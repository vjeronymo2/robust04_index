			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bo Jeppesen: "Center Democrats: Government </F> Should Work for the Western European Union"]    [Text] The next government will have to work for Danish  membership in the WEU, the Western European Union, during  1995-96. That is a demand from the Center Democrats [CD] to the  next government.    The CD has already made inroads into the discussion on the  basis for cooperation in a future [coalition] government. A  demand from the CD remains that a new government be in favor of  Danish membership in the WEU.    The WEU is a West European cooperative defense organization  that, following the last NATO summit meeting in December last  year, became the European component of NATO cooperation.    "We are stating clearly that a receptivity must be part of  the basis for a new government," said Peter Duetoft, the CD's  policy spokesman.    "In the government terms of office to come, each government  must take a position on Danish membership in the WEU. If they  say no, then Denmark will become a second-class member of both  the EU [European Union] and NATO, and in any event we do not  want that. Our foreign policy footnotes (provisos, editor's  note) in the 1980's quite simply won't amount to anything  compared with the footnotes we'll have to adopt if we're out of  the WEU," Duetoft said.    He had no wish to state in which government the CD's wishes  could be fulfilled or whether it would be easier to convince a  nonsocialist government on the issue of WEU membership.    Duetoft does not support the Liberal Party's proposal -- in  connection with elections to the European Parliament -- to hold  a national membership on WEU membership this summer.    "That's much too early, because WEU membership requires  popular enthusiasm. The Liberal Party's proposal will only lead  to another no vote. I would rather wait until 1995-96 but  precisely because it would be insane to put together a  government that is closed to the idea of membership," Duetoft  said.</p>

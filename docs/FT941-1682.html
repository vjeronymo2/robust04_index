			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / People: Bodies politic Training mediators as well as coping with such hands-on jobs as sorting out a dispute between a minister and his church elders are among the challenges facing David Richbell in his new job as director of training at the Centre for Dispute Resolution. It is a job that 50-year-old Richbell, a lay preacher and fully accredited CEDR mediator, says he will find deeply satisfying. 'Mediation fulfils my belief in reconciliation and peacemaking,' he says. 'I am extremely unhappy with the adversarial legal system as this polarises people into more entrenched roles.' CEDR is much smaller than Acas, the advisory, arbitration, and conciliation service which is financially backed by the government. Rather, CEDR is an independent, non-profit making organisation, backed by a number of bodies including the Confederation of British Industry. Richbell says CEDR can handle any kind of mediation between parties in dispute, except criminal cases.</p>

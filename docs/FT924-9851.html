			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Arab bank nearly doubles profits ARAB Banking Corporation (ABC), the biggest Arab bank, has nearly doubled net profit for the first nine months of 1992, Reuter reports from Manama. The bank, traded on the Bahraini and Paris bourses, said profit after estimated taxes rose to Dollars 60m in the period from Dollars 31m the year before. Mr Abdullah Saudi, chief executive, attributed the rise in the net to a lower cost of funds, lower taxes, expanded business in trade financing and the recovery of some Dollars 20m in interest that had not been paid on loans to Argentina. He said unaudited operating profits rose 36 per cent to Dollars 183m from Dollars 135m. It boosted the provisions it was making for bad loans to Dollars 98m from Dollars 53m. After Dollars 6m for minority interests in subsidiaries such as Banco Atlantico in Spain, pre-tax profits showed an increase of 22 per cent to Dollars 79m. Despite the higher pre-tax profit, estimated taxes fell to Dollars 19m from Dollars 34m because the branches with little or no tax did relatively better than heavily taxed units in Europe. Lower interest rates also meant it was less costly to fund non-performing loans. The bank remained cautious about new lending, total loans and advances rising modestly to Dollars 11.2bn at the end of September from Dollars 10.6bn a year earlier. Total assets rose to Dollars 20.8bn from Dollars 19.6bn. Total deposits rose to Dollars 16.6bn from Dollars 16.1bn.</p>

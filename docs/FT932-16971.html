			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian vegetable oil exports set to start INDIA - until a few years ago a big importer of vegetable oils - may decide to allow exports following a bumper oilseeds crop. The country already exports minor oils. Sales of them are expected to be about 8,000 tonnes, worth Rs300m (USDollars 9.6m), in the fiscal year ending March 31. An oil surplus of over 500,000 tonnes is expected after meeting the domestic requirement of nearly 7m tonnes, making the export of major oils like soyabean, sunflower and groundnut seem likely. The record combined summer and winter oilseeds production of 21.6m tonnes, compared with 19.5m tonnes last year, will enable the country to earn Rs13.62bn from the export of oilmeals, oilseeds and minor oils. India has achieved self-reliance in oils at a low level of per capita consumption of 6.8 kg, compared with the world average of about 15 kg. India has the option to import 300,000 tonnes of palm oil from Malaysia but the government has announced that India will not be importing oils in the current 'oil year' which began in November 1992. At the same time prices of all types of oils have fallen sharply because of the comfortable supply situation. The breakthrough in oilseeds production in India has come about following the constitution of the Technology Mission on Oilseeds (TMO) in 1986 with the mandate to provide modern technology, inputs and services to the 7m farmers who mostly have small holdings. TMO also has to contend with the fact that nearly 80 per cent of the 24m hectares of land under oilseeds depends on rain. In this situation, the small farmers could avail themselves of the 'critical farm services and inputs' either by becoming members of co-operatives or by doing contract farming for corporations. While the co-operative movement has taken deep roots in the oilseeds economy, ITC, an associate of British American Tobacco, has created a model for other corporations by producing hybrid oilseeds, conducting farm extension services, guaranteeing the off-take of seeds from farmers at remunerative prices and operating an oil refinery. To ITC goes the credit for popularising sunflower cultivation in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The government, meanwhile, has helped sustain farmers' interest in oilseeds cultivation through its market intervention operation.</p>

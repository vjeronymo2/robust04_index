			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Telco ahead sharply at midway Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company (Telco), India's leading commercial vehicle maker, saw operating profit in the six months to end-September almost double to Rs2.24bn (Dollars 71.3m) from Rs1.12bn a year earlier. Net profit for the period advanced to Rs562.8m from Rs301m. Telco said market conditions during the first half had improved significantly since last year. It added that it had achieved record levels of production and sales. The sustained recovery in demand for the automotive sector pushed up vehicle sales to 53,391 units from 37,507 vehicles last year. Vehicle production increased to 57,313 vehicles from 25,197. Cheaper borrowing should also have a positive impact on the company's performance for the rest of the year. Meanwhile, Tata Iron and Steel, the flagship company of the Bombay-based Tata group, said operating profit for the same period rose by 40 per cent to Rs3.06bn. This was achieved as a result of a richer product mix and improved control over costs. Net profits rose to Rs868.1m from Rs46.3m. Analysts said that although the increase was sharp it was below expectations. Domestic demand for steel was buoyant, reflecting an increase in domestic sales of 33 per cent, to 758,000 tonnes. Exports almost halved to 155,000 tonnes from 308,000 tonnes, forcing Tisco to concentrate on the home market, and raising its domestic share to 14 per cent from 11 per cent last year. Overall production increased by 9 per cent to 1.08m tonnes from 994,600 tonnes last year. The company said results would improve later this year with the near completion of its modernisation programme.</p>

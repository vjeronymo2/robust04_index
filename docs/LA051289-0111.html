			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BLEAK SPENDING PLAN PRESENTED TO COUNCIL;  </P> <P> LOCKWOOD'S BUDGET PROPOSAL REDUCES FUNDING FOR RECREATION, FAILS TO ENLARGE  POLICE FORCE  </P> <P> San Diego City Manager John Lockwood, calling the city's financial straits the  gravest since the 1978 passage of Proposition 13, Thursday proposed a  $931-million budget for fiscal 1990 that includes sizable cutbacks in  recreation programs and a slight retreat from the city's goal of expanding its  police force.  </P> <P> With property-tax and sales-tax revenues expected to increase more slowly than  in the past, and city population continuing to soar, the city's operating  budget "is not keeping up with the cost of doing business," said Patricia  Frazier, the city's director of financial management.  </P> <P> "Last year was the worst year we had since Proposition 13," Lockwood said.  "This year is far worse.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Difficult Choices'  </P> <P> "It's a very, very difficult year and the budget we're proposing for the  council gives them some very, very difficult choices."  </P> <P> The silver lining in the budgetary cloud can be found in the huge growth of  bricks-and-mortar projects such as streets, parks, libraries and sewer  projects. The money for those projects is budgeted to increase by $77 million  to $260 million, most of it from sewer users' fees, developers' fees, special  taxes and borrowing.  </P> <P> The capital spending includes $8.6 million for the first year of a projected  $45-million spruce-up of Balboa Park and $13.7 million in road construction  from the Proposition A half-cent sales tax increase. Sewer and building  inspection, funded by user fees, will increase substantially.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 4.9% Budget Increase  </P> <P> But the $404.7-million fiscal 1990 operating budget, which would increase just  4.9% according to Lockwood's blueprint, includes a $577,000 cut in after-school  recreation programs that would eliminate half of the 74 sites; a $205,000  savings achieved by closing eight city-run pools for nine weeks in the spring  and fall and the curtailment of library hours in Otay Mesa, North Park and Mira  Mesa. A city bookmobile would be taken off the streets.  </P> <P> The council nixed a similar after-school recreation cut when Lockwood proposed  it last year. "Every year, when we get the budget, they've cut Parks and Rec,"  said an aide to Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer. "And, every year, the council  goes up and fights to put it back."  </P> <P> Perhaps more importantly to the council and the public, the number of police  officers would slip from 1.62 per thousand city residents to 1.59 per thousand  city residents, despite the council's continued determination to bring the  department's staff to a ratio of 2 officers per thousand population.  </P> <P> It is the third-straight year that the council will not achieve that goal,  which would cost an estimated $106.4 million over three years. A blue-ribbon  panel examining ways to raise the money to finance that effort expects to  complete its study by the end of this year, according to Lockwood's budget  document.  </P> <P> Lockwood would, however, put 22 more police officers on the street by  eliminating the positions of 21 civilians at storefront police stations around  the city.  </P> <P> "I find the budget totally unacceptable," said Councilman Bob Filner, who said  he will press for across-the-board spending cuts or a tax increase to raise the  $18.5 million required to start the push toward 2 officers per thousand  residents. "For the third year in a row, we have made no progress toward the  2.0 (officers) per thousand (goal), and, in fact, this year we're going  backward."  </P> <P> Councilman Bruce Henderson had a virtually identical reaction, though for  different reasons.  </P> <P> "I don't find the budget satisfactory at all," said Henderson, often credited  with having the keenest financial mind on the nine-member council. "To cut back  in Park and Recreation is totally unacceptable to me. Moreover, I'm very  unhappy that we don't have any money for jails or for vocational education."  </P> <P> Other council members declined to comment on the budget document because they  had not examined it thoroughly or they could not be reached. Mayor Maureen  O'Connor is vacationing in Europe.  </P> <P> With the budgetary vise tightening around the council, Mark Nelson, executive  director of the San Diego Taxpayers Assn., said he believes that this year's  deliberations may produce debate on fundamental questions of what the city's  budgetary responsibilities are. The council begins its discussions May 25. The  1990 fiscal year starts July 1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Issue Facing Council  </P> <P> "The council is going to be increasingly put in a position (of deciding) what  are traditional municipal services," Nelson said. "Are we going to continue to  pay for parks and recreation . . . or are we going to make them  (self-sustaining) services?"  </P> <P> A prime example, cited by both Nelson and Lockwood, is trash collection. Now  free to single-family homeowners, trash pickups cost the city more than $20  million coveted by Lockwood to pay for other services. San Diego is the only  city in the county that now offers free trash collection. A vote of the public  would be required to change the 1919 ordinance establishing free trash pickup.  </P> <P> Lockwood's budgetary dilemma can be summed up this way: Though his operating  budget will increase by $18.9 million, contracts with labor unions and the  salaries of 135 top city managers will take up $12.1 million of that. That  leaves just $6.8 million to cope with inflation and the expansion of services  required by the estimated 27,000 more people who will be added to the city's  population during the next fiscal year. For the first time since 1984, real per  capita spending will decline.  </P> <P> Requirements include staffing and maintaining the 15 recreation facilities  built or enlarged by developers, staffing a new fire station and adding police  officers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Tax Sources  </P> <P> At the same time, the two major sources of city revenue -- property taxes and  sales taxes -- are increasing more slowly than in the past. The increasing  number of home resales does not bring the city as much tax revenue as the  construction of new homes has in the past, and the growth of suburban shopping  complexes outside the city limits such as North County Fair in Escondido and  Car Country Carlsbad hinders the growth of sales tax revenue.  </P> <P> The result is less money to go around. Lockwood proposes placing just $1  million -- 0.25% of the budget -- in the city's rainy-day fund. Another $27.1  million in top-priority needs are left unfunded in the proposed budget.  </P> <P> In another sign of the times, he is budgeting $8 million to pay off lawsuit  losses. The city has already spent about $10 million on such losses this year.  </P> <P> Another proposed cut would eliminate cleanup at Mission Bay Park and all other  shoreline parks between 3 p.m and 7 p.m.  </P> <P> Departments not facing outright budget reductions will have to do more with  less.  </P> <P> "We're just going to have to get more and more out of our people as we go  along," Lockwood said.  </P></p>

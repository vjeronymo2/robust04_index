			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Arts: Hackney learns from Tudor heritage - Architecture It seems far from rolling rural England. But there is an ancient Kentish ragstone church tower and a large and shady churchyard sprouting crocuses. You can arrive by train and be almost the only person on the platform. It is hard to believe that you are in the heart of that part of East London that is vibrant and decaying, the London Borough of Hackney. Last week an event occured that further confounded the accepted view of this suffering inner city borough - the staid old National Trust opened an historic house there. Sutton House started its life in 1535 as a country house on the eastern edge of the City of London for Ralph Sadleir, courtier, judge and politician. He was a great survivor who worked for Thomas Cromwell and ended up as one of Mary, Queen of Scots' judges. Sutton House is also a great survivor. It has been a school, men's club and office, and it endured the worst of the London Blitz. In 1936 it was the subject of a concerned letter to The Times from George Lansbury, Labour member of parliament for Poplar, and Lord Esher and Lord Crawford and Balcarres. They organised a public appeal to save Sutton House and it took the National Trust's intervention, with a legacy given in memory of two men killed in the first world war, to finally secure the Tudor building for the nation. Somehow the National Trust never quite knew what to do with Sutton House. It wasn't in their normal country bailiwick and it was tenanted and administered from the remote headquarters in Hughenden manor in Buckinghamshire. When I first saw the house in the late 1980s it was empty, boarded up and vandalised. There was then a scheme to split it up into flats and sell them. It was the residents of Hackney, led by one or two particularly fervent locals, who changed the Trust's mind and set in train a determined effort to save the house and return it to the community. Today Hackney has one of the most intriguing and best preserved Tudor houses, with later additions, to be seen in London. What is especially inspiring is the way the Trust and the community have decided to use it. When I was there last week the big hall, which dates back to the 1900s and was designed by the Arts and Crafts architect Lionel Crane, was full of children joining in a production of Falstaff with singers from the English National Opera. Many Musical events and educational activities are planned to ensure that the house is seen as a teaching resource. It is a brilliant place to learn about architecture. First of all, approach it from the fine Georgian church and the elegant street of Georgian houses, Sutton Place. Then observe the house, which is almost overwhelmed by the giant concrete sixties Community School across the road. The house is an 'H' shaped plan and was built of brick in the first half of the sixteenth century. One wing was rendered and has new fenestration from the 18th or early 19th century. Inside the house is one of the best linenfold panelled rooms in London. The Great Chamber on the first floor retains the atmosphere of a Tudor room that showed off the wealth of the owner. There are good Georgian and Victorian interiors and an exhibition room where the full and complex history of the house is shown. I was extremely impressed by the way the architect Richard Griffiths had not just carried out a meticulous restoration but had added some additions in a completely contemporary way. The new restaurant occupies a modern conservatory addition built of bronze, ash wood and glass. It demonstrates that it is perfectly possible to mix the old and the new if they are of matching quality in design and materials. Sutton House has an appropriate liveliness about it - but this is not at the expense of the historic qualities of the architecture. School children study courses that bring history alive and there is an architectural course, 'Bricks and Building', that would be suitable for adult beginners. The whole Sutton House Community Scheme has cost Pounds 2m and half of this sum has come from the National Trust. Many businesses, livery companies, and private donors have helped to fund the restoration. It is a brilliant cause  -the model rejuvenation of Sutton House has brought history and architecture alive in Hackney in a way that has clearly inspired affection and tapped a local enthusiasm in a stirring and remarkable way. Sutton House can be hired for events and functions and the historic rooms are open on Wednesdays, Sundays and Bank Holiday Mondays from 11.30am to 5.30pm.

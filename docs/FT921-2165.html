			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: UniChem hits Pounds 21m and loses interest in Macarthy UNICHEM, the pharmaceut-icals wholesaler, yesterday announced a 31 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits and its withdrawal from the battle for Macarthy. The company's decision not to renew its bid for the retailer, in spite of clearance from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, comes a week before the first closing date for the new Pounds 96m agreed offer from Lloyds Chemists. UniChem's profits rose from Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 21.4m last year, about Pounds 400,000 ahead of the forecast made with December's Pounds 35.1m rights issue. The figures included a Pounds 2.5m reduction in net interest costs to Pounds 288,000. Turnover was Pounds 920.1m (Pounds 873.3m). Mr Jeff Harris, who in May will take over from Mr Peter Dodd as chief executive, said pharmaceuticals sales grew 9 per cent, in line with the market, while the over-the-counter business was much flatter. The account with Kingswood chemists was lost in May, when Lloyds took it over. Savory &amp; Moore, part of Macarthy, was gained as a customer in November, but would be lost if the Lloyds bid succeeded. Operating margins in wholesaling, still the vast majority of the business with retail contributing only Pounds 12m to sales, improved from 2.2 per cent to just over 2.3 per cent. Group operating profit rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 21.7m (Pounds 19.3m). The retail division, started a year ago, had grown to 145 shops - of which 92 were added in December via the Pounds 27m acquisition of E Moss. The group operates a franchise scheme. Mr Dodd said some of the Pounds 17.5m cash that UniChem had at the year-end would be used to buy more chemists. On the wholesaling side, there was still scope to expand in the UK - where it had between 25 and 30 per cent of the market, depending on definitions. On the Continent, both UniChem and its PAG associate were looking at acquisitions. Fully diluted earnings per share rose 10 per cent to 13.6p (12.4p). A final dividend of 3.3p makes a 5p total. For 1990, the year the company floated on the stock market, a single dividend of 1.5p was paid. Costs of the Macarthy bid and the MMC inquiry amounted to Pounds 1.03m, taken as an extraordinary item. COMMENT It is less than two years since the pharamcist members of what was then a co-operative voted overwhelmingly for public company status. Their faith has been handsomely repaid with the share price more than doubling since the November 1990 launch. Meanwhile, pre-tax profit has grown by nearly 50 per cent since 1989. Last year was a perfect illustration of UniChem's defensive qualities, including its powers of cash generation. Net assets advanced by Pounds 20m to Pounds 111m after acquisitions and a Pounds 33m goodwill write off. UniChem does its image no harm by resisting the temptation to put pharmacy licences on the balance sheet, as Lloyds does. Market growth, the withdrawal of Medicopharma as a competitor and retail expansion should help pre-tax profit to approach Pounds 30m this year, but earnings growth will be weighed down by extra equity. A prospective multiple of 14.5 to 15 on yesterday's 212p looks high enough. See Observer</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NARA agrees that the agency should determine the distribution of the final report within the agency. The language of the regulation has been changed to read ``Distribute the final report to all concerned and appropriate persons and offices.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Reporting Deadlines and Draft Report <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies commented that, while the regulations specify reporting deadlines for agencies to respond to an evaluation, there is no time limit for NARA to finalize the report. One agency suggested that this section indicate that the 120-day period NARA has to provide a draft report to the agency begins following the last site visit or final exit briefing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NARA agrees and changed the regulation to add that NARA will produce the draft report within 120 days following the last site visit or final exit briefing and that the final report will be sent to the head of the agency within 30 days after receiving agency comments on the draft report. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One agency suggested that agencies should be allowed to comment on the recommendations when commenting on the factual contents of the report. This is standard practice when reviewing an audit or evaluation report. If an agency chooses to comment on the recommendations at this stage, the comments will allow NARA to identify potential problems that may develop during the followup actions. Furthermore, such comments may clarify an agency's internal operations for NARA and allow the development of a more appropriate recommendation. The regulation has been changed accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two agencies suggested that the provision in the current &sect;1220.52(b)(1) giving agencies the right to provide rationale in the action plan for not implementing a recommendation be included in the revised regulations. NARA agrees that an agency should have the right to provide rationale for not implementing a recommendation if it is unable to do so. Section 1220.58(a)(1)(ii) has been amended accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1220.58&blank;Agency Action Plans and Progress Reports <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One agency requested a 120 day period after receiving the final report submitting an action plan to NARA, stating that this extension is important for agencies that are deficient in many areas. NARA thinks that 90 days is an adequate period for most agency to prepare an action plan. However, the regulation has been changed to allow for agencies to request an extension. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One agency commented extensively on NARA's proposed requirement that agencies provide individual action plans for evaluated field sites. They noted that such reports are an unauthorized interagency reporting requirement; there is no indication that NARA would analyze field action plans and provide feedback to the agency about them; and without periodic status reports, there is no value to the action plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The value of including individual site summaries in the final report has been proven in previous evaluations. NARA intends to continue this practice. In order to track followup actions at these individual sites, it may be necessary to request individual action plans. If this is the case, NARA will analyze them and provide feedback. The language of the regulation has been changed to reflect this intention. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One agency suggested that estimating the month and year for starting and completing each action is unrealistic: proposed quarters and years would be better. NARA agrees and has changed the regulation accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to a suggestion from one agency, NARA added criteria for closing recommendations to this section of the regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One agency suggested that the action plan be submitted by the agency head or Designated Senior Official for Information Resources Management rather than ``senior management official responsible for records and information management.'' We have made this change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One agency noted that the requirement to provide the name of officials or offices specifically responsible for initiating and completing each proposed action is extensive. NARA agrees that it is appropriate for the agency to determine who will track individual recommendations. The regulation has been changed to require the agency head to designate an individual who will serve as NARA's contact for evaluation followup. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1220.60&blank;Followup Notification and Reviews <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One agency suggested that reporting to Congress and/or appropriate Federal oversight agencies of evaluation findings and agency response be mandatory. Other agencies commented that reporting to Congress would be a valuable tool to use to highlight the importance of records management in agencies. The majority opinion is that NARA should send every evaluation report to Congress or the appropriate Federal oversight agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One agency said that NARA should be required to provide agencies with the factors by which NARA determines that an agency is not progressing in a satisfactory manner and that the agency head should be notified before NARA reports to Congress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If NARA determines that there has been insufficient progress in fully implementing recommendations or that the agency has not corrected problems identified by NARA, then NARA will notify the head of the agency. After the head of the agency has been notified, NARA may also notify the appropriate oversight agencies or appropriate Congressional committees. Section 1220.60 has been changed accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

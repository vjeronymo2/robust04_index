			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Books: Model of a columnist - The American journalist Joseph Alsop I'VE SEEN THE BEST OF IT by Joseph Alsop with Adam Platt W W Norton Pounds 19.55, 495 pges JOSEPH ALSOP was a very clever, but very fat and rather unattractive child. He grew up in what he describes as the Wasp (white anglo-saxon protestant) ascendancy in New England. Although his background was not rich by the standards of the time and place, it was certainly comfortable. When it was decided that he was unsuited either for business or the law, his grandmother recalled that he had sent her some well-written letters from Harvard, so why not journalism? Nobody in the family had ever gone in for that before, nor knew anyone else connected with it except for the Ogden Reids, who happened to own the New York Herald Tribune and were friends of Alsop's grandmother. A word in the right ear and Alsop was on his way to becoming one of the best-known political columnists the world over. Alsop died in 1989 with his memoirs not quite completed. They have been put together by Adam Platt, another American journalist, but there should be no doubt that this is the Alsop story. Essentially I've Seen The Best Of It should be a book for journalists, and it is certainly that: it is also one of the best personal memoirs I have read for several years. The Washington to which Alsop was sent as a junior reporter in the 1930s was totally different from that of today. 'No-one hurried and few ever worked later than 5 pm . . . there was no really great restaurant, nor was it missed . . . We never locked our doors and never so much thought of the horrible word 'security': crime was non-existent . . . Anyone invited to dine with the president and Mrs Roosevelt simply drew up to the front door of the White House and rang the bell.' Alsop describes it as a paradise for political reporters. Being well-connected both by birth and education, he had no problems of access. Even as a young man, he could wander in and see the secretary of state every day. It was from there that the idea of a political column began. Alsop lays down some of the early ground rules he established for himself. On reporting, for example: don't ask foolish questions, don't waste time by being diverted from the subject in hand, and 'no matter how big a bastard you have to talk business with, never be rude unless the bastard is rude first'. Alsop says that one one of the few bastards with whom he ever broke his own rule was Senator Joe McCarthy. There were also rules for columnists: for example, any column that gets too far from the headlines is bound to be disregarded; 'never write about serious overseas problems without being overseas long enough to smell the weather on the streets'; and 'don't make extreme assertions on your authority.' The trick of writing a column, Alsop thought, was rather like a debased version of the trick of writing sonnets: it had to be well organised. And, of course, you had to work at the facts. That was how the Alsop column became a model. Sometimes he did it with a fellow journalist, often his brother Stewart. Earlier he had twinned with an economics specialist so that the best of political and economic knowledge could go into the same column, a practice that might be resumed today. Column-writing, however, has its hazards. One of them stems from becoming too involved in the political processes you are seeking to describe: pomposity or partisanship can creep in. There seems little doubt that this is what happened to Alsop over time. In the late 1960s and early 1970s he was a great supporter of American involvement in Vietnam and fell out with many of his old friends in the process. This is how his diary could read on a trip to Saigon: 'Monday, 18 March, Air France 191, arr. Saigon, 5.05 pm, dinner with Amb Ellsworth Bunker, Stay with Amb Bunker, Tuesday, 19 March, morning at American Embassy, 2.30 pm, Gen Philip Davidson (chief of intelligence, Westmoreland's staff), 7.30 pm, dinner with Gen Westmoreland.' And so it went on, through President Thieu and Vice President Ky the next day before back to dinner with Ambassador Bunker. There was not much there of smelling the weather in the streets. Some people would say that the older Alsop had broken the young Alsop's rules. Nevertheless, Alsop young and old could write and every door was open to him. This book is full of stories - like the time when he threw Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean out of his Washington house before it was known they were spies, or when he asked Churchill about younger Tories. 'There's Hogg,' said Churchill, 'he's an ass. Don't know any others.'</p>

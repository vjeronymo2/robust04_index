			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Architecture: Rough guide to English churches - Colin Amery on one of the best ways to learn about history and architecture This is the season for church calling - a greatly underestimated summer activity that somehow has the undeserved reputation of being confined to young fogies, wearing tweed jackets and riding old fashioned bicycles. Looking at churches, as I have been in Norfolk and Suffolk in the past week, is a remarkably painless way of studying history and architecture. It helps in understanding their relationship to the countryside. But how easy is it to enlarge one's knowledge and understanding when faced with the average description of a parish church in the typed leaflets provided, or in the vicar's guidebook? Take a typical example: 'The church and tower are Perp but traces of Norman work remain. The south aisle is Dec, while the porch is a fine Perp example with good flushwork decoration in checkerboard pattern, with two orders of fleurons at the entrance. The chancel was renewed in 1848 but the stepped triple lancet window remains Perp. The piscina and sedilia clearly belong to the mid-13th century, as do the poppy heads on the choir stalls. Much of the furnishing is very much renewed and considerable damage was caused to the church by the iconoclasts. Note the fine brasses and hatchments.' Is a translation needed, or at least some key that can open the door into the arcane Perp and Dec and early English? The most natural place to turn for enlightenment would be The Buildings of England by Nikolaus Pevsner, the invaluable Penguin Guides to all the counties of England. This great German refugee professor did what only a German could do. He methodically tackled the task of listing and visiting every building in England and describing them in an inimitable way that was both accurate and opinionated. Only Pevsner could write the sentence that says: 'The Perp font as usual, octagonal', assuming realms of knowledge that most readers are unlikely to have. It was Sir John Betjeman who memorably described Pevsner as 'Herr Professor Doktor' - implying quite rightly that architectural scholarship has its place but is not much use if it cannot enlighten and communicate. The only thing that really matters when you visit an old church, or examine an historic building, is to understand how to look. Once you learn to spot the clues - and it is easy enough - then visual discrimination and the detective work of architectural history can begin. When it comes to churches here is a rough guide. The Norman style of architecture was developed in England from 1050 to 1200. You can recognise it by its use of the round arch and the fact that most Norman buildings are very big and solid. This solidity meant that there was no need for large projecting buttresses. Towers are usually square and the place for richly carved ornaments is around doorways. You can tell the difference between early and later Norman work by the thickness of the mortar joints. In the 11th century they were wide and coarse, while in the 12th century they became fine and exact. Much of Durham Cathedral is Norman. Out of the Norman style emerged the national Gothic style, which is known as Early English or EE. It was struggling to life in 1150 but really flourished for the whole of the 13th century. The arches are pointed and the buildings less fortress like. They also become lighter. Spires appeared and roofs became steeply pitched. Vaults were no longer barrel shaped but became pointed and groined. Decoration became less geometric and more naturalistic  -carved foliage can be seen. Salisbury Cathedral is the best example of this style. It was inevitable that the cool refinement of the early English style would develop into something more elaborate and that is why the Decorated (Dec) evolved during the period 1290 to 1350. This style achieved something that modern architects have never been able to do: ornament became an integral part of the constructional elements of a building. Windows became much wider and gained strength from stone tracery based upon simple geometric designs. Wooden roofs became more elaborate, while piers and columns became slender. Lincoln Cathedral is a good example of the Decorated style. Perp stands for the perpendicular style and its dates are 1350 to 1530. It looks as it sounds. All the emphasis is upon the vertical. This style represents the ultimate in Gothic architecture. The best way to learn what Perp is is to look at Kings College Chapel in Cambridge. The elaborate 'fan tracery' of the roof is the culmination of Gothic vaulting. Arches are flatter and the flying buttress developed at this time to support walls that were sometimes composed entirely of glass. Walls that are not windows are covered with panels that emphasise the vertical nature of these tall Gothic buildings. Part of the fun of church calling is not just mastering the basic stylistic differences but noticing the local variations of style and materials. In East Anglia, for example, there is a characteristic use of flint. Sometimes the flint is knapped (made smooth) and sometimes it is contrasted with stone in Heraldic patterns - this is known as flushwork. It is a regional art form of a very high order. Churches are potent with the palimpsests of architectural as well as national history. The secret to unlocking their pleasure is learning the basic language and recognising different styles as you see them. Then churches become strange and wonderful changing things. They are an endless source of character and beauty.</p>

L. 103&hyph;182). These amendments affect the program of trade adjustment assistance for workers and the administration of the program by the States pursuant to State agreements with the Secretary of Labor. The amendments must be implemented as of the respective dates set out in Title V and contained in the GAL published with this notice <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Title V amendments supersede the statute in effect prior to these amendments and affect the regulations at 20 CFR part 617 and 29 CFR part 90 currently in effect, to the extent that such prior law and regulations are inconsistent with the amendments. Pending the issuance of final regulations implementing the provisions of the Title V amendments, the GAL published with this notice expresses the Department of Labor's position on procedures for implementation of the amendments and their respective meanings, and constitutes operating instructions to the States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Title V amendments also require States to make available certain assistance and services authorized under Title III of the Job Training Partnership Act to workers whom the Governor preliminarily finds to be adversely affected by NAFTA. The GAL informs the States of this requirement, and of the potential for secondary workers in firms supplying component parts to primary producers affected by NAFTA to receive assistance under the Title III program. Additional information concerning the use of Title III funds to assist these workers and other individuals adversely affected by NAFTA will be forthcoming. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> For TAA Program information, contact: Marvin M.

Some of the provisions of Title V are not in the form of amendments to the Trade Act, however, they nonetheless must be given effect in implementing the NAFTA&hyph;TAA program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

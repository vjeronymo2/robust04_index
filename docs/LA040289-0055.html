			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> ARE JOURNALISTS PERFIDIOUS CON ARTISTS? NATIONAL NAME-CALLING AMONG PARASITES  </P> <P> "Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what  is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible. He is a kind of  confidence man, preying on people's vanity, ignorance, or loneliness, gaining  their trust and betraying them without remorse."  </P> <P> So wrote Janet Malcolm in the first paragraph of a two-part, 40,000-word  exegesis in the New Yorker last month on journalist/author Joe McGinniss, his  book, "Fatal Vision" and his subsequent legal battle with the subject of that  book, Jeffrey MacDonald, the ex-Marine who was convicted of murdering his  pregnant wife and their two small children in 1970.  </P> <P> McGinniss and MacDonald signed an agreement giving McGinniss exclusive rights  to and absolute artistic control over a book on MacDonald, provided that the  "essential integrity" of MacDonald's life story was maintained; they also  signed an agreement giving MacDonald a percentage of the income from the book.  </P> <P> McGinniss spent four years on "Fatal Vision." He became a part of MacDonald's  defense team and for a time shared living quarters with MacDonald (and others).  In the course of their collaboration, the two became friends. MacDonald insists  he is innocent, and he assumed McGinniss' book would exonerate him. When,  instead, the book depicted him as a psychopathic killer, MacDonald sued  McGinniss for fraud and breach of contract -- a case that ended in a mistrial,  followed by a private cash settlement paid to MacDonald.  </P> <P> Malcolm is on MacDonald's side. She says McGinniss -- and all journalists --  are guilty of "perfidy . . . seduction and betrayal . . . .  </P> <P> "The journalist must do his work in a kind of deliberately induced state of  moral anarchy," she writes.  </P> <P> Journalists have leaped to defend their individual and collective integrity  against Malcolm's onslaught, but there is a glimmer of truth -- albeit only a  glimmer -- in what Malcolm is saying.  </P> <P> For a journalist, The Story (or The Book) always comes first. Journalists don't  generally approach subjects altruistically, and subjects don't usually talk to  journalists altruistically. Those who submit to the process have their own  agendas, and they almost invariably assume that they will persuade the  journalist to see things their way. (Why else would any corporate mogul in his  right mind agree to face Mike Wallace in front of a television camera?) But if  the story or the book or the "60 Minutes" episode turns out unfavorably, the  subject feels betrayed.  </P> <P> Journalists often don't disclose their precise intention on a given story.  Sometimes, journalists don't even know what they're after at first. But if they  do know -- and if they expect to find something their subjects won't like --  they usually won't announce that. Instead, the journalist will probably try to  make a person feel comfortable and secure, to gain the subject's confidence;  sources not experienced in dealing with the media may be misled by this. So, in  that sense, yes, a journalist is something of a con artist, "preying" on the  subject individual, as Malcolm charges.  </P> <P> But I've been a journalist for 25 years, specializing in writing about other  journalists for the last 14, and most journalists I know do not deliberately  lie to their subjects or behave in a "morally indefensible" fashion, as Malcolm  charges -- and, alas, as two prominent writers testified for McGinniss in the  trial of MacDonald's suit against him.  </P> <P> William F. Buckley Jr. -- he of the sesquipedalian vocabulary -- suddenly found  himself unable, under oath, to define one small word ("lie"). But Buckley did  say that "for the purpose of lubricating the discussion in order to learn more  information," he would tell his subject something he didn't really believe.  Even worse, Joseph Wambaugh tried to make a bizarre distinction between an  indefensible "lie" and a defensible "untruth." A writer's obligation, Wambaugh  argued, is to his book -- which he characterized as "a baby . . . a living  thing" -- and he said that in pursuit of the truth, a writer should tell his  subject an "untruth," if necessary, in order to "nurture" that baby.  </P> <P> What Wambaugh calls an "untruth" is what some of us were taught to think of as  a "white lie" -- telling your wife she looks nice in her new dress when she  really doesn't (to use Wambaugh's example). But that's a long way from  misleading a murder suspect into thinking that you believe he's innocent.  </P> <P> Wambaugh now claims he was referring only to a writer's dealings with  psychopathic killers and that he would, of course, tell "only the straight,  honest truth with normal people." But the trial transcript shows he made no  such distinction when he was under oath, testifying on "customs and practices  in the literary community." Indeed, I find the Wambaugh/Buckley/McGinniss  reasoning sadly reminiscent of what another New Yorker writer, Alastair Reid,  said five years ago when he tried to explain certain fabrications in his  stories: "There is a truth that is harder to get at . . . than the truth  yielded by fact."  </P> <P> Buckley, Wambaugh and Reid are the journalistic equivalent of the American  major in Vietnam who said, "It became necessary to destroy the town in order to  save it."  </P> <P> Malcolm, too, belongs in this group. "Morally indefensible" journalism seems to  be her forte. In the course of her essay, she neglected to mention her own  legal battles with a psychologist who sued her (unsuccessfully), charging that  she fabricated quotations and counterfeited dialogue -- behavior that would  seem to disqualify her as journalism's ethical arbiter.  </P> <P> Perhaps the two crucial points in both Malcolm's article and MacDonald's  lawsuit against McGinniss were: 1) When did McGinniss decide MacDonald was  guilty? and 2) Did McGinniss deceive MacDonald into thinking the book would  exonerate him?  </P> <P> Malcolm is intellectually perfidious on both points.  </P> <P> She quotes Jeffrey M. Elliot, who is also writing a book on MacDonald, as  saying that McGinniss wrote letters "assuring MacDonald -- right up to  publication -- that the book would exonerate him." But neither she nor  MacDonald has offered any evidence that McGinniss offered such "assurances."  </P> <P> Malcolm quotes McGinniss as having decided during MacDonald's 1979 murder trial  that he was guilty; then, she writes, "for almost four years -- during which he  corresponded with MacDonald, spoke with him on the telephone . . . and, on two  occasions visited him, he successfully hid the fact that in the book under  preparation he was portraying MacDonald as a psychopathic killer."  </P> <P> But McGinniss said he liked MacDonald "enormously" and had great difficulty  reconciling his fondness for him with his growing realization that he had  committed a monstrous crime. "For a long time," he said, "I was unable to  persuade myself intellectually that he didn't do it but unable to persuade  myself emotionally that he did."  </P> <P> More than 18 months before he finished writing "Fatal Vision," McGinniss gave  MacDonald's attorney at least a strong hint that he might not be writing a book  sympathetic to MacDonald: "Look," he said, "I have a moral obligation to the  truth. I don't have a moral obligation to MacDonald." But Malcolm doesn't  mention this exchange. Nor does she bother to quote an explanation McGinniss  gave on the same page of a legal document that she does quote in another  context.  </P> <P> "The truth is that I knew it (MacDonald's guilt) with certainty, in my heart as  well as my head, only when I finished writing the book," McGinniss said.  </P> <P> I know what McGinniss means. As Flannery O'Connor has said, "I write because I  don't know what I think until I read what I write."  </P> <P> To McGinniss, writing is "an act of discovery," so while he concedes that ". .  . on the basis of the evidence presented, had I been a juror, I quite likely  would have voted to convict," he says that realization was "only the beginning,  not the end of my quest . . . . I had to go deeper, I had to know more, I had  to try to understand."  </P> <P> I don't mean to suggest that I think McGinniss behaved honorably in his  dealings with MacDonald. He didn't (although he would argue that since  MacDonald lied in proclaiming his innocence, McGinniss had no obligation to be  honorable).  </P> <P> McGinniss may not have known in his heart that MacDonald was guilty until he  finished writing his book, but he clearly had damn strong feelings about  MacDonald's guilt long before he typed the final words. And yet, while he  didn't "assure" MacDonald that the book would exonerate him, he certainly did  virtually everything short of an outright lie to give MacDonald that  impression.  </P> <P> In his letters to MacDonald, McGinniss expressed sympathy and friendship and  outrage over his conviction ("Total strangers can recognize within five minutes  that you did not receive a fair trial"; "How could 12 people . . . agree to  believe such a horrendous proposition?"). McGinniss also beseeched MacDonald  not to cooperate with other authors seeking to write a book, implying that they  might not be sympathetic ("At this time to the best of anyone's knowledge,  there are no unfriendly MacDonald books on the horizon").  </P> <P> McGinniss' lawyer argued in court that his client's letters expressing "warmth  and understanding" changed within a few months after MacDonald's conviction, as  McGinniss began to vacillate in his feelings; after that, the letters became a  "much more formal kind of correspondence."  </P> <P> But even in his "formal" letters, McGinniss continued to share with MacDonald  news of editing problems and book publication and promotion plans in an  enthusiastic, we're-in-this together spirit that MacDonald -- obsessed with  proving his innocence, convinced of McGinniss' friendship and support -- could  only have interpreted as evidence that the book would be favorable to him.  </P> <P> McGinniss virtually conceded as much when he testified in court that there came  a point in their relationship when " . . . I was willing to let him continue to  believe whatever he wanted to believe, so he wouldn't try to prevent me from  finishing my book . . . ."  </P> <P> But McGinniss did more than simply "let" MacDonald believe what he wanted to  believe. He actively, disingenuously, encouraged that belief.  </P> <P> In July, 1982 -- almost three years after MacDonald's conviction, when  McGinniss had written "75% of the book" -- he even provided MacDonald with an  advance peek at a brief passage from the book. That passage described the judge  at MacDonald's murder trial as having acted in a way that might have prejudiced  the jury against him. Why would McGinniss -- who adamantly refused to allow  MacDonald to see the book before publication -- send him that one excerpt, if  not to create the impression that the book itself was favorable to MacDonald?  </P> <P> Having invested so much time, McGinniss was clearly terrified that if MacDonald  realized the book might not exonerate him, he would stop cooperating, thus  jeopardizing both the book and the money McGinniss would make from it.  </P> <P> "I was making a conscious effort to keep lines of communication open" at a time  when MacDonald was "pressing harder and harder to see the entire book,"  McGinniss conceded when I asked about this. That one passage, McGinniss knew,  would "calm him down a little bit."  </P> <P> Three weeks after sending the passage about the judge, McGinniss wrote another  letter to MacDonald, urging "by all means, hype the book" -- a suggestion that  any reasonable person would also interpret as evidence the book was favorable  to him. Would someone who insisted on his own innocence knowingly "hype" a book  that depicted him as a brutal murderer?  </P> <P> So McGinniss did prey on MacDonald's "vanity, ignorance (and) . . . loneliness"  to maintain his "trust," in Malcolm's words. And Malcolm does seem to have done  her own work in the very sort of "deliberately induced state of moral anarchy"  for which she condemns all journalists. But what McGinniss and Malcolm did was  as atypical as it was wrong. A journalist is something of a parasite, dependent  on sources, but most are not predators, liars or perfidious con artists.  </P></p>

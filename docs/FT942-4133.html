			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Prescott highlights full employment Mr John Prescott yesterday threw his weight behind a target of 2.5 per cent unemployment as he said he would contest both the Labour leadership and the deputy leader's post. Putting full employment at the centre of his campaign, the shadow employment secretary acknowledged that the target was a 'very difficult goal' and could take more than one parliamentary term to achieve. He said full employment was 'an essential part of my socialism'. He aimed to start a 'proper public debate' about how it should be achieved. 'We can and must take the opportunity, as John Smith said, to provide work for all those wanting work.' The MP for Hull East, who ran for deputy leader in 1992, is regarded as one of Labour's leading traditionalists. His strongest support in the six-week contest is expected to come from predominantly blue-collar trade unionists. But, although proud of his own union roots as a former seaman, he is not one to swallow leftwing dogma unquestioned. As Labour's transport spokesman, he was an early advocate of making it easier for publicly owned companies such as British Rail to secure access to private finance. He was keen to underline this point at yesterday's packed Westminster press conference where he spoke of putting 'traditional values in a modern setting'. Last autumn he improved his standing within the party and won a mainstream economic portfolio after his blistering speech at party conference played an important part in ensuring that John Smith won the tense battle to inject greater democracy into Labour's links with the unions. Although he is known as a pugnacious extrovert only a small circle of MPs enjoy Mr Prescott's absolute confidence. Two of them - Mr Richard Caborn, the MP for Sheffield Central, and Mr Ian McCartney, MP for Makerfield - shared the platform with him yesterday. Mr Caborn, chairman of the trade and industry committee of MPs, will serve as Mr Prescott's campaign committee chair and Mr McCartney as his campaign co-ordinator. Mr Prescott, who does not appear to have any firm commitments of support from his shadow cabinet colleagues, yesterday laid much emphasis on the importance of giving party members a 'real' choice in selecting the next Labour leader. He was also keen to highlight the new electoral procedures which his conference speech helped to ensure would be put in place. Labelling the leadership race as 'a turning-point in British political history', Mr Prescott said it would involve 'more voters than participate in national elections in countries such as Denmark and Ireland'. In confident mood, Mr Prescott, 56, sidestepped questions on detailed policy on the grounds that the party had a well-established policy-making machinery. But he said he had been heartened by the 'tremendous public support' for 'my strong commitment to positive employment rights for all workers . . . and to the introduction of a statutory minimum wage'. He said he wanted to introduce a 'positive framework of law' to guarantee such rights. Where the government had opted out of its international obligations, he said, 'we will correct that and that clearly will need legislation'. His pitch for deputy leader two years ago centred almost exclusively on the need to turn the job into an organisational post, charged with reinvigorating the party grassroots, raising membership, boosting the campaigning focus and shifting party resources to Labour's regional centres. He has long argued that Labour's message to its traditional working-class supporters and others, has been lost behind public-relations gloss.</p>

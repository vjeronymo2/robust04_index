			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Leading Article: British Gas and the MMC A YEAR of investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission has not ended debate over the future of the UK gas industry. Argument still rages over the main questions: whether British Gas's domestic monopoly should be abolished and whether the company's trading arm should be divested from its pipeline business. With public consultation on the MMC's recommendations due to end this week, it is unclear what ministers, who have the final say, will decide. The snag is that there is little support for the MMC's line that British Gas should be broken up in 1997 and its monopoly abolished three to five years later. The Gas Consumers Council is suspicious of both break-up and abolition of the monopoly, fearing they would result in higher prices, particularly for the poorest customers. Independent gas suppliers want the market opened up much sooner than the end of the century but care little either way about break-up. Ofgas, the industry regulator, is taking a similar line ' reversing its earlier position that break-up was necessary for competition to flourish. The only party reasonably content with the MMC's package is British Gas, which previously argued against being broken up. In bringing this tangled debate to an end, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, should hold fast to the golden rule: competition wherever possible and regulation only where necessary. Competition is the most effective tool for driving costs down and widening consumer choice. Regulation can strangle the benefits competition brings. Such considerations mean priority should be given to abolishing the domestic monopoly. It is not acceptable for consumers to be denied a choice of gas suppliers until the next century. Higher bills But this does not mean concerns over competition leading to higher gas bills can be swept aside. British Gas's charging structure is riddled with cross-subsidies, which would be eroded by competition. Ministers will not want a similar row to that which has greeted the imposition of VAT on fuel bills. An acceptable way must therefore be found to protect those most in need while harnessing market forces. Such a combination is not, as many suppose, a contradiction in terms. Social obligations can be maintained in a competitive market, as experience in telecommunications has shown. There are different ways of achieving this. In choosing, ministers should be guided by the need to keep regulation in check. Such an imperative counts against Ofgas's proposal that onerous social obligations - equivalent to those currently borne by British Gas - should be imposed on all competitors. This could deter potential rivals from entering the market. Social obligations A better approach would be to conduct a proper analysis of which social obligations are desirable and then cost them. At present, there is much fuzzy talk about cross-subsidies between different types of customer but little analysis of how well these are targeted on those most in need. Once social obligations had been costed, it would be possible to require one supplier to meet the obligations and the rest to pay their share. Initially, it would be natural for the obligations to remain with British Gas. But in the longer run, the role could be put out to competitive tender and given to the operator requiring the lowest subsidy. The need to keep regulation to the minimum is also the most persuasive reason for splitting British Gas's trading and pipeline operations. Although the MMC probably overstated the case by arguing that self-sustaining competition would be impossible without break-up, such a structure would certainly enhance the prospects of competition. So long as British Gas remains an integrated group, there will be a need for constant regulatory intervention to ensure rivals gain fair access to its pipelines. Some think it impractical to press ahead with abolition of the domestic monopoly and break-up at the same time. If that were the case, ministers should give priority to opening up the market. But it is not clear why there has to be such a trade-off. Ideally, Mr Heseltine should give the green light to both.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Tokyo - Other Markets Details of machinery orders in October and wholesale price index for November will be released tomorrow, writes Robert Patton. Analysts expect the WPI data to show a year-on-year decline, while machinery orders should be higher, if only because last October's orders were extremely weak. The Bank of Japan will release November's money supply data on Thursday, the day before its governor, Mr Yasushi Mieno retires. He will be succeeded by the chairman of Sakura Bank, Mr Yasuo Matsushita. Barclays de Zoete Wedd's Weekly Economic Survey on Friday noted that the 'main theme of (governor Mieno's) last six months was bank balance sheet reconstruction and this should also be the main thrust of the new (governor).'

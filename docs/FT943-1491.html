			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Biotech promoter closes its doors A securities firm which made markets in the shares of 68 different biotechnology companies was forced to close its doors yesterday, throwing into question the ability of investors in the companies to sell their shares. The firm, D Blech, which had been rumoured before to be facing liquidity problems, yesterday confirmed that it did not meet the minimum regulatory capital requirements laid down by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Securities firms are not allowed to trade without sufficient capital. The firm's problems follow a difficult time for the biotech industry. According to a study by accountants Ernst &amp; Young, released earlier this week, the market value of publicly-trade biotech companies slid last year to Dollars 36bn, from Dollars 39bn the year before, even though sales grew by a sixth to Dollars 7bn. The failure in recent months of a number of biotech products to win regulatory approval has also dented confidence in the sector. Blech had won a name for its aggressive promotion of small biotech companies which could not win the support of other investment firms. Companies it had backed included Ecogen, Genemedicine, Guildford Pharmaceuticals and La Jolla Pharmaceutical. The shares in each of these companies fell be at least a quarter after yesterday's news.</p>

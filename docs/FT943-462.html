			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Living life to the Max - PepsiCo has combined an ambitious promotion with a plan to squeeze suppliers Club Med in Ibiza has temporarily assumed a new identity: the entire 1,000-bed operation has been taken over and rebranded Club Pepsi Max, as Pepsi-Cola mounts what must be one of the most ambitious pan-European promotions ever attempted. A total of 1,400 competition winners, most of them in their late teens and early twenties, have been flown from all corners of eastern and western Europe, for a week's all expenses-paid holiday. To get there, they had to be successful in a variety of Pepsi Max promotions, from finding lucky-number ring-pulls, to composing slogans - the exact competition details have been left to Pepsi marketers in each country. Prizewinners are playing basketball with Magic Johnson, receiving tennis coaching from former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash and receiving fashion advice from supermodels Linda Evangelista and Karen Mulder, who have all been flown in by Pepsi. The entire multi-million dollar event has been designed to complement Pepsi Max's sporty positioning as a low-calorie cola drink for youths wanting to 'live life to the Max'. The Ibiza event, gigantic in scale though it is, with Pepsi still adding up the millions of entries to the promotion across Europe, could be the start of something even bigger for Pepsi's parent company, PepsiCo. For the US group - which has in its stable Pizza Hut, KFC (formerly Kentucky Fried Chicken), as well as snack foods such as Walkers Crisps - has also used the event to unveil plans for European growth and co-operation between its hitherto autonomous business divisions. Using the Ibiza venue during the weekend before the first batch of lucky prizewinners arrived, PepsiCo invited more than 600 trade customers, including supermarket, petrol station and leisure park operators, to sample Club Pepsi Max hospitality and to listen to presentations about the company's plans. In particular, the company wanted to get over the message that PepsiCo has more to offer than a brown fizzy drink. For example, it wants to see petrol stations and retailers who may currently stock Pepsi, also considering their snack products and even wanting to site quick-service KFC or Pizza Hut outlets on their premises. Says Charlotte Pinder, marketing director for Pepsi Max Europe: 'We've been quite poor at working together with some of our sister companies in the past. We've always been encouraged to be autonomous units.' This has had its benefits in encouraging competition between PepsiCo's businesses, but it has also meant, says Pinder, that best advantage has not always been taken of the 'huge overlap in target audience' between the businesses. Also under-exploited has been the overlap between the goods and services purchased by all the separate businesses. For the last year, PepsiCo's European heads have been meeting to see what economies of scale across operations might yield. The target is to save Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) a year across Europe, out of costs of about Dollars 2bn, by using the combined muscle of the separate businesses. All this is due to happen within a year. According to Paul Steele, Pepsi-Cola's vice-president, sales and marketing in Europe: 'When we went through the list it was surprising. For example, Pizza Hut buys an enormous quantity of cardboard for their boxes; Pepsi-Cola buys cardboard for soft drinks trays. We're looking at whether we can leverage that scale.' The same potential economies of scale could apply to the purchase of flour, salt, spices, cooking oil and TV advertising airtime, say the heads of PepsiCo's different divisions. Says Steele: 'The businesses developed very separately. We didn't have the scale to do this before, but it has suddenly become a very exciting proposition.' The building of this scale in Europe, which was outlined for the first time to trade customers in Ibiza, is intended to take PepsiCo over the next six years from an organisation which reaps 80 per cent of its profits from the US, to one which is reliant for only 50 per cent of its business on the home market. As an example of the kind of growth to be expected, David Williams, who is responsible for Pizza Hut in Europe, says there are plans to invest over Dollars 100m in his operation over the coming year; from 1,000 units today, the aim is to build to 6,000 across Europe by the end of the decade. Purchasing specialists agree the target of Dollars 100m-worth of savings by co-operation between businesses on purchasing - equivalent to about 5 per cent off PepsiCo's European bills - looks realistic, when compared with other companies' experience. Mark Ralf, group purchasing director for SmithKline Beecham worldwide, and a member of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, agrees that 'you can generate huge benefits out of this kind of focus'. His purchasing operation has taken about Pounds 200m over three years out of about Pounds 3bn of the group's costs world wide. But, he warns, PepsiCo could discover what many companies have found: 'Identifying the savings is one thing, actually making them happen is another.' Another specialist in the area points out: 'Americans have a relatively naive view of what happens in Europe. They tend to believe that getting synergies across Europe is the same as getting synergies across the US. As well as cultural differences, there just aren't the integrated supply chains that you have across America. They expect Europe to be the United States of Europe.' At Club Pepsi Max over the past few days, PepsiCo is convinced that it has found the pan-European youth dream. Consumer research conducted by Pinder throughout Europe for the promotion resulted in 'surprise within the company that teenagers in different countries are a much more homogenous group than anyone had imagined,' she says. There was universal excitement among young people about the idea of being a star for a week in the company of celebrities. The next year will see how far suppliers and trade customers can be persuaded to share PepsiCo's pan-European dreams and ambitions.</p>

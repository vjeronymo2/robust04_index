			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> This paragraph also provides that the government will not accept, for purposes of this rule, blanket claims by counsel that he or she represents all or a large number of employees of the organization. It is important to note that this provision is only relevant when the attorney for the government would be prohibited by some other provision of this part from contacting an individual falling under the broad claims of representation under question. For example, an attorney for the government may contact a low-level employee of a corporation, without consent of that employee's counsel or the corporation's counsel, regarding a matter for which the corporation has already been indicted as part of an undercover or overt factual investigation, if that individual has not been arrested or named as a defendant in a criminal or civil law enforcement proceeding. Therefore, the fact that an attorney has stated that he or she represents that individual will have no bearing on whether the communication is proper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, if a particular communication with an individual employee included in such a claim of representation would be improper under these regulations if he or she were in fact represented by counsel (for example, communications to negotiate a plea agreement), then this paragraph provides that a government attorney must first inquire whether the employee is in fact represented before undertaking substantive communications with the employee. As part of this inquiry, the government attorney is not required to disclose to the employee the fact that counsel has asserted that he or she represents the employee. If the employee indicates that he or she is not represented by counsel, it is proper for the government attorney to treat the employee as unrepresented. If the employee indicates that he or she is represented by counsel with regard to the relevant subject matter, the attorney for the government shall treat that employee as a represented person or represented party, and any further communications with that individual shall be governed by this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Paragraph (d): Communications With Separately Represented Controlling Individuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> This paragraph ensures that communications with a controlling individual of an organization that qualifies as a represented party are subject to basically the same limitations, regardless of whether the controlling individual has retained separate counsel on the same subject matter. Thus, this paragraph only applies in the circumstances in which a controlling individual of a represented organizational party retains separate counsel. In such circumstances, a government attorney may not communicate with the controlling individual without the consent of that individual's separate counsel unless the communication satisfies one of the exceptions contained in &sect;&sect;77.6 or 77.9 of this part. The paragraph also allows such communications if the individual does not qualify as a represented party, initiates the communication, and waives the presence of counsel. Thus, the same rules apply to contacts with controlling individuals of represented organizational parties who retain separate counsel as apply to controlling individuals of represented organizational parties who are not separately represented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Paragraph (e): Communications With Unrepresented Controlling Individuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> This paragraph addresses a relatively narrow circumstance: when a controlling individual who is not individually represented by counsel initiates a communication with the government outside the presence of counsel for the organization. An attorney for the government may participate in such communications if: (1) The controlling individual indicates that he or she is speaking exclusively in his or her personal capacity and not as a representative of the organizational party; and (2) he or she indicates that the waiver of counsel is voluntary, knowing and informed and, if willing, signs a statement to that effect. The fact that the controlling individual indicates that he or she is speaking in his or her personal capacity does not mean, however, that incriminating testimony received from the controlling individual cannot be used against the represented organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the controlling individual is also a named defendant in a civil enforcement proceeding or has been arrested or charged in a criminal action, the requirements set forth in &sect;77.6(c) must be satisfied before any substantive communications are made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Paragraph (f): Multiple Representation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> This paragraph makes clear that the proposed regulations should not be construed as altering existing legal and ethical rules regarding the propriety of multiple representation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Section 77.11&blank;Enforcement of Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a): Enforcement by Attorney General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In order to ensure consistency and uniformity in the interpretation of the proposed rule, this paragraph provides that the Attorney General shall have exclusive authority to enforce these regulations. Thus, neither state courts nor state disciplinary boards may impose sanctions on a Department attorney for violations of this rule or state or local rules governing communications with represented parties except as provided in &sect;77.12. This paragraph further provides the framework for investigating allegations that a Department attorney has violated these regulations. It provides that the Department's Office of Professional Responsibility (``OPR'') shall have jurisdiction to investigate such allegations and that violations will be treated as matters of attorney discipline. See 28 CFR 0.39 (establishing and defining duties of OPR). It also makes clear that the Attorney General's determination as to whether a violation has occurred shall be final and conclusive except to the extent that the Department attorney enjoys a right of review provided by other laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Paragraph (b): No Private Remedies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Instead of devoting their Friday session to  parliamentary control, on 28 January the National Assembly  members engaged in regular legislative activity.    The Consultative National Security Council, as envisioned in  the Bulgarian Constitution, finally was fully adopted at a  second reading. Its functions were finally clarified at the  National Assembly session. This will not only be an auxiliary  organ of the president; the council will adopt no obligatory  stands or proposals addressed at other institutions.    The clarification of the council's functions again posed the  old disputed issue of its composition. This issue was discussed  amid growing tension until the end of the session. According to  the Constitution, the president of the Republic is chairman of  the council. The prime minister, the four ministers most  directly involved in security issues, the chief of the General  Staff, the National Assembly chairman, and one representative  from each parliamentary faction also are members of the council.  No changes in this permanent composition were adopted, despite  the fact that there were many new proposals.</p>

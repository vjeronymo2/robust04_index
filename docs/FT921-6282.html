			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: DTI criticises BOM chairman INSPECTORS appointed by the Department of Trade and Industry have expressed 'strong disapproval' of some aspects of the conduct of Mr Michael Lucas, chairman of BOM Holdings, a retailer and property developer that has gone into liquidation. Overall, however, they found that Mr Lucas 'worked very hard on behalf of BOM's shareholders in an honest endeavour to turn BOM once more into a profitable company.' The Stock Exchange was criticised for its initial approval of a defective rights issue circular in December 1988. But the inspectors concluded that the blame rested principally with TC Coombs, which 'failed in its responsibility as a sponsoring broker'. The Stock Exchange was 'wholly justified' in stopping the rights issue three weeks later. The DTI launched an investigation into BOM in February 1990 after numerous complaints from shareholders perturbed by the company's failure to produce accounts for the year to January 1989 and its agreement to sell land at a price thought to be less than its true market value. Some shareholders had alleged that Mr Lucas had an undisclosed interest in the land sale. The DTI's report dismissed the allegations of fraud and said that the price agreed for the land was fair. But it criticised a corporate video made by the company in October 1988 which estimated the value of the land with planning permission at between Pounds 75m and Pounds 100m. Mr Lucas was also criticised for not disclosing transactions in BOM shares in which he was interested. The controversial sale was not completed and the land was sold at auction by a mortgagee for Pounds 1.8m in May 1990. The inspectors said that unless claims against third parties were successful, shareholders have no prospect of receiving any money for their shares.</p>

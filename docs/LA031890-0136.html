			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> INVENTOR HAD WARNED TASER UNSAFE FOR CARDIAC PATIENTS;  </P> <P> WEAPONS: CORONERS IN LOS ANGELES AND SANTA CLARA COUNTIES SAY THE STUN GUN  CONTRIBUTED TO OR CAUSED THREE DEATHS. TWO OF THE VICTIMS HAD HEART DISEASE.  </P> <P> Distributors of the Taser stun gun used by hundreds of police agencies,  including the Ventura Police Department, for years have marketed the weapon as  a non-lethal alternative to nightsticks and firearms that is safe for use on  cardiac patients.  </P> <P> However, a document filed 15 years ago with a federal agency by the weapon's  inventor says that the 50,000-volt Taser poses a special threat to people with  heart ailments.  </P> <P> And, according to coroners in Los Angeles and Santa Clara counties, the weapon  has either caused or contributed to the deaths of three people, two of whom had  heart disease.  </P> <P> The question of whether Taser guns should be used on people with heart problems  was raised last month when a cardiac patient at Ventura County Medical Center  died after being shocked by Ventura police with Taser and Nova stun guns.  </P> <P> Police say they responded when 24-year-old Duane Johnson, who had a history of  psychiatric problems, began throwing himself into windows and walls after being  told that he would be transferred to a nearby mental health facility.  </P> <P> Police acknowledge jolting Johnson four times -- once with the Nova gun during  the initial struggle -- and three times later, with the Taser, to stop him from  grabbing at people and to force him to submit to handcuffing.  </P> <P> Two mental-health workers who witnessed the incident have told county  investigators that Johnson, a muscular former athlete, was shocked seven to 11  times, including several times after he was subdued and posed no threat to  others, according to a coroner's report.  </P> <P> Coroner F. Warren Lovell has not yet determined the cause of Johnson's death,  but the circumstances surrounding the Feb. 13 incident have prompted Lovell to  say that police training is an issue in the case.  </P> <P> "I'd say these weapons aren't safe," Lovell said. Police officers should "use  them to protect life and to reduce injury, but be careful. I think these  officers read the manual that's given out, and they think these things are  entirely safe."  </P> <P> Randall Feltman, county mental health director, said in an interview that the  use of stun guns on Johnson raises "a question about the instruction police  officers get in relation to these weapons. If they think there's no risk, they  will use them more liberally."  </P> <P> A Ventura police spokesman said that Taser and Nova training manuals given to  the Ventura Police Department contain no warning about the weapons' use on  heart patients or on anyone else. The only admonition is not to apply them to  the face, head or genitals, Lt. Michael Tracy said.  </P> <P> Department policy allows officers to use the weapons to control people who pose  a threat to officers or to the public, Tracy said. They also can be used to  force people to comply with officers' instructions, such as in the Johnson  case, he said.  </P> <P> But warnings may not have made a difference for Johnson anyway, since Tracy  said officers were not aware that he had a heart problem, despite his presence  in a ward occupied mostly by cardiac patients.  </P> <P> The Taser -- a flashlight-size device that shoots darts and trailing electrical  wires up to 14 feet or can shock with two long antenna pressed to the skin --  is used by Ventura police about once a month, Tracy estimated. The same is true  of the smaller Nova weapon, whose two tiny exposed points are applied to the  skin, he said.  </P> <P> None of the other law enforcement agencies in Ventura County use the Taser,  though Oxnard and Port Hueneme have supplied Nova guns to their police. A  spokesman for the Taser's manufacturer said 267 police agencies nationwide use  the weapon. Nova Technologies Inc. of Austin, Tex., supplies about 450 police  departments in this country and 800 worldwide, spokesmen said.  </P> <P> The Nova can also be purchased for less than $100 over the counter at gun  shops. A number of other stun guns similar to the Nova are also available to  the public. But the Taser, which costs about $300, is sold only to police.  </P> <P> Taser and Nova weapons have similar power and circuitry, and the manufacturers  of both weapons are licensed by inventor Jack Cover, whose patented technology  they use, Cover said. The weapons, he said, produce about three watts of power,  enough to light a Christmas tree bulb.  </P> <P> It was Cover, manufacturer of the Taser for more than a decade, whose summary  of the weapon was submitted to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission in  1975. Cover stated in that report that years of studies and tests had shown  that the Taser "is non-lethal . . . to normally healthy people."  </P> <P> "However, it must be emphasized that neither this feature nor the noninjury or  no-harmful-after-effect aspect can ever be guaranteed," Cover wrote. "There is  no weapon, technique or procedure for subduing, constraining or dispersing that  does not involve some risk of injury to healthy persons or of death, especially  if the individual has a heart ailment."  </P> <P> Based partly on this analysis by Cover, the product safety commission's deputy  medical director, Dr. Leo T. Duffy, declared the Taser non-lethal when "used as  directed on the average, healthy adult." He described the gun as a "dangerous  weapon," but said it had only a fraction of the power necessary to shock the  heart into losing its rhythm and causing death.  </P> <P> "This safety margin would be diminished in a person who has existing  cardiovascular disease," Duffy noted. And it would be decreased even more, he  said, if the Taser were applied to a person for a prolonged period. Children  and the elderly, along with heart patients, would be especially susceptible to  the adverse effects of the Taser, Duffy said.  </P> <P> Cover, in an interview last week, said his summary of his product's potential  negative effects "were wise words." He said, however, that he was very cautious  in his analysis for legal reasons and that he still believes that electrical  shocks from a Taser present no more threat to cardiac patients than the shock  they would get if someone said "boo" to them.  </P> <P> He said he emphasized the weapon's safety, even with heart patients, while  training officers at the Los Angeles Police Department, which in 1981 became  the first major police agency in the country to use of the weapon.  </P> <P> The current primary distributor of the Taser, Adamson Uniform and Equipment of  Costa Mesa, has been similarly aggressive in stressing the safety of the stun  gun.  </P> <P> The second page of a promotional packet Adamson has sent to potential customers  says the weapon is "medically safe, even for individuals with heart disease or  those using pacemakers." The 15th page of the same packet includes a summary of  Duffy's findings for the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which incorporates  Cover's warning about special risks to heart patients.  </P> <P> Adamson, which has sold about 90% of the 1,000 Tasers built since 1987 by the  current manufacturer, EID Laboratory of Temple City, has trained  representatives of numerous law enforcement agencies that have purchased the  weapon, said Jim Fraser, the distributor's general manager.  </P> <P> Adamson's 37-page training manual makes no mention of cardiac patients. It  states that there is no evidence of "adverse physiological or neurological  effects stemming purely from the electric current charge of a Taser. . . "  Spokesmen for the manufacturers of the Taser and the Nova weapons said in  interviews that no deaths or serious injuries have been caused by their  weapons, and that they are safe for police officers to use on anyone.  </P> <P> In situations where coroners have found that the Taser has caused or  contributed to death, the medical examiners have not had the technical  expertise required to make an accurate analysis, said James McNulty, president  and owner of EID Laboratory.  </P> <P> Those who have died after being shocked with Tasers "have overexerted  themselves battling with police or have taken enough PCP to cause them to die,"  McNulty said.  </P> <P> The drugs and exertion are "a thousand times more likely" to have caused the  deaths than the Taser, he said. He cited university studies that have found  that the small amount of electricity produced by stun guns has little effect on  the heart, even when directly applied to it.  </P> <P> McNulty also said that Tasers manufactured by his firm are slightly less  powerful than their predecessors, and that none has been used in a fatal  incident.  </P> <P> County medical examiners in Los Angeles have concluded that two men died in  1985 and 1986 either as a direct result of being shot with Taser darts, or in  part because of them. A coroner in San Jose also found last summer that a  37-year-old jail inmate with a mild heart problem died when his heart failed  because of Taser shocks he received during a struggle with officers.  </P> <P> In addition, use of Nova stun guns has been declared a contributing factor in  the deaths of two people, including a Port Hueneme man who died of heart  failure while intoxicated with cocaine in 1987.  </P> <P> Seventeen people in Los Angeles County have died since 1983 after being shocked  with Tasers, according to the coroner's office, including the two cases in  which the weapons at least contributed to death.  </P> <P> Cornelius Garland Smith, who was shot twice with Taser darts in 1985, is one of  10 people who died in instances where Los Angeles Police Department officers  used the weapon during the 1980s, according to Cmdr. William Booth.  </P> <P> Smith, 35, was shocked after officers found him writhing and screaming on the  ground in South-Central Los Angeles. He died from a combination of the Taser,  PCP and a congenital heart problem for which he was taking medicine, the  coroner found.  </P> <P> Tasers were the cause of the death of Anthony M. Williams III, a 35-year-old  Upland man, who died after being subdued by Pomona police in May, 1986, the  coroner reported. The cause of death was reported as heart failure "due to  multiple Taser use." Williams was also under the influence of cocaine, the  coroner reported.  </P> <P> "Because the individual developed cardiac arrest immediately following shooting  with the electrode rifle, and in the absence of other significant injuries . .  . , it is assumed that death was caused" by the Taser, a deputy coroner found.  At least one other Los Angeles County death has involved the Taser and a victim  with a heart problem. The coroner ruled that Raul Guevara Jr., 30, of San  Fernando died in January, 1984, of a heart problem aggravated by the effort  Guevara exerted during a struggle with a jailer.  </P> <P> In response, Taser and Nova spokesmen cite studies that they say show their  weapons cannot cause a death.  </P> <P> They cited the studies of Dr. Theodore Bernstein, whom the product safety  commission selected to analyze the Taser in 1975. He found in a 1985 study that  the heart rhythm of healthy volunteers who were shocked with the Nova stun gun  did not change significantly.  </P> <P> Also in 1985, Dr. Robert A. Stratbucker of the University of Nebraska Medical  Center, Omaha, concluded that the Nova weapon, when used on animals, had no  effect on heart rhythm or pumping and only a mild effect on blood pressure,  even when it was applied directly to the heart. When Stratbucker simulated  heart disease in animals, the shocks caused no irregularities.  </P> <P> In the first large-scale medical review of the effects of the Taser on crime  suspects, doctors at Martin Luther King Jr. Medical Center in Los Angeles found  that during 1980-85, all but three of the 218 people treated there after Taser  shocks survived.  </P> <P> Doctors reported that those three had high drug or alcohol levels that alone  could have caused their deaths. By comparison, 11 of 22 people shot by police  over a two-year period died, the doctors noted.  </P> <P> Dr. Eric Koscove, an emergency physician at L.A. County-USC Medical Center, who  has written extensively on the Taser, said that it may be impossible to say for  sure that the weapon is safe for use on heart patients because tests on people  with such problems probably never will be conducted.  </P> <P> "I think generally speaking, the Taser is a relatively safe weapon for what  it's supposed to do," Koscove said. "As a physician, I would prefer they use  the Taser than just beat people down with the baton or choke them down. If my  brother or sister were involved, I'd rather see them Tasered. We see a lot more  deaths from chokeholds and batons than from the Taser."  </P> <P> Even critics who cite cases where police officers have tortured crime suspects  with stun guns -- including one settled for more than $300,000 by the city of  Huntington Park in 1988 -- say the weapons should be used more frequently  instead of lethal weapons such as firearms.  </P> <P> Ventura County Coroner Lovell said he supports the cautious use of stun guns.  The problem is not the weapon, he said. "The problem is that police really  believe these things are completely safe."  </P></p>

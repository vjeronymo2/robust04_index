			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / A tall order to avoid the traps: Gatt as well as domestic economic policies could determine the race to the Elysee Palace If Prime Minister Edouard Balladur pulls off a deal in the stalled General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations that includes at least some concessions for France, he will probably want - and feel he deserves - to be the country's next president. That is a tall order. Such a compromise would require placating all but the most die-hard of French farmers and appeasing the cultural nationalists in his own RPR Gaullist party. It would also mightily relieve the all-too-silent majority of French industrialists and bankers who want wider markets for their high-tech products and services, and would ward off a European crisis that would deeply upset his centre-right UDF coalition partner. He also faces other potential pitfalls. His chances of winning the presidency, if he decides to respond to pressure from his supporters to stand, would depend on pulling France out of recession and formulating a European policy that can fill a vacuum left by the summer's foreign exchange upheaval. Success on Gatt, however, would be a historic step with a conservative government opening France to the world economy, just as 10 years ago its socialist leaders decided that France should sign up to the process that led to the European Community's single market. Failure of the Uruguay Round on trade liberalisation, if pinned on France, would, besides damaging world trade, provoke a European political crisis and almost certainly another European monetary crisis that would destroy France's hopes of breathing life into the newly ratified Maastricht treaty. 'Gatt is a trap for France,' says Mr Balladur bluntly, though without admitting that it is largely a trap of his and previous governments' making. For France to sign a Gatt accord on present terms would be seen as 'a shameful compromise'. Equally, its failure to sign would be seen as 'dangerously isolating' the country. So far, Mr Balladur has focused on ensuring that he himself is not dangerously isolated. This was why he devoted Monday and Tuesday to explaining his position on Gatt to a stream of leaders of France's political, business, union, farming, show-business and even academic worlds. This very public show of consultation to defuse the threat of a crisis was very much in the style that Mr Balladur learnt when he was Prime Minister Georges Pompidou's minister in charge of industrial relations in May 1968. But Mr Balladur's public consultation had other aims. He won public pledges of support, most importantly from the leader of his own RPR party, Mr Jacques Chirac, who looks certain to be a candidate in 1995's presidential elections. But the exercise was also a chance to impress upon France's movers and shakers the need for some compromise on Gatt. One man needed no convincing of that. Mr Brice Lalonde, leader of Generation Ecologie, one faction of the Green movement, has proclaimed his readiness to campaign in favour of Gatt. Yet Mr Lalonde, who lost heavily in the March parliamentary elections, hardly counts. Nor, in this context, does European Commission president Jacques Delors' recent warning that France is in danger of building itself a 'Maginot line' against Gatt, with about as much utility as that second world war defence. Most French regard Mr Delors as too implicated in the despised Blair House accord on farm trade which the Commission negotiated with the US. But there are other signs of cracks in France's anti-Gatt consensus that will be useful to Mr Balladur's search for compromise. Not only are some media commentators beginning to question the wisdom of France going it alone on the Gatt; but this week an important fissure appeared in the anti-Gatt agriculture lobby. The head of France's wine and cognac exporters said 'a Gatt failure would be a catastrophe' for his members who last year boosted the country's trade surplus by FFr29bn. French wine exports - largely unsubsidised and thus unaffected by Blair House constraints - have been hit by US retaliatory duties in the past, and might be again if Washington took out a Gatt failure on France. For its part, the Patronat employers' federation reminded the country that industry and services, which stand to benefit from a Gatt deal, provide more than 90 per cent of French jobs. In contrast to his open airing of France's Gatt dilemma, Mr Balladur has stifled debate on domestic monetary policy, which is as much a trap for him as the Gatt. On the one hand, he knows that to let the franc slide sharply against the D-Mark would be to throw away the hard-won credibility France has earned in the eyes, if not of the markets, at least of Germany. The strategy of putting every 'letter' of the Maastricht treaty into effect, hoping that one day its 'spirit' will return, depends, Mr Balladur gauges, on pretending that the European exchange rate mechanism lives on in shadow form, at least for France. On the other hand, a drop in interest rates would guarantee a French recovery in 1994, which for the moment is only made likely by the government's cautious fiscal policy. Mr Balladur is still living with his mistake of underestimating the depth of France's recession, and in cutting spending and raising taxes in April. This week the government revised its forecast of this year's contraction in the economy from 0.8 per cent to 1 per cent. Yet, an expansionary budget for 1994 would not have sat well with France's commitment to working out a joint economic convergence programme with Germany - to be presented for public relations purposes at next week's EC summit in Brussels. The 1994 budget will take steps towards shifting welfare charges off company payrolls, on to general taxation. Long term, this will reduce the cost of French labour, which should price itself back into the market. But unemployment will probably go on rising into 1994. For the moment, Mr Balladur's popularity, though declining from record levels, is still greater than that of his policies. A large part of the population still gives him the benefit of the doubt. In spite of much moaning in private, the Patronat this week backed the 'measured policy of the government moving towards short-term interest rates of 5-6 per cent', an expression of hope made more realistic by the Bundesbank's decision yesterday to cut rates. Mr Balladur's privatisation programme has helped stoke unrest not only in Air France, where bitterly contested lay-offs are necessary if the carrier is ever to be fit for sale, but also indirectly in France Telecom and the post office which are not on the list of state assets to be sold, but whose staff fear their utilities will one day be put on the auction block too. But private investors outnumber public sector workers. Judging by the low price set for shares in the sale of Banque Nationale de Paris, privatisation is being conducted so as to put a tidy profit in investors' pockets. That should make them happy to vote for Mr Balladur in 1995, if he wants to run for the presidency. It is hard to see Mr Balladur resisting the lure of the Elysee - but not because he has any real difficulty with its present incumbent. He gets on well with President Francois Mitterrand. Too well, some inside the ruling majority would argue, pointing out that he has let Mr Mitterrand hamper government attempts to reform school finances and asylum procedures, as well as the resumption of nuclear weapon testing. But the opinion poll evidence is conclusive that most French people give Mr Balladur more credit for falling in with Mr Mitterrand than to Mr Chirac for falling out with the president when the RPR leader was prime minister in the mid-1980s. Equally striking is the poll evidence that Mr Balladur would, at the moment, beat any candidate for the Elysee in 1995, when Mr Mitterrand's term expires. In spite of consolidating his hold on the depleted Socialist party at its congress this weekend, Mr Michel Rocard is likely to pose little challenge to either Mr Chirac or even ex-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the UDF. But opinion surveys show the latter two could be trumped by a wild-card candidacy of Mr Delors, a centrist socialist. For the moment, Mr Balladur eschews publicly any presidential ambitions. Nor has Mr Chirac formally declared his hand. The only visible tension between the two men is over their disagreement over the timing of the 'real turning point' in French politics; Mr Balladur claims it came with March's elections, Mr Chirac says it will not arrive until 1995. But the issues facing France may soon make the present truce untenable, for Mr Chirac is closer to the farm lobby on Gatt, more sceptical on Europe, and more inclined to an expansionary economic policy than Mr Balladur. Failure by Mr Balladur to finesse Gatt, to orchestrate interest rate cuts and to bring the jobless rate down next year, would flush Mr Chirac out into open rivalry.</p>

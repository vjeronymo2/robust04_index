			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (1): Motor industry sets pace for investors - The race is on to expand operations in a trading area which, thanks to Nafta, has 360m consumers. Martin Dickson examines the prospects There is no more clearcut illustration of the importance of North America as a business location for European and Asian corporations than a string of recent investments in the motor industry. Toyota, the largest Japanese vehicle manufacturer, announced recently that it would be raising its vehicle production in the region by nearly 50 per cent over the next two years, taking its total output from 533,000 units to 790,000 a year. The increase will come from its existing manufacturing plant in Kentucky, where it has already put in place the necessary extra production capacity; from New United Motor Manufacturing, its California-based joint venture with General Motors; and from Toyota Motor Manufacturing in Canada. In July, Honda, Japan's third largest carmaker (and the first to establish a manufacturing presence in the US, in the early 1980s), announced that it planned an 18 per cent increase in North American vehicle capacity over the next three years and a 50 per cent boost in engine-making capacity by 1998. Again, the expansion will take place at its existing factories in Ohio and Ontario, Canada. The Japanese companies want to increase their US output partly because the rise in the value of the yen, relative to the dollar, has made it uneconomic to import many vehicles from Asia, and partly because Tokyo is under strong US pressure to reduce its trade imbalance with America. But they are hardly alone in their expansion plans: over the past two years two German luxury car manufacturers - BMW and Mercedes-Benz - have both announced plans to locate in the US, their first manufacturing plants outside Germany. BMW has built a factory in South Carolina, which produced its first vehicles last month, while a Mercedes plant is going up in Alabama. Both have been lured by America's relatively low labour costs (partly a function of dollar weakness), by the skills of its workforce, and by the competitive edge they hope they will gain from being direct participants in the world's most cut-throat vehicle market, and one of the most innovative. Like the Japanese, their new US production will be aimed both at domestic consumers and at the export market. The increasing motor industry investment is being replicated in many other sectors, and for broadly similar reasons: no company seeking a global presence can ignore either the size or fiercely entrepreneurial character of the US market. For the US remains by far the world's largest market speaking a single language, while this year's implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement has created a trading area, also embracing Canada and Mexico, of more than 360m consumers. Nafta is starting to have a significant impact on location decisions. Chrysler is building a new Dollars 300m vehicle assembly plant in Mexico, and analysts expect employment in the nation's motor industry to rise from 160,000 today to 210,000 by 1998. Foreign direct investment in the US grew remarkably in the 1980s. This was partly through the start-up of greenfield plants, notably from Japanese car manufacturers, but much more so through the takeover of existing US companies. Direct foreign investment grew from Dollars 83bn in 1980 to Dollars 403.7bn in 1990. In the late 1980s and early 1990s the growth rate dropped sharply, due to recession and to alternative investment opportunities opened up by the economic integration of western Europe, the collapse of the Soviet empire, an economic boom in several Pacific Rim nations and an improved economic climate in Latin America. Foreign spending on acquiring or establishing US businesses totalled Dollars 15.3bn in 1992, down roughly 45 per cent on the previous year and the fourth consecutive year of decline. It was the lowest total since the Dollars 8.09bn in 1983. However, over the past 18 months there has been a distinct revival in US inward investment. Expenditure in 1993 bounced back to Dollars 26.2bn, while total foreign direct investment, at historic cost, reached Dollars 445.3bn. This year has seen a flurry of European takeovers or sizeable investments in US companies, including a Dollars 5.3bn cash bid by Roche of Switzerland for drugs company Syntex and a Dollars 2.3bn offer by SmithKline Beecham for drug wholesaler Diversified Pharmaceutical Services. But where in North America should a foreign company locate its operations? For those acquiring or expanding a US presence through a takeover, there is little choice: you set up shop where the acquired company has its facilities. But those companies establishing a greenfield presence, or thinking of changing their existing North American locations, face a complicated trade-off involving, among many factors: the type of business they are engaged in; the markets they are seeking to serve; the type of labour force they need to attract; relative wage/real estate/utility and cost-of-living expenses; transport and other infrastructure requirements; and available government incentives. Despite this wide range of variables, some broad trends can be identified. One of the most significant is the growth of financial assistance packages over the past few years as US states and municipalities try to woo businesses. Jim Schriner, of PHH Fantus Consulting, a leading business location advisory group, says: 'The incentive market is very hot right now and will probably stay so for a couple of years.' The most startling incentive package is that awarded by Alamaba to Mercedes: an initial Dollars 253m, with tax breaks over 25 years that could be worth an additional Dollars 230m. More recently, the state of Iowa gave Ipsco, a Canadian steel group, a package of tax and other incentives worth Dollars 73m over 20 years to clinch the location of a steel mill. And last month Connecticut gave some Dollars 120m of incentives over 10 years to persuade Swiss Bank Corporation to move its US headquarters from Manhattan, New York, to the suburban city of Stamford. Despite the growth of incentives, most companies consider these towards the end of their site search, as one of several factors which can tip the balance between one area and another. Relocation advisory groups argue that to focus on government concessions ahead of more fundamental business factors is to risk making short-term judgments which could prove costly in the long run. More fundamental business location trends include a continuing shift of businesses from city centres to surrounding suburbs. Take, for example, Swiss Bank's recent decision to move to Stamford, Connecticut, from New York city, and Mastercard's plan to move its headquarters from Manhattan to New York state's nearby Westchester county. In New York, this trend partly reflects rising Manhattan property rental prices as the city recovers from the severe recession of 1989-1993. That, in turn, underlines the fact that, despite the run of defections, cosmopolitan New York remains a crucial centre for the financial services industry, international trade and media industries. That said, manufacturing and services industries that do not need to be in the relatively costly north-eastern US are continuing to switch to less expensive centres in the south, midwest and west. And on the west coast, there is a trend for businesses to relocate from California to fast-growing desert and Rocky Mountain states, notably Arizona, Nevada and Utah. Many are leaving the expensive, socially-troubled Los Angeles region. Nafta is also starting to influence location decisions. Richard Greene, of Ernst &amp; Young's international corporate real estate consulting service, says: 'The biggest thing to have changed in the last couple of years is Nafta. We are seeing foreign companies - Canadian and Mexican as well as European and Asian - re-examining where in America to do business. They are looking for the best place to access the entire North American market.' Mr Schriner of PHH says that it has seen 'very little work resulting from Nafta. Companies that want to be in Mexico already have a presence in Mexico.' But he adds that many companies are still organised on a country basis, rather than a regional basis, with three separate corporate staffs for the US, Canada and Mexico, and these will have to be cut eventually to one. 'Companies have not dealt with this yet, but they will have to.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] U.S. Ambassador in Cyprus Richard Boucher is the  one who was actually behind the moves and efforts to change UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's latest report to the  Security Council on the results of the proximity talks.    According to our information from Washington, the U.S.  ambassador strongly suggested that the State Department push the  UN Secretariat to amend the initial text of the secretary  general's report to not blame the Turkish side for the failure  of the talks.    According to the same information, a close supporter of this  effort by Mr. Boucher was Robert Lamb, U.S. State Department  special coordinator on Cyprus; however, the actions and  initiative were the U.S. ambassador's.    The same information also notes that one of the reasons that  led Mr. Boucher to this initiative, besides, of course, the fact  that this effort is part of the greater U.S. policy toward  Cyprus and the Turks, is the fact that he has been a diplomat in  Cyprus for such a short time that he has not developed a greater  perspective for progress on the Cyprus issue.</p>

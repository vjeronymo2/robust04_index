			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Kmart buys Czech department store KMART, one of the largest and best-known US retailers, yesterday announced that it was acquiring a majority interest in MAJ, one of the biggest department stores in the centre of Prague. It also said that it was negotiating with government authorities for the purchase of a further 11 stores in both the Czech and Slovak republics. These deals have been agreed in principle, but are subject to final review and approval. This is first time a foreign company has acquired retail outlets in Czechoslovakia, and the deal takes Kmart into Europe for the first time. In the US, its operations range from speciality chains, like the Waldenbooks bookstores, to more than 2,300 discount stores selling general merchandise. The US retailer - which was built up by a notoriously stingy businessman, Sebastian Kresge, in the early 1900s - said that its total outlay could amount to Dollars 100m if all 12 stores are acquired. This sum would be spread over three years and would include some expenditure on improving the stores. Kmart has paid Dollars 11.8m for the MAJ interest, and will invest another Dollars 3.5m in this store alone over the next three years. Kmart has been negotiating with the Czech State Asset Fund for at least a year, and is belived to have been interested initially in the rival Kotva store in Prague. This is the country's largest department store, and has been introducing West European goods and displays. The MAJ store, although ideally located, has a more downmarket image, and sells a very wide variety of goods - from clothing to housewares. Kmart said that MAJ's space totalled about 200,000 square feet, significantly more than any of its Kmart stores in the US. The company says it plans to introduce US retail expertise to Czecoslovakia, and will send some of its personnel to Europe. US retail sales, Page 18</p>

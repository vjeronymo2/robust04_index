			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Arts: And the band plays soap opera - A worthy film about Aids too closely resembles an old Hollywood biopic / Cinema AND THE BAND PLAYED ON (12) Roger Spottiswoode GRIEF Richard Glatzer THE DIARY OF LADY M (18) Alain Tanner REDHEADS (15) Danny Vendramini A closing caption in And The Band Played On, based on Randy Shilts's bestselling book about the discovery of Aids, reveals that 25,000 Americans died from the disease before President Ronald Reagan deigned to make his first speech on the subject. Hollywood has some nerve. It has taken 15 years, and a spectacularly higher death toll, for mainstream American cinema itself to broach the topic in earnest. Philadelphia saw us through Oscar time. This week two more films, Band and Richard Glatzer's Grief, arrive to show that the illness that once dared not speak its name - indeed could not settle on a name for several years (it was originally, we are told, called GRID) - is now developing a startling taste for the soapbox. And The Band Played On is massively worthy: 2 1/4 hours of all-star inspirationalism and medical-historical legwork. We meet the brave band of researchers at the Atlanta Center for Disease Control, led by Matthew Modine as the real-life Dr Don Francis. We watch the trans-Atlantic test-tube war between America's Dr Bob Gallo (Alan Alda) and France's Pasteur Institute (Nathalie Baye, Patrick Bauchau), both claiming first-discovery honours over the virus. And we goggle at the procession of guest stars, from Hollywood natives such as Steve Martin, Richard Gere and Anjelica Huston to our own Ian McKellen (American-accented) and Phil Collins (indefinably accented as a louche bathhouse owner). Finally, of course, we applaud the capacity of the Human Spirit to overcome anything put in its path, including films such as this. It is wicked to mock an affliction, but in the demonological landscape of Aids a movie like And The Band Played On may be part of the affliction. Devoid of a single moment of pain or complex emotional revelation - let alone of real rather than sentimentalised 'struggle' - the film plays like one of those old Hollywood medical biopics, only without the flair. Having despaired of reality, we end up wishing the film would go the whole romantic hog and bring on Greer Garson, brandishing her smile, her bunsen burner and her ever-attentive Walter Pidgeon. If And The Band Played On is Madame Curie with the glums, Richard Glatzer's Grief is a gay Soapdish - and surprisingly enjoyable for it. This movie of confused sexuality is set in the mad mad world of American daytime television. Mark (Craig Chester), who has lost his lover Kenny to Aids, falls for Bill (Alexis Arquette), who is having an affair with Jeremy (Carlton Wilborn), all under the eye of butch boss Jo, played by drag performer Jackie Beat. And that is just behind the scenes of The Love Judge, the series about a divorce court on which they are working. Soap opera itself being the art form of emotional instability, a soap production company is the perfect world for pixillated feelings. Glatzer, a first-time filmmaker, does not seem quite sure whether he is spoofing soap emotionalism or subscribing to it. But that is part of Grief's charm. The straight faces with which the actors collide into one crisis after another ensure that innocent gravity cohabits with sly comedy: a combination that never in deft hands fails. A terrible hilarity overcame the press show audience at Alain Tanner's The Diary Of Lady M. To my left, The Independent and The Sunday Telegraph, were knee-deep in chortles; to my right, The Times, agog with satiric disbelief. It is hard to believe the dialogue in this film about a nightclub singer's AC/DC affairs with a Barcelona painter and his North African wife. And then we must grapple with the images. The Swiss director who once commanded respect with The Salamander and Jonas now appears to be joined at the hip, or at some other body part, with writer-actress Myriam Mezieres, who plays the heroine. Their last collaboration, A Flame In My Heart, was bad enough: the earnestly wanton tale of a circus lady's amours prodigales. But here we reel from one voice-over enormity to another - 'I was the plain covered with almond trees that Van Gogh painted' - while the pictures try vainly to keep up with the logorrhoea. Redheads runs The Diary Of Lady M close for worst film of 1994. Danny Vendramini directs the Brisbane-set tale of two carrot-headed women, a criminal (Claudia Karvan) and a social worker (Catherine McClements), who discover a strange kinship in the wake of a murder. The kinship finds expression in their breathless delivery of B-movie dialogue and their tendency to wave their arms about in front of a wobbly camera. Occasionally someone screams, rages or loses consciousness - or was that just in the audience?</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Fashion heralds have designs on the past: Avril Groom flags the look which has its roots in medieval times IN Siena, at the frenetic horse-racing pageant of the Palio, heraldic banners are hoisted which could be forgiven for being mistaken for a display of Gianni Versace's scarves. At the Hermes workshops in Paris, their designs on silk incorporate heraldic symbols including those once British stalwarts the rose, the thistle and the leek. And everyone with designs on selling to the yachting fraternity, from Louis Vuitton to Polo Ralph Lauren, has attempted to translate the heraldry of nautical flags, usually accompanied by coiled rope and compasses, into print. The interplay between heraldry and design is one of Britain's most enduring images. Originally, of course, it was hardly fashion but a necessity as the medieval knight rode into battle wearing his identifying colours. Today's designs, pioneered by Hermes, have seen the braid and badges of military pomp and circumstance and gold Baroque swirls added. To the heraldry-wearers of today - from lager louts in Union flag shorts to the ladies-who-lunch in silk shirts emblazoned with ersatz coats-of-arms - one would hardly impute noble motives. In fashion terms, status heraldry wins hands down, despite the best efforts of avant-garde designers to turn the Union flag into serious design. Those Baroque designs with their swags and tassels of golden rope or chains and their shields and badges in rich, opulent colours have what is popularly recognised as elegance, even when they are inexpensive versions inspired by great designer names. As such, they make ideal Christmas presents because, apart from a few dedicated fans of modernist, minimalist black, it is hard to find anyone who dislikes them. Heraldic is also one of the few print styles that both sexes can wear with equanimity. The original, and probably still the best canvas for such prints is the shirt, as it shows off the whole design, usually spread unrepeated over a area to its best advantage. Hermes was the original past-master of such designs, explaining their appeal by the 'rich regal palette of colours associated with ceremonial pageantry, majesty and pomp which, in turn, relates to tradition and ancestry' - all factors with an emotional pull in today's uncertain modern world. This perhaps explains the rise of the heraldic silk shirt as high fashion in the headlong consumerist 1980s and its now becoming a classic for more traditional dressers in the depressed 1990s. But the Hermes print did not rule unchallenged for long. In the late 1980s, Versace, high priest of modern, body-hugging, sexually-charged design, turned his hand to heraldry and produced a print revolution. As one of his associates put it: 'However modern his shapes, his designs always contain historical references, anything from Greek or Etruscan to medieval culture.' Presumably, he looked at the ancient banners with their rich heraldic colours and strange insets of black and white checks reminiscent of 1960s op-art and evolved designs with his own imaginative input such as theatrical, operatic or architectural motifs, or a more obviously '60s slant. With even more complex designs and colours, and therefore higher price-tags, than other such prints, Versace's inevitably became the most coveted. At up to Pounds 1,000, the Versace silk shirt was the ultimate late '80s status-symbol. Some have gone into his Signatures collection of classic items that will last from one season to the next. The print style - brilliant colour and Baroque gold interspersed with monochrome geometric sections - has been copied by the high street manufacturers of the world, often appallingly. Versace himself has wisely adapted it for his less exalted items. Now you can have an exclusive Versace print on your boxer shorts. Diversification is the latest move in the heraldic game. Shirts and scarves started it, but now those who see these prints as adding a touch of class can do it in more subtle ways. For women, it goes from head (hairbands) to toe (slippers and evening shoes), and from low-key (Sam Browne's fleur-de-lys printed separates in gold on black silk) to flamboyant (Loewe's print of Spanish nobles on heraldic-caparisoned horses). For men, it goes from the obvious ties and cummerbunds to the more subtle - Hermes' print back on a plain dress-shirt or Gucci's silk-print back on a suede waistcoat. At every level of the market, the Christmas pickings of this much-loved look are rich.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> MONDALE DAUGHTER QUITS TV JOB  </P> <P> Eleanor Mondale, daughter of the former vice president, resigned from her job  as a TV entertainment reporter just days before a local magazine was due to  publish an article called, "Walter and Joan's Wild Child."  </P> <P> Mondale denied she was forced out after only eight months at WCCO-TV, the Star  Tribune of Minneapolis reported today.  </P> <P> "The resignation is definitely her choice," said WCCO news director John  Culliton.  </P> <P> "I've done a lot of stuff," Mondale is quoted as saying in the article. "I like  to get wild. But it's not murder, and I don't do drugs. I hear stuff about me  dating everyone in town, and that's really unfair. I'm new in town, I'm single,  and my job is to know this city and know people. So what am I supposed to do?  Never go out?"  </P></p>

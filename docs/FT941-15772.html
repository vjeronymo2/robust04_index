			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / ICI pulls out of Du Pont joint venture Imperial Chemical Industries has pulled out of IDAC, the Pounds 50m joint venture in Germany with Du Pont, the US chemicals company, which was set up in 1988 to enter the Pounds 650m European market for painting cars during manufacture. The venture, which Du Pont will continue alone, failed to reach the 20 per cent market share for which ICI hoped. The price Du Pont is paying for ICI's 50 per cent stake is not being disclosed. IDAC's annual sales are about DM200m (Pounds 77m) to 12 car factories, but the squeeze on costs by manufacturers during the recession has damaged profitability. IDAC's competitive edge was supposed to be ICI's revolutionary car paint, Aquabase, which uses water instead of volatile organic solvents to carry the paint's pigment and resin. Solvent emissions from paint shops contribute to acid rain as their constituent chemicals break down in sunlight. IDAC's factory will keep its Aquabase licences. ICI has now developed Aquabase technology to give it a technological lead in car repair paints, a Pounds 2bn global market where the company claims to be the world's fifth largest supplier and the biggest outside the US. Mr John Hirst, chief executive of ICI Autocolor, said the company would now concentrate on the development of its two strong industrial paint businesses, environmentally friendly can coatings and specialised paints for vehicle repair. It will also continue to milk its profitable cash cow of Dulux decorative paints, which dominate the UK market for architectural coatings. Paint manufacturers learn lesson, Page 30</p>

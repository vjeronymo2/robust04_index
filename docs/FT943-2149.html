			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Jobs for life hit by Tokyo reversal The Japanese government yesterday gave its blessing to a symbolic challenge to the industrial elite's system of lifetime employment, by approving leading airlines' plans to hire stewardesses on short-term contracts. The decision, by Mr Shizuka Kamei, transport minister, confirms his humiliating climbdown at the end of last month, when he was forced to withdraw initial opposition to Japan Airlines' plans to recruit part-time staff to cut costs. All Nippon Airways, Japan's second largest airline after JAL, is planning to do the same. This is a rare setback for the traditional practice of administrative guidance, where government ministries exert behind-the-scenes control on companies, backed up with implied threats. Mr Kamei had hinted that the ministry might refuse new JAL route applications if the airline refused administrative guidance. This is the latest example of how Mr Kamei's Liberal Democratic party, the largest partner in the three-party coalition, has been striving with mixed success to re-establish authority over the bureaucracy and industry since returning to power at the end of June after a year's absence. The outcome of the row could signal a weakening in government influence on the private sector. Mr Kamei's attempt to block recruitment of contract staff, ostensibly on safety grounds, drew sharp protests from Japan's main business lobbies, sensitive to increasing use of non-salaried labour. Lifetime employment has come under growing strain as the rise of the yen has obliged employers to sharpen cost competitiveness. JAL diplomatically gave Mr Kamei a reason for changing his mind by revising its plans, increasing wages of the contract stewardesses although they will still earn much less than salaried staff.</p>

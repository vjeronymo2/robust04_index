			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Charity shops 'make 27% profit' on small turnover THE TYPICAL high-street charity shop made a profit of 27 per cent on weekly sales and donations of Pounds 963, a survey published today shows. Oxfam has the largest sales and profits of any charity, followed by Imperial Cancer Research Fund, the Spastics Society and Barnados. The survey, by NGO Finance, a magazine for finance staff in the non-governmental sector, covered the most recent accounts of 2,760 shops run by 26 charities - there are estimated to be 4,671 shops run by 41 charities around the country. The most profitable shops were the Alzheimer's shop in Teesside, the Earl Mountbatten Hospice and Age Concern in Sevenoaks, Kent. This partly reflects low overheads because of the use of volunteer staff. Cash donations in shops made up just 1 per cent of income, with 85 per cent from donated goods and 14 per cent from bought-in goods. The information is particularly important because Sorp 2, the new draft recommended accounting standard for charities, will require trading operations to be consolidated into organisations' group accounts. A number of large charities did not respond to the survey, or provided incomplete information, including the National Trust, Age Concern, the British Red Cross and the Salvation Army. There was a wide range of accounting treatments adopted, with the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals charging against profits all capital expenditure in shops in the year in which it is made. Few shops provided information on return on capital employed or similar measures of performance.  ----------------------------------------------------- TEN MOST PROFITABLE CHARITY SHOPS  ----------------------------------------------------- Charity                          Net surplus Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------- Oxfam                                    18,312,000 Imperial Cancer Research Fund             6,631,000 Spastics Society                          4,584,000 Barnardo's                                2,721,848 Save the Children                         1,879,922 Children's Society                        1,077,000 Cancer Research Campaign                    858,000 British Heart Foundation                    842,000 Help the Aged                               697,000 Princess Alice Hospital                     408,117  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Central St Louis holds out against record flooding THE muddy floodwaters of the Mississippi River crested yesterday in St Louis, breaking flood records and swamping many of the city's outskirts but remaining five feet short of the giant floodwall protecting the central area. Although the worst of the floods seemed to have passed, rain continued to drench 12 Midwestern states on Sunday, and thunderstorms hit parts of Kansas, Minnesota, Ohio and Illinois yesterday. A quirk in the jetstream that usually drives weather systems from west to east across the continental US continues to block a cold front over the Midwest; there it meets a mass of hot and humid air from the south and east, producing rainfall that has remained above average for eight months. With the Mississippi, the Missouri and their swollen tributaries likely to remain flooded for weeks, the chances that more dams, earthworks and levees will give way are high. After submitting a Dollars 2.48bn (Pounds 1.65bn) aid bill to Congress last week, the Clinton administration has all but given up trying to put a cost on the damage until the rivers stabilise. Some informal estimates of the total property damage run as high as Dollars 15bn, although federal officials have warned that the victims should not expect the government to bail them out entirely. 'We have to caution the victims that these programmes are designed to try to get people back on their feet. There is no way that any federal programme is going to restore them to 100 per cent,' said Mr Leon Panetta, President Bill Clinton's budget director. Seven states have so far been declared federal disaster areas, but parts of another two states are expected to be designated soon for emergency aid. Members of Congress, however, are alarmed at demands from less-affected areas for federal money, as well as the claims of some eastern states that their heatwave qualifies them for drought assistance. 'If we turn this thing into a trough event, we're going to make deficit reduction impossible,' said Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.</p>

New techniques for parallel computers should  now make possible extensive optimizations in the planning and  production processes. Moreover, the Aachen firm Parsytec  Computer, Ltd., (Juelicher Strasse 338, 52070 Aachen) has formed  the Pamips (Parallel Mixed Integer Programming Systems)  consortium. It has been reported that, together with BASF [Baden  Anilin and Soda Factory], Inc., Ludwigshafen, Gesa, Palma de  Mallorca, and Dash, Coventry, as well as the Universities of  Buckingham, Heidelberg, and Leuven, these techniques are to be  used industrially. The developers expect to have the initial  results as soon as the beginning of 1994.    In industries with high production volumes that are  distributed among many individual products, efficiency depends  on the cost structure. A reduction in production costs can, for  example, be achieved through better use of raw materials as well  as better use of the means of production through minimization of  machines' service life. Another important factor in optimizing  production is firms' global organization with production sites  distributed worldwide. With them costs can be reduced through  deciding on a day-to-day basis where a given product is to be  produced on the most favorable terms. The prerequisite for this,  however, is consideration of the various costs for wages, raw  materials, energy, and shipping, as well as currency exchange  rates. These formulations are similar to those involved in  long-range planning for major investments in, for example, the  energy supply sector or commercial airlines. Costs can be cut  this way inasmuch as sound prognoses of needs, new products with  lengthy development periods, and the scheduling of fewer  expensive resources could be submitted. But up to now this too  has failed to materialize due to a lack of software and computer  power. In this area computer-supported production optimizations  and process simulations can only solve small parts of the  problem because of their traditional computer architecture.    What is required for this are discrete optimization  techniques that go far beyond the range of the classical "linear  programming approach" that stems from operation research.  Discrete, integral, binary, and semicontinuous variables have to  be included too in order to portray a discrete selection or  binary decisions in a model way. This is why for over five years  algorithms have been developed that make use of massive  parallelism. The goal of the Pamips consortium that has now been  formed is to for the first time solve major optimizaiton  problems of relevance to industry with the aid of massive  parallelism. Thefirms BASA and Gesa bring into the project  different ways of looking at unsolved problems and the know-how  to create models from the fields of chemistry and energy supply.  With its Xpress-MP product, Dash is one of the leading companies  in the optimization software market and provides the basis for  implementing the management of problems. New algorithms and  approahes to implementation have been developed at the  Universities of Buckingham, Heidelberg, and Leuven. The Aachen  firm Parsytec is assembling the hardware and software with the  North Rhine-Westphalia Center for Industrial Applications of  Massive Parallelism (ZIAM) and has taken over the marketing,  especially in Germany. The Pamips optimization method is soon to  be incorporated into the ESPRIT [European Strategic Program for  Information Technologies] project and provided with aid. The  parallelized version of the Xpress-MP should be available to  users for a test phase for the first time at the start of 1994  for Parsytec GC and XPlorer Computing.</p>

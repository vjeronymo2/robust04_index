			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second part of Ion Cristoiu editorial: "What Has Got Into </F> Mr. Corneliu Coposu?"]    [Text] As I was writing in the previous issue of our  newspaper, the statements made by Corneliu Coposu [leader of the  National Peasant Christian Democratic Party -- PNTCD] to the  effect that if the PNTCD comes to power it will modify the  Constitution and will reinstate the monarchy, caused great  bewilderment among politicians, a state that could be best  defined through the question: What has got into Mr. Corneliu  Coposu? Searching for an answer, the left-wing of our political  spectrum thought that this is perhaps a blow whose hidden  meanings are not yet known. Therefore, this side preferred to  adopt a position of prudent silence. However, Corneliu Coposu's  political friends interpreted this declaration as a gaffe. This  is also what the ROMANIA LIBERA editorial devoted to this issue  says, not without some sort of gentleness. Condemned as being  untimely, with serious consequences for the CDR [Democratic  Convention of Romania] the declaration is explained by the fact  that the PNTCD leader, an honest man, insisted on telling the  Romanian people "what the PNTCD has in mind if it comes to  power." Under the nicer aspect of this statement there is also  a deadly hidden thorn. The concealed reasoning is the  following. Coposu knew what disaster his declaration on  reinstating of monarchy would cause to the PNTCD and the  opposition in general. Nevertheless, without anybody forcing  him, he started, out of the blue, to state what the PNTCD will  do in the event it comes to power. And all this only because  he, unlike others, is an honest man. Why is this reasoning a  thorn in the nice aspect of the statement? Because it shows us  Coposu as a great personality when it comes to the moral aspect  of the issue, but infantile when we consider the political  aspect. Luckily, Coposu is far from the way the reasoning of  his friends wants to present him to us. Without any concessions  to the moral aspect of the issue, one has to admit that Coposu  is an experienced politician who is carefully weighing his moves  and statements. From this point of view, his statement  regarding the reinstatement of the monarchy in Romania is not a  gaffe, as some would have it, but the result of a rational  calculation. Through this statement, the PNTCD leader solves  several things.    First of all, he brings back the radical and inflexible  anti-government and anti-presidential position of the PNTCD that  the negotiations with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of  Romania] have seriously damaged. Nothing can separate the PNTCD  from the PDSR and from President Iliescu more than such a  categorical declaration regarding the restoration of the  monarchy. This is a point on which the ruling party and  President Ion Iliescu will never reach a compromise with any  party. Thus, Coposu's declaration is meant to reaffirm in a  spectacular way in the eyes of the electorate the fact that  between the PNTCD and those in power there is a huge gap. One  of the diversionary maneuvers used against the opposition was to  systematically release rumors about secret negotiations that the  PDSR and the presidency are holding with the PNTCD. Affirming  that the program of his party is based on the restoration of the  monarchy, Coposu makes it impossible for those in power to  resort to such maneuvers in the future. Likewise, this makes  impossible any attempt of the PDSR and of the presidency to  resume the masquerade of negotiations with the opposition.  Thus, strongly separated now from those in power, the PNTCD  insists on emphasizing more clearly than ever that the entire  responsibility for the disaster rests exclusively with those  currently in power.    Second, through his definite declaration, Coposu is  preparing  his party for the future elections. It is clear that the next  elections will be dominated by the idea of the need to change  the current state of affairs. Certainly, the parties will  propose to the electorate a radical solution that the Romanian  people has not met so far. No doubt, political parties will  propose all kinds of solutions to the electorate. The party  that is going to propose a radical solution that the Romanian  people has not met so far will have a chance to win. No doubt  this proposal will not be the reform, privatization, or return  to communism. Such solutions have already been expressed, with  the already known disastrous results. Therefore, the solution  that one could bet on, even if it involves certain risks, would  be the establishment of the monarchy. Apart from the fact that  it has not been applied so far, this solution has a few  important advantages: it is radical, since it presupposes a  total change of the current situation; it is simple to explain,  because it does not refer to very complicated economic  arguments, which are difficult to understand, but resorts to  political and sentimental arguments; and it is based on the  nostalgia of the Romanian people for the providential person  (the kings will come and solve everything!). It is possible  that the PNTCD leader is mistaken in his calculations. He might  be taking an enormous risk with this electoral program.  However, any risk is preferable to the disaster that the  opposition is currently facing.</p>

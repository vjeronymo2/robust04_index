			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sagindik Nuraliyev, Kazakhstan's trade attache in  Ankara, has clarified the oil pipeline project that will  transport Kazakhstan's oil. The Turkish newspapers have  frequently commented on the matter in the past few days.  Nuraliyev said: "Kazakhstan's oil will be transported to Europe  and other markets in the world through a pipeline that will  traverse Turkey."    Recalling that Kazakhstan markets its oil through a pipeline  to Novosibirsk in Russia, Nuraliyev asserted: "We do not have  time to wait. We have to sell our oil. Novosibirsk is not an  alternative."    Stressing that the oil pipeline to Novosibirsk, which  crosses  through Astrakhan, needs to be modernized, Nuraliyev said the  decision to repair and renovate that pipeline was made before  the project for the second pipeline was considered. Nuraliyev  also denied Turkish press reports that "Russia has been allowed  to decide on the new project." He said: "The second pipeline,  which will carry Kazakhstan's oil through Turkey to  international markets, is a significant project this requires  significant expertise. Meanwhile, a decision has to be made on  the route of the pipeline."</p>

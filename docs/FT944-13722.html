			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Matsushita rises 26% at halfway Matsushita, the Japanese consumer electronics maker, reported a 26 per cent rise in non-consolidated recurring profits in the six months to September and said that full-year results would be better than it had expected. Recurring profits, before extraordinary items and tax, increased to Y37.4bn (Dollars 385m) from Y29.7bn a year ago, helped by strong sales of air conditioners during an unusually hot Japanese summer and buoyant demand in overseas markets. The dividend is held at Y6.25. The profits rise came on higher sales of Y2,204bn, against Y2,148bn last time, which the company achieved in spite of the sharp rise in the yen and sluggish economic activity in Japan. Operating profits nearly doubled to Y23bn, compared with Y11.7bn previously. Sales for the full year to next March are expected to rise 2 per cent to Y4,420bn instead of Y4,320bn. Recurring profits are forecast to reach Y85bn, up 33 per cent, and net profits are expected to be Y50bn, or 16 per cent up. However, this compares with recurring profits of Y276bn in fiscal 1990. Most of the company's main product divisions showed a slight increase in sales in the latest period, with home consumer products - such as air conditioners, washing machines and refrigerators - recording the biggest rise of 10 per cent. The information equipment division also saw stronger demand particularly for cellular phones, home facsimile machines and CD-Rom drives. However, Matsushita's traditional audio-visual businesses continued to suffer a big fall in sales as consumers turned to cheaper televisions, videos and audio systems, many of which are made overseas. The group was particularly hurt by sharp declines in audio-visual equipment prices, Matsushita said. Prices of some products had fallen about 15 per cent in the video market and 20 per cent in the audio market. Video sales were down 14 per cent and sales of colour televisions were flat, in spite of the popularity of wide-screen televisions. Audio equipment sales fell 4 per cent. Matsushita continued to suffer the adverse impact of the yen's appreciation against the US dollar, which trimmed Y12bn off profits. As a result of the yen's appreciation, cost savings of Y12bn in the audio-visual divisions were more or less wiped out, the company indicated. Overall, however, Matsushita was able to make cost savings of Y28bn through rationalisation efforts.</p>

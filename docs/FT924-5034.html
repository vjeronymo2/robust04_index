			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Markets: Irish investors do well out of poll turmoil - At a Glance Irish investors have done very well out of the nation's turmoil of the last few weeks. While the country went to the polls foreign exchange dealers decided that the punt was overvalued, forcing short-term interest rates to apparently unsustainable levels. All that uncertainty might have been expected to hit shares. But instead, the market rallied by 6.68 per cent in a week after a very poor year. Dealers wanted a devaluation, assumed it would take place, and priced stocks accordingly. Remember on Black Wednesday, just before the UK left the exchange rate mechanism when base rates hit 15 per cent, the FT-SE actually rose by 8.3 points.</p>

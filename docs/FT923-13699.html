			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Noriega given 40 years' jail THE FORMER military ruler of Panama, General Manuel Antonio Noriega, who was arrested on drug-trafficking charges after the US invasion of his country in 1989, was sentenced to 40 years in US prison in Miami last night. The sentence brings to an end a trial which lasted more than half a year, cost the US government millions of dollars to prosecute, and raised questions about US policy on the war on drugs in Central America. Gen Noriega is the first ruler of a foreign country ever sentenced by a US court. He was sentenced to two concurrent 20-year terms under two counts of the indictment, which charged him with conspiring with members of the Medelln cocaine cartel to ship cocaine from Colombia via Panama to the US. The balance of the general's 40-year sentence is based on convictions on six other charges involving specific actions taken to support the conspiracy. Before the sentence was imposed, the general gave a long speech in which he claimed that Presidents Bush and Reagan sought to reverse the 1977 Panama-US treaty, which calls for a US withdrawal from Panama and the Canal Zone in 1999, and said the real reason for his indictment and trial was that 'I was the obstacle to obtaining military bases in the (Panama) canal in perpetuity. I was the obstacle to dismembering the treaty.' The general made a number of specific charges against US officials, including claims that some had at one point sought to have the Shah of Iran killed by Panamanian doctors in order to win the release of US hostages in Tehran and that Mr Reagan's national security adviser, Admiral John Poindexter, demanded that Panama provide a pretext for US armed intervention in Nicaragua. Before imposing the sentence, federal district judge William Hoeveler said that, despite the general's claim that the prosecution was politically motivated, 'the politics of this case were not a part of this case. 'The real reason we are here today is that a jury of 12 men and women had decided that the charges were true beyond a reasonable doubt.'</p>

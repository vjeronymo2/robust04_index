			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Virtual actors turn to animation First there was virtual memory, then there was virtual reality. Now there is the virtual actor, a way of enabling computer-generated characters to move and behave in the same way as humans by sending information directly to the animated character from a live actor. Up to 16 sensors are placed over the actor's hands, face and body. As he or she moves, the movement and speech are mirrored exactly by the computerised character. Developed in the US by SimGraphics and sold in the UK by Televirtual, V Actor was first used in the UK by the BBC to create Ratz, an animated cat which presents children's television programmes.

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: How falling funds sank the greedy stags - Speculators intended to make a killing from investment trust launches this year. Instead, says Bethan Hutton, they have taken a beating The investment trust stags who bounded into action at the peak of the recent market surge in new issues may be feeling bruised and bewildered. All but a handful of the trusts launched this year are trading now at less than their issue price, and the few that have risen were not issues that attracted many private investors. Stags are a top-of-the-market phenomenon: they buy new issues intending to unload them at a profit in the first few days of trading. They were out in force for the launches earlier this year of the two biggest new investment trusts yet: the Kleinwort European Privatisation trust, which raised Pounds 500m, and the Mercury European Privatisation fund, which raised Pounds 575m. Many private investors developed a taste for stagging when British Telecom, British Gas and the others were privatised in the 1980s. The government was keen for the issues to do well, so the shares were priced very cheaply. People snapped them up - and a large number unloaded them immediately, making handsome profits. Perhaps it was the word 'privatisation' in the titles that made people think the Kleinwort and Mercury funds could be stagged. Perhaps it was just that the last few trusts hyped to the same extent went to a premium as soon as they started trading. In any case, a surprising number of investors seem to have thought they could outwit the market and make a quick profit on these two trusts. They were wrong. The problem with stagging investment trusts is that, generally, when you buy shares in one that has just been launched, these are not backed by assets - unlike the flotation of BT and the rest. There is only the cash put up by you and other investors, less the expenses of making the issue - often about 4 per cent. So, for every Pounds 1 of shares you buy, you end up on the first day of trading with a piece of paper backed by 96p in cash. There can be no pricing anomalies. It is, of course, possible occasionally to stag an investment trust issue successfully. When an issue is oversubscribed heavily, shares shoot to a premium as investors whose applications were scaled back scramble to buy more on the open market. The Kleinwort trust was oversubscribed massively - Pounds 360m of investors' money was turned away - but its near-identical twin, the Mercury fund, was following close behind and mopping up the overflowing funds. By the time both trusts hit the market, most people who wanted shares had got them already. The timing was also impeccably awful. The public offer for the Kleinwort fund spanned the peak of the surge when investors were pouring money into new trusts at an unprecedented rate. But the first day of trading in the shares was February 9 - the week that a US interest rate rise rattled world markets. And the Mercury shares came to market a month later when the climate was distinctly chillier. Subscribers to the Kleinwort trust who were very quick off the mark and sold within the first few days might just have made a profit after allowing for dealing costs. But any stag greedy (or optimistic) enough to hold on a little longer, hoping that the share price would take an upward turn, has been disappointed. Later sellers would certainly have made a loss. Would-be stags of the Mercury fund did not stand a chance: packages of shares and warrants opened at a slight discount and slid further. The discount on the Kleinwort shares is exaggerated by their part-paid structure. Investors had to pay only 250p up front for a package of five shares and a warrant, with the remaining 250p due in August. The shares were trading this week at 38p and the warrants at 31.25p, so 221.25p for the package - a discount of 11.5 per cent on the issue price. The cash discount - 28.75p - would probably be similar if the full 500p had been paid, making it smaller in percentage terms - about 5.75 per cent. Timing is all-important. One of the most popular new investment trust issues earlier in the market surge was the Fleming Chinese fund. It went to an immediate premium, so early sellers made a profit. The share price zoomed upwards until the Hong Kong stock market caught a cold, and has since come back to around the issue price. At one stage, if you had sold shares in Fleming Chinese after buying them in the public offer, you would have made a profit of more than 50 per cent. But if you held on, you would now be back where you started. Discounts The average investment trust discount hit its narrowest point in January and has widened since (see graph). But it is still very narrow by the standards of the past few years. Early in the 1980s, discounts of 25 or 30 per cent were common. The shifting level of investment trust discounts tends to magnify the effect of any market changes. In a rising market, a share's asset value will increase, more people want to buy it and its discount narrows, adding to the profits. When the market turns down, asset values drop and people want to sell - so the discount widens and losses expand. Take, for example, a share with a net asset value of 100p that is trading at 95p, a discount of 5 per cent. If the underlying market falls by 10 per cent, the asset value is likely also to fall by a similar amount, to 90p. If the discount remains steady at 5 per cent, the share would then sell for 85.5p - a loss of 9.5p, or 10 per cent. But if, as is likely, the discount widened at the same time to, say, 10 per cent, the share would then be priced at 81p - a loss of 14p, or 14.7 per cent. So those who bought emerging markets' investment trusts at a premium before many of the Far Eastern markets took a tumble will now be affected not only by the loss in asset value but also by the shift from premium to discount. The point to remember is that this is a two-way process - what goes down can go back up, and down, and up again. But then, no one ever promised a smooth ride to investors in any stock market, particularly emerging markets. Opportunities Nigel Sidebottom, a private client fund manager with stockbroker Gerrard Vivian Gray, says: 'I think what this sort of shake-out shows is that investment trusts can be more volatile when markets are contracting. You can get not only asset values dropping but discounts widening - but that can throw up opportunities for the fleet of foot.' As for opportunities now, he recommends some of the emerging-market trusts which have lost their long-standing premiums, and also the Lloyd's trusts - relative newcomers which invest in the Lloyd's insurance market and have fallen back recently. But random movements in a volatile market mean that other opportunities can spring up for short periods if you keep your eyes open. Reality has now returned to the investment trust market. New issues continue to appear, but they are raising more modest amounts of money and having to work harder to get it. More are falling short of their targets (see table). A calming-down period, and some time for the market to absorb the new money, can only be healthy. Long-term investors seeking value are no longer priced out of the market. And the stags can retreat to lick their wounds until the next market surge.  ----------------------------------------------------------------                NEW TRUSTS LAUNCHED IN 1994  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Trust name                        Target            Actual                                 Pounds m          Pounds m  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Abtrust High Income                   40              30.5 Central Euro Growth Fund    dollars 200m              200m Edinburgh Inca                        95                39 Edinburgh New Tiger               50-100               140 Fidelity Japanese Values             25+               105 Fleming Euro Fledgeling               50              14.7 F&amp;C Income Growth                     50                43 F&amp;C Private Equity                    20                25 Gartmore British                      50              58.5 Herald                                25                65 Israel Fund                 dollars 200m              153m Kleinwort Euro Privatisation         40+               500 Mercury Euro Privatisation           50+               575 Mithras                               20                 5 Morgan Grenfell Lat America          125                64 Piper European Smaller                50                10 Saracen Value                         50                37 Schroder UK Growth                   50+               117 Taiwan                                30                45  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source:AITC/SG Warburg/FT  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

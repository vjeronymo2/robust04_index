			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFEAT OF LIQUOR TAX PROPOSITIONS  </P> <P> So the "nickel-a-drink" tax was defeated and now the county-run mental health  clinics may have to cut $42 million in programs.  </P> <P> This is such an absurd way to get funding for mental health clinics by taxing  all of those who enjoy an occasional cocktail, beer or glass of wine. County  health programs should be supported by taxpayers in general and not just by  those who enjoy alcohol. Why didn't they simply place a proposition on the  ballot that was designed to help fund county health programs? Maybe if they  would have been straight about it, they would have gotten their funding.  </P> <P> KAREN RAE, Santa Monica  </P></p>

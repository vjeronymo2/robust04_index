			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: A Shaw plans sale and leaseback Arthur Shaw &amp; Company has announced the sale and leaseback of premises in the West Midlands to Stepvale. Shaw's chief executive and chairman have connections with Stepvale. Accordingly shareholders' approval will be sought at an extraordinary meeting on August 24, when a capital reorganisation will be considered. The sale has been agreed at Pounds 525,000 cash, and is expected to enable Shaw to repay more than Pounds 500,000 to Midland Bank. The plans to reorganise the share capital, which is currently 8.76m ordinary shares at 10p each, consist of a 2-for-1 subdivision and a 2-for-1 capitalisation issue. This would result in 35m ordinary shares of 5p each in issue.</p>

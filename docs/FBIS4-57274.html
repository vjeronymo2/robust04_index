			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont by Santiago </F> Pedraglio; place and date not given: "Belmont Speaks Out"]    [Text] [Pedraglio] You have stated that the executive  branch is killing Lima, that never has so much harm been done to  the city.... Do you reaffirm this view?    [Belmont] Yes, I reaffirm my statements. Taken out of  context, their terms may sound very confrontational; but within  the context of an explanation, each has its logic.    [Pedraglio] Do you believe that without funds of its own  Lima's municipality can carry out projects by simply  coordinating with the district authorities, as the central  government representatives asserted in rationalizing DL 776?    [Belmont] According to the government representatives,  something that has been working rather well--and the proof is  that I was elected to continue carrying out works projects--does  not work. They say that it is not technical and that it is not  fair because it does not distribute the benefits equitably...and  they pull a figure out of a hat, wave it, then clam up. They  practically issue the order to dynamite Lima. It is, as I term  it, the biggest of all attempts, one that nobody can justify.  And now, everyone has grown silent. They accuse me of pursuing  electoral ends. But no one can defend stripping a municipal  administration's budget of 44,887,900 soles, by a mere stroke of  the pen.    [Pedraglio] That is a reduction from 64 million soles to 19  million, as I read it.    [Belmont] In one round. And from 144,359,000 for the  Invermet  project I have been slashed to 17 million, also in one round.  Half of that 144 million was to have been invested in new urban  settlements.    [Pedraglio] Why do you think Fujimori supported your  candidacy a year ago?    [Belmont] Fujimori did not support me. Fujimori had a  candidate named Pablo Gutierrez. When the results of the polls  were submitted to Fujimori--the same polls also rated me--Pablo  Gutierrez was summoned to the Government House and told, "You  must withdraw." Pablo Gutierrez asked, "Why?" And the answer  was, "Because you are going to lose." The Administration had  decided to pull its candidate out of the race so as to not be on  the losing side. It had begun comparing the views of the two  contenders. Those views obviously gave it the answer it was  seeking, a week or 10 days in advance, as to which of the two  was likely to win.    [Pedraglio] Do you believe that the executive branch's  behavior--including that of the president, of course--is owing  to its viewing you as a potential adversary in the 1996  presidential elections?    [Belmont] That is plain as day to the taxi drivers, the  household help in the homes I visit, the civil construction  workers...and even to the kids. They are all aware that Fujimori  is jealous of anyone who could overshadow him. In Lima, he never  got more than 26 percent of the vote, and in each of two  elections I have scored 48 percent.    [Pedraglio] The government has said that the bulk of  available funding has heretofore been centralized in Lima to the  detriment of the rest of the country's municipalities, and that  its intent is to decentralize those funds so as to benefit the  small districts, the little urban centers. What is your view of  this argument?    [Belmont] I have already said, on one occasion--laughing at  that attitude--that this was the national dirty-tricks  government, the leg-puller of all of us Peruvians who have seen  history unfurl before us and who have lived it and taken part in  it.    Lima's municipality is not a rich one. It is a very poor  one.  Its budget is one twentieth that of Bogota. As a candidate,  Pablo Gutierrez said, "If I am elected mayor, I shall have money  to provide water, electricity, and sewers, and to finish the  Santa Anita market, and I shall complete more construction  projects than all the other previous mayors together." One can  legitimately wonder whether, had he won, the government would  have acted in the same way.    [Pedraglio] Do you regret having taken a favorable position  on 5 April toward Fujimori's decision to dissolve Parliament,  and toward everything else he did?    [Belmont] I must again point out that memories are very  faulty. I issued a statement approved by Lima's Metropolitan  Council in which I deplored the break with the constitutional  order and earnestly hoped for its early restoration. But  interviews taking on a political turn, as they sometimes do, the  next question was, "What do you think of Parliament?" I answered  that Parliament was a disaster, good for nothing, in the  belief--shared by thousands of Peruvians--that a democratic  Parliament would be created within the shortest possible time,  that would be much closer to the people, more austere, and more  dynamic. That is what I urged.    And this I will admit: I believed in the good faith of the  government. I understood the government's position because I  have my own municipal parliament to deal with. And as it is  designed, the city's "executive branch," the mayor, is unable to  function unless he is backed by a majority and a consensus. The  city retrogressed badly during my initial term, because of the  considerable resistance I encountered in the "municipal  parliament." I could see that I, too, would have welcomed a  change in the municipal parliamentary structure; but, as written  and published in all the newspapers of 23 April 1992, I was  never in agreement with the break away from the constitutional  order.    But I did believe in President Fujimori. I acknowledge that.  I saw in him a man who was acting pragmatically in areas in  which I would have done the same.    [Pedraglio] In which areas, for example?    [Belmont] In that of social reinsertion, in  privatization--but not in the way he has now done it. That way  is not the most elegant, to say the least.    [Pedraglio] At what point were you no longer convinced of  the  government's orientation? At what point did you say "this is not  working?"    [Belmont] When he won his second election. Because I noted  that the government became very touchy about my very high  standing in the polls. The government was already cooking up his  reelection, but I did not know that. No one knew it.    Then they started talking about a new Constitution. I did  not  lean toward a yes. Instead, I published a very harsh commentary  that leaned toward a no. I maintained an impartial position as a  mayor, but from a municipal viewpoint, I pointed out the reasons  that put all local governments at risk. It was at that point  that I realized the danger of the octopus.    [Pedraglio] You had a critical opinion of the previous  Parliament. Do you believe that the present one is better?    [Belmont] No. It is worse. That is why I am frustrated. This  is a Parliament designed to have Fujimori reelected, so that he  can push through the laws he chooses to. It is simply a  Parliament of puppets. The opposition is painted on the walls.  And I feel that I was mistaken in putting too much faith in the  people.    [Pedraglio] Do you think Fujimori is going to easily  relinquish power in 1995?    [Belmont] No. It is going to be very difficult. It has been  very well thought out. One who intends to run a clean election,  as president, answers the questions asked by the press. But he  does not mock, he does not go around acting like an adolescent,  he does not delegate whatever is not to his advantage, he does  not inaugurate things, day after day, that are beneath the  dignity of a president.... There is only one player on the  stage. In my view, the drug of power has converted him into an  addict who has no intention of abjuring what I call the morphine  of power.    [Pedraglio] You have said that you are not going to run for  office. In sports terms: Is this a feint or for real?    [Belmont] No, no, no. This is for real. I do not intend to  stand. But I do intend to remain in my role as the elected mayor  and defend the municipal charter to the bitter end.    It is only since I became a potential candidate that I have  had all these problems. Between 1990 and 1993, the president  lauded my works projects. He consistently complimented me. He  would ask me, "How do you do it, Ricardo?" He would accompany me  to view them. But at the most recent project inauguration, to  which I invited him--and, I might say, his name has figured on  all the dedication plaques; I was not interested in having my  name figure on them--I noted in his gaze that he was already  seeking a candidate for Lima.    He had told me on many occasions that he saw no other  candidate who could compete with me, with so many public works.  But a month and a half before elections, he telephoned me at  home to give me orders, to tell me that I must rescind some  specified taxes because he was not in agreement with them. I  replied: "Mr. President, I am the mayor. I am grateful for your  suggestion, but leave it to me to decide." He did not like that,  and in one blow he annulled one of the vehicle taxes I was about  to announce. At that point I realized that the president wanted  to govern Lima.    Subsequently, I submitted the bill of a new organic law of  municipalities to him that would enable Lima to operate under  the next mayor to be elected. At that time, it was not my  intention to stand, but I did feel that whoever did stand should  have the easements that I did not have. He received the bill,  thanked me for it, and in the end I believe he must have said to  himself, "I am going to implement this plan without Belmont." I  thanked him for his frankness....    [Pedraglio] Why?    [Belmont] He suggested to me that I withdraw, that I not run  for election. I had told him, "Mr. President, I am an  independent...."    [Pedraglio] When did that happen?    [Belmont] About two months before the elections; more or  less  in November 1992. He was very courteous to me in this regard.  But he already wanted to control all areas.    [Pedraglio] When you spoke of supporting an independent  candidate, did you have in mind Perez de Cuellar?    [Belmont] He is the man who could beat the president, on the  basis of a very precisely detailed governing platform that would  deliver what it promised.    [Pedraglio] What would you consider the basic lines of a  government platform?    [Belmont] First, an economic program. One cannot promise to  deliver an antishock economy and proceed to deliver a shock  instead, an economy that has forgotten the mass sectors and has  made the rich richer and the poor poorer. The program would all  have to be studied by a team of economists, in order to tell the  Peruvians, the many unemployed and the many underemployed, that  from the day the next party takes office, the rules of the game  will be these, and will not change.    The platform would also provide that whoever takes office as  head of the government and fails to keep his or her word will  fare as the presidents of other countries do. They must resign  immediately for having lied to the people. A president's lie in  the Middle East, and in the United States as well, entails his  immediate resignation. Here, instead, presidents, members of  Parliament, politicians, lie, but they complain when a political  group commits an act--which I do not justify-in the face of  powerlessness stemming from so many lies. The liars themselves  are the root cause of such occurrences, because they have lied  so much. That is all there is to it.    [Pedraglio] Of the independents, today, Perez de Cuellar  appears to be the best positioned, objectively speaking.    [Belmont] Basically, I do not believe in polls.    [Pedraglio] Thus, I could not infer that if you were to  support an independent capable of beating Fujimori, Perez de  Cuellar would be your best choice as of today.    [Belmont] Perez de Cuellar is one of this country's highly  eminent assets. Peru would immediately gain international  respect and that of all the Peruvians, for what he represents.  But I would not be part of the ticket, nor would I accept a  position in the government. On the contrary, I would announce my  retirement from Peruvian politics. That says it all.    [Pedraglio] But could you, as you have stated it, support  him?    [Belmont] I would support the ideas posited by Mario Vargas  Llosa, as I did in his time. I have been frank enough to say,  "Gentlemen, if I were president I would do what Vargas Llosa has  said he will accomplish." He had an emergency social platform,  he was initiating a serious privatization process, he was  opening the economy to a free-market one.... That platform was  supported by three master beams which I applauded.    What we Peruvians need at this stage is to agree on a master  plan. But I would like for the person who assumes responsibility  for its implementation, as the representative of those  majorities--and I do not want to be that person; I sincerely  believe that I am not cut out for these things; I have given six  years of my life to public service and I now want to return to  my own work, my business affairs, my personal life, for strictly  family reasons--but I would like that person to be one of known  qualifications, not a new arrival, appearing from one day to the  next with rabbits under his hat, inventing government along the  way. I would like that person to be one who is prepared to  accept a serious commitment to the country and to the solution  of the problems that we all see and that have not been resolved  for the past many years.    And the person best meeting these conditions is Perez de  Cuellar, because of his record. I would like to see him  representing Peru so as to bring dirty-tricks government to an  end.    [Pedraglio] It is said that you are trapped by the Channel  11  thing, and that if you were to run for election, your opponents  would bring out some things....    [Belmont] Then, let them bring them out once and for all.  There is no dirt. On the contrary, I have proven to be an  entrepreneur who builds his enterprise on the basis of human  capital, with a broad stockholder base in which 70,000 persons  participate, who invests all of his money in fixed assets that  today are enabling Channel 11 to transmit and compete  head-on--not as a monopoly--with the television monsters, which  have lost much more money than Channel 11 has lost. On the  contrary, the government should reward me for having survived  two crises: that of Alan Garcia and that of Fujimori, with its  brutal recession that has forced the sale of one of the biggest  television enterprises, Channel 4, to the Mexicans, because  Channel 4 could no longer survive. Channel 11, on the other  hand, with all its faults and mistakes, has made no profit, but  it is solid as a rock because it owes nothing to anyone, and  because its economic base is entirely shipshape.    [Pedraglio] Is the enterprise's relationship with that broad  base of shareholders really operative?    [Belmont] Of course it is. We hold stockholders meetings. We  hold them publicly. The problem is that in this country, success  is prohibited. Channel 11 is always present on the screen. It  has never gone dark in its seven years on the air. Moreover, I  would not have been elected if I were a swindler, a man who had  defrauded his contingency. I have 70,000 partners, and if we  multiply each family by five... If I have won the elections that  I have, it is because my partners voted for me, as did others  who were not partners, of course. Furthermore, I am certain that  if I issue a new block of shares in Channel 11, the number of my  partners will exceed 1 million.    [Pedraglio] What is the basis of the suit that you have  announced will be brought by the municipality against the  government?    [Belmont] My lawyers are looking into it. It is the first  case of this type, in which government sues government.  Generally speaking, throughout history, the government has been  a great ally of the mayor. My team of lawyers, accredited by the  Lima Bar Association, is presently studying the legal aspects of  the action.</p>

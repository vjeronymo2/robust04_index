About one-third of this group described sums  ranging from $100,000 to $300,000 as appropriate compensation.  The poll also reveals that about 6 percent of them have looked  into possibilities of leaving, such as jobs and housing. Our  correspondent Shula Schmerling reports that the telephone poll  was conducted among approximately 300 Golan settlers.</p>

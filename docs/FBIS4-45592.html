Children, some only eight years old, had been suspended for  pushing drugs, the National Association of Head Teachers'  conference was told. Delegates in Eastbourne called for  government action to warn the young about the dangers of drugs.    Martin Saunders, headmaster of a Stoke-on-Trent primary  school, said that half the city's secondary schools had  suspended pupils for drugs offences. He said children could buy  cannabis for &pound;15 to &pound;20, heroin for &pound;5 to  &pound;10, a tab  of Ecstasy for &pound;12 and "speed" for &pound;5. "It is  cheaper than  getting drunk. For many young people who go out at the weekend,  drug-taking is as common as having a drink."    Derek Gray, another head teacher in Stoke, said schools were  reluctant to admit they had a drug problem. Mr Gray told of a  boy who started sniffing lighter fuel at the age of 11, before  turning to hard drugs. He died, aged 19, of a heart infection.    At the conference, David Hart, the general secretary, called  for 22,000 extra teachers to be employed to halt the increase in  class sizes and to implement changes in the national curriculum.  Almost a quarter of pupils were now in classes of more than 30,  he said. He criticised the National Union of Teachers for its  boycott of national testing.     -  A study of East Yorkshire has discovered that children in  the countryside are using drugs produced for pigs and some are  experimenting with a sedative given to animals with mad cow  disease. One Lincolnshire addict said the drugs "are more  available than street illegal drugs."     TIMES NEWSPAPERS LIMITED, 1994</p>

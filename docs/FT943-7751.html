			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / International Company News: Indonesian cement group ahead 77% PT Semen Cibinong, Indonesia's second-largest cement producer, increased unaudited net income by 77 per cent to Rp14.2bn (Dollars 6.6m) in the six months ended June, compared with a year earlier. The performance was underpinned by active construction and cement demand and last year's acquisition of Semen Nusantara. Net sales jumped almost 75 per cent to Rp224bn, while earnings per share rose 31 per cent to Rp156. 'The results reflect the early benefits of the consolidated marketing and operations of Semen Cibinong and Semen Nusantara,' president Mr Hashim S. Djodohadikusomo said. Semen Cibinong bought Nusantara in July last year. It is the only cement company with production facilities in central Java, one of Indonesia's fastest growing areas.</p>

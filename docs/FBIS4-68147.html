			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 14 May (NOTIMEX) -- The Army has  revealed that it found at least five remote-controlled bombs,  which guerrillas planned to set off today against the helicopter  of Santander Department Governor Juan Carlos Duarte. According  to the military report, the bombs had been planted by the rebels  on the runway at the terminal area of Malaga, located some 370  km from Santa Fe de Bogota. Governor Duarte and his entourage  were scheduled to land in Malaga.    According to Army sources, after the bombs were detected in  Malaga, authorities decided to divert Duarte's plane. The  source added that five suspects were captured in connection with  this failed action.    The Simon Bolivar National Guerrilla Coordinating Board  [CNGSB], made up of 12,000 combatants, is engaged in an  offensive to hinder the 29 May presidential elections. As a  result, the incident in Malaga has not been ruled out to be  associated with the sabotage campaign by the CNGSB. The report  indicates that the Army of National Liberation -- a CNGSB group  -- operates in the Garcia Rovira area, where the attempt against  Duarte was planned.    Duarte, who was preparing to inaugurate various social  welfare projects in the area, said that despite the failed  attempt, he will continue touring the department. Santander is  among the most unstable departments nationwide.    According to the source, the Army arrested four guerrillas  and seized weapons and political propaganda in Antioquia  Department during operations to guarantee normal elections on 29  May.    The CNGSB two years ago chose not to participate in peace  negotiations held by the government of President Cesar Gaviria  in Tlaxcala, Mexico because of disagreements on the agenda to be  discussed.</p>

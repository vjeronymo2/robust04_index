			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> PACIFIC BALLOON CROSSING PLANNED  </P> <P> Pop music tycoon Richard Branson announced ambitious plans today to make the  last great balloon crossing -- a nonstop voyage across the Pacific Ocean in the  biggest hot-air balloon ever built.  </P> <P> Branson, whose attempt to fly a balloon across the Atlantic in 1987 ended when  he was forced to ditch in the Irish Sea, said the 6,200-mile crossing is  ballooning's last great challenge.  </P> <P> "The only place left to have a go at is the Pacific. It is double the length of  the Atlantic and, in ballooning terms, it is the last great challenge," he told  a news conference.  </P> <P> Branson's balloon, Pacific Flier, is 200 feet tall and has been under  construction in secret for the last 18 months.  </P> <P> It will take off from southern Japan about Nov. 15 and ride 210-m.p.h. winds at  an altitude of about 33,000 feet. It is expected to land on the West Coast of  the United States four or five days later.  </P></p>

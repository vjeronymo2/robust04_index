			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bido Zeqiri: "What Does Mr. Rugova Mean by the </F> Word `Aggression'?"]    [Text] Every patriot and honest Albanian, wherever he  lives and works, follows with painful concern the events in  Kosovo, and it seems to us unfounded and illogical when Mr.  Rugova places all his hopes of liberation on external forces.  Here is what he said in a recent interview to the newspaper  REPUBLIKA: "President Clinton and his administration will not  tolerate conflicts or any Serbian aggression against Kosova."  We would like to ask Mr. Rugova: What does he mean by  aggression against Kosova, when the virtual aggression against  Kosova that was perpetrated long ago in this area still  mercilessly continues? Is it not aggression when your schools  are closed, your university is closed, you are dismissed from  your job, your academy is shut down, and your newspapers, radio  and television stations, etc., are closed? Is it not aggression  when the Serbian police, armed to the teeth, conduct  house-to-house searches, terrorizing the Kosovars, beating them  up and torturing them without the slightest mercy? Finally, is  it not aggression when Serbian tanks and guns are patrolling the  roads of Kosova towns?    It is difficult to admit, Mr. Rugova, that the U.S.  Administration knows nothing about these things. It is also  very difficult to say that this Administration does not know  what aggression means. Should we perhaps expect the criminal  Arkan to put into practice his plan of ejecting 700,000 Kosovars  from their homeland?    It seems to us that in his recent interview, Mr. Rugova  tried  to conceal something. When Mrs. Edlira Bucpapaj asked the  honorable Mr. Rugova about Douglas Hogg's visit to Prishtina, he  failed to mention that Mr. Hogg called Kosova "Serbian  territory."    Thus, the U.S. Administration is waiting for the Serbs to  carry out aggression against Kosova when the Serbs are already  there, and Britain's Mr. Hogg argues that "Kosova must be viewed  as Serbian territory." The following question then arises:  What should the Kosovars do? Should they plead with the Serbs  for mercy?</p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Observer: TV soft-sell Why is Sir David Frost monopolising the cream of Britain's political talent for his new Sunday morning TV show? First the prime minister, then the leader of the opposition, and now the chancellor of the exchequer. One by one they have made themselves available to be interviewed by the newly knighted Frostie, before most people are awake Norman Lamont escaped from yesterday's near 45-minute encounter without so much as a graze. He had no problem ducking tricky issues such as whether he should be taxed on the help he got paying his legal bills, or the circumstances under which he would resign. At least Frost didn't feed the bird-watching chancellor soft questions about the Braer disaster. But then again, there was a marked lack of grilling about unemployment, which will soon top the 3m mark. Perhaps Britain's politicians have learnt something from the recent US presidential election campaign where candidates made a point of avoiding the tough TV interviewers, preferring to submit themselves to the persiflage of chat-show hosts. That being so, it would be sad if seasoned TV-types such as Jeremy Paxman, Brian Walden and Jonathan Dimbleby were henceforth relegated to interviewing political has-beens.</p>

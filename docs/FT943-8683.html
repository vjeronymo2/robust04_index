			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Observer: Idaho . . .the pot state Northwest Airlines is flying high. Or at least one of its co-chairmen has been. Returning from a rafting holiday in Idaho, Gary Wilson was passing through the security screening point at Boise airport when he was apprehended by security officials puzzled by an X-ray image of an oddly-shaped object in his bag. On close examination, the object turned out to be a kind of pipe, and with it were 2.7 grams of marijuana. The red-faced Wilson was fined Dollars 500 and, on reporting back to Northwest Airlines' head office in St Paul, Minnesota, suspended himself from duty pending an internal inquiry. In all probability, he will soon be back at his desk. After all, he is more of an investor than an executive; with Alfred Checchi, the other co-chairman, he led a Dollars 3.6bn buy-out of Northwest in 1989 which took the airline private. Also, he was off duty at the time, and the airline says that other employees committing comparable misdemeanours have stayed. Even so, the turn of events has astonished Northwest's staff. Wilson is 54, so hardly falls into the category of the Woodstock generation. 'He's the last person you would suspect. He's such a button-down, senior type of person,' said one employee. 'It just goes to show; you never can tell . . .' Come to think of it, has anyone inspected Sir Colin Marshall's hand-baggage recently?</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RETAIL SALES UP SLIM 0.1% IN MARCH AFTER SHARP FEB. DECLINE  </P> <P> Retail sales, held back by sluggish business at car dealerships and department  stores, edged up a slim 0.1% in March after posting a sharp decline during the  previous month, the government reported today.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said sales rose to a seasonally adjusted $139.42  billion last month after falling 0.6% in February and rising 0.6% in January.  The figures are not adjusted to exclude the effects of rising prices.  </P> <P> For the third straight month, overall sales in March were held down by a  decline in spending on autos, which account for almost one-fourth of the retail  total. Car sales were down 0.1% in March after declining 2.5% in February and  1.9% in January.  </P> <P> It was the first time that auto sales had declined for three straight months  since July through September, 1984, when the decreases were more pronounced.  </P> <P> Car makers in recent weeks have launched a new round of incentive programs in  hopes of luring customers back to showrooms during the prime spring selling  season despite higher interest rates for loans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Closely Watched  </P> <P> Excluding the automotive category, retail sales last month still were up just  0.2% after holding virtually even during February and rising 1.4% in January.  </P> <P> Retail spending accounts for about one-third of overall economic activity and  is closely watched as a measure of the economy's health.  </P> <P> Many analysts are expecting an economic slowdown this year in response to an  ongoing campaign by the Federal Reserve Board to push up interest rates and  thus dampen demand and restrain inflation.  </P> <P> In the key category of department and other general merchandise stores, sales  fell 1.2% in March to $15.6 billion after declining 1.5% in February.  </P> <P> In a separate report earlier this month, the nation's big retailers reported  mixed March results, with giant Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. reporting strong sales  under its new competitive pricing policy while other chains were less pleased  with last month's showing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Big Ticket' Items Down  </P> <P> Overall, sales of durable goods, "big ticket" items expected to last three or  more years, were down 0.2% last month after plunging 1.7% in February.  </P> <P> Sales of non-durable goods, meanwhile, rose 0.3% in March after climbing 0.2%  during the previous month.  </P> <P> Among the categories of goods to report sales increases last month were: food  and grocery stores, up 0.2%; gasoline service stations, up 0.5%, and bars and  restaurants, up 0.5%.  </P> <P> Categories posting declines included building and hardware stores, down 1.9%;  furniture stores, down 0.2%; clothing and accessory stores, down 0.4%, and  drugstores, down 0.2%.  </P> <P> For the first three months of the year, overall retail sales were up 5.7% from  the same period in 1988.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-REGIME IRANIAN KURD LEADER SLAIN  </P> <P> Gunmen burst into a meeting and assassinated Iranian Kurdish opposition leader  Abdul Rahman Qassemlou and two other exiled Kurdish activists and wounded a man  with an Iranian diplomatic passport, police in Vienna said Friday.  </P> <P> "The murders were politically motivated," Police Chief Werner Liebhart told a  news conference.  </P> <P> He said the three killers, who later fled, burst into an apartment in central  Vienna where the four men had held talks Thursday evening and immediately  opened fire.  </P> <P> Qassemlou, 59, was secretary general of the pro-Iraqi Democratic Party of  Kurdistan. Also killed was his deputy, Abdullah Ghaderi-Azar, 37, and an Iraqi  Kurd, Fadel Mala Mahmoud Rasoul, 38, who represented a separate Kurdish group,  police said.  </P> <P> A fourth man, who held an Iranian passport, fled to the street outside the  apartment with a gunshot wound in the jaw. He was hospitalized and unable to  talk to police.  </P> <P> There were no claims of responsibility for the deaths.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Iran Blames 'Enemies'  </P> <P> The Iranian Embassy in Vienna issued a statement Friday night that blamed  "enemies of Iran" for the killings and said it had sent a delegation to meet  with Kurdish leaders in Vienna to discuss "peaceful solutions." The Iraqi  Embassy declined to comment on the shootings.  </P> <P> In Iran, independent sources who declined to be named said Qassemlou, who has  led the Iranian Kurds against Tehran for more than 20 years, had been  negotiating a settlement with the new Tehran leadership that emerged after the  death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini last month.  </P> <P> Qassemlou's guerrillas seized control of a large part of Iranian Kurdistan  after the 1979 Islamic revolution, but many were pushed across the border into  Iraq after a massive government offensive in 1980.  </P> <P> A total of at least 20 million Kurds are believed to live in Iran, Iraq, the  Soviet Union, Syria, and Turkey.  </P></p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Norway's budget aims to cut deficit NORWAY'S minority Labour government yesterday unveiled a draft budget proposal for 1994 which aims to create jobs and protect the welfare state while still cutting last year's record deficit by NKr5.1bn (Pounds 475m). The government forecasts a budget deficit of NKr46.4bn for 1994, or 6.1 per cent of gross domestic product, down from last year's NKr51.5bn. However, the government said this year's budget deficit would be 3.4 per cent of GDP, somewhat higher than the 3 per cent ceiling stipulated by the Maastricht treaty convergence criteria. Norway is currently seeking European Community membership. The current account surplus is forecast to rise to NKr35.5bn from NKr25.3bn, mainly because of higher oil production. Total revenue is expected to increase to NKr330.2bn from NKr318.4bn last year, while spending is set to rise to NKr376.5bn from NKr369.9bn. The finance ministry said it aimed to raise NKr880m annually by increasing the marginal wealth tax rate to 1.8 per cent from 1.3 per cent. The government promised to try to cut the tax bill to industry by NKr584m in an attempt to improve conditions for job creation. Measures to achieve this include the abolition of an electricity duty, which the government said would save industry NKr270m annually. The unemployment rate is about 8 per cent, a post war record. Economic growth is forecast to accelerate to 3 per cent from 1.3 per cent this year.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Industry wants fresh action on inflation INDUSTRY yesterday wel-comed the reduction in interest rates as a step towards economic recovery but called on the government to maintain its downward pressure on inflation. Sir Michael Angus, Confederation of British Industry president, said the cut was 'fully justified' by the weakness of the real economy and exceptionally low inflationary pressures. He called for a freeze in the public-sector pay bill and urged the government to give priority to capital projects. The Engineering Employers' Federation also called for a shift of public resources into investment and infrastructure, rather than into consumer spending. Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the federation, said: 'The previous reason for high rates, the danger of inflation, has not gone away.' Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors, welcomed the cut and urged Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to make a further reduction of 1 percentage point as soon as possible. Mr Lamont, he added, had to be tough on public spending in order to control inflation. The Federation of Small Businesses said rates had to be cut back to between 5 per cent and 8 per cent to revive the economy.</p>

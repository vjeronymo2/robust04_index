			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Polish government gives top priority to mass privatisation POLAND'S new centre-right government confirmed yesterday that it was pressing ahead with a mass privatisation scheme involving western-managed investment funds. The scheme will be a key element in its policy of reducing the share of state ownership throughout the economy. A policy document accepted by the government's economic steering committee puts mass privatisation, and a scheme for compensating former owners, at the top of a list of actions designed to transfer half of Polish industry to the private sector within two years. Last year, a start was made on privatising 12 per cent of the nearly 8,500 companies in state hands. This year, the government expects to privatise at least 200 companies through mass privatisation. A further 10 companies will be sold through conventional public share offers, doubling the number of quoted companies on Warsaw's stock exchange, while another 30-40 factories will be sold to foreign investors compared to eight last year. Revenues from disposals are expected to more than double last year's Zl 3,500bn (Pounds 168m) contribution to the budget and Mr Tomasz Gruszecki, privatisation minister, wants to retain half of privatisation proceeds to restructure companies before they are put on sale. Under the mass privatisation scheme, 200 concerns will initially be handed to western-managed investment funds in which shares will be sold to the population at a nominal charge. This will be doubled as soon as possible. The privatisation ministry is being advised by S G Warburg, the London merchant bank. Fund managers will be chosen by June and the scheme will be financed in part through a Dollars 240m World Bank loan. Parliament will soon be asked to decide whether the entire population, or just adults, should be involved, as well as the price of shares in the funds. Former owners of nationalised property worth Zl 100,000 will also be partially compensated through the mass privatisation programme The government is also planning a privatisation agency run on commercial lines to handle sales of state property. Mr Gruszecki suggested that 49 per of the shares in it could be sold to institutions like the World Bank or European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>

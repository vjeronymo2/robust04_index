			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> JUDGE ENJOINS NOVELIST'S SON  </P> <P> Happily-ever-after endings are found in some of the novels of best-selling  author Belva Plain, but not always in her personal life.  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge on Thursday banned Plain's 44-year-old son, John, from  contacting her or going within four blocks of the homes of his mother and  sisters.  </P> <P> Judge Thomas P. Zampino said his ruling did not endorse the conduct of the  74-year-old Plain, author of a string of best sellers including "Evergreen" and  "Blessing." But he also said he could not force a mother-child relationship on  the pair.  </P> <P> John Plain has not been allowed in his mother's home since age 14, when he was  sent to a succession of boarding schools and institutions. Plain's efforts  during the past few years to meet his mother and siblings included repeated  telephone calls and picketing outside their Short Hills home.  </P></p>

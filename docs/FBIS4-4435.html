			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Larry Jagan] </F>   [Text] Responsible Burmese Government personnel have said  that cease-fire talks with the Mon delegates in Moulmein ended  successfully earlier this week. The Burmese Government said  both sides had a frank and cordial exchange of views, explained  their own positions, and discussed their differences of opinion.  This is the second round of cease-fire talks; the first was  held last December. According to Rangoon public opinion, the  Burmese military leaders did not expect to reach a cease-fire  agreement at the present talks. The next round of talks are  scheduled to be held in Moulmein before the end of next month,  but the Mon group does not seem too eager about the talks.  According to sources among the ethnic groups at the  Thai-Burmese border, the talks ended when it became clear that  Burmese Government troops will not be withdrawn from  Mon-controlled areas -- a matter the Mon group has been pursuing  since the end of the first round of talks with the Burmese  Government last year.    According to Burmese and Mon sources, the main topic of  discussion was border demarcation. It seems the Mons have  exaggerated the region they claim to control. The Burmese  military government delegates -- although not objecting outright  -- say the cease-fire implementation should be based on the  areas presently controlled by both sides, a stance they have  maintained all along. The cease-fire agreement will officially  recognize the end of military operations; troop withdrawal  should not interfere with it. The government side pointed out  that the withdrawal of troops will be the last thing discussed.    Five senior Mon officials from the New Mon State Party  [NMSP]  arrived in Bangkok from Moulmein yesterday and had dinner with  the Burmese military attache last night. According to Mon  sources, the parties will meet again in (?Ranong) on the  Thai-Burmese border in a few days to discuss the outcome of the  Moulmein talks and draw up future programs, with more talks  expected in the near future. Burmese Government officials have  always accepted that it was never easy to hold talks with  internal ethnic rebel organizations. Discussions were held on  many occasions for more than a year before the cease-fire  agreement was signed with the Kachins. The NMSP does not expect  the cease-fire talks to take that long, but both sides agree  that more talks are needed before the cease-fire agreement is  signed.    According to responsible Burmese Government personnel, the  second round of peace talks with the Karenni National  Development Party is scheduled to be held soon in Loikaw,  capital of Karenni State. The first round of talks was held in  January. Another Karenni group, the Karenni National People's  Liberation Front, announced they had agreed on a regional  cease-fire in February, but responsible Burmese Government  officials claim the Karenni group has not yet made any such  arrangements.</p>

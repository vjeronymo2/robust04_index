Bon appetit."  </P> <P> POMMES DAUPHINE  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups water  </P> <P> 1 1/3 cups flour  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> 4 eggs  </P> <P> Thick mashed potatoes using recipe for 3 cups instant mashed potato flakes  </P> <P> Oil for deep frying  </P> <P> Prepare pate a choux dough, bring water to boil in medium saucepan.

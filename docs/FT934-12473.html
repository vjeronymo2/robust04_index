			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (9): The high cost of 'downtime' / PC Networks PERSONAL computer network technology today is a mature technology, which is well-understood by the technical experts. It has also become so sophisticated that it is deceptively easy to install and look after. The truth, however, is far from that, as some organisations are discovering to their cost. One City of London law firm recently had its entire network crash in the middle of a working day. The network - comprising desktop PCs for more than 200 staff - ran its client files, as well as accounting and word processing. The crash meant the 150 solicitors employed could do no work. The firm's IT consultants found that a piece of faulty applications software on one of the network server machines had been the cause. When the software was removed, the system began to function again. Nevertheless, the consultants spent most of the day trying to get everyone back on-line. In another case, a leading bank in London put all the PCs on its trading floor onto two fault-tolerant server machines, and relied on these machines to keep the network running. No-one managed it on a daily basis, and neither did anyone realise that one of the servers have fallen over until the second one also developed a problem. The entire trading floor was out action for two working days. According to John Godden, principal consultant with network specialist Azlan, the cost of the 'downtime' in such situations can be much larger than the simple cost of fixing the system. These networks, in common with most that are being installed today, are commercially driven. They are used to support the day to day business functions, in a way that did not used to be the case even two or three years ago. The old-style PC networks were 'device sharing' facilities, giving people access to a departmental printer or fax. If they went down, people could carry on working. Today they cannot. People use their PC to log on to the network for all their software, from wordprocessing through to databases. They also use the network to get information from software held elsewhere in the organisation - 'the true cost is the cost per hour in lost business for every hour the network is down,' says Godden. Networks need to be planned differently to support the new applications, says Andy Rolfe, technical director of Logical Networks. The design should be sufficiently resilient and robust to properly support the new business applications, and the increased traffic volumes which they create - 'many companies under-estimate the complexity of the system they want,' he adds. Technically, a network consists of several 'layers' of equipment and software. The bottom layer is the wiring. The comes the 'pipe' - ethernet, token ring, or FDDI (fibre distributed data interface). On top of that is the transport protocol which determines how the data will be transported. Next is the operating system, such as Novell Netware or Banyan Vines, which manages what goes where, and finally there is the applications software held on the server. To complicate matters, there are other pieces of equipment known as routers, bridges, hubs and switches, which play a part in sending the data traffic around the wires. Some problems happen because the 'pipes' installed do not have sufficient capacity, as one insurance company found out to its cost. It had tried to stretch the ethernet pipe beyonds its technical limit, and wondered why 'protocol error' messages kept appearing on the screens. In other cases, the network has just grown organically, and gets to a point where it is simply over-stretched. Re-assessing the applications software may solve the problem. One such case was the British Airports Authority resource management system. It supported 150 PCs, which log faults which occur at UK airports, including London Heathrow. It ran a PC database system, but the application was drowning the network with too much data traffic. Consultants ACT business Systems solved the problem by redesigning the applications software to use a client-server architecture, cutting down the volume of traffic on the network. Mike Long, principal consultant at Hoskyns, stresses that a sound network infrastructure does not come cheaply, but the long term benefits can outweigh the cost - 'it must be flexible, and easy to add more people. That is a heavy commitment. For a large building, of say 180,000 square feet, and five or six storeys, the cost could come to between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 750,000,' he says. But even a well-designed robust network is not trouble-free. An issue that many large organisations are now wrestling with is data management. As networks, the number of servers increases in proportion, and that creates problems for users. They do not know where files are stored, or find that duplicate file copies do not match. 'If you have 250 users, you would have to think about controlling the data. Problems arise such as who has a copy of this document, what did they file it under, on which server,' says Andy Mulholland of network services company, BISS. Difficulties arise when two copies of the same file are held on different servers, but one has been altered. Anyone calling up the unaltered file could unknowingly be working with out of date information. At BISS, they have first-hand experience. The company's 200 employees all have a PC, connected to 10 servers, with 500 Mbytes of storage each. Documents transferred from one department to another are regularly re-filed on a different server under another name. The copy in the originating department does not get updated. BISS is hoping to solve the problem by replacing its 10 500Megabytes servers with two 3Gigabyte 'super-servers.' These 'super-servers' also have other advantages. It is easier to keep them in a single physical location, where they can be protected not only against theft, but against spilled drinks and other hazards of the office environment. An alternative way to improve the management of the network might be to use new operating software, such as Novell's Netware 4. This has been designed to provide sophisticated data management facilities, in particular to make file access simpler. However, the software was only launched this year, and most consultants are advising people to wait until it has proved itself before they embark on a substantial installation.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Security Council likely to act THE UN Security Council appeared last night to be moving towards approval of the use of force to safeguard deliveries of desperately-needed food and other emergency aid to millions of starving civilians in Somalia. A key question was whether to accept, and if so on what terms, a dramatic US offer of up to 30,000 troops to form the mainstay of such an operation. The US yesterday said it had prepared the first draft of a possible resolution for consideration by the UK, France, Russia and China, the other permanent members. If they were in general agreement the resolution would be submitted to the African and other third world delegates but a final draft was not expected to be ready before the end of the week. While acknowledging that there now was 'no alternative' but force to stop the rival Somali warlords and their clans from blocking aid deliveries, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary general, still favoured employing troops under total UN command and control. However, the US offer disclosed last week was contingent on it maintaining control over its forces even if the UN formally authorised the operation. With more than 52,000 UN troops on duty on four continents, Mr Boutros Ghali said his staff were 'already overstretched in managing greatly enlarged peacekeeping commitments'. In his report to the Council he admitted that he did not have the capability to command and control an enforcement operation of the size and urgency required by the Somali crisis. Therefore, he suggested, that states contributing troops would have to provide not only field commandos but 'considerable staff' for headquarters service in New York.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weak Dollars unsettles trading in Continental centres THE US dollar exerted its influence on bourses, while sporadic profit-taking also contributed to weaker prices yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS retreated late in the day, with the CAC-40 index ending 55.63, or 2.6 per cent, down at 2,078.51 in turnover of some FFr4bn. Mr Ian Furnivall, an analyst at the Paris office of Hoare Govett, commented that while yesterday's decline was partly the result of profit-taking, there was a general feeling that the French government was being unduly intransigent in not easing monetary policy following the Bundesbank's recent move. Another factor affecting sentiment, he said, was the recent bad set of interim results, further emphasised by disappointing figures from Chargeurs after the close of trading. He said that he would not be surprised if the index fell below the 2,000 level in the next couple of weeks. Among the day's declines Chargeurs lost FFr23 to FFr1,151 ahead of its results, while Alcatel shed FFr16 to FFr723, BSN FFr28 to FFr883 and Elf Aquitaine FFr15.40 to FFr395.90. FRANKFURT saw nervous trading as the weaker dollar again affected overall sentiment. The DAX index closed down 20.18 or 1 per cent at 1,860.39. Turnover was DM5.4bn. Some market observers noted that US institutional funds may have been moving out of German stocks, but the underlying trend remained firm if cautious. Mr Michael Geiger of NatWest Securities in London commented that the market remained in a consolidation phase and he saw no reason to change any recommendations at present. Volkswagen was again in the news after reports earlier this week of expected losses at its Spanish subsidiary. The shares lost DM11 or 3 per cent to DM350.50. Daimler fell DM12.70 or 1.8 per cent to DM708.80 ahead of tomorrow's results. Mr Geiger maintains a positive stance on construction stocks, particularly Hochtief and Bilfinger and Berger which stand to gain if either Berlin or Sydney are successful in winning the bid for the Olympic Games in 2,000 - a decision is due next week - since both groups also have a strong exposure in Australia. Hochtief yesterday shed DM14 to DM1,101 and Bilfinger DM1 to DM910. AMSTERDAM was another market to be affected by currency woes and the CBS Tendency index closed down 2.8 or 2 per cent at 122.4, with most of the losses occuring late in the session. Analysts at Amsterdam brokers Pierson were not worried by the day's fall and maintained that the market was showing a healthy correction from recent high levels. MILAN saw technical selling during the last hour wipe out some of the earlier gains, leaving the Comit index 4.90 ahead at 611.04. The last day of the monthly account had begun in positive mood with firm demand for insurers and renewed US interest in the telecom sector. However, Generali, which led the early gains following Tuesday's disclosure that first half premium income was up 14 per cent on the year slipped back to close L429 higher at L40,837, after a day's high of L41,230. Fiat fell L103 to L6,322, as rumours that the group might be planning a rights issue refused to go away. Sip, the domestic telephone operator gained L55 to L3,594 while Stet, the holding company, finished L6 lower to L4,415. Ferruzzi ended limit down for the fourth successive day. The share shed L37 or 10 per cent to L326. ZURICH was hit as the dollar fell to a year's low against the Swiss franc and the SMI index shed 26.5 or 1.1 per cent to 2,361.8. The mood was also dampened by tomorrow's options and futures expiry which was also expected to restrain activity today. Among exporters under pressure, Nestle registered shares fell SFr21 to SFr1,041. MADRID was pushed lower by profit taking as investors were unnerved by falls in other European stock and bond futures markets and news that disagreements were surfacing between trades union officials and the government in a new round of social pact talks. The general index shed 5.36 or 1.9 per cent to 283.30 in heavy turnover of Pta21.5bn. STOCKHOLM shed 1.7 per cent in response to sharply higher debt market yields. The Affarsvarlden index fell 21.8 to 1,265.7.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- September 15                                       THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1280.69     1278.55     1276.90     1274.45 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1354.96     1350.59     1349.98     1347.74  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1269.62     1267.86     1265.06     1260.47 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1343.48     1342.08     1337.99     1337.35  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Sep 14    Sep 13    Sep 10     Sep 9     Sep 8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1279.94   1276.64   1263.72   1265.95   1266.53 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1357.12   1351.64   1355.64   1362.52   1363.68  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1280.98; 200 - 1354.96 Low/day: 100 - 1260.47  200 - 1336.61.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

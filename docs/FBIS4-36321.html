			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News at Ten" program] </F>   [Text] Jordan said current talks in Washington would place  adequate emphasis on regaining its rightful share of water and  securing recognized borders with Israel.    Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs and Information  Minister Jawad al-'Anani said Jordan's water rights were  embedded in international and regional agreements, and that it  insisted on enforcing such agreements. He also blamed Israel  for excessive water siphoning from the River Jordan and its  tributaries.    Speaking to "News at Ten" reporter Maha al-Sha'ir, Dr.  al-'Anani said it was important to settle the issue of how to  divide water among the region's riparian states. The minister  also stressed the need for reaching agreement on recognized and  secure borders, and that technical problems should not stand in  the way of the demarcation process. He said the current  cease-fire line with Israel is not a good recipe for peace.    [Begin recording] [Al-'Anani] What is more important is that  each country should live within recognized and secure  boundaries. The current cease-fire lines do not constitute a  recipe for permanent peace. Therefore, our insistence on  demarcation boundaries is because we want to create also the  atmosphere which would be conducive for permanent peace in the  area.    [Al-Sha'ir] You referred to reports from Israelis that it is  very difficult to put lines or border demarcations for that area  of the Dead Sea for instance.    [Al-'Anani] Well, I think the foreign minister of Israel was  specifically referring to the technical problems which might be  encountered in trying to delineate boundaries in the Dead Sea  itself. He might be referring, either to certain geological  factors in that area or he was specifically referring to the  fact that the surface of the Dead Sea was continuously shifting  and moving because of over water siphoning that is taking place  in the area, and we think that Israel is very much to blame for  overdrawing from the River Jordan and its tributaries, which  eventually thrown to the Dead Sea. And, therefore, while we  acknowledge that there might be difficulty, but this does not  construe any clear reason for not engaging in the demarcation  process itself. [end recording]</p>

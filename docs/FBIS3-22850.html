			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Peruvian Institute of Nuclear Energy (IPEN) has  implemented the largest national project in the field of science  and technology: the construction of the Oscar Miro Quesada de  la Guerra-Racso Center for Nuclear Research [Centro Nuclear de  Investigaciones Oscar Miro Quesada de la Guerra-Racso].    Located 40 km north of Lima in the region known as  Huarangal,  the nuclear center is a small science and technology citadel  where a group of professionals and technicians specialized in  various subjects are developing a series of activities applying  nuclear energy.    The center's most important part is its investigations  reactor called RP-10 (10 megawatts of thermal power) with four  radial tubes [tubos radiales] and one tangential tubo [tubo  tangencial]. The reactor's core contains MTR [materials-testing  reactor]-type fuel with uranium enriched by 20 percent in which  various samples are lowered for the production of radioisotopes,  studies on the behavior of materials under neutron irradiation,  neutrography [neutrografia], and diffraction and fission traces.    Another important plant component is the radioisotope  production plant, which entails a series of laboratories located  next to the reactor that are used for the production, quality  control, and development of radioisotopes and irradiated  [marcadas] molecules.    In addition to the nuclear center, IPEN has at its main  headquarters in San Borja a test reactor (RP-0), a 14 MeV  neutron generator, two gamma irradiators, and several  laboratories engaged in projects such as the irradiation of  food, isotopic hydrology [hidrologia isotopica], non-destructive  tests, and gauging.    The Lima, Arequipa, and Trujillo nuclear medicine centers,  which in addition to rendering routine services also carry out  training, research, and development programs, are also part of  IPEN's infrastructure acquired with the support and cooperation  of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Radio Liberte was set up to back Paul Mba Abessole,  a former Catholic priest and leader of the opposition National  Lumberjacks Rally. Reporter Yvette Biregou asked him how he  responded to yesterday events:    [Begin recording] [Abessole, in French with superimposed  translation into English] I say that it is Bongo and his armed  bandits who are continuing to follow with their logic. They  want to exterminate all differences and to remain the sole  master on the boat. I think the Gabonese will not accept this.  I am demanding all Gabonese to stand and to get rid of this  tyranny. I would also like to hail all the democrats at the  international level, to bring us their support and so that there  will be a responsible and humanitarian democracy.    [Biregou] The government has ordered its troops onto the  streets. How do you respond to that?    [Abessole] Well, you know, it is the people who are reacting  and this is what I had said when Bongo's election was  acknowledged by his constitutional court. I said that the  people themselves would react. I am only an element of the  people who were elected. The people are organizing themselves.  I do not know what it is capable of doing in a few days. What  I know is that they will react. [end recording]</p>

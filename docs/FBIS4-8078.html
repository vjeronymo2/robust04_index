			<p>BFN     [Text] Novi Sad, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik,  president of the people's assembly of the Srpska republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, today told Novi Sad Radio that following the  bombardment of the Serb forces around Gorazde negotiations with  UN representatives would only be conducted through Russian  special envoy Vitaliy Churkin.    Krajisnik added that the Srpska republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer trusted other mediators since they  had been abusing the trust of the top leadership of the Srpska  republic.    Krajisnik also pointed out that it was a totally obvious  fact  that the Muslim forces had provoked the Serbs around Gorazde to  shatter the cessation of hostilities and an agreement on peace.  Instead of the Muslim forces bearing responsibility for the  conflicts around Gorazde, the NATO aircraft bombed the positions  of Serb units near Gorazde.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFC PLAYOFF NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> KAY HURT, DOUBTFUL FOR DENVER  </P> <P> Starting tight end Clarence Kay of the Denver Broncos suffered a pulled thigh  muscle in practice, putting his status for Sunday's AFC championship game in  doubt.  </P> <P> Kay injured the muscle in his left thigh while running wind sprints at the end  of Wednesday's practice.  </P> <P> "Right now, you'd have to list him as doubtful," Denver Coach Dan Reeves said.  "If it's sore today, I'd say it would be even more sore tomorrow. And he  doesn't have much time to recover. A thigh muscle is awful hard to come back  from."  </P> <P> If Kay can't play on Sunday against the Cleveland Browns, it would be a blow to  Denver's running game. Kay is considered one of the best run-blocking tight  ends in the NFL.  </P> <P> Reeves said Pat Kelly probably will make his first pro start if Kay can't play,  with Orson Mobley in reserve. The Broncos might also activate former USC tight  end Paul Green.  </P> <P> Ozzie Newsome of the Browns has reached all but one of his goals in pro  football. And time is running out in his quest to reach the Super Bowl.  </P> <P> "I've accomplished everything a tight end can accomplish except getting the  opportunity to play in the Super Bowl," Newsome said. "That's the one thing  that has eluded me. I guess that's why this has such a big meaning to me."  </P> <P> The 33-year-old Newsome is the NFL's all-time leading tight end with 639  receptions -- fifth among all receivers. His streak of 150 consecutive games  with at least one catch ended Oct. 29 against Houston, but he has remained an  important part of the offense. In last week's 34-30 victory over Buffalo, he  had four catches for 35 yards.  </P> <P> For the last several weeks, his resolve to retire at the end of the season  seems to have weakened, and Newsome now says he won't make a final decision on  his career until the Browns finish the year.  </P> <P> His teammates, however, are treating the playoffs as though they are Newsome's  last gasp. Cleveland's kicking team chanted his name before the opening kickoff  against Buffalo.  </P> <P> So they're 0-3 in the Super Bowl.  </P> <P> So another loss in the big game will tie them with Minnesota for the worst  Super Bowl record.  </P> <P> But the Denver Broncos are still willing to risk everything for another chance  at the Big One.  </P> <P> And, yes, they are fully aware of the talk of the town: if the Broncos are  going to be humiliated again in the Super Bowl, they're better off losing  Sunday's AFC championship game against Cleveland before they even get to New  Orleans.  </P> <P> "We've heard that they're saying, 'Hopefully we won't go back because we don't  want to go and lose again,' " quarterback John Elway said. "Those people who  ask, 'Why go back?' ought to go hide in their closets. That's the easy way out.  </P> <P> "I want a chance, at least a chance to step up to bat. We'll give it all we've  got. If we lose, we lose. If we win, we're world champs. I'd hate to be stuck  in my closet. No one wants to go 0-4 like the Minnesota Vikings, but I'm not  worried about that."  </P></p>

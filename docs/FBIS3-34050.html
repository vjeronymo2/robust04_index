			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The settlers' operation aimed at doubling the  number of existing settlements continued this evening. Dozens  of settlers set up a new outpost near the settlement of Yaqir on  the trans-Samaria highway. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at  1900 GMT on 2 February reports that "the 50 settlers from Yaqir  who attempted to set up a new settlement on a hill next to their  settlement left the site after the Army declared the area a  closed military zone. Our correspondent Dani Gur-Arye reports  that no confrontation occurred between the soldiers and the  settlers."]    IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers said that the operation  impedes the routine activities of the IDF, which is compelled to  assign a large number of troops to evacuate the settlers. The  organizers of the operation, called This Is Our Land, say that  the operation will continue in all 130 settlements, or until  50,000 people are arrested. As is known, the leaders of the  Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza  object to the operation, but have nevertheless announced they  will provide legal assistance to settlers who are arrested.  [passage omitted]    The struggle between the official leadership of the settlers  and activists in the field in fact exists only on paper. This  week, an attempt will be made to close ranks in anticipation of  the deployment of Israel Police in the territories in place of  the IDF. [passage omitted]    The IDF announced today that demonstrations by Jews in the  territories will henceforth be allowed only within the Jewish  settlements, just as demonstrations by Arabs will be allowed  only within Arab locations. Our legal affairs correspondent  Shlomo Arad reports that the High Court of Justice today  rejected the settlers' request to demonstrate in the synagogue  in Jericho based on this policy, arguing that the synagogue is  located in an Arab location and that the court was convinced  that such a move could imperil security on the site.</p>

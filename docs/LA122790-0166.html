			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTSCOPE: PUNTER NAMED SCHOLAR/ATHLETE ALL-AMERICAN  </P> <P> Sophomore Brian Parvin from Mt. San Antonio College of Walnut, the leading  punter in the state community college ranks last season, has been selected to  the JC Grid Wire Scholar/Athlete All-American team.  </P> <P> A graduate of Ganesha High in Pomona, Parvin posted a 3.8 grade-point average  and also averaged 41.8 yards on 57 punts including two that went 59 yards. An  All-Mission Conference first-team selection who has been recruited by UC  Berkeley, Pacific and Nevada Las Vegas, Parvin had 15 punts that went 50 yards  or more.  </P> <P> The selection of Parvin marks the third year in a row that a Mt. SAC player has  been named to the All-American squad. Defensive lineman Tom Berry received the  honor in 1988 and offensive lineman Alan Maxwell was chosen in 1989.  </P> <P> "It's really a great honor for Brian and for the football program here," Coach  Bill Fisk said. "We're proud to have three players named scholar/athletes three  years in a row."  </P> <P> The Pomona-Pitzer women's tennis team and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps men's squad  have received high rankings in a preseason NCAA Division III poll by the  Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Assn.  </P> <P> The Pomona women were ranked No. 2 behind defending champion Gustavus Adolphus  of Minnesota. Pomona is led by returning players Shelley Keeler and Caryn  Cranston. Keeler was ranked No. 1 in singles and combined with Cranston for the  top spot in doubles, where they were the 1990 Division III champions.  </P> <P> Pomona's No. 2 doubles team of Erin Hendricks and Brenda Pierce was also ranked  No. 17.  </P> <P> Claremont was ranked No. 4 as a team in men's Division III play on the strength  of returning players Lance Au and Ryan McKee. Au is ranked No. 3 and McKee No.  9 and the pair is ranked No. 2 in doubles.  </P> <P> Pomona is ranked No. 9 in the men's division led by Reed Newhall at No. 10 in  singles play.  </P> <P> Bill Swartz, who guided the Pomona-Pitzer men's soccer team to a share of its  first Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference title since 1980,  has been named NCAA Division III Far West Region coach of the year by the  National Soccer Coaches Assn. of America.  </P> <P> The Sagehens finished 11-5-1 and went 8-1 in the SCIAC. It is the second time  that Swartz has been honored as a regional coach of the year. In 1985, he was  named National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics New England Region coach of  the year at Thomas College of Maine.  </P> <P> Distance runner Angel Martinez of San Gabriel High and long and triple jumper  Juliana Yendork of Walnut have been invited to compete in the prep division of  the Sunkist Invitational Track Meet on Jan. 18 at the L.A. Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Yendork has been the top long and triple jumper in the state the past two  seasons and Martinez is regarded as one of the top distance runners in the  state.

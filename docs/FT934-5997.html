			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Fletcher Challenge creates forest unit shares Fletcher Challenge share-holders yesterday approved a proposal to create a separate class of forestry division shares for investors who may wish to focus their investments on the company's solid wood plantation activities in New Zealand and Chile. The approval means that the existing holdings of ordinary shares in Fletcher Challenge will be split. For each four ordinary shares held on December 10, shareholders will receive four new Fletcher Challenge ordinary division shares and one forestry division share. In effect, the forestry share is being regarded as a bonus. Mr Hugh Fletcher, chief executive, told an extraordinary general meeting in Auckland that the the new forestry shares would provide flexibility for those interested in a pure forestry investment, and had the potential to attract new investors who might not have the same interest in a Fletcher Challenge ordinary share. Under the new structure the ordinary shares will encompass the operations of the group's pulp and paper, energy and building divisions. In a separate development, Fletcher Challenge yesterday issued a prospectus for the sale of its New Zealand based shopping centres, to be known as the St Luke's Group. These centres are being sold as part of the company's drive to retire debt. The St Luke's flotation will be the second biggest ever, in New Zealand after the Telecom issue in 1990. The offer is for NZDollars 345.6m (USDollars 190m) in ordinary shares and notes, of which 12 per cent, or NZDollars 42m, will be made available to New Zealand investors.</p>

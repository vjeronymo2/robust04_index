			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (2): Putting assets on the map - There were good economic reasons for the Romans' regular census of their citizens. The same reasons, finding out who owned what and where, brought about William the Conqueror's national inventory known as the Domesday Book Today, graphical information systems (GIS) are putting assets on computerised maps across the world. The current boom in GIS is driven by economic necessity. Controversial 'handouts' and farming subsidies have fuelled the European Community's keeness to document every field within its vast area, in pursuit of an efficient Common Agricultural Policy. In the UK, National Health Service patients have always had the right to be treated at the hospital of their choice. But now that choice has a cash significance: a hospital has to know exactly where its clientele is located, and the act of sending a patient from one area to another has financial implications. Cross-charging for services, even competitive tendering, are all areas where GIS applications have a role to play. The first pioneers of commercial widespread GIS were utilities, and local authorities, whose main concern was with the location of assets. Retailers seeking to locate new stores have similar interests. The spread to transport systems was predictable. GIS applications are now being used by courier and security companies for location and routing, and in 'life of death' command and control systems, such as Cleveland Constabulary's Pounds 1.2m Despatch Management System installed by Intergraph in July. Advances in technology has brought GIS within the reach of a broader spectrum of companies, as the research in this issue of Software At Work shows. According to graphics research company Cambashi, GIS is a bright spark in an otherwise gloomy computer-aided engineering market, and is still growing at an average of 14 per cent annually in Europe, (see references on page six of this survey). Another projection of existing trends, from the Ordnance Survey, puts the number of geographical systems at half a million by the year 2000. Until very recently, GIS has been viewed as a niche application, belonging to geographers. Among the barriers to its widespread adoption have been the special equipment needed (such as scanners and plotters), and the enormous investment demanded up-front before GIS projects show much return. The figures for up-front development can be as high as 70 or 80 per cent, according to Prof Peter Dale, chairman of the GLIM (Geographical and Land Information Management) skills panel, and member of the Domesday 2000 steering group - 'it's also a matter of running costs. Depending on the type of data, there can be data maintenance costs.' But, as he points out, data collected and funded for one purpose, such as MAFF's survey of fields for agricultural set-aside subsidies, usually proves useful for other purposes once in place. What distinguishes GIS from other areas of information technology (IT) is the need for an 'infrastructure': a central source of information and control for the basic mapping data. The groundwork of third-party suppliers and specialists is essential, especially in the labour-intensive area of data capture. Leslie Brown, of Brown Projects in Dublin, is one such specialist in data capture, whose tasks include the digitising of very old maps for clients. 'The main problem for most users is the cost of creating the graphical part of the database. It's a costly exercise for one user to create digital maps to suit a GIS application if they don't already exist. If they do exist, they're more costly to buy than paper. 'Not all countries are the same. Ireland has good digital mapping for urban areas, but rural maps might be not so up to date,' he says. Luckily for most UK users, Ordnance Survey (OS) started digitising maps of Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) in the early 1970s. Its remit from government is to keep large-scale maps up to date. Originally scheduled to finish by 2010, it now expects to have whole country finished by April 1995. 'Around 80 per cent of decisions made in most governments and many other organisations are strongly influenced by geography in one form or another,' says Prof. David Rhind, director general and chief executive of Ordnance Survey of Great Britain. 'GIS underpins such decision-making and its growth is astonishing. But GIS requires a basic geographical framework, the map skeleton on which to 'fix' other data. In Britain, Ordnance Survey provides that framework whether users want details of every house and street or information about a country as a whole.' OS concentrated on the large scale 1:1250 maps to start with, as needed by professional users such estates agents, property developers, utilities - 'everyone concerned with land-use needs the real detail,' explains OS spokesperson Wendy Fellingham. 'The biggest customers are still utilities, (who funded some of the development), and local authorities, but we are noticing a broader spectrum of users.' Now that the data is in place, the OS is spinning off new products such as Address-point, the new postal address gazetteer, a dataset that uniquely defines and locates each and every residential, business, and public postal address and Oscar, Ordnance Survey Central Alignment of Roads, a route-planner currently used mainly by courier companies, local authorities, and emergency services. Alongside the large-scale maps, work is being carried out on other small scale mapping areas, such as the New Travelmaster series, a series of eight 1:250,000 maps plus a route planner. OS is using an Oracle database, and LAMPS, the Laser-Scan Automated Map Production System from Cambridge-based Laser-Scan Ltd. A comparatively small company, founded in 1969, Laser-Scan now finds itself batting against multi-million corporations in international bids  - it recently won a Dollars 7.8m contract from Mexico. 'Today's applications range from local government and emergency services to the planning of radio transmitters and disaster monitoring,' comments Laser-Scan chief executive Mike Jackson. 'The broadening user-base has brought about a new stage in GIS evolution. We bring all the esssential elements of the technolgoy together with database and a developers' toolkit, and let the industry specialists build the tailored end-user applications.' Output is an important part of GIS, and specialist equipment for high-quality output can be expensive. Xerox Engineering Systems claims to be the world's largest of wide format printing and plotting equipment. Its 8900 range, targeted at GIS users has user base of 9,500 in the UK alone. Customers, include the utilities, such as South Wales Electricity, and Welsh Water: the latter spent Pounds 210,00 on its seven plotters. However, some of the users in the survey have managed low-cost installations, based on Macintosh or PCs. Others, because of the scale of the effort and the expenditure involved, are taking a very cautious approach. Northampton County Council, for example, is 'testing' the very concept of GIS with exploratory applications such as road-traffic accident monitoring, before going for full scale implementation. No-one considering the introduction of a GIS should make a move without consulting the findings of USIS: Usable Spatial Information Systems. Based at Loughborough University, this research project on 'design for usability' has invaluable feedback from GIS end-users, some of it frightening. It seems the industry is treading the same weary path beaten by other software suppliers: less than perfect documentation, and customisation that makes systems harder, not easier, to use. The key is in training and the preparation of staff for a drastic change in their jobs. Clare Davis, one of the USIS researchers, raises a point about the grind of data capture - 'certainly, some of the UK digitising staff we met in our observation study were treated as low-paid temporary industrial operatives, with no employment rights and a very tedious job - sometimes in ergonomically unsuitable conditions.' Dozens of third party suppliers are springing up in support of GIS developments. Although the annual GIS exhibition (see references, page six) attracts small and enthusiastic companies, some of the larger names are also showing an active interest. Some suppliers have found specific niches. Bull UK, for example, concentrates on local authorities: its users include five out of the six largest metropolitan districts. The need to produce an asset register has concentrated local authorities' efforts on GIS - but this only scrapes the surface. The wider potential is not in merely recording data, but in using GIS for efficient operations, and for future planning and strategic use of resources. This is the view of Paul Cunnington, Bull's market development manager in the Land and Property Group, who stresses the need for training. 'GIS has a key role to play at the operational level. But once it has proved its role in improving efficiency, there's a further problem in focusing staff on newly imposed measures such as the citizen's charter and service level contracts. That means a change in attitudes and values, and GIS can help that change take place.' Companies such as Logica, CMG, ICL and Sema are all developing GIS expertise: BAeSema, a joint company with British Aerospace, has developed an underwater GIS for environmental and tactical use: the first user is the Swedish Navy, which will be using it to seek out likely hiding places for submarines. Intergraph, which claims to be largest established supplier with 34 per cent of the UK GIS market, is doing brisk overseas business. Recent installations include one in Prague. There is also a flurry of acquisitions in the industry. CACI Information Services has recently bought Pinpoint's market analysis business from MAI, the international services group. Pinpoint's Digitising Services, specialises in providing grid-references for specific addresses. Combined with the demographic data available fro the OPCS, Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, this can be a powerful marketing tool. Pinpoint's Geomaps, a Windows-based tool, is being used for such analyses as university catchments for the country's 187 colleges, and the flow of students across borders. IBM , which abandoned support of its own mainframe GFIS system, has made a worldwide agreement with GeoVision, covering product development and marketing. GeoVision, based in Camberley in the UK, has itself been recently acquired by SHL Systemhouse. GeoVision is involved in some large collaborative projects, including the British Telecom EPR project, where it is working with Unisys (whose ARGIS product is based on GeoVision's software) and work at North West Water, with Andersen Consulting. Among other large companies moving in on GIS is Autodesk. It is well placed, as the supplier of AutoCAD, to capitalise on its computer aided design (CAD )user-base, with the AutoCAD Data Extension. 'We've recognised the need to link information together and do a search' says Carol Bartz, chairman and president of Autodesk. 'The ability to query large amounts of data quickly has enormous potential, far beyond basic mapping.' The GIS sector is marked by an openness and willingness to share information and experience. Perhaps it is the explorative, geographical background of the GIS pioneers that has brought about the co-operative spirit between users. This sector of the IT industry is surprisingly well-served by specialist publications (see references, page six) and a very communicative professional body, the AGI, Association of Geographical Information. The AGI is playing a vigorous part in pursuing standards, and acts as a communicator and a forum for discussion, as well as a central source of information and organiser of regular conferences. Most promising for the GIS industry is the feeling among all the users interviewed that the main purpose of their system was only the start. Once in place, the information would find all sorts of all uses. The recognition that data has to be shared to make the fullest use of it bodes well for the next stage of development.

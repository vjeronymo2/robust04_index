			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Exciting and under Pounds 4 a bottle - Wine / Wine merchants and consumers should sniff out the south of France The south of France is making the best value wines in the world today. Discuss. Well, where else can you find varied wines with real character and a sense of provenance for less than Pounds 4 a bottle? And the exciting thing is that the south of France produces such a large quantity of wine - more than any other wine region in the world - that the number of interesting bottles is substantial, and the potential is enormous. Take, for example, the two most fashionable white varietal wines, solid Chardonnay and modish Viognier. The Midi may not be able to offer anything with the concentration of a Corton-Charlemagne (Coche-Dury's 1991 is stunning) or the best Condrieu, but it can field some of the world's better-made examples at the blunt end of wine pricing. Domaine St Hilaire's Chardonnay 1993, Vin de Pays d'Oc at Oddbins and Le Gineste at Waitrose can offer full, round Chardonnay fruit with a distinct suggestion of the added interest accrued by stirring the lees after fermentation. Not bad for Pounds 3.99, although I suspect these wines are best drunk straight off the bottling line. Viognier 1993 Resplandy, Pounds 3.95 from Sainsbury's and another Vin de Pays d'Oc, has, like so many cheaper Viogniers, more than a whiff of air freshener about it, but it has very lively acidity, lots of fruit, and is generally a better bet than the vapid market average with this variety. Perhaps the interest for serious wine lovers is the Midi's ability to provide carefully made, small domaine, appellation controlee wines at rock bottom prices. Ch de Cabriac Corbieres 1991, Pounds 3.45 at Asda, is a good example. Round, full, and generous, it is a fitting memorial to the winemaking skills of the late Bernadette Villars who was consultant there. Sainsbury's Ch La Voulte Gasparets 1990 at Pounds 4.75 comes from one of Corbieres' most respected domaines, run by a former plumber with suitably fastidious attention to detail. Full, herby and chewy, the wine is truly representative of this beautiful region, and the 1991 vintage will be a worthy successor. Faugeres 1991, Domaine Marbrieres, Pounds 4.19 Safeway, is another excellent, deep draught of oak-aged wine from the ambitious Laurens co-operative in the rocky Faugeres zone. There is no shortage of serious estates in the Minervois appellation making sleek reds and increasingly sophisticated whites on a shoestring. Oddbins has invested in one of the Languedoc's most polished bottlings, Cuvee Trianon 1991 Villerambert-Julien, which can provide that rather nouveau bordeaux mixture of density and structure with fruit ripe enough to enjoy now that is difficult to find in a red bordeaux selling at Pounds 6.99. Both Adnams, of Southwold, Suffolk and the Thresher/Bottoms Up/Wine Rack group have taken a particularly good look at what the Midi has to offer and both the Adnams and Bottoms Up lists are worthy of serious study. Domaine l'Hortus makes some excellent red and rose, and Fitou is once more a potentially interesting proposition. La Vigneronne, of London SW7, also has a fine collection of some of the more obscure southern French wines. Further east the Grenache grape starts to dominate and many of the reds are a little sweeter and more alcoholic. Grenache Le Radical 1993 Vin de Pays de Vaucluse, Pounds 3.25 Oddbins, is a new wave Grenache made in Cotes de Ventoux country just north of Mayle country by an incomer. Full, fruity with high acidity, it is certainly good value, if far less exciting than, say, the dense, Chateauneuf-like wines of Ch de Fonsalette from OW Loeb, London SE1. A fair stab at this hefty style for under a fiver can be found at Waitrose in the form of Cairanne 1990 Domaine de la Presidente Pounds 4.99. This is absolutely correct Cotes-du- Rhone-Villages with real density, roundness, and lovely, spicy Grenache fruit from the village of Ste Cecile des Vignes. Meanwhile, Provence is producing more and more interesting red wine, often from blends of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. Domaine de Trevallon, from Yapp Bros of Mere, Wiltshire, showed the way and has yet to disappoint this palate. Now Coteaux Varois wines such as Routas, from Adnams and Morris &amp; Verdin and Domaine du Deffends are worthy of serious consideration by any serious wine enthusiast, if that is not an oxymoron. Domaine de Triennes, Les Aureliens Vin de Pays du Var 1992 is Pounds 5.99 at Oddbins and the most impressive Provencal red so far from this new enterprise undertaken by two of Burgundy's most admired winemakers. It is full, rich, dense yet supple and, while not being under Pounds 4, certainly does nothing to disprove my thesis that the south of France is where any wine merchant worth his salt should be sniffing most keenly.</p>

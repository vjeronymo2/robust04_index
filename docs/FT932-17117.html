			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Minford expects fall in jobless UNEMPLOYMENT is set to fall sharply without the risk of inflation being reignited, says Professor Patrick Minford of the University of Liverpool. In a paper, co-authored with Mr Jonathon Riley of the Cardiff Business School, he says that micro problems in the labour market have been substantially diminished by the supply side reforms of the 1980s. Prof Minford takes issue with the argument that the lack of pressure from 'outsiders' - most typically the long-term unemployed - helps to push up wages for those in work. He says that 50 per cent of the labour force may have quit jobs and experienced a spell of unemployment in the past four years.</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Europe and World Trade: Korean investors unfurl red flags with eye to China - John Burton on trade links fuelled by Roh's visit CHINESE flags are flying along the main avenue of central Seoul this week for the first time since enemy Chinese troops entered the city in early 1951 during the Korean war. The display of the red Chinese banner this time represents the prospect of economic gains that Korean companies hope to make in China after the visit of President Roh Tae-woo to Beijing, which ends today. The establishment of diplomatic relations between Beijing and Seoul last month has already benefited Korean concerns. Samsung Engineering last week won the largest construction order any Korean company has received from China - for the building of a Dollars 200m chemical plant. The Halla Group has announced the establishment of a joint venture cement plant. And an agreement was recently signed for the construction of a Korean industrial park in Tianjin. South Korea's cumulative total investment in China is expected to double this year to Dollars 300m, making China the leading recipient of foreign investment by South Koreans. Sino-South Korean trade is also expected nearly to double this year to Dollars 10bn, as trade accelerates in the second half. This would make China the third-largest trade partner for South Korea after the US and Japan. Momentum has been building for closer economic ties since the two countries established trade offices last year. This led to expanded direct trade, which had formerly been conducted through third-parties in Hong Kong. Trade links were further improved in February when China reduced tariffs on South Korean products and granted some investment guarantees. Because of the tariff cuts, South Korea is showing signs of a slight trade surplus with China this year, after suffering deficits for the last three years. South Korea's exports to China mainly consist of textiles, electronics, machinery, chemicals, steel and metal products, while imports from China include silk, cotton fabrics, coal, oil and copper. President Roh's trip to Beijing is likely to increase the confidence of South Korea's big conglomerates, or chaebol, to begin investing in China. Medium-sized Korean companies have so far been the biggest investors in China, producing cheap, labour-intensive goods such as toys, textiles and footwear. Thirty-seven senior businessmen, including the chairmen of the leading chaebol, accompanied President Roh to Beijing, where agreements on investment guarantees, trade and technological co-operation were signed. The chaebol are interested in joint-venture factories for the production of electronic products and vehicles to take advantage of China's inexpensive labour. Samsung Electronics recently announced it would set up a VCR factory in Tianjin. Hyundai is negotiating a joint venture to manufacture minibuses and trucks in Harbin and another to produce cars in Tianjin and Wuhan. Daewoo wants to build buses in Shanghai. Other proposed projects include the construction of cement plants by Daewoo and Ssangyong, the development of zinc ore mines by Hyundai and the building of a machinery plant near Beijing by Lucky-Goldstar. The contract awarded to Samsung Engineering last week for an ethylene plant in Jilin province is only the first indication of the construction orders that South Korea could win as part of China's current five-year plan, which is expected to produce Dollars 300bn in orders. South Korean participation in the building of industrial facilities throughout China will also encourage Korean companies to expand out of north east China, where Korean investment is concentrated. The Korean preference for this area reflects not only its close proximity to South Korea, but also that this region is home to most of the 2m ethnic Koreans living in China. However, the official Korean Trade Promotion Corporation is warning companies about entering China in haste because of continued political uncertainty and the lack of sufficient infrastructure. Pioneer efforts by Korean companies to penetrate China have not always fared well. Daewoo, for example, has lost an estimated Dollars 1m annually on a refrigerator factory it opened five years ago in Fuzhou. Moreover, there is concern that China is becoming a competitor to South Korea in global markets because of its low wages. Korean producers of footwear and textiles have complained that the Chinese are taking a growing share of the Korean market for these products.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Fashion: Strictly for consenting adults only - Avril Groom moves among those wealthy few who will always say 'toujours couture' HAUTE COUTURE, say the doom-mongers, is an outmoded industry sliding gracefully towards its inevitable demise. Yet at least 500 people find it necessary to be in Paris twice a year for each of the 20 shows, with the full catwalk works, estimated to cost up to Pounds 1m a time. In this topsy-turvy world, only a tiny percentage of these are clients. The rest, who create the often hysterical fantasy which surrounds the shows and who provide an entertaining fashion show in themselves, are there for many less direct reasons. In 1993 who can say honestly that an haute couture fashion show is relevant to their lives? Certainly not the clients, who number perhaps only 3,000 around the world. Nowadays haute couture is so politically incorrect that it is something worn between consenting adults behind closed doors. The places where it survives are in areas less sensitive to criticism - the Middle East, Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea (the newest market to be courted) and those parts of the US and European society still cushioned by vast wealth. The clients are in a closed system populated only by similar individuals and they make their choice at small showings as private as the subsequent fittings. A few celebrities and clients do 'come out' in the glare of the flashbulbs. No one knows, or dares ask, if they are actually buying or just looking. It may be a favour to the designer, adding to his celebrity-count and his publicity, which is what a couture show is really about. Thus, Mrs Mick Jagger emerged on the catwalk this week at Dior where, as Jerry Hall, she used to model regularly. A bewigged Joan Collins appeared at Chanel, Paloma Picasso played the field and le tout Paris went to Yves St Laurent to offer the fragile designer their support. At Balmain, Pamela Harriman, the US ambassador, and a sprinkling of her big-spending compatriots, thought it politically correct to turn up for 'their boy', designer Oscar de la Renta. In France it is acceptable for politicians' wives, such as Mesdames Chirac and Pompidou, to go to shows like Dior, which is an institution, and Chanel, which they wear. The wife of Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, is a Nina Ricci customer but only, it is said, for ready-to-wear. Royal guests are the biggest coup. Last season Dior claimed Princess Michael of Kent. This season the Princess of Wales did not appear at Chanel, where she is said to be a couture client, and we had to make do with a gum-chewing Prince Albert of Monaco. Real clients do exist but are thin on the ground. Versace's staff were well satisfied with the '10 genuine private clients' scattered discreetly among the high profiles like Elton John and Roman Polanski. At Ungaro, British names such as Hambro and Goldsmith do not appear in the front row and enter and leave anonymously. But if clients often shun the shows, their place has been more than filled by the press. The army of photographers, a jostling bunch wielding big lenses, metal camera boxes and wearing multi-pocketed combat jackets, has created the myth of the supermodel, recording every move of, as the Chanel soundtrack had it, the 'million-dollar derrieres'. Amid the organised chaos backstage at Chanel, the tension was highest among those keen for the perfect shot of designer Karl Lagerfeld on his tour of inspection or Claudia Schiffers's curls being pinned in place. Cameramen undertake not to photograph the girls changing yet they snap away on the catwalk at outfits with only a strip of chiffon hiding the same girl's modesty. The photographers are abetted by the fashion writers, who turn any change in design direction or a hint of scandal into a newspaper story. A rumour that Karl Lagerfeld was introducing the micro-skirt at Chanel produced headlines even before his pelmet skirt reached the catwalk. The irony is that, in its attempt to stay afloat, couture is now returning to making what customers might buy rather than making the fashion headlines, which are the proper province of the ready-to-wear collections. What to wear, to assist in this spectacle, is a journalist's dilemma. Very few can either afford or want the clothes, preferring avant garde deconstructionism. The variations produced by British journalists on long black layers and sunglasses are amazing. The international hackpack are determined down- dressers, and even grand dames such as the International Herald Tribune's Suzy Menkes, champion of Christian Lacroix's enormous jewellery, and American Vogue's Anna Wintour, high priestess of short, sharp Chanel, have reduced themselves to simple severity. Head girl of the press pack is Denise Dubois, chief press officer of couture's governing body, who does not dress down at all but always appears elegantly attired in an outfit by one of the designers whose interest she protects so efficiently. Dressing up is the preserve of guests from the trade, the wives of fabric manufacturers and accessory makers, boutique owners and store buyers from around the world, to whom the show is a treat that also informs them of their master's design thinking. They always turn up in his latest ready-to-wear collection. At Lacroix, the philosophy is if you cannot afford the clothes, wear the jewellery - and as much as possible. The uniform is the short suit, whatever one's age and shape, so one mustsuspend one's critical faculties. British women are often quoted as the world's worst formal dressers but a couture crowd scrabbling for free champagne and canapes is only marginally more stylish. Then, of course, there are the hangers-on, who have no real reason to be present except to see and be seen and whip up hysteria about the divine clothes. They may be a friend of a friend of the hairdresser or a fashion student whose former college chum is now a workroom assistant. Their prerequisite is to look exotic and clap loudly. The designers are the other key players in the couture game. Beatrice Keller, Versace's Paris assistant, says the show is: 'Essential as something for Gianni to aim for, a way of seeing how all his ideas work together.' Asked on French television how couture could survive la crise, Christian Lacroix said that designers 'must fight the recession by making couture even more unique compared with ready-to-wear so its customers find in it a value they cannot get elsewhere.' He is quite right. The gap between couture and ready-to-wear has never been bigger. Avant-garde ready-to-wear is experimenting with long lengths and ideas that challenge the accepted construction of clothes. Couture has gone back to short because it knows that is what its customers like. Lagerfeld's micro-skirts have it both ways, providing the publicity and, by their perfunctoriness, allowing the customer to concentrate on the subtleties of the perfectly-fitting jackets which are the collection's real backbone. Couture has gone back to its roots of fit and detail - the curvy box-pleated peplum at the back of a Balmain jacket, the simplicity of a Dior pants suit or a strappy Givenchy jumpsuit under a spencer jacket. The detail comes with the fabric, especially for evening: Versace's crushed silk and slashed panne velvet mixed with lace; Lacroix's antique and devore velvets heavy with braid and beading but contrasted with delicate chiffon, lace and even woven leather; Dior's mixture of pleated shot velvet, old gold chiffon and sumptuous brocade; and Ungaro's moth-wing mixes of shimmery velvet, chiffon, chenille and fine beading. Such details, which are the heart of couture, are rarely discernible from the raucous broad canvas of the catwalk. Only the customer really knows such intimate pleasures, and that is as it should be.</p>

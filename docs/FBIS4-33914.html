			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Cuban economic developments monitored from Havana  radio and television sources in Spanish between 6 and 10 June:    Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish at 0900 GMT on 6  June  carries a report on the Arturo Almeida Credit and Services  Cooperative in Las Yeguas, a rural settlement in Aguada de  Pasajeros Municipality, Cienfuegos Province. Foreman Roberto  Gonzalez Santana says their main crop is sugarcane, but they  also have cattle. He adds that the sugarcane harvest has just  concluded and their yield was 53,000 arrobas per caballeria,  which is considered very high. He also talks about milk  production, which is very low -- only 5 liters per cow -- due to  the dry season.    Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish at 0900 GMT also features a  financial report on Cienfuegos Province enterprises during the  first semester. The information reveals that "46 enterprises  were profitable, but a similar amount reported losses, adding  that employment and salary figures registered in 1989 remained  the same in 1993, but that production dropped 40 percent. The  tendency to pay subsidies increased." The report says efforts to  solve this situation include allowing the municipal authorities  to manage their funds, thus enabling them to prevent squandering  and to increase revenues.    Radio Reloj at 1339 GMT on 6 June reports that the joint  Cuban-Spanish enterprise Gaviota S.A. plans to build in Cayo  Guajaba, Camaguey, a four-star, 1920's-style sea resort which,  by the peak of the 1995 season, will comprise 80 cabanas.    Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 8 June reports that  agricultrual  workers in Guantanamo are striving to lower production costs by  harvesting plantains before they ripen.

Radio Rebelde also reports that construction workers of the  Jose Maceo contingent in Santiago de Cuba and workers of the  geology-mining enterprise in Oriente work 14 hours per day to  repair the salt mining enterprise in Caimanera. This plant,  which produces more than 75 percent of the salt consumed in Cuba  was affected by the floods of May.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 9 June reports that the Mexican  Embassy in Cuba donated more than 400 books to the Jose Marti  Library in Havana.

Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 9 June reports that Las Tunas  Province has planted 1,852 caballerias of vegetables, fruits,  and tubers, which is the highest level of its history and  equivalent to 84 percent of its territory. Of the 1,852  caballerias, 960 are plantain crops.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 9 June reports that the  approximately 8,000 self employed workers in Pinar del Rio  Province contributed more than 1.5 million pesos so far this  year.

Jose Ramon Fernandez, vice president of the council of  Ministers, received the donations made by different solidarity  groups from Galicia. In addition to the aforementioned goods,  the donation also includes five vehicles, including a truck.  Another donation consisting of 23 packages of medicine also  arrived on board the ship, which was donated by the Miguel  Hernandez Friendship Organization.    Nine of Havana Province's 19 municipalities are  self-sufficient in terms of food production, and they have  allocated 202 caballerias to help increase the amount of food  available for the population.

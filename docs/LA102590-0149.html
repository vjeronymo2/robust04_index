			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> HAPPY BIRTHDAY: Seal Beach, celebrating its 75th anniversary this weekend, was  not always the upscale, upstanding town it is now. . . . In the Roaring '20s,  it attracted hordes of actors for Cecil B. DeMille's "Ten Commandments" (look  for oil wells behind the pursuing Egyptians), and drew carnival crowds to watch  aviators loop the loop (and occasionally crash). . . . With prostitution and  gambling, it was also the closest thing to a Sin City the county ever had.  Chris Woodyard and Len Hall  </P></p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (17): Right-size gains credence - Mainframes, life in the old system yet THE mainframe computer will it not lie down and die. It continues to demonstrate it has a viable, long-term place in information processing and management, in spite of the inevitable effects of the recession, and the continuing suggestion that it is to be supplanted by a collective of mid-range, workstation and PC systems. One of the main assumptions in the suggested demise of the mainframe, and one which has had a significant impact of late, is downsizing. This is the concept that, as technology allows the same performance to be packed into an ever-smaller physical size, so the need for the big boxes will diminish to an eventual vanishing point of economic non-viability. The evidence is now starting to point away from this inevitability. Instead, the term 'right-sizing' is starting to gain credence. With that credence comes an appreciation that the mainframe will continue to have an important role. What is more the corollary of downsizing, that the technology will be exploited to add more power and performance to a system of any given physical size and price, will provide continued justification for that role. Right-sizing takes as its basis the fact that different types of applications in information management require different systems architectures to run them most efficiently. Therefore, while it is far more sensible to run a highly user-interactive mix of spreadsheeting, graphics and text report writing applications together on a PC, the same platform is totally inadequate as the host of a large, on-line transaction processing system. Here, there is really no alternative to a large mainframe installation and an extensive disk farm of on-line data storage. As such on-line transactions processing (OLTP) systems are the life-blood of most large corporations, such as the financial institutions, there is unlikely to be any significant reduction in either the role of or demand for mainframe systems. The main differentiator that defines mainframes, minicomputers and workstations/PCs, is the relationship between an application's data and functionality. An application that is data-rich but functionally poor, such as OLTP or large database management, is ideally suited to a mainframe solution. Applications with the inverse ratio suit the workstation/PC, while the minicomputer matches applications which require a reasonable mix of these two elements. The fact that there is still very much a role for mainframes has not meant a healthy flow of business for the manufacturers. Industry-leader IBM indicated that the slump in its business, thought to have been stemmed following a good fourth quarter last year, looks set to continue for at least the first half of this year. The company has laid the blame on the spreading recession throughout Europe and Japan, though US analysts, such as Mr Ulric Weil of Weil Associates, have suggested that downsizing aspirations by customers is also having a considerable impact on the company's mainframe sales. There is a negative impact felt from the problems in computer leasing business, which has been a significant sales route through which IBM has reached its customer base. The recession is, a big worry for IBM's mainframe business, for it has followed smartly on its introduction of a complete new range of systems, the System/390 range, described by Mr Tony Cleaver, IBM chairman and chief executive, as the biggest and most important announcement for a quarter of century. In spite of that significance, sales of systems in the range have been slow, except for a small increase which occurred during the fourth quarter last year. Then, sales of the most powerful, six processor systems, the ES/9000 Model 900, and the top of the entry-level machines, Models 330 and 340, rose sharply. This looks as though it has been a temporary excursion, and that sales will continue slowly. As well as the problems of recession, the machines mark a fairly radical step function both in performance and compatibility with the the existing IBM mainframe product family, the 370 Series. There are only a limited number of bridges between the two families, and users of 370 series machines may first have to upgrade their existing systems to one of the configurations at which a transition to the equivalent ES/9000 can be made. There have also been some missed compatibility opportunities in fairly obvious, even rather silly areas. For example, the upper range of the ES/9000 series is water-cooled, as are the 370 series machines, yet they use different diameter piping to supply the coolant. In spite of the continued reliance on proprietary architectures and operating systems from the mainframe suppliers, there are signs that open systems concepts are now penetrating deeply. Amdahl, for example, is still the only mainframe supplier to offer an implementation of Unix as a native operating system on its machines. Others, including IBM, only offer it as a guest running under the proprietary operating system. Unix on the mainframe has been a slow starter, but some users see it as a way out of being locked in to not only proprietary systems, but the pricing that can go with them. It offers opportunities in providing more coherent communications between different hardware platforms, a fundamental element of open systems, if they are all running broadly the same operating system. If Unix does become more prominent on mainframe systems, it offers the chance of greater freedom for the IBM plug compatible systems manufacturers, which include the likes of Amdahl and Fujitsu. These have built their businesses on making hardware that runs IBM software but is cheaper and/or more readily available than IBM kit. Any significant switch to Unix in the market could allow both them and the users a wider, more competitive choice of sources for applications software. It could reverse the current situation and allow a native Unix to act as host to a manufacturer's existing proprietary operating system. This would provide current users of proprietary systems with continuity as well as broadening the choice of upgrade path.</p>

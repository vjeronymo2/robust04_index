			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial office report: "Industrialists and Agrarians Do </F> Not Lend Any Special Significance to Gaydar's Departure"]    [Text] Yesterday we published the viewpoint of a number of  financiers about Yegor Gaydar's resignation from the post of  government first vice premier. Chiefs of banks, exchanges, and  investment companies are sorry about this decision, and they are  concerned about the upcoming changes. Other IZVESTIYA readers  express a rather different point of view. We considered it  possible to acquaint you with their stance too.    Aleksandr Vladislavlev, vice president of the Russian Union  of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs:    "Yegor Gaydar has theoretically made the right choice by  leaving the government, but he gave the wrong reasons for his  step. His problem is not a difference of opinion with other  government members, but a difference of opinion with the people.  It is a good thing if both he and his supporters understand  this now.    "The president, it seems to me, cannot fail to take into  consideration the undoubted fact that today the `ruling party,'  so to speak, associated with Gaydar's team is a source of public  allergy. This team has made reforming the economy its own  exclusive right.    "Now it appears that this team is prepared to shed  responsibility, transferring it to those who have tried to  display common sense and avoid national disillusionment in the  reforms. The departure of the `architect' who built the  country's future on the sand of naive ideas gives us a chance to  place the reforms on a more solid foundation."    Viktor Gulov, chairman of the "Kuzminichi" joint stock  company in Kaluga Oblast:    "Any changes in the government are painful to those of us  who  are involved in agricultural production. Because amid the  half-market economy we are nevertheless forced to be involved in  finding our way, blazing a trail, and so on. The newly reformed  farms (the former sovkhozes and kolkhozes) have their own  specific development programs. But their implementation depends  entirely on various government officials. Gaydar promised the  agrarians a great deal at the end of last year. It will be  disappointing if, with Yegor Timurovich's departure, his  promises are forgotten.    "In principle this is not even about Gaydar. Before and  during his time, attention paid to the agricultural producer has  always been all talk, and unfortunately it will be the same  after his time. Exorbitant credits, debts which the state is  not paying off, the daunting prices of industrial goods. Was  Gaydar able to change this situation? No.    "And anyway it is not Gaydar who is giving us a headache. He  will not disappear... But the spring sowing is just around the  corner. We need to have plenty of fuel and seed, we need  equipment to be repaired... I am sorry, but `Gaydars' come and  go, whereas the grain has to be sown every year. Under any  government."</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Business expansion schemes BUSINESS expansion scheme investors do not lack for choice, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Recent issues include an arranged exit, cash-backed scheme from sponsor Matrix Securities for Middlesex University, offering a return of 122p after five years for every 100p invested. The equivalent annual compounded return to a higher rate taxpayer investor in Aegis V is 14.27 per cent. Minimum subscription is Pounds 1,000. Royal Bank of Scotland has issued BESSA RBS, sponsored by Close Brothers, which gives investors a choice of a fixed exit price of 120p (equating to an annual return of 13.8 per cent for higher rate taxpayers) or a FT-SE 100 linked return. The investor receives a minimum of 60p plus 2.5p for every 1 per cent rise in the index, up to a maximum of 36 per cent. There are lock-ins at rises of 24 per cent and 36 per cent. The scheme comes with top credit ratings and recommendations from both BESt Investment and Best BES Advice. Minimum investment: Pounds 2,000. Oxford Colleges BES, sponsored by Hodgson Martin, aims to raise Pounds 12m for St Hugh's, St Peter's and Wadham colleges. It is offering an arranged exit price of 118p, which the sponsors say equates to a compunded annual return of up to 14.2 per cent. It is backed by gilts. Minimum investment: Pounds 2,000. Great Western II is an assured tenancy BES sponsored by Rowan Dartington, a West Country stockbroker, and issued by Knightstone Housing Association, which owns properties with a vacant possession value of about Pounds 220m. The aim is to raise a minimum of Pounds 750,000 to provide low-rent homes. The fixed exit price of 123p will be partially cash-backed with deposits at Knightstone. Govett BES Taxsaver, sponsored by John Govett is an extension of Assetbuilder, number 4 of which was issued earlier this year, and has raised Pounds 6m. It will develop properties in the Portland Basin area near Manchester which will be bought back after five years by Sanctuary Housing Association. There is some cash backing. The fixed exit price is 117p but the sponsors say that, since BES3 certificates will be out by the end of November, this equates to a compounded annual return of 13.9 per cent to a higher rate taxpayer. Sponsor Neill Clerk has also launched Unchained Reversions plc, to raise Pounds 1.9m It is a home reversion BES under which elderly owners sell their property in exchange for an assured tenancy in new accommodation. There is no arranged exit. Minimum investment: Pounds 1,000. Courtview BES Properties is an entrepreneurial scheme arranged by Peter Duboff, a chartered accountant and chairman of Courtview BES companies. It is not a sponsored issue and since no commission is payable to intermediaries, costs should be kept low. The aim is to raise up to Pounds 10m to buy first-time buyer properties in London. A novel twist is a dividend option of 5 per cent net a year.</p>

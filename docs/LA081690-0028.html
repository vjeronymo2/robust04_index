			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: VICHYSSOISE: HOW TO CUT CALORIES, BOTHER  </P> <P> Vichyssoise is a rich, creamy potato soup that is always served cold. Like many  famous French dishes, it actually started out as a way to use up leftovers --  in this case, leftover leek-and-potato soup.  </P> <P> The soup was combined with heavy cream and served cold so that it became  totally unrecognizable as a leftover.  </P> <P> My lighter version of this classic is much easier to make than the original  French technique. It also has a fraction of the calories and cholesterol per  serving.  </P> <P> For formal dinner parties I like to serve Vichyssoise in icers garnished with a  dollop of caviar. For less formal buffet gatherings I sometimes serve the soup  in mugs before seating my guests for dinner.  </P> <P> VICHYSSOISE WITH CAVIAR  </P> <P> 2 medium baking potatoes (1 pound), peeled and diced  </P> <P> 2 cups chopped white onions  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups defatted chicken stock  </P> <P> 1/2 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> 1/2 cup light sour cream  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt (omit if using salted stock)  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice  </P> <P> 1/2 cup minced onion  </P> <P> 1/4 cup caviar  </P> <P> Combine potatoes and onions in large saucepan. Add chicken stock and bring to  boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until potatos are tender, about 20  minutes.  </P> <P> Spoon cooked potato mixture into blender container or food processor. Add  nonfat milk, sour cream, salt and lemon juice. Cover and chill well.  </P> <P> To serve, pour 1/2 cup cold soup into each of 8 chilled bowls. Top each serving  with 1 tablespoon minced onion and 1/2 tablespoon caviar. Makes 8 (1/2-cup)  servings.  </P> <P>  Each serving contains approximately 80 calories; 54 mg cholesterol; 4 g fat;  300 mg sodium.  </P> <P> </P></p>

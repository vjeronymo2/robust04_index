			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Claimant Partnership <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SSA's interaction with claimants will focus on enabling their participation in the process. SSA will also work with third parties, such as family members and community-based organizations, to provide additional claimant support. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Understandable public information materials and comprehensive information packets will be widely available. Explanations of the programs, the decisionmaking process, and claimant responsibilities will be widely available and furnished at the point individuals first make contact with SSA. Claimants, who are able to do so, will be asked to do more to facilitate development of supporting information, particularly with respect to medical evidence. To encourage the release of evidence by treating medical sources, SSA will network with the treating source community to overcome the lack of understanding and possible resistance to providing patient information. SSA will encourage private insurers and public agencies that refer claimants to SSA as a condition of receiving other benefits to provide medical evidence for these individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA will develop ongoing relationships with community organizations to ensure that competent third-party resources are available to assist the claimants. Examples of resources that SSA will help develop include: transportation and escort services for indigent claimants and those who experience difficulty in getting to consultative examinations; enhancement of medical provider capacity to identify potentially eligible patients, secure claims and provide medical evidence; and software with compatible format design which will allow direct input of claim-related information to SSA. SSA will have an ongoing demonstration program that provides funds for truly innovative projects that test models for national implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to expedite the referral of potentially eligible individuals, SSA will develop productive working relationships with Federal, State and local programs that serve individuals with disabilities. Other programs will be able to use SSA-developed decisional support systems to evaluate potentially eligible persons prior to referral and to transfer information to SSA through compatible databases. Local managers will be encouraged to develop and maintain appropriate working relationships with local Federal, State and third-party resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Active participation by claimants, supported by SSA's efforts and the contributions of third parties will result in a fundamental shift in claimant expectations and satisfaction with the SSA disability process. From the SSA perspective, the results will be better service to customers through timely, fully supported decisions rendered at all decisional levels; better use of SSA resources focused on helping those who need assistance; and greater public confidence in the disability adjudication process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Workforce Maximization <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Teamwork and workforce empowerment are fundamental ingredients in the new process. In carrying out their duties and responsibilities, adjudicators will work in a team environment with internal medical and nonmedical experts, who provide advice and assistance for complex case adjudication, as well as with technical and other clerical personnel who may handle more routine aspects of case development and payment effectuation. The disability claim manager will be the focal point at the initial claim level, assisted by technical and medical support staff. The adjudication officer will be the focal point at the prehearing level, relying on technical and medical support staff, as well as interacting with the disability claim manager and the ALJ, as necessary. The ALJ will be the focal point at the hearing level, receiving support from technical and medical support staff, and also interacting with the adjudication officer and disability claim manager, as necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each team member will have at least a basic familiarity with all the steps in the process and an understanding of how he/she complements another's efforts. Team members will be knowledgeable but will also be able to draw upon each other's expertise on complex issues. Communication among team members will encourage consistent application of disability policy. Improved automated systems will enable members of the team to work together using a shared data base even when they are not co-located. Handoffs, rework, and non-value steps will be significantly reduced and fewer employees will be involved in shepherding each claim through the process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employees will perform multiple tasks instead of singular activities, thus their roles will expand to encompass more of the ``whole'' job. This will enable employees to experience the direct relationship between their actions and the final product. Adequate resources and sufficient training and mentoring will allow employees to acquire the skills they need to process claims from intake through adjudication. Employees will feel more of a sense of ownership for the services they perform as a member of a team focused on serving claimants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new process will rely heavily on increased employee empowerment, applying information technology and using professional judgment to complete tasks more effectively and efficiently without constant checking, direction and micro-management. Recognition and reward processes will be revised to emphasize contributions to team outcomes and acquisition of knowledge bases. Continuous quality improvement activities will foster ongoing incremental process change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Representatives: New Rules and Standards of Conduct <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Social Security Act and regulations have long recognized the representational rights of claimants and have provided an administrative framework designed to ensure that claimants will have access to the legal community and others in the pursuit of their claims. Representatives currently have the option for authorization of fees through two procedures: 1) the fee petition method, whereby the representative presents an itemization of services rendered and time expended, and SSA determines a reasonable fee; and 2) the fee agreement method, whereby the claimant and representative agree to a fee of 25 percent of the retroactive benefits due or $4,000, whichever is less. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Focus groups of claimants and the general public have indicated that the disability program is too complex to understand and the process too fragmented and difficult for them to navigate alone. While many claimants resent having to pay a representative to establish entitlement to government-sponsored benefits, they feel that they have no choice if they want to be successful in this pursuit. Although the current regulations provide protection for claimants from fee abuses, these rules fall short of assuring claimants that the representatives they retain are qualified and will adequately represent their interests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

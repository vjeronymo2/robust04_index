			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leonid Tsegelnikov: "Belarus: Road to Nowhere"] </F>   [text] By comparison with the events in the former  Yugoslavia, the Caucasus region, and Central Asia, the events in  Belarus remain in the background. Almost no light is thrown on  them in the Russian press, but if something does appear, it is  with great distortions. In addition, the reasons for the drop in  production and the lowering of the standard of living in the  republic are not explained.    I am Belarusian; I periodically visit my homeland, and I see  that life there is becoming worse and worse. But, after all, it  was not long ago that Belarus was considered the most stable and  reliable republic of the USSR, and after its dissolution the  starting conditions of the new state were better than in  neighboring former republics of the USSR. In 1991-1992 half of  the former Union exported industrial and food commodities from  Belarus that were bought at cheaper prices than in other  regions. Our Lithuanian and Latvian neighbors proved to be  smarter. With a premonition of the quick end of the ruble in  their countries, the Balts bought up and exported everything  they could. Indeed, the Belarusians themselves haphazardly took  cattle to neighbors in the hope of earning money. The dashing  Dzhigits-Caucasians also did not lag behind the Balts. Trains  with conquering hucksters left from Moscow for Minsk, Brest, and  Gomel.    Belarus's proclamation of its independence in August 1991  did  not change anything in its economic activity. Independence Day  was established without taking the history of Belarusians into  account. As if there had been no Belarusian People's Republic,  which was proclaimed on 25 March 1918, no uprising of 1794, no  uprising of Kastus Kalinovskiy in 1863, no Grunwald Battle, and  other remarkable events. The coupon-ticket system of protecting  the consumer proved to be weak in the face of intensifying  corruption, wholesale accumulation of commodities at bases and  warehouses, and given the practical absence of customs offices  at the borders.    Continuously increasing inflation in Russia caused an  enormous shortage in the supply of money with the picture of the  leader of the proletarian revolution. Discontent and strikes  started with demands for payment of wages that were being  withheld in various regions. On airliners to hot spots in  immense Russia, Yeltsin and his companions-in-arms scattered  money that had just come off the printing press. Russia accepted  foreign handouts. The whole Western world jabbered about  rendering Russia humanitarian assistance. Many former republics  of the USSR hurriedly introduced national money. Intimidated by  the April strikes of 1991, the Government of Belarus, fearing  that it would not get its lot of all-Union money coupons,  introduced its own monetary surrogate--the "hare," which was  printed at the Perm Goznak factory. All-Union notes of the 1991  version, Russian notes of the 1992 version, and "hares" were  simultaneously in monetary circulation in the republic. In  addition, a distribution coupon system that protected the  Belarusian consumer from his foreign colleague was operating.  Food commodities were sold only for "hares," with presentation  of a citizen's consumer card of the republic. Payment with  coupons of the two systems was allowed for transportation,  municipal services, and public catering. Such a system made it  possible to avoid a sharp drop in production and to maintain  relative stability in the republic for a short time. V.F.  Kebich, chairman of the Council of Ministers of Belarus,  declared at the end of 1992 that the republic was successfully  overcoming the first stage of a smooth transition to market  relations, that the slump in production had been stopped, and  that a slow rise had begun. We will add that S.S. Shushkevich,  chairman of the Supreme Soviet, had refused humanitarian  assistance. The first sprouts of national independence began to  appear at that time: Independent newspapers and journals began  to appear in the Belarusian language, a number of schools began  to teach in the mother tongue, discussions flared up in  parliament about whether the Belarusian language should be the  only official language, and the Belarusian Army began to be  formed. Diplomatic relations were established with many states,  comparatively good arrangements were made with the closest  neighboring states, and it was possible to avoid serious  disputes on territorial questions with Lithuania, with whom  Belarusians lived for several centuries in one state--the Grand  Duchy of Lithuania. The much higher standard of living in  Belarus by comparison, for example, with Russia can be judged by  the psychology of the consumer of food. Thus, on 4 January 1993  in Gomel I ate a glass of sour cream, drank a cup of tea, and  ate two small pieces of bread for 12 Russian rubles [R]. Such a  meal would have been several times more expensive in Russia.    The relative prosperity in Belarus in 1992 and the awakening  of national dignity were achieved in a fierce struggle of the  parliamentary opposition with the communist majority. In  contrast to the unsound Russian shock programs of transition to  the market--"400 days" and "500 days"--the Government of Belarus  did not have official programs. At the same time, the  opposition, in the form of the BNF [Belarusian People's Front],  worked out its own program of privatization and transition to  the market, calculated for 20-25 years and consisting of several  stages. In addition, the transition to each successive stage was  to be implemented only to the extent the previous one was  realized. This would make it possible to avoid chaos and tension  in the country. The communist parliament of Belarus rejected the  proposals of the opposition.    The opposition called for the introduction of our own  currency--the taller--the withdrawal of Russian troops from the  territory of the republic, a restructuring of the Belarusian  Army, and the development of real programs for the creation of a  market economy. The opposition indicated that the inactivity of  the government and parliament, the marking time in place, and  the temporizing policy of Shushkevich, who was trying to  reconcile two opposite political directions, will lead to a  crash in the economy and loss of the republic's independence. At  the beginning of 1993 the BNF and other democratic forces of the  republic collected 442,000 signatures (according to the  Constitution of Belarus only 350,000 are required) for a  referendum on immediate parliamentary elections. The parliament  boycotted the constitutional demands of the people. S.S.  Shushkevich, taking a compromise position, passed a resolution  in parliament on ahead-of-schedule elections (by one year) to  the Supreme Soviet. These elections were supposed to have been  held in March 1994.    A big crack occurred in the economy of Belarus in the spring  of 1993, when not enough cash "hares" were available and coaches  with new batches of "hares" "got lost" in the labyrinth of the  railroad lines of the Moscow rail junction. The government  passed a resolution on the "temporary" circulation of the  Russian ruble in the purchase of food commodities. Prices began  to rise sharply in the republic. Products disappeared from the  shelves. The "hare" began to be quoted lower than Russian money.    The second blow against the economy of Belarus was delivered  in July 1993, when Russia, in a unilateral procedure, conducted  an operation to remove from circulation rubles with the image of  a silhouette of the leader and the introduction into circulation  of the 1993 version of bank notes of the Russian Bank. According  to an existing agreement of Russia with states that were in the  ruble zone, Russia was obligated to notify its colleagues within  six months about the conduct of such an operation. The current  notes of the national bank ("hares") remained in circulation.  The financial system of the republic was broken. The economy of  the state, which relied mainly on the Russian consumer, began to  drop sharply. For two years the Government of Belarus  practically did nothing to reorient the economy toward other  countries, a Black Sea-Baltic economic union was not  established, which the opposition had insisted on, and the  question of the construction of a Ukraine-Belarus-Baltic oil  collector for the reception of oil from the Near East was not  resolved. Under pressure from the communist majority in  parliament, S. Shushkevich began to yield small gains anyway:  Activity of the Communist Party was authorized, Kebich's  government concluded an agreement with Russia on extending the  period of stationing Russian troops on the territory of Belarus  for another eight years, and Belarus joined the collective  security system.    We will note that Belarus was compelled in the course of  seven years to overcome by itself the consequences of the  Chernobyl accident, when 70 percent of all radioactive emissions  fell on its territory. One-fourth of the territory of the  republic was exposed to radioactive contamination. The republic  expends 20-25 percent of the national budget on elimination of  the aftereffects of Chernobyl annually. At the same time,  Belarus is the most militarized state in the world: In 1991, of  each 1,000 persons, 43 were servicemen.    Belarus did not sustain the repeated increase in prices in  1993 for Russian energy sources: There was not enough meat or  other agricultural products, which were delivered to Russia at  cheap prices. A number of enterprises came to a halt, and many  began part-time operations. Lack of our own policy, and  corruption in the upper echelons of power, which involved even  the family of the prime minister, led to a crash of the  financial and economic system of the republic. Inflation reached  50 percent a month, the exchange rate of the "hare" with respect  to the ruble fell by a ratio of one to four. Kebich's government  led the country on a road to nowhere. Striving to hold onto  power a little longer, first two powerful ministries (internal  affairs and state security) were sent into retirement, and  afterwards also S.S. Shushkevich, chairman of the Supreme  Soviet, and the activity of the social military union BZV  [Belarusian Union of Officers] was banned. The elected speaker,  M. Hryb, is striving for dictatorship, declaring the need to  introduce the institution of the presidency, and postponing the  elections of a new parliament until the end of the year.    The inclination of Kebich's government to avoid  responsibility for the inactivity and corruption is now being  covered by joining a unified ruble zone with Russia. The  responsibility is thereby transferred to the Government of  Russia, and all material losses--to the Russian taxpayer.  However, Russia's infusions into the existing economy of  Belarus, considering the composition of the current government,  will be squandered and embezzled.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> SCHOOL BOARD MAKES CHOICE FOR TOP POST  </P> <P> The Oxnard Union High School District's five-month search for a new  superintendent ended Wednesday night when the board named the head of a small  Stanislaus County high school district to its top job.  </P> <P> Ian C. Kirkpatrick, 48, accepted the $87,000-a-year post left vacant with the  July 1 departure of Bob Cash.  </P> <P> Kirkpatrick, who assumes the post full time on Oct. 8, had been superintendent  of the Oakdale Joint Union High School District for the past five years.  </P> <P> "I hope to become an important cog in the wheel," Kirkpatrick said.  </P> <P> The Oxnard district, with six high schools and 11,000 students, has a student  body nearly four times larger and far more ethnically diverse than Oakdale,  whose three high schools enrolled 2,400 students this year. Minority students  compose 65% of Oxnard's student population, compared with 35% in Oakdale.  </P> <P> "Migrant, bilingual and bicultural education is something we'll be working on  as often as possible," said Kirkpatrick, a former social studies teacher and  track coach.  </P> <P> District trustees launched their search for a new superintendent in March when  Carter announced that he would be stepping down. He left the post he held for  10 years to take a job as superintendent of the Santa Clara Unified School  District in Northern California.  </P> <P> Trustees paid $12,000 to an assistant director of the California School Board  Assn. to help find a successor. The search yielded nine finalists from a field  of 50 applicants that included an associate dean of USC's School of Education  and superintendents of the Glendale Unified and Berkeley Unified School  districts.  </P> <P> The trustees interviewed all finalists before settling on Kirkatrick. Before  offering him the job last week, trustees visited with educators and board  members in his 440-square-mile district in Northern California.  </P> <P> "The words we kept hearing were 'hard-working, integrity, ethical and  conservative,' " Trustee Jean B. Daily said. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER  </P></p>

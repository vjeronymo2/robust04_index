			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Clydeport to float with Pounds 60m tag - Employees to sell part of shareholding in placing before end of year Clydeport Holdings, the privatised port operator on the river Clyde, is to come to the stock exchange via a placing before the end of the year. The flotation is expected to value the company at between Pounds 50m and Pounds 60m. Clydeport was formerly the Clyde Port Authority, operating the ports of Glasgow, Greenock and Ardrossan. It was acquired for Pounds 26m by its management and employees - led by Mr John Mather, now executive chairman - in March 1992 as part of the government's disposal of trust ports. Its wish to float then was thwarted by the abrupt drop in traffic caused by British Steel's closure of the Ravenscraig steelworks at Motherwell. The company has since been reorganised and invested Pounds 10m - with half contributed by the European Union - in upgrading facilities. Last year it purchased the Hunterston bulk terminal from British Steel for Pounds 4.8m, enabling it to start a large coal shipment business. Clydeport made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.4m on sales of Pounds 11.8m in the year to December 31 1993. This year it expects to make Pounds 4m on turnover of Pounds 16m. The company is 67 per cent owned by its management and employees and their families. Montagu Private Equity holds 28 per cent and 3i 5 per cent. Management and employees may sell up to a third of their holdings in the placing. Montagu Private Equity will retain only 6 per cent after flotation but 3i intends to retain its entire stake. The company is assessing institutional demand for its shares. Clydeport is also to raise Pounds 5m through an issue of new shares to redeem Pounds 2.5m of preference shares and provide cash. The company has property holdings, including a site at Yorkhill in Glasgow which has outline planning consent. But, Mr Mather stressed, 'ninety per cent of our business is ports'. The flotation is sponsored by Allied Provincial. Dr Ian Preston, chief executive of ScottishPower, and Mr James Millar, former chairman of William Low, are joining the board as non-executive directors.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Burton Shareholders who stumped up 30p a share to rescue Burton in the 1991 rights issue have done pretty nicely. Those who choose to take up their rights this time will find it harder to double their money. From the company's point of view the issue is clearly sensible: gearing at the year-end will be almost halved to an acceptable 27 per cent. The management gains the flexibility it badly needs to rejuvenate its store chains - some of which have not been refurbished for 10 years. The recovery story, which the City badly wants to believe, has been put on a sounder financial footing. Yet high commercial risks remain. There is no guarantee that the money will be spent effectively. Some chains, like Evans, are starting to test new store formats, but the results are not yet quantifiable. Others, like Burton menswear, require a total rethink. After the experiences of the 1980s, it may be an advantage that the company is not dominated by a single retailing visionary, but flair will be needed to capture the fickle fashion market. It is not yet clear that Burton has the spark. Then there is the question of all those different chains. An internal study has concluded that the company does not have too much space. But the chains need to be rationalised and the culture changed. Perhaps the difficulty in placing shop leases is a deterrent to slimming down the group. Investors will need strong nerves. It would strengthen resolve if the management were seen to be hacking through the thicket of shops.</p>

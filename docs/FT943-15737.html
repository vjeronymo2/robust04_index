			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: GEC disappoints The market showed its disappointment with preliminary results from GEC, the flagship of the UK's electronics industry, with the stock the worst performer among the FT-SE 100 constituents and sliding more than 8 per cent to its lowest level since January last year. Explaining the steep fall in GEC shares, dealers said the market had been expecting news of a successor to Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director, and was surprised at news that he is staying on for a further two years. Profits of Pounds 866m were only a fraction above last year's and well below the consensus forecast of Pounds 890m, while the dividend total was in line with most estimates. But analysts pointed out that the profits included an unexpected Pounds 18m exceptional charge for litigation costs involving Hughes Corporation, of the US, and that adding that figure back would have put the results virtually in line with most estimates. Analysts were said to be lowering the current year forecasts from the consensus figure of Pounds 960m to a number closer to Pounds 900m. Some analysts said the fall in the shares had been overdone. One commented: 'The post-results meeting was by no means gloomy and the company's cash generation was better than expected; this could be a good buying opportunity.' At the close GEC was 24 down at 270p, with turnover of 29m shares the highest in a single day since the profits warning issued last December.</p>

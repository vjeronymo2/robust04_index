			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bowman Cutter, special assistant to the </F> President for economic affairs, by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN  Washington correspondent Shigeru Omago; place and date not  given; first paragraph is NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN introduction]    [Text] In an interview by a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter,  Bowman Cutter, special assistant to the President for economic  affairs, expressed hope for setting objective criteria, which  Japan calls numerical targets, by incorporating figures for the  future and admitted that an understanding gap exist between  Japan and the United States. To promote discussions on this  issue, he stressed the need to hold ministerial meetings,  saying: "Talks should be held between Foreign Minister Kakizawa  and U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Kantor before the end of  June." Regarding macro policies, he expressed strong hope that  Japan will decide by July to reduce its taxes for three years  before making any tax increases. [Omago] Is it correct to  assume that Japan and the United States, at the recent  unofficial negotiations, confirmed that both countries will not  set numerical targets, that progress in market liberalization  shall be measured qualitatively and quantitatively by several  objective criteria, and that the discussions' goals [kyogi] are  to increase sales of foreign goods and services with competitive  power in the Japanese market?    [Cutter] "That is right."    [Omago] The USTR and other government organizations made a  proposal at negotiation meetings in individual fields, saying  they wanted to set future numerical targets regarding the number  of stores that sell foreign goods, and other matters. Do you  not think this is contradictory to the agreement reached at the  unofficial meeting?    [Cutter] "Such a U.S. proposal itself is not in conflict  with the Japan-U.S. agreement. Numerical target means we set up  specific figures as future goals and make it mandatory for Japan  to reach these goals. However, the U.S. Government does not  want that. Since we agreed to measure the degree of progress by  applying several objective criteria, which will be introduced in  each field, and not to use the degree of progress as an excuse  to impose sanctions, I am sure we can incorporate a standard  [kijun] regarding future figures into one of the criteria."    "Japan said last year that objective criteria figures must  be  used to measure progress made in the past because all numerical  standards for the future are numerical targets. This is not a  theoretic view. Because of this, we are having negotiations.  We are not saying we need a complete agreement on this point.  However, it is against the agreement for resumption of the  negotiations to refuse to have discussions on this matter."    [Omago] There is a deep-rooted view in Japan that the USTR  is taking the leadership for negotiations in the United States.    [Cutter] "I do not think we should separate the USTR from  other U.S. Government departments. Policies, even in the field  where the USTR is acting as a contact point for negotiations,  are determined by National Economic Council (NEC) secretarial  meetings . USTR Kantor is one of the top VIP's, if I may name  one. However, the final decisions are made by NEC secretaries,  including Rubin, special assistant to the President, USTR  Kantor, Finance Secretary Bentsen, and Tyson, Council of  Economic Advisers chairwoman."    [Omago] Some people in Japan think they can accept the idea  of setting objective criteria for foreign companies' procurement  shares only in the government procurement field. What do you  think of this?    [Cutter] "This is news to me. I have been talking to  Assistant USTR Barshevsky, who is in charge of government  procurement. I am sure she does not know about that either, and  we have not heard any proposals in this regard. However, it is  a good sign if there is such a proposal. It will be extremely  beneficial."    [Omago] Can you comment on macroeconomic policies?    [Cutter] "Both Japan and the United States made record of  the fact that Tsutomu Hata, then deputy prime minister and  foreign minister, explained to USTR Kantor at Marrakech in  Morocco a plan designed to cut taxes for three years before  making tax increases. This is a very important decision (aimed  at a significant reduction of Japan's current account balance).  We understand that Japan's political situation is in a state of  confusion. This does not mean, however, that Japan does not  have to come up with new macro policies in time for the  developed nations' summit talks in July (Naples summit)."    [Omago] Are you aiming to reach mutual accords on all  three priority areas -- government procurement, insurance, and  auto and auto parts -- before the summit?    [Cutter] "Ideally, yes. But, the reality is that we are not  setting a deadline. We will be satisfied if we can check the  discussions' progress, which are incorporated in last July's  original agreement between the top leaders of Japan and the  United States. There is no need for us to reach accords on all  three fields prior to the summit."    [Omago] Are the next deputy ministerial talks going to be  held?    [Cutter] "We would like to see, for a little while, how the  situation develops. Foreign Minister Kakizawa and USTR Kantor  will meet in Paris next week and ..." [ellipses as received]    [Omago] I am sure Foreign Minister Kakizawa will not be able  to go to Paris because the Diet is now in session.    [Cutter] "That is news to me too. It was Foreign Minister  Kakizawa's idea, so we were hoping the meeting would be held.  They should hold a meeting even if they are not able to meet in  Paris. If their meeting is held by the end of June, we will be  able to pave the way for subsequent negotiations."</p>

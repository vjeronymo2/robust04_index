			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (16): The bull market may be entering its final phase - Bonds / Last year's strong total returns in Europe are unlikely to be repeated in 1994, with a question-mark over current yield levels Although the outlook for Europe's government bond markets remains broadly positive, bonds are no longer an obvious buy. Brokers may be keen to point to the strong total returns posted by government bond markets in 1993, but the fact is that these are unlikely to be repeated. The Salomon World Government Bond Index posted total returns, in local currency terms, of 14.77 per cent last year: for currency-hedged, sterling-based investors, that rises to 16.03 per cent, and for hedged, D-mark-based investors to 17.76 per cent. Individual markets performed spectacularly: Italy returned 28.75 per cent and Spain 28.49 per cent in local currency terms; Sweden and Denmark both offered local currency returns of more than 21 per cent, while the UK reached 22 per cent. These returns take account of both the yield and the capital gains earned on bonds: one reason why they are unlikely to be repeated is simply that the long rally has brought yields down to much lower levels at the start of this year. This means that, even before looking at economic fundamentals and market expectations, there is a question-mark over the attractiveness of current yield levels. With Japanese 10-year government bond yields now down to around 3 per cent, that market is losing favour. Although the prognosis for the Japanese economy is far from good - and therefore short-term rates are likely to remain low - the prospects for substantial capital gains are limited. The US Treasury market is also falling out of favour: with continued signs of a pick-up in economic growth, some analysts expect short-term rates to start rising again this year. Although many dealers say the US Treasury market is currently looking cheap, after its latest sell-off, potential gains are likely to be made by technical traders switching in and out of the market, and it looks a rather risky market to hold. There is a general consensus that the European government bond markets are preferable to both the US and Japan, because they offer higher current yields and European economies are further behind in the economic cycle, and therefore interest rates still have some way to fall. But there is a widespread fear that, if US rates start to move up, the heavy flow of US investment which has poured into the European markets will be reversed, as US investors return to domestic funds such as money market funds. The current favourite among European markets appears to be Italy. The market has proved volatile, experiencing several sharp declines on concerns about political uncertainty. But these now appear to have been priced into the market, and there are widespread expectations that, in the longer run, yields have substantially further to fall. Although there could be further volatility ahead of the spring elections, there is growing confidence that Italy's fiscal problems have been tackled, and that a change in government would not bring fundamental shifts in economic policy. Mr Juonni Kokko, an international economist, at S G Warburg, points out that there is still a 300-basis-point spread between 10-year Italian and German government bond yields, leaving plenty of room for some narrowing. However, the partial collapse of the exchange rate mechanism has increased the importance of the currency component of bond investments. For example, unhedged sterling-based investors made their strongest gains in Japan, which returned 30.21 per cent; while Italy returned a relatively disappointing 13.37 per cent and Spain a paltry 5.75 per cent last year, according to Salomon Brothers. 'The big question is: are we going to reach an important watershed this year? Interest rates can't fall forever,' warns Mr Phillip Saunders, head of currency and fixed-interest management at Guinness Flight. 'Returns on bonds will be more a function of income, and currency will have a more significant effect.' For example, he said that the Spanish market was currently attractive, but only if the currency exposure is stripped out. Several analysts are also bullish on Sweden and Denmark. Phyllis Reed, international economist at BZW, recommends an overweight position in Denmark. 'We continue to think that Danish bonds provide decent value relative to the rest,' she says, citing expectations that Danish short-term rates could fall below those in Germany in coming months. But she is cautious on the outlook for the bond market's performance relative to equities: 'We are tending to say that people should shift into equity markets - and it is certainly a long time before we will start recommending cash.' While investors may improve their returns by choosing the right market or buying the long end of the yield curve, there is a growing note of caution, as the bull market for bonds appears to be entering its final phase. 'Bonds are still a good-looking one-year play, but in 1995 total returns will come down to below 10 per cent,' believes Mr Kokko.</p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Nissan cuts European suppliers to UK and Spanish plants NISSAN, the Japanese carmaker, has reduced the number of European-based components producers supplying its vehicle assembly plants in the UK and Spain by 8 per cent in the last year. It has cut the number of its suppliers in Europe to 431 from 470 a year ago, and the total is expected to fall to between 350 and 400 by the end of the decade, according to Mr Bob Hampson, Nissan Europe's purchasing general manager. The reduction of its supplier base, a trend common throughout the motor industry, is part of its attempts to rationalise the number of companies supplying its separate vehicle manufacturing operations in the UK and Spain. Of its current suppliers in Europe, Nissan has 214 in Spain, 143 in the UK, 36 in Germany, 20 in France, and seven in Italy. Its two European manufacturing operations, Nissan Motor Manufacturing in the UK and Nissan Motor Iberica in Spain, are expected to buy components in Europe worth around Pounds 1.2bn (Dollars 800m) this year, said Mr Hampson. NMUK, Nissan's Pounds 900m car plant at Sunderland, in north-east England, is forecasting total components purchases in Europe in 1993 of Pounds 850m from its 198 suppliers, with an output of around 270,000 cars. The Spanish operation, which is forecasting output this year of around 90,000 vehicles - most importantly the Terrano II/Ford Maverick four-wheel drive leisure utility vehicle and the Serena multipurpose vehicle - will purchase components worth around Pounds 350m from a total of 270 suppliers. The main reduction in supplier numbers has already been achieved by Nissan Motor Iberica, which been more than halved its supply base from 560 suppliers five years ago. At present, only 37 of Nissan's suppliers in Europe produce components for both its UK and Spanish operations. However, Nissan is pushing hard to increase the number of common suppliers as an important step in cutting the heavy losses of its less efficient Spanish business. The number of suppliers to its UK car plant has grown from 31 in 1986, when the Sunderland factory first began small-volume production, to the present level of 198. The main effort to rationalise the supply base will continue to be in Spain, where Nissan acquired the former Motor Iberica operations in the early 1980s, together with its diffuse supplier network then common to the European motor industry.</p>

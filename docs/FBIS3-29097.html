Recalling that the United States, instead of seeking a  negotiated solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula, has unilaterally broken up dialogue and even sent an  ultimatum to the DPRK threatening it with "sanctions," the  statement said it is a scheme to stifle the socialist system of  the DPRK and destroy its independent national economy.    Noting that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was  caused by the United States' deployment of nuclear weapons in  South Korea, it strongly urged the United States to immediately  withdraw its nuclear weapons from South Korea.    The statement called upon the Indian and world peaceloving  people to lift up louder voices of justice for thwarting the  moves of the U.S. warmaniacs against the DPRK.</p>

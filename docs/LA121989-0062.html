			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURVEY FINDS WHITE STUDENTS MORE APT TO ABUSE DRUGS  </P> <P> A drug-use survey of students nationwide found that white high school seniors  are more apt to abuse drugs than black seniors, according to figures released  Monday.  </P> <P> "It goes against conventional wisdom -- particularly television has portrayed  the problem of drug abuse in the United States as a black, inner-city problem,"  said Doug Hall, vice president of the national Parents' Resource Institute for  Drug Education Inc.  </P> <P> Atlanta-based PRIDE surveyed 296,180 white students and 59,898 black students  in grades 6-12 at 958 schools in 38 states during the 1988-89 school year,  including students in inner city areas in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston,  New York and Washington, D.C.  </P> <P> "The key is keeping teen-agers in school," PRIDE co-founder Marsha Keith  Schuchard said in a statement. "Black students who stay in school have  significantly fewer drug and alcohol problems."  </P> <P> The focus on inner-city drug use by blacks "feeds the increasing expressions of  racism that surface daily in our country," she said at a news conference  announcing the survey results.  </P> <P> "The preoccupation with blacks and crack also misleads white parents into  underestimating the temptations and dangers their teens face from the  multibillion-dollar drug culture."  </P> <P> Judge Reggie Walton, associate director of the Office of National Drug Control  Policy, called drugs an American problem.  </P> <P> "For all too long, this problem has been portrayed as a black problem, and I  think the end result has been that there are some people who have not really  cared a lot about it because of that," he said. "This is an American problem,  not just a black problem."  </P> <P> The survey found that "black students find cocaine about twice as available as  white students, but they use cocaine less than white students, by a substantial  amount," Hall said.  </P> <P> About 15% of black students overall said cocaine was easy to get, compared with  8% of white students who responded that way, he said, noting that cocaine  referred to both the powder and its smokable derivative, crack.  </P> <P> However, in the 12th grade, in which some 40,000 students were surveyed, only  4% of the black students said they had used cocaine at least once in the  previous year, while 7% of white students said they had done so.  </P></p>

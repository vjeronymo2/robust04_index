			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / German pay demand set at 5%: Consumer price increase sours mood after moderate wage claim A CLAIM for a basic 5 per cent pay increase for 2.3m west German public sector workers next year was cautiously welcomed yesterday as the first sign that wage-driven inflation might be brought under control. However, the mood was soured by provisional figures which showed consumer prices had risen 0.5 per cent last month, leaving the annual inflation rate unchanged at 3.7 per cent. Most economists had expected a small decline. The pay demand, agreed by national leaders of the oTV union yesterday, compares with last year's 9.5 per cent basic claim. This led to a bitter 11-day strike in the spring. It raised hopes that a deal could be struck around the 3 per cent level that the Bundesbank considers necessary in all sectors in the west if inflation is to be combatted effectively and interest rates reduced. But the claim also raised the prospect of a difficult negotiating round for the federal government, the main public sector employer. Professor Herbert Hax, leader of the 'five wise men' who give Bonn independent economic advice, recommended a pay freeze for public officials. Although private sector groups, including banking, insurance and steel workers, are pressing claims of 7.5 per cent, the oTV leaders appear to have taken account of the accelerating economic downturn and non-stop campaigning for pay restraint by government, employers and the Bundesbank. 'Such a realistic demand can only be positive,' said economist Mr Peter Pietsch at Commerzbank. He expected oTV to settle for 'three-point-something' and a similar pattern in the private sector. Other unions appeared to be showing much more flexibility than in the past two years, when settlements of between 6 and 7 per cent contributed to inflation increases, he said. Although steel workers' representatives earlier this week refused a 3 per cent offer, the rejection came without the threats which characterised last year's wage negotiations. 'Much too high,' said Mr Dietrich Beier at Berliner Bank. Taking into account oTV's as yet undefined demands for a 'social component', he guessed the claim was worth 6 per cent or more. 'The right number is 3 per cent; 3.5 per cent is too high for the Bundesbank and too high for the solidarity pact,' he said. Chancellor Helmut Kohl is seeking agreement on a solidarity pact involving opposition parties, unions and employers, aimed at solving the economic crisis in the east and countering recessionary tendencies in the west. Government officials, who are expected to start negotiations with oTV before Christmas, will enter the talks with little room to manoeuvre. Bonn is pledged to limit increases in spending next year to 2.5 per cent. If it sets an example to the private sector with a settlement deemed 'unsuitable' by the Bundesbank, then prospects for lower interest rates in the new year would be damaged.

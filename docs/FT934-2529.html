			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Brussels looks to EIB first for infrastructure loans The European Union should turn first to the European Investment Bank for loans to fund heavy investment planned for transport, energy and telecommunications networks, finance ministers agreed yesterday. Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister who chaired yesterday's meeting of EU finance ministers, said the EU would have to consider other means of funding trans-European networks only if the EIB had reached its borrowing limits. On Saturday, EU leaders confirmed that Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.8bn) of annual spending on networks would come from the existing EU budget, and Ecu7bn of loans and guarantees from the EIB and the new European Investment Fund. But during the summit, some leaders and finance ministers - notably from Britain and Germany - criticised European Commission proposals to raise an extra Ecu8bn a year through the issue of 'Union bonds'. If the EIB could provide the extra funds, it would provide a simple way out of the potentially divisive debate about extra financing. Mr Maystadt said yesterday the issue would be examined by the council of ministers, the Commission and the EIB 'to deepen the analysis of the limits of EIB involvement'. He said Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, had designated Mr Henning Christophersen, economics commissioner, to co-ordinate trans-European networks policy. Separately, ministers formally agreed the legally binding macro-economic guidelines which will be the basis of economic convergence during the next phase of European economic and monetary union, which begins on January 1. The original draft guidelines were modified to take into account the summit's conclusions. The agreed text suggests using new fiscal measures - for example, environmental taxes - to fund a decline in social security revenue. The guidelines include a general call for lower interest rates, wage restraint, lower budget deficits and lower government debt.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Unions Council, which includes all  production associations, has released the following communique:    1. The democratic process to elect a president of the  Republic has been honest and has made it possible for the people  to express their will in accordance with constitutional  provisions and regulations. The National Unions Council  therefore reaffirms its support for the process and endorses the  sovereign decision that has resulted in the election of the  president of the Republic.    2. The Council voices its deep concern about the serious and  negative consequences resulting from the way in which the  controversy over the alleged use of drug money in the recent  electoral campaign has been conducted.    3. The Council invites all Colombians to remain calm and  composed, as required by the circumstances, in analyzing and  reporting the facts and asks that the Prosecutor General's  Office promptly reach conclusions in the corresponding  investigation.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Solveig Rodsgaard: "Strategy and Alphabet </F> Games"]    [Excerpt] "We have plenty of time," is Prime Minister Poul  Nyrup Rasmussen's standard response when the question of the  election date is raised.    That may be so. But all the parties, including the prime  minister's party, are falling over themselves to get into  position for the election campaign that has not yet begun  officially. Every single statement made by leading politicians  in one party is dissected by the leaders of the other parties,  and a lot of time is spent on possible party combinations each  day. It is predictable, but entertaining.    Actually an incredible amount of political energy is spent  on  establishing a strategy prior to the as yet unknown election  day. At the same time nothing big is happening in the Folketing.  The parties always go off the rails in the last part of an  election period when they know the election must be  held by a certain date. It is unusual that the parties  experience an entire election period in strict accordance with  the text of the Constitution, for decades elections in Denmark  have been held every other year on the average. The last time  the Folketing went into the fourth year of an election period  was in 1987, under Poul Schluter, when practically all of 1987  was taken up with guessing that the election would be held in  late fall. However Schluter struck earlier and called the  election for 8 September.    Therefore the fact that it created such a commotion recently  when Holger K. Nielsen, chairman of the Socialist People's Party  (SF), spoke of closer cooperation between the SF and the Radical  Liberals must also be attributed to the current unofficial  election campaign. His stand was received positively by the  Radical leader, Economic Minister Marianne Jelved. However  Nielsen has been talking about this cooperation ever since the  SF issued a government program that could include the Social  Democrats, the SF, and the Radicals a year and a half ago. And  if one looks closely at what Jelved actually replied to Nielsen  recently, she did not directly invite the SF to participate in a  government with the Radicals, but acknowledged that the two  parties have common interests in a number of areas.    The Radicals do not feel the SF has passed the litmus test  yet. This concerns economic responsibility, and as long as the  SF Folketing members do not vote for the budget bill they cannot  be accepted as one of the group. According to the Radicals, who  have always scolded parties that are unwilling to share  responsibility for the budget.    But naturally the hard-pressed Center Democrats (CD)  immediately dissociated themselves from Jelved's statements  about closer contact between the SF and the Radicals. CD leader  and Industry and Coordination Minister Mimi Jakobsen will not  sit in a government based on SF support. The CD's emphatic  stance and the continued uncertainty about the placement of the  Christian People's Party after the election continue to create  turbulence about the party's cooperation in Poul Nyrup  Rasmussen's four-party government, to the great irritation of  the prime minister.    Regardless of the uncertainty about the placement of the CD  and the Christians after the election, the Liberals and  Conservatives have more or less written off the two small  parties in the nonsocialist bloc this time around. Both Uffe  Ellemann-Jensen and Hans Engell have done so publicly. Thus the  only thing the opposition can do is suggest a VKZ  [Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party] alternative. And that is  what they are doing, no matter how skeptical the Conservatives  are about this constellation at times.    The most probable outcome after the Folketing election is a  continued Social Democratic-Radical minority government that can  seek support from the SF and/or the CD and the Christian  People's Party. Drawn up against this government will be a large  offensive Liberal Party, the Conservatives, and the Progress  Party, and at the same time the Liberals and Conservatives will  start drawing the CD and the Christian Party back into the  nonsocialist fold.    Prime Minister Rasmussen will probably not throw the CD and  the Christians out of the government, although many members of  the Social Democratic Folketing group and many local party  people are sick and tired of having to make allowances for the  two small parties. If Rasmussen dismisses the CD and the  Christian Party he will have the same problem as his predecessor  in the prime minister's office. Mimi Jakobsen, Erhard Jakobsen,  and the other CD members along with the leaders of the Christian  People's Party have never forgotten how Poul Schluter threw them  out of the four-party nonsocialist coalition in favor of the  Radicals after the 1988 election.    Those wounds have not healed, nor will they heal. But the  election results for the CD and the Christian People's Party may  be so poor that they themselves decide to leave a government led  by the Social Democrats. Just as the Radicals left the  nonsocialist government after the election defeat in 1990.    However, for the time being the two small parties think they  are in the right company in the government and that they are  given extensive consideration. At the national congress of the  Christian People's Party in Kolding during the holiday at the  end of April there was no real criticism of the party's  participation in the government. However party leader Jann  Sjursen would not say who the party would back after the  election, but only stated that they will campaign as an  independent party.    And, paradoxically, some of the demands the Christians will  make for providing a new government base cannot be met by the  Social Democrats, but can be by the nonsocialist parties.    These include such things as the old Christian special  issue,  namely the demand that mothers or fathers who stay at home to  care for their children receive financial support from the state.    On the other hand, the Christians are on a collision course  with the Liberals and Conservatives in their attitude toward  leave programs and tax reform, among other things. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: ICL appoints advisers in run-up to flotation ICL, the UK-based computer manufacturer in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority stake, has appointed advisers in the run-up to its proposed flotation on the London stock market. It said yesterday that it had appointed Schroders as merchant bankers and Cazenove as lead broker, assisted by Warburg. The search for financial advisers has been under way since the beginning of the year. Fujitsu paid Pounds 743m for an 80 per cent stake in ICL two years ago; at the time it said it would float at least 25 per cent of the company in London within five years at a minimum price of 225p a share, giving ICL a tag of not less than Pounds 1.2bn.</p>

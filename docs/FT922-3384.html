			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Arts: Dejavu - Theatre Just over 25 years on, John Osborne has done it again. Dejavu is not Look Back in Anger, nor is it meant to be, but it has every claim to become the most talked about play in London. The only reservation apart from the length  -a good three hours - and the uncertainty about how to bring it to an end is whether you need to know the earlier piece in order to enjoy the latter. My guess is that Dejavu just about stands in its own right, though a thorough grounding in Look Back would help the appreciation immeasurably. Osborne has forgotten nothing since the height of his powers. A quarter of a century later, Jimmy Porter and Cliff are still there, relatively affluent now and with Jimmy tending to be known as JP. The change is that instead of Alison, Jimmy's wife, there is now Alison, his daughter, and instead of Helena, his wife's friend, there is now Helena, the friend of his daughter. The rest of the plot, if you remember it, is much the same right down to the use of the ironing board and the switch of allegiance. Apart from the sheer pleasure of seeing Look Back revisited, there are two fundamental reasons why this production by Tony Palmer works so well. One is that Osborne at his best is such a brilliant stage-writer: the words and the allusions come tumbling out, joke after joke. The other is that this Jimmy Porter - the ageing John Osborne in all but name - is played by the youngish actor, Peter Egan. The decision to go for Egan in the end rather than some older hand like Peter O'Toole is crucial to the success. It means that even when JP is at his most cantankerous and bilious, he still has a youthful charm. The danger of playing him like a stereotype - angry young man turned reactionary fogey  -has been avoided. Although Egan appears to get through enormous quantities of red wine and champagne in the course of the show, it never seems that it is wholly the drink that is talking. This is Porter Senior reflecting on Porter Junior: curiously enough he tends to the conclusion that the generation of the 1950s had it better. Jimmy looks younger than Cliff (Gareth Thomas), as perhaps he always was at heart. What the pair of them still have in common, however, is the ability to turn on a double act. The two man cabaret show is at the heart of their performance. Where Osborne scores, just as he did in Look Back and also in The Entertainer, is in mixing the corniest of old music hall jokes with the most literary. Some of the awfullest old lines are repeated, like 'my feet hurt' - 'why not try washing your socks?' Then we are off with 'Auntie Wordsworth'. Osborne's language is steeped in Shakespeare virtually every other line. Remember that team of comics, Jock and Day, who stood tiptoe on the misty mountain top? This mock-literary stuff is the preferred home of Jimmy and Cliff. They were, as one of them says in Dejavu, camp before anyone knew what it meant. There are also the Osborne swipes at fashionable trends. JP has become a wine snob, and uses the language to dismiss the Nicaragua '89. In the Osborne world there is now an A level in joined-up writing; for GCSEs you do Elton John since nobody has heard of T S Eliot. The local shopping precinct is called after Winnie Mandela. But the style is not repetitive because the jokes are so infinitely varied. There is a lot more besides. The Sunday papers are back: Osborne claims not unfairly to have invented the category 'posh'. The bears and squirrels of Look Back now appear regularly in the Valentine's Day messages in The Times. If the earlier work was seminal, this is an essential catch-up.

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Wholesale fall leaves Bridgend at Pounds 25,000 Bridgend Group blamed a downturn in turnover at its wholesale distribution offshoot for a fall in profits from Pounds 295,000 to Pounds 25,000 before tax for the six months to end-June. The division's sales fell from Pounds 6.32m to Pounds 5.6m leaving group turnover from continuing operations some 7 per cent lower at Pounds 7.6m. Operating profits of the sector declined from Pounds 661,00 to Pounds 317,000. The group has interests in distribution and leisure. It said its investment programme had 'paid off' and that it had received 'indicative offers' for certain of its businesses. As a result, the company expected significant sales in the second half. Earnings per share emerged at 0.06p (0.7p) and the interim dividend is reduced from 0.2p to 0.1p.</p>

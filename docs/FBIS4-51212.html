			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Abounding in natural  maritime resources, Zhejiang Province is boosting fishing,  industry, foreign trade and tourism, and building more ports.    A provincial official said that Zhejiang will draw on the  experience of other provinces and overseas in the development of  its maritime economy, and encourage people to tap the natural  resources under the principle of "those who invest in and  develop the economy will benefit from it."    With a vast population but limited territory, Zhejiang has  2,100 islands with combined coastlines of more than 6,300 km.    Its rapid economic development with poor natural resources  on  land has forced the province to focus on the ocean.    So far, Zhejiang has set up eight breeding bases for aquatic  products, and sent more than 100 ocean-going ships to the  Pacific Ocean to catch fish, and process and sell it in  neighboring countries.    Last year saw the province reap a good fishing harvest for  the tenth year running. It caught 1.56 million tons of aquatic  products and exported 200 million U.S. dollars-worth of them.    According to the official, localities in Zhejiang have spent  more than 300 million yuan on building 35 ports and docks over  the past five years.    At present, Zhejiang has a total of 58 sea ports, which have  relations with more than 200 ports overseas.    The province has formed an integrated group of ports with  Ningbo and Zhoushan as the centers.    The power industry is developing alongside the port  construction, according to the official, as state enterprises  have invested more than 10 billion yuan in this field over the  past five years.    So far, a number of power plants have gone into operation.  Included are the Beilun Power Plant, Jiaxing Power Plant and  Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, which have helped the province to  raise its power-generating capacity by more than 40 percent.    In addition, the province is making full use of wind, water  and tidal power to generate electricity.    Being an up-and-coming area in tapping ocean resources,  Zhejiang has improved tourist facilities and services to attract  more tourists from overseas.    Islands that have opened to tourists at home and abroad  include Putuo mountain, one of China's four sacred places of  Buddhism, and the Chengsi isles, known as the "Oriental Hawaii".    A survey shows that the number of visitors to these islands  had increased to more than two million last year.    The official noted that the discovery of oil and natural gas  deposits in the east China sea has enhanced the provincial  government's determination to expand the oceanic economy.    About 20 trans-national corporations from Europe and America  have come to the offshore areas off Wenzhou, Zhejiang, to  prospect for crude oil and natural gas since last year.    "All this indicates that Zhejiang's maritime economy is in  the ascendant," the official said.</p>

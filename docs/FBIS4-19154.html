			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mats Knutson report: "Colliander New Party Leader in New </F> Democracy"]    [Excerpts] Vasteras -- On Saturday evening [9 April]  Harriet Colliander, 51, was elected New Democracy's new party  chairman by a large majority.    With voting figures of 101 to 63 she knocked out her main  opponent, Sten Dybeck, in the second round of voting.    Outgoing party leader Ian Wachtmeister, who supported  Dybeck,  was most dissatisfied with the outcome of the election. Instead  of congratulating his successor, he openly criticized Colliander  at the congress for a lack of leadership.    "That felt a bit sad. If we are going to have any peace so  we can work in the Riksdag group I think it is best that  Wachtmeister leaves his seat in the Riksdag," Colliander  responded a little later at an improvised press conference.    Harriet Colliander is the leader of New Democracy's group in  the Riksdag. This is another post she has taken over after Ian  Wachtmeister after he announced that he would leave the post of  party chairman.    Colliander is single, has two grownup children, and is  closer  to the political center than her predecessor.    However, she denied that the election of a new party leader  will mean a shift to the left in New Democracy's policies.    "But in future we will not be as unconditional in our  support  for the government as we have been in the past," she said.    Harriet Colliander also claimed that New Democracy will  become more democratic under her leadership. For example, she  is critical of the party organization that was forced through  and which means that the Riksdag party only enters into  cooperation agreements with local party organizations.    "For the party to be able to be strong it must see itself as  a whole," she declared, adding that she wants the return of the  old arrangement under which local associations were also  formally part of New Democracy.    The election of a new party leader on Saturday evening had  been preceded by a long and bitter power struggle within New  Democracy, with one side chiefly represented by Harriet  Colliander and Bert Karlsson and the other by Ian Wachtmeister  and his supporters.    For several weeks the two factions have been fighting each  other in the media and at the party's offices in Stockholm.  Several people have resigned or taken sick leave after divisive  rows. Despite this internal conflict Harriet Colliander  believes she can unite the party.    "After everything that has happened I believe everyone is  longing for peace and quiet. It therefore would be tragic if  Ian Wachtmeister were the one in the party upsetting its  internal calm," she said.    Ian Wachtmeister, who left the party congress immediately  after Colliander was elected his successor, thinks that she must  give evidence of clearer leadership if the party is to be welded  together again.    "I think that she will have a much more difficult time  uniting the party than Sten Dybeck. Not least because she  belongs to one faction and therefore carries a taint. But there  is a chance if Harriet sharpens up her ideas and becomes a  leader instead of someone who allows herself to be led," said  Wachtmeister, who claimed that it is Bert Karlsson who controls  the new party leader. [passage omitted]    The wounds go deep after the conflict within New Democracy.  Ian Wachtmeister himself was only partially successful when it  came to winning some redress from the congress, which he has  been demanding since the party executive stripped him of all  powers as party leader last week.    Wachtmeister had demanded that the congress dissociate  itself  from the majority on the party executive, including Harriet  Colliander. Instead the congress only adopted a general  statement put together by Bo Sillen to the effect that the  executive's decision was incorrect and that it had harmed  Wachtmeister.</p>

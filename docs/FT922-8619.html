			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Waldegrave pledge on openness in government THE GOVERNMENT will publish the membership of cabinet committees, which make many important decisions, within the next few days, Mr William Waldegrave said yesterday. He also pledged the publication of the 'guidance for ministers', rules which prevent conflicts between ministers' private interests and public responsibilities. Opening the fourth day's debate on the Queen's Speech, the Citizen's Charter minister denounced the 'disastrous attempt to make the state the production manager' of services and industries. The initiatives follow a general election undertaking by Mr John Major, the prime minister, to promote more open government. There should be far more openness 'from Whitehall to the local school', Mr Waldegrave said. To a cacophony of protests and interventions from the Labour left wing, Mr Waldegrave devoted the bulk of his address to outlining the shortcomings of state ownership of industry and public services. Nationalisation had been damaging both for the industries concerned and consumers, he said. It was 'the central initiative' of Mr Major's administration to return government to its 'proper role' and the remaining nationalised industries to the marketplace. The philosophy was not shared by all Conservatives present, however. Mr Robert Adley, the Tory MP for Christchurch, cautioned against the automatic assumption that the state has no role to play in any of the leading industries or services. 'We don't want Wessex fighting Mercia in privatised armies,' he said. Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary and a contender for the Labour party's deputy leadership, called for 'stupid' Treasury rules limiting public-sector access to private finance to be changed. Ms Glenda Jackson (Lab Hampstead and Highgate), one of several MPs to make maiden speeches during yesterday's debate, said Britain should do more for the Third World, targeting aid on the poorest countries and on the basic requirements of health care.

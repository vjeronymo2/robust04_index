			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / The Markets: Race for top job raises profile of the OECD - Economics Notebook For years the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has seemed the cinderella of the international bodies set up after the second world war to help manage the global economy. Without the financial largesse of the World Bank, the intimidating prescriptive mandate of the International Monetary Fund or the high profile negotiating role of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, it has been easy to dismiss the 24-nation OECD as a mere talking shop, tucked away in one of the more desirable residential areas of Paris. But suddenly there is a rush of high level candidates for the OECD's top job, which falls vacant in September. As soon as the UK government disclosed last week that Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, was seeking the post, others came forward or confirmed long nurtured ambitions to be OECD secretary general. Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the French diplomat who has held the post since 1984, confirmed that he would seek another five-year term. Already in the field was Mr Donald Johnston, a little-known former middle ranking Canadian economics minister, who has been given assurances of US support. Germany put forward Mr Lorenz Schomerus, a senior economics ministry official, who has been closely involved with the OECD since 1987. At first sight, the story might seem a familiar one of the great and good jockeying for a comfortable, well paid tax-free post in one of the world's more agreeable capitals. But the global economy is in a period of profound and radical change and the OECD, which exists to promote co-operation among its industrial member states, is swept up in these developments. How its shareholders respond to the choice of candidates will determine how the organisation evolves into the next century. The British argue that Lord Lawson is the ideal candidate. Officials make much of his vast experience and suggest that the OECD has adopted too low a profile under Mr Paye. With Lord Lawson in charge, they say, the organisation would be given a new sense of direction. It is indisputable that Lord Lawson is fascinated by public policy issues. Although the last years of his chancellorship were marred by rising inflation and cabinet discord, his tax reforms were bold and innovative. He moved decisively to strengthen the UK economy through micro-economic measures and apparently feels that other industrialised countries could benefit from this experience. As chancellor, he was active on the international stage and has since become involved with central and eastern Europe - also a preoccupation of the OECD. The British government also has an obvious, but unstated desire to increase high level UK representation in international organisations and so dilute France's dominant hold over such posts. In promoting Lord Lawson's candidacy there is a clear presumption in Whitehall that the OECD needs a high profile, heavyweight political figure in charge who can knock heads together if necessary. But does it? Political clout is a necessary adjunct to negotiating with and among governments, and is very important when an organisation has money to disburse. It is helpful in the cases of the IMF managing director and World Bank president. Mr Peter Sutherland's political background and experience served him well as GATT director general in the final stages of the Uruguay Round trade negotiations. But it is not so self evident that the OECD secretary general needs to be a political heavyweight. The OECD has no big money to dispense. More than 75 per cent of its FFr1.58bn (Pounds 170m) annual budget is expenditure on personnel and pensions for its 1,900 staff. Its work involves policy analysis, gathering statistics and organising meetings. Publications are the main tangible result of its efforts. Some OECD countries actually favour its low profile, arguing that the organisation should think of itself as the wholly-owned subsidiary of its 24 industrial member governments. They value the non-partisan analysis of the OECD secretariat, which can cover issues ranging from macro-economics to trade, the environment, education, health and technological change. This does not mean the OECD cannot be innovative. The organisation's work in the 1980s in assessing the cost of agricultural subsidies was a genuine breakthrough that helped bring the GATT talks to a successful conclusion. The OECD has also changed rapidly, forging close links with eastern Europe and the fast developing countries of east Asia and Latin America. One result is that its work on eastern and central Europe has expanded to account for 10 per cent of its activities as measured by the budget compared with nothing four years ago. The accompanying charts show how the industrial world's share of global output has declined since the early post war years. But instead of diminishing interest in the OECD, this shift of economic power has triggered growing awareness of the organisation among non-member states. Membership negotiations are underway with Mexico. South Korea would also like to join, as would Poland, Hungary and the Czech republic. Last week, Mr Paye cited the list of aspiring member states in support of his own candidacy and as evidence that the organisation must be doing something right. That view will not guarantee his re-selection. There will be much horse trading in the months ahead, and there is a strong feeling in the US that the OECD has been a European fiefdom for too long. But at present, with one strong political candidate against three eminences grises, the odds seem weighted against the organisation taking a radical change of direction. This is Peter Norman's last notebook until after Easter when he returns from sabbatical.</p>

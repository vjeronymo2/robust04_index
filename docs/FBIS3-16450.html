			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] At least two states, Russia and Ukraine,  are closely watching how the sociopolitical situation in Crimea  is developing. As is known, on 27 March, the elections of  deputies to the Republic's Supreme Soviet will take place; but  this will not be the only thing happening. The recently elected  President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov has made his amendments to the  election campaign by signing on 10 March a decree which provides  for the people of Crimea to be polled simultaneously. Yevgeniy  Novikov has the details from Simferopol.    [Novikov] According to the presidential decree, Crimea's  citizens are to reply to three questions on 27 March: whether it  is necessary to restore the 6 May 1992 Crimean Constitution  which provides for the interrelations between Crimea and Ukraine  to be regulated on the basis of a bilateral treaty; whether the  people of Crimea are entitled to dual citizenship; and whether  the Crimean president's decrees should be granted the force of  law.    Taking into account the Crimeans' active support for Yuriy  Meshkov's policy, there is no doubt that all three questions  will be answered in the affirmative and this will enable the  Crimean president to take a tougher stance at the talks with  Ukraine and to receive commanding powers in Crimea analogous to  President Yeltsin's powers in Russia.    However, the Central Electoral Commission took the liberty  of  disagreeing with the president's decree and adopted Special  Resolution No 21. The Central Electoral Commission's resolution  says that polling of Crimea's citizens is not envisaged by the  law on elections and that the president, in appointing his  representatives to the Central Electoral Commission, has grossly  violated the Republic's Constitution and therefore must bring  his decree in line with the legislation in force, that is to  say, the decree should actually be abolished.    Legal experts are now urgently working on resolving the  conflict which has arisen. On the one hand, Meshkov was indeed  too late in giving notice about the poll that was being  prepared. On the other hand, the Central Electoral Commission  has no legitimate grounds for instructing the president what he  should do.    For the time being it is also not clear whether the poll of  Crimea's citizens will take place on 27 March. It is unclear  what the legal consequences are of such a poll.    Meanwhile, Yuriy Meshkov has signed one more decree on the  dissolution of Crimea's Council of Ministers. The decree is  perfectly in line with the Crimean Constitution, but runs  counter to Ukraine's Constitution. Ukraine president's aid  Mykola Mykhalchenko expressed the hope that Crimea's Supreme  Soviet would not agree with Yuriy Meshkov's unconstitutional  actions. However, Crimea's parliament did not find anything  unconstitutional in the president's actions.    Time will tell how events will develop further, but it is  obvious that relations between Crimea and Ukraine are again  beginning to worsen.</p>

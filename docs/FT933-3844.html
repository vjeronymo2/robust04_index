			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: A case of financial incompatibility Sir, Norma Cohen's article, 'Doors slam shut in salesman's face' (September 8), revealed some interesting figures. I believe she should have gone further in terms of explaining the implications. At the moment the commission payable on an annual premium personal pension plan is broadly related to the potential premium paying term to retirement - in other words, the greater the difference between the starting age and the retirement age, the higher the commission paid. For example, where a client pays a premium of Pounds 10,000, which is classified as 'annual', a sum of about Pounds 8,000 would be stripped out in commission over a period of just more than two years. By contrast were the premium to be classified as 'single' the commission taken out and payable immediately would be equivalent to about Pounds 480. Independent intermediaries are certainly not above criticism where the question of commission is concerned, but it is interesting to note from the figures produced in your article that those employed by the banks and building societies as salesmen of 'tied' products sell 150 per cent more personal pensions classified as annual rather than single. By contrast, 'insurance brokers, solicitors, accountants and others' (independent intermediaries) sell 34 per cent less annual vis a vis single. If Mr Wadsworth of consulting actuaries Watson &amp; Company is right about bancassurance accounting for 30 per cent to 50 per cent of the UK retail financial services market by the end of the decade, these figures must be cause for concern as far as the consumer is concerned. In our view commission and financial advice make incompatible bedfellows. As fee-charging independent financial advisers we believe the figures prove that not nearly enough has been done to raise the public awareness of the increasing trend towards poorer value for money products.

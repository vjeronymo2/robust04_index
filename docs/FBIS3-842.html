			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lagos, 14 March (PANA) -- Education and Youth  Development Minister Iyorchia Ayu has promised tough new  measures against cult activities on the campus of the country's  universities. Ayu, speaking in Benin, capital of mid-west Edo  State at the weekend, said that law abiding students and  security agents would continue to "receive the full backing of  government" in dealing with cultism. He did not elaborate, but  urged parents and teachers to advise their wards against acts of  indiscipline, saying that "beyond financing of facilities is the  need for moral re-armament." "The nation is going through a  despicable phenomenon in our school system. Our collective  psyche has been assaulted by the tragic wave of secret cults on  our campuses. Bizarre killings, intimidation, violence and  indiscipline precipitated by activities of secret cults on our  campuses is daily on the rise," the minister said.    His statement came in the wake of the closure of University  of Lagos (UNILAG) on Saturday [12 March] by the authorities  because of alleged cult activities by the students. On 2 March,  suspected student cult members clashed openly at UNILAG,  incurring the wrath of the student union, which accused the  university authorities of inaction and launched an anti-cult  capaign that crippled academic actitives for two days. In  closing the university, the authorities cited "arson and general  breakdown of law and order", saying that while they "condemn  cult activities, hoologanism and indiscipline" should not be  condoned. The registrar, Dr. A.A. Omotosho, has also announced  the proscription of the students' union.    He said in a statement that "for the avoidance of doubt, all  students union organisation by whichever name they are  described, including students' union caretaker committee, are  hereby proscribed." The registrar said that last Saturday, some  1,000 UNILAG students "raided" the Lagos home of the  university's former lecturer, Idowu Sobowale, just as he  addressed a press conference, alerting the nation on the  "takeover of the institution by gangsters". The students were  alleged to have destroyed household items and abducted the wife  of Sobowale, who is now editor-in-chief of a metropolitan  newspaper, THE REPUBLIC. Sobowale's wife reportedly escaped  when the bus in which she was being conveyed by the students ran  out of fuel.    Cult activities, reminiscent of American-type campus  fraternities in the 60s, assumed a worrying dimension in  Nigerian institutions of higher learning in the 80s resulting in  a government clamp down. Initially, the Nigerian campus  societies were a varitable vanguard for anti-colonial campaigns  in the country. But later day societies manifest violence and  despicable tendencies. In the past months, security agents have  reported the arrests of some 300 suspected student cult members  in different parts of the country. Some of them were shown on  national television in their strange dresses and carrying  weapons, including matchetes, with which they reportedly  terrorise the campus communities.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Executive Committee member </F> Samir Ghawshah, in Tunis, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo, date not  given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Jundi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, what new principles  must the upcoming Palestinian-Israeli negotiations be based on  after a full month of hiatus following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre? How do the Palestinians envision the next talks?    [Ghawshah] Undoubtedly, the negotiations will be based on  the  practical implementation of the Declaration of Principles. But  we can say that the new talks must focus on accelerating the  Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho as a practical  preparation for the full implementation of the Declaration of  Principles. This will be the first step in the interim stage  before subsequent steps are taken to reach the final stage.    [Al-Jundi] Do you believe that the arrival of the first  groups of Palestinian police in Gaza beginning on Tuesday is a  real beginning to the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement?    [Ghawshah] The arrival of the first group of police is part  of the latest agreement on the security measures following the  Hebron massacre. We are supposed to begin these moves within  days, on Thursday at the latest, for the entry of the first  battalion of the Palestinian police force. We believe that this  is the beginning of a tangible step that must be followed by  others. We will discuss a timetable for the entry of the  Palestinian police as soon as possible during the negotiations.    [Al-Jundi] Do you think that the Palestinian police force,  still in its initial stage, can protect the Palestinian people  under the occupation, or must international forces impose  themselves at this stage?    [Ghawshah] The Palestinian police will face no problem  except  from one side, the armed settlers. This is a major  responsibility that also rests on the shoulders of the Israeli  police. International observers must be deployed in areas where  Palestinian forces are not, such as Hebron. But for us, we  believe the Palestinian police force, when its deployment is  completed, can perform its duty and face all eventualities,  including aggression by settlers, especially in Gaza and Jericho.    [Al-Jundi] Has the relationship among the Palestinian force,  the Israeli Army, and the Jewish settlers been decided?    [Ghawshah] This is one of the points being discussed at the  Cairo negotiations.    [Al-Jundi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, the Palestinians have asked  that the Palestinian-Israeli talks be transferred to Cairo  instead of Washington. This is because of the Egyptian  diplomacy's clear activity in reconciling the two sides at the  negotiating table, which is known as positive mediation.    [Ghawshah] There is undoubtedly a big qualitative difference  in the role and effort. Before anything else, Egypt is an Arab  country. It has its clear position in supporting the rights of  the Palestinian people, and it has a positive role in pushing  the negotiations toward the practical implementation of the UN  resolutions, including Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.  In addition, Egypt knows the details and it is geographically  close. This makes the Egyptian role effective. On the other  hand, so far the United States has not been playing its full  role. It has not been an active partner. U.S. officials have  often said that they would leave the Palestinian and Israeli  negotiators without intervention in their negotiations. But the  fact was that the Americans were biased toward the Israelis. In  short, we can say that the Egyptian role is outstanding. The  efforts of Egyptian diplomacy were clear in both the  negotiations and in supporting the struggle of the Palestinian  people until they achieve their full rights, including their  rights to repatriation, self-determination, and the  establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem  as its capital.    [Al-Jundi] Thank you.    [Ghawshah] You are welcome.</p>

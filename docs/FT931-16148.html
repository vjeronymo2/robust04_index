			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Burton To many it will be a shock that Burton can have got this far through the recession with 930-odd surplus staff at head office. But at least the management responsible for such excess has gone, and the new chief executive, Mr John Hoerner, has tackled costs decisively. The head office cuts should flow through to profits directly, while the store changes will provide the flexibility to improve service and possibly sales. Cutting costs is one thing, handling Burton's badly needed strategic change is another. Until recently group companies vied with each other as much as their high street competitors, and the group has always been less than the sum of its parts. Mr Hoerner may be trying to change that, but Burton has 10 shop brands and thousands of disparate outlets. Fostering corporate co-operation from the high street through distribution to buying and suppliers is a complex task. Such a cultural revolution is hard enough in a simple business: at Burton the odds on success must be long indeed. That may not stop the shares recovering further. With Pounds 1.7bn of sales and minimal profits, any economic growth and cost reductions will have a dramatic effect on earnings. At present the market wants to back that view. But fashion retailing means keeping up with rapidly changing trends, which costs money the company can ill-afford. Mr Hoerner may wish to capitalise on market enthusiasm, and buy the elbow room he needs, with a well-timed rights issue.</p>

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Mercury's regulation plea MERCURY, the main competitor to British Telecommunications, yesterday called for more 'focused' regulation of the telecoms industry. It also warned against over-regulation. Its call came in its response to draft proposals by Oftel, the industry regulator, which would force BT to account separately for its 'retail' and 'network' businesses in an attempt to promote greater competition. Rather than full accounting separation on Oftel's model, Mercury wants Oftel to concentrate on prices that BT charges competitors for 'bottleneck' services - those over which it has a virtual monopoly. The most significant is access to BT's local network to 'deliver' calls the last leg of their journey. Mr Terry Rhodes, Mercury director of competition policy, said: 'We want to see more focused regulation, not an increase in regulation all round.' Mr Rhodes welcomed BT's proposal for a 'menu' of prices for particular services as 'a big step in the right direction' - but said that the basis for apportioning costs for each service needed to be refined. Mercury's submission marks a significant development in its attitude to regulation, reflecting its status as an increasingly effective competitor to BT. The cable TV companies, still fighting to establish themselves, want to see a bigger Oftel able to monitor and check BT's activities in detail.</p>

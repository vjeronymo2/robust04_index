			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Rover dives to losses of Pounds 83m - Recession affects most British Aerospace divisions, though Gulf war benefits defence and construction THE ROVER Group motor vehicle operations plunged from profits of Pounds 103m to pre-tax losses of Pounds 83m last year in the face of the deep recession in the UK new car market. Rover, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, also suffered an additional extraordinary loss of Pounds 45m arising from the withdrawal from the US car market and the costs of closing Sterling Motor Cars, its US car marketing subsidiary. Vehicle operations suffered a trading loss of Pounds 52m (profit Pounds 65m). The trading performance improved in the second half of the year, however, with Pounds 45m of the overall trading loss coming in the first half. Turnover at Rover was virtually unchanged last year at Pounds 3.74bn (Pounds 3.79bn) and accounted for a third of BAe's group turnover. Despite a fall in sales volume and production, Rover's turnover was helped by an improved model mix and prices increases. The company also stood largely aloof from the discounting price war started by Ford, the UK market leader, last summer. Rover's vehicle production fell by 16.2 per cent to 419,861 (501,323). The fall was cushioned by a 36 per cent jump in output to 35,952 of the Honda Concerto (included in the above figures) at Rover's Longbridge, Birmingham, assembly plant. Honda, the Japanese car maker, owns a 20 per cent stake in Rover's vehicle operations. Excluding the Honda production, Rover's car output fell by 19 per cent to 329,335 (406,253), while output of Land Rover four-wheel drive vehicles (including the Range Rover, Discovery and Defender ranges) fell by 20.5 per cent to 54,574. Rover car sales worldwide fell by 12 per cent to 351,588 (400,821) with the main decline coming in the UK with a 21 per cent decline to 224,278. Car sales outside the UK rose by 9.2 per cent to 127,310 helped by significant increases in Italy, Spain and Germany. Japan also remained Rover's biggest single market for the Mini. Mr George Simpson, Rover chairman and deputy chief executive of BAe, said that Rover had reduced its workforce by 6,000 last year (including 2,000 salaried staff) to 35,500 at end of 1991 and a further 400 jobs had been cut in January. Rover's financial performance in the second half of last year had improved 'substantially', thanks to swift actions taken to cut costs - Pounds 50m was taken out of annual fixed costs during 1991. Inventories had been reduced significantly and had shown a year-on-year fall of more than Pounds 200m. The group's break-even manufacturing level had been reduced by 80,000-90,000 vehicles and was now significantly below 450,000 vehicles a year, he said. Investments this year were expected to fall from Pounds 255m to just over Pounds 200m in 1991. Mr Simpson said that Mr Kevin Morley, formerly managing director for Rover Cars' commercial operations, had left the company during the recent reshuffle of top management. He remained a non-executive member of the Rover board but was 'no longer an employee of the company'. Mr Morley had formed his own company, Kudos, to provide 'integrated marketing services' to Rover, but it had not yet been decided which services Kudos would provide and which would be supplied by sub-contractors. Mr Simpson said that the formation of Kudos was aimed at reducing Rover's marketing costs per vehicle.</p>

Charles Bolden, Ken Reightler, Franklin Chang-Diaz, Jan  Davis, Ronald Sega and Sergey Krikalev spent slightly more than  eight days in space and returned to the earth at 22:19 (Moscow  time). The landing was postponed by almost two hours due to bad  weather.    The crew conducted 35 scientific experiments in the sphere  of  material science, medicine and biology with the use of the  spacehab laboratory and an installation for the production of  super-clean thin films. The research was made to order of  scientific and industrial organizations of the U.S. and Russia.    The flight is the first stage in the bilateral Mir-shuttle  program, which will continue to the planned Alfa International  orbiting station after several joint flights.    As for the immediate plans, a flight of Vladimir Titov  (whose  back-up is Sergey Krikalev) with a joint crew on board the U.S.  shuttle is scheduled for January 1995. Titov is training at the  Johnson Center (Houston, U.S.A.). Both U.S. astronauts, whose  flight is scheduled for March 1, 1995, with the 18th main  expedition of the Mir orbiting station have started training  this week.    Bonnie Dunbar, the wife of U.S. astronaut Ronald Sega, and  Norman Thagard are training at the Gagarin Cosmonaut training  Center, the Moscow region.</p>

It approved  several projects that will be implemented in cooperation with  the EC and Middle Eastern countries.    The Cairo meeting is the first of several planned by the  Economic Development Committee during its meeting in Copenhagen  on 8 and 9 November. A program called the Copenhagen Work  Program was drawn up then.    The agreement reached today provides for four agricultural  projects to be implemented with the cooperation of Egypt, the  occupied territories, Israel, and Jordan. Agreement was also  reached to implement a project involving cleaning up pollution  in the Gulf of Aqaba and preserving marine life and coral. This  project will be carried out with the help of the gulf's littoral  countries. Agreement was also reached to carry out a joint  tourism project involving Egypt, Israel, and the occupied  territories.    Dr 'Adil al-Biltaji, chairman of the board of directors of  the Egyptian Agricultural Research Center and Egypt's  representative at the meeting, told MENA that agreement was  reached to establish four networks through which expertise and  data will be exchanged with the aim of promoting research in  various spheres.    Dr. al-Biltaji explained that the first sphere is connected  with natural resources, notably desert plants, and ways of  protecting them. He said each regional country will make  efforts in one particular sphere and all the resulting  information on available natural resources will be exchanged and  coordinated. He said this project will be carried out through  the joint efforts of Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Turkey and in  coordination with Italy. He added that the EC will provide  financial backing for this $125-million project.    Dr. al-Biltaji said the second project is connected with the  effects insecticides have on the soil. The aim is to minimize  the use of insecticides and prevent harm to people, plants, and  natural resources like water. [passage omitted]</p>

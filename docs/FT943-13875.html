			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Ban on Shia sect teachings The Malaysian government will ban the teachings of Darul Arqam, a radical Malaysian Islamic Shia group led by the self-styled Abuya Sheikh Imam Ashaari Muhammad. In June, officials described Darul Arqam as a threat to national security and the government has accused Ashaari Muhammad of building an armed, 313-member suicide squad trained in Thailand. No evidence has been produced on the suicide squads. Darul Arqam, founded in 1969, claims a following of 10,000. Group publications say Ashaari preaches returning to life as the Prophet Mohammed decreed.</p>

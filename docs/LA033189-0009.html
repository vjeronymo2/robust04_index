			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: FIPPLE FLAUTISTS PRACTICE PUCKERS FOR A 'NIGHT WATCH'  </P> <P> Listen very carefully Saturday, and you just might hear the strains of an old  English dance tune, "The Night Watch," floating through the air. Recorder  players from Australia to Alhambra are being asked to synchronize their  watches, and at precisely 2 p.m. PST thousands of them are expected to play the  centuries-old song on their ancient flute-like instruments to celebrate the  50th anniversary of the American Recorder Society. "The old saying that there's  strength in numbers will be felt," said Tim King, director of the seven-member  Albany Recorder Ensemble in Albany, Ga. "This will give us an opportunity to  share with people all over the world in a common event." Andy Green, the  society's administrative director, said recorders are popular because they  don't take a lot of skill to produce pleasing music. To ensure the greatest  participation, the society, which has about 4,200 members worldwide, mailed  copies of the song as well as starting times in various time zones -- late  evening in Europe, Sunday morning in the Far East -- and urged the fipple  flautists to "be sure to synchronize your watch to the second with the radio or  the time telephone number." It also gave a suggested metronome tempo.  </P> <P>  -- When Parsippany, N.J., Mayor Frank Priore learned that one of the town's  employees was a traffic scofflaw, he suspended him for one day without pay and  ordered the police chief to issue a $20 ticket. The fact that the errant  employee was himself didn't faze him one bit. "I think that was the fairest  thing I could do with myself," he said. Priore didn't realize he had been  driving with an expired license since 1987 until he was contacted by a  reporter. But as head of the city's police department, he said he had to set an  example. He based his punishment on what a police officer would face in the  same situation. He said the notice to renew probably was sent to his former  address.  </P> <P>  -- A former Indian beauty queen at the center of a British sex and politics  scandal has been in hiding on the island of Bali, Indonesian immigration  officials said. Pamella Bordes, 27, went into seclusion after the British  tabloid press linked her to an unnamed Cabinet minister, two British newspaper  editors and a Libyan security official. The suggestion of a connection with  Libya, with which Britain has no diplomatic ties, sparked an outcry about  possible security breaches at the House of Commons, where Bordes worked for a  Conservative member of Parliament.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 10 Feb 94 Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] In a news conference before his departure for the  United States on 9 February, Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister  cum foreign minister, commented on reports that U.S. Treasury  Secretary Lloyd Bentsen criticized Japan's comprehensive  economic stimulus package as "a small step." Hata reacted  strongly, saying: "The United States may be thinking it is  something like a tax rebate. The package worth a total of 15.25  billion yen is the largest in scale in history. The United  States does not yet understand what it is about."    Asked about the view that the United States might incite a  further increase of the yen value on the exchange market should  the Japan-U.S. framework talks end in failure, Hata said: "The  exchange market is something that reflects the fundamentals  [preceding word published in English] of that nation. An  incitement by words only does not have a long-lasting effect."  He then complained harshly: "An official in an influential  position should be very careful about what he says."    Speaking about his talks with top U.S. leaders preceding the  Japan-U.S. summit meeting, he reiterated the position of not  accepting U.S. demands in the economic framework talks regarding  numerical targets. He said: "Japan is making steady progress  toward removal of its surplus. If I speak frankly, they will  probably come to understand it." But he added: "I would like to  hold a dialogue, based on the principle that numerical targets  cannot be accepted."</p>

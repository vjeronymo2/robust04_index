			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Professor Svyatoslav Fedorov: "If We Wish To </F> Live Decently....: Five Conditions of Economic Stabilization"]    [Text] I am writing these lines several days after the  program report of the president to the parliament of Russia,  awaited by everyone, on most important questions of the  salvation of the state. But even following Boris Nikolayevich's  speech, I believe, the main questions of the country's  development and its emergence from the crisis remain pertinent.  Urgent, decisive, and unerring actions in order first of all to  slow down and then to halt the decline in production are needed.  A powerful drive mechanism is needed. Incentives to labor are  needed.    Can the state today create the conditions for the most  productive labor of each employee? Of course it can! But the  following conditions, in my view, are needed for this.    The first and main condition is a fair evaluation  of the labor of each employee. The utopian socialism of Lenin  and Stalin collapsed because Soviet man's vested interest in the  results of labor was incredibly low. Labor was essentially  compulsory and differed little from camp labor. It has remained  such today also, for that matter. Why work hard if this does not  bring about a rise in the living standard? The individual's  detachment from the profits he produces makes him indifferent to  the very process of labor. And, on the other hand, a link with  profits from joint labor engenders a desire to work with maximum  input. This is easily achieved with the outfit's lease of the  instruments of production or their transfer to joint ownership.  It is very important in this case to fairly distribute the  instruments of production shares. It is simple and efficient to  divide them up according to length of service and pay over the  past three or four years. When we retire, no one objects to this  procedure then. Why not use it for the distribution of property?    A second version is possible also: the property remains  state-owned, but is leased to the outfit for a symbolic fee. In  a closed stock company collective property cannot be sold. There  is for this reason just one way of living better--working hard  and in high-quality fashion. But everyone should be confident  that no one can appropriate the results of his labor and should  for this know his percentage of the enterprise's monthly profits  which it has been decided to transfer to the wage fund.  Only the producers' vested interest in making a profit can  raise productivity and labor quality.    The basis of market price regulation is competition. But  what  kind of competition can there be in a monopoly state-run economy  other than competition between enterprises to raise prices?  Whoever raises the most, as at an auction!    I am speaking about indisputable, rudimentary matters, about  the thousand-fold tried-and-tested experience of economic  development. But we, as always, have our own way. So the market  train is idling beneath the magnificent arches of a station  called Government Monopoly.    A unique situation has taken shape with us today. The  executive has practically abandoned not only our property but  also ourselves to the whim of the waves. Consequently, we need  to persuade or compel the administrative-bureaucratic machinery  to give back, finally, our property directly to the producers  and citizens of Russia. We are all the legitimate, direct heirs  of our fathers, grandfathers, and great grandfathers.  Consequently, we are the owners of this property. There is no  need to redeem it: Any plant recoups costs in several years. The  years have passed, the plants have been redeemed. And who is to  pay? For what? According to what law? After all, the state,  represented by its bureaucratic machinery, cannot regard these  means of production as its own private property. But it is being  grabbed by those who are stronger and more impudent.    In order to change the slave mentality we need to afford the  individual the opportunity to dispose of the fruits of his  labor. Hand the plants, factories, institutes, and agricultural  enterprises over to the people who want to work independently,  are not afraid of risk, and believe in their own powers. They  would work at full stretch and invent and apply the latest  technology. They would work not eight but, if need be, 10 hours.  They would cut back on their leave. It would not occur to them  to stop production on holidays, and they would not think up new  days off for themselves, as is the case now. What kind of people  is it does, having made a hash of the economy, does not work for  half a year just about?!    Today the government's statistical office shamefully does  not  report to us on how things stand with regard to productivity.  But we know, in any case, that it has fallen sharply. And  whatever reason our economists and political scientists give to  explain this, one thing is clear: People no longer wish to plow  for others, they wish to plow for themselves. So give them this  opportunity!    Second condition. Having tackled the first, most  important task, we will realize that this is insufficient. For  the worker, even one owning property, can easily immediately be  fleeced by taxes, being deprived of the opportunity to make a  profit. We know how to suffocate with taxes, we have mastered  this art well. It is difficult now to enumerate our taxes, they  are more than 15, it seems.    The result is that we punish good work! Heck, we should have  Genghis Khan, after all, his "yasak" [tribute] was only  one-tenth, only 10 percent! His bureaucrat-brother, on the other  hand, 70 percent! He does not understand, this sharp mind, that  he is simply undermining the tax base itself, that he is cutting  the branch on which he is sitting. That ultimately he will have  nothing to collect from anyone.    It is essential that our authorities recognize that it  is rich enterprises, rich works, and rich people who should be  the basis of the country's budget. Let them replenish it  with one tax--income tax--and social charges. Previously Russia  lived with one tax--a poll tax--and that sufficed. The country's  budget should be filled up also by customs duty, a land tax, a  property tax, and a tax on the sale of raw material (under  strict control, of course) since we are a country that is very  rich in terms of material reserves. But collecting profits from  moribund enterprises, factories, agricultural enterprises is the  same as taking bread away from a participant in the Leningrad  blockade.    Dying enterprises are a separate problem. They are on the  point of declaring themselves bankrupt, and thousands upon  thousands of workers and employees will be unemployed. We will  have to pay them enormous sums from our money. But would it not  be better today to exempt them from profits taxes and afford an  opportunity for the rescue of the enterprises and rectification  of their economic position?    Having become the proprietors, the work force should switch  to a new type of remuneration of labor. We have over decades  become used to obtaining remuneration for labor in the form of a  certain ration. This does not work. The remuneration of the  labor of each should be part of the income of the enterprise  over a particular stretch of time, and at the end of the year,  part of the profits used to pay dividends. Fairness in  remuneration and economic glasnost are the basis of the high  productivity, good conduct, and creative initiative of each  member of the work force.    The third condition of success is the maximum  encouragement of investments in production. A most  important question of the efficient functioning of the economy  is the creation of new technology and its purchase  overseas. The government must contribute to this to the  maximum. Customs duty on new technology should, therefore, be  made purely symbolic.    Enormous investments are required for reequipping the plants  and factories. According to the most modest estimates, 25  percent of all industrial enterprises should be modernized. And  this would cost a minimum of R1.5 quadrillion. The national  budget, on the other hand, constitutes R120-130 trillion.  Understandably, the state cannot cope with such a task with its  forces. But it can create the conditions for large-scale  investments of its own and overseas entrepreneurs.    Every year native entrepreneurs take $20-25 billion out of  Russia. This money is going to develop the economies of Western  countries, since investing it in production here is unprofitable  (and unsafe: It is impossible to predict changes in the economic  and political situation).    The entrepreneur needs dependability and stability. So he is  taking his capital abroad. So the conclusion suggests itself:  Modernization of the existing enterprises and the construction  of new ones will only be a reality when it is more profitable  for the investors to do this on our territory than in other  countries. Investors should be the most esteemed people. They  are truly the saviors of the fatherland from ultimate economic  and moral collapse. I would recall that even in such  economically developed countries as the United States any  investor is wholly exempted from a tax on profits for three  years, the local authorities help him obtain cheap credit, and  he encounters a "green light" literally at every step.    The president and parliament are called upon to urgently  pass  a law on investments. This law must make the position of  investors with us more favorable than in other countries. It is  essential to exempt new enterprises from a tax on profits for  five years, assist in the purchase of land, and guarantee the  supply of energy, water, and other elements of the  infrastructure.    Were we to create conditions whereby exporting dollars  overseas would be an unprofitable business and they came to be  invested in the development of industry in Russia, 500,000 jobs  could be organized for this sum annually. And were we to add to  this the investments of states and entrepreneurs from overseas,  this could ward off the impending unemployment, and in politics,  nationalism developing into fascism, for which a slump in  production is the most nutrient medium.    The fourth condition of success is connected with  the price of raw material. We are doggedly proclaiming our  aspiration to move toward free world prices for raw material,  without seeing, however, how dangerous this is for the  development of our economy. Successful production is  possible only where the price of raw material accords with the  level of technology and the state infrastructure (roads,  power engineering, transport, communications). So free world  prices of raw material could simply strangle us. Our producer,  still weak, could not create products which could compete in  terms of price with the products of more developed countries.  This is why it is necessary first to create an infrastructure  similar to the world infrastructure and only then to gradually  release the prices of raw material.    A tremendous stream of raw material is crossing our borders  today, not the export product of our plants and factories. The  borders should be closed to unchecked exports of raw material,  and it is necessary for a transitional period to establish  prices that afford an opportunity for making the products of our  plants competitive. Currently, for example, the cost of the  VAZ-21099 automobiles on the domestic market is $10,000, but  overseas they sell for $3,500. It is not hard to understand that  the plant costs of raw material (ore, metal, energy) are being  covered from the pockets of our citizen.    It should, however, be made clear that there is also raw  material whose exportation would be profitable to us in all  respects. Thus there are on the Kola peninsula incalculable  deposits of the dumping of apatite-cephalin production, with  which our industry will never cope and which, moreover, are very  harmful environmentally. Exports of these "tailings" or their  development would be of great interest to many foreign  companies. So total prohibition is needless here. But, in any  event, it is essential prior to the achievement of normal market  relations to monopolize exports of raw material exports in the  hands of a specialized state committee under the strict control  of the State Duma.    Fifth and final condition. The country cannot  function normally without development of the infrastructure.  This means transport arteries, power engineering, the banking  system, communications. Substantial capital investments are  needed here. No budget resources of ours would be sufficient for  this. Consequently, investments in the infrastructure of  the resources of private individuals, enterprises, and foreign  entrepreneurs are needed. This applies primarily to means  of communication, without which a market economy is impossible.    The absence of a market infrastructure is severely impeding  the transition of the economy of barracks socialism to a market  economy. The monopolization by the state, the bureaucratic  machinery, in fact, of the entire infrastructure leads to the  dictatorship of the official prices of energy, land, and  transport. And for this reason not one self-respecting  businessman will take the risk of production in our country.  Mixed types of ownership in communications, transport, power  engineering, and other sectors could ensure stable and  competitive prices.    Free labor would afford an opportunity for breathing new  life  into agricultural production also. The countryside could obtain  from the prosperous townsperson more money for agricultural  produce. And this would make it possible to purchase equipment,  fertilizer, and lubricants. But until such time as the mass  prosperous townsperson appears, there will, of course, have to  be substantial government financial infusions also.    All that has been said above could, perhaps, be summed up in  just a few words. For a prosperous, decent life each of us must  want to work hard. The results of our labor are our main private  property. No one has the right to take away our profits without  our consent. But instruments, machine tools, and premises are  necessary for work. They would belong to us or be the property  of the collective or partnership. Raw material should be cheap  enough. It has, after all, been produced by nature, it is our  common resource. Only in this case can we bring our producer  onto the world market.    Generally, together with all, for the good of all.    A simple and precise formula. Why should it not be employed  in our country?</p>

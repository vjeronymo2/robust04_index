			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Quotation marks as received] </F>   [Text] Ostrava, North Moravia, May 26 (CTK) -- Czech  Premier Vaclav Klaus today rejected a statement by Defense  Minister Antonin Baudys who allegedly said on Wednesday in  Brussels that a visit of former Chilean dictator and the current  commander of the Chilean ground forces Augusto Pinochet to the  Czech Republic "actually ensues from Klaus' visit to Chile."  "Minister Baudys could not have said this. It is pure  nonsense, a lie. If Mr.Baudys did say this then it is  absolutely absurd and meaningless sentence," Klaus told  journalists here.    On Wednesday Baudys told CTK in Brussels that Pinochet's  planned visit to the Czech Republic was not an official one, a  visit "on a political level and a visit on the purely working  and trade level." "It actually ensues from Klaus' visit who in  Chile also spoke about mutual trade contacts. It is an  exclusively working and commercial matter and it has no  political background," he said.    Neither the government nor any government official has  talked  about the visit or organized it," Klaus said. "I cannot  therefore speak on behalf of the cabinet. This visit which is  more or less a visit aimed at looking for orders for the Chilean  army is a matter which does not directly concern the government  at all, he added.    Klaus pointed out that he did not see any reason for banning  the sale of Czech armaments to Chile or Czech private firms'  deals with Chile, which currently meets all democratic criteria.</p>

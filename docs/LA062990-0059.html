			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONFEREES BREAK DEADLOCK ON OIL SPILL BILL  </P> <P> Senate and House negotiators broke a months-old deadlock Thursday and cleared  the way for final passage this summer of legislation to help prevent and clean  up oil spills as well as impose higher liability payments on tanker owners.  </P> <P> House conferees yielded to the Senate and dropped a House-approved provision  that would have enforced two international treaties that set liability limits  for oil spills by ocean tankers and establish a global fund to compensate for  damages, up to a specified ceiling.  </P> <P> The Senate delegation unanimously opposed the treaties on grounds that the  liability limits were too low and that the international agreements -- never  ratified by the Senate -- would have the effect of replacing stiffer federal  and state laws on oil spills.  </P> <P> Two other major issues remain unresolved: establishing timetables for requiring  double hulls on tankers and barges and setting the upper limits of liability  for ship and cargo owners. A conference was scheduled for July 12 -- after the  congressional recess for the Fourth of July holiday -- in hopes of reaching  agreement on those items.  </P> <P> "I'm confident we can resolve the other issues and pass a bill this year," said  Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), a participant in the conference.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration favored the House approach on grounds that it would  give better protection against oil spills originating outside the three-mile  U.S. territorial limit and would not subject tankers to state laws providing  unlimited liability.  </P> <P> Senate Democratic leader George J. Mitchell of Maine led the fight against the  House provision, which would have implemented the treaties even though the  Senate has not ratified them.  </P> <P> "Only the tiniest fraction of vessels," he said, would be covered by the  treaties that would not be covered by federal or state law. "The purpose of the  protocols (treaties) is to preempt federal and state law." The House, however,  voted against federal preemption of state laws concerning oil spills.  </P> <P> In addition, Mitchell argued, the House provision would have shifted  responsibility for oil spills from those responsible for them to the American  taxpayers, who would contribute to the international fund. Sen. Max Baucus  (D-Mont.) said the international agreements -- concluded long before the Exxon  Valdez spill off Alaska -- were "outdated" and should be renegotiated before  the United States accepts them.  </P> <P> Under the international agreements, which have been ratified by 41 countries,  those hurt by an oil spill may first seek compensation from insurers for the  responsible party, with a ceiling of $75 million.  </P> <P> The applicants may then seek up to $260 million from an international fund  supported by the signatory nations.  </P> <P> Rep. Gerry E. Studds (D-Mass.), chairman of the House negotiators, said he was  relieved to have the issue resolved even though his compromise proposal was not  accepted.  </P> <P> The strong Senate stand and the unwillingness of the House negotiators to  change their position had led some lawmakers to believe that the dispute might  scuttle the legislation during this session of Congress.  </P></p>

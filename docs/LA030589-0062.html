			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INCLUDING FCA'S KNAPP IN S&amp;L STORY WRONGLY CREATED IMPRESSION OF GUILT BY  ASSOCIATION  </P> <P> On Feb. 20, The Times carried an article on five former savings and loan  executives, including our client, Charles W. Knapp, who resigned in August,  1984, as chairman and chief executive of Financial Corp. of America ("Behind  the Fallen Thrifts"). It was extremely unfair to include Knapp in a story with  persons who have been convicted of crimes or who are targets of criminal  prosecution; that improperly created the impression with your readers of guilt  by association.  </P> <P> Although your article on Knapp refers to "an internal FCA study done in 1986,"  it fails to state that FCA has refused to disclose the evidence supporting any  of the conclusions in its study. More than 4 1/2 years have elapsed since  Knapp's resignation and no criminal or administrative charges of wrongdoing  have been brought, nor does he have any knowledge of any pending investigation.  </P> <P> In October, 1986, Knapp filed a lawsuit against FCA in Los Angeles federal  court in which he alleged that FCA made false and defamatory statements about  him and improperly attributed to prior officers the responsibility for the  failures of his successors. In addition, Knapp's lawsuit alleges that the  matters for which he was blamed were disclosed in advance to and approved by  FCA's auditors, attorneys, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the  Federal Home Loan Bank Board and that the financial reporting of these matters  was approved by FCA's accountants, audit committee and entire board of  directors, which included respected members of the business, legal and academic  communities.  </P> <P> After Knapp resigned, he was named a defendant in several lawsuits. In the only  case in which there was a final ruling on the merits, summary judgment was  granted in favor of Knapp because there was no evidence "that Knapp was  personally involved in any of the alleged misconduct, conspired to commit any  of the alleged misconduct, or that he knew of it, authorized it, or ratified  it."  </P> <P> If you intended to report fairly, you would not have included Knapp in an  article with convicted or about-to-be-indicted persons and you would have  reported the facts set forth in this letter rather than quoting uncorroborated  and confusing innuendo from anonymous sources.  </P> <P> ARTHUR N.

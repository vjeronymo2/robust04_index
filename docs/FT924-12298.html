			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Investors scramble for UK's first D-Mark Eurobond issue and the largest to date in the sector by a substantial margin - prompted a burst of frenzied activity as investors rushed to take part in the transaction. The DM5.5bn five-year deal, arranged by Deutsche Bank, was substantially oversubscribed, underwriters said. The success of the deal marks a further step in the development of the D-Mark bond market, which is enjoying a vogue as one of the few bond markets where large financings can be completed. The D-Mark sector, benefiting from a flow of funds into a 'safe haven', seems set to fill the void left by the defunct Ecu bond market, and the creation of such a liquid benchmark will further the cause. The only room for potential conflict is the question of where liquidity will be concentrated. Frankfurt-based German banks are suddenly facing fresh competition from London-based international investment banks, which are drafting traders into the D-Mark Eurobond market. In either case, the competition to dominate the market is likely to help boost secondary market liquidity, which has been poor in the past. Last week's DM2.5bn issue for Sweden helped set the tone for the UK transaction. The five-year deal, launched at a spread of 45 basis points over the comparable German government bond yield, has tightened by five basis points. However, the initial pricing was widely seen as quite generous, in order to take account of Sweden's large funding needs. The pricing of the UK's five-year deal proved a pleasant surprise for some market participants, who had been expecting a more aggressive approach. Last week, as bidding for the mandate intensified, some banks were offering to launch the deal at a spread of five basis points over the comparable German government bond yield. However, the deal was announced yesterday with an indicated yield spread over the 8 1/4 per cent five-year BOBL - short-dated German government bond  -of 10 to 12 basis points. Although the deal is not officially priced until today, the spread will be fixed at the lower end of the range, at 10 basis points, due to strong demand. Some dealers said the issue could have been completed a couple of basis points tighter, but others suggested a double-digit margin was necessary to ensure the success of a deal of this size. Of the total issue size of DM5.5bn, DM500m is being kept back by the Bank of England to lend for repurchase transactions, which help ensure liquidity in the secondary market. The DM5.5bn deal forms part of the UK's Ecu10bn multi-currency funding programme announced in September in a bid to support sterling in the foreign exchange market. Since sterling has been suspended from the ERM, negating the original function of the programme, the proceeds will be used to repay short-term debt incurred through foreign exchange intervention. The first part of the financing consisted of a multi-currency revolving credit facility totalling Ecu5bn, drawn down in D-Marks and then sold for sterling. Following the D-Mark bond offering, a further Ecu2.5bn of funding remains to be completed by the end of the year. The government is also likely to refinance the Ecu5bn loan with an interest rate on drawings of 3/32 , in the bond market, where finer terms are available. The UK is one of a growing band of European countries facing increasing borrowing needs. As well as needing to replenish foreign exchange reserves and repay the Bundesbank for its help in foreign exchange intervention, recession has increased the amount of borrowing required to fund budget deficits in some countries. In addition to Sweden's offering last week, Norway, Finland, Belgium, Spain and Italy are among the countries considering tapping the German market. Denmark is believed to be preparing a Dollars 300m three-year transaction, for launch as soon as today. In the Swiss bond market, the European Investment Bank launched a SFr500m eight-year issue, which will provide a new benchmark and will be traded in Zurich and London. The deal was arranged by Swiss Bank Corporation.</p>

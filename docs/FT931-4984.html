			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Unions step up action at GPT UNIONS at GPT, the telecommunications group, are stepping up their campaign against the phasing out of collective bargaining at the company. The company, a joint venture between GEC and Siemens, has not de-recognised the unions but is increasingly by-passing them over pay determination through introducing individual pay assessment systems. This is being resisted by the AEEU engineering union, and the TGWU, MSF and GMB general unions. GPT, which has about 13,000 employees at plants in Coventry, Liverpool, and Nottingham, confirmed that it had introduced more performance-related pay but would make no comment on whether it was still involved in collective bargaining. The Engineering Training Authority is to establish a formal link with the Engineering Employers Federation, with EEF members automatically becoming members of the ETA.</p>

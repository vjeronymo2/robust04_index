			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMPLEX, COSTLY CLEANUPS MAY SNARL BASE CLOSINGS  </P> <P> The Presidio looks more like a park than a military base, with towering  eucalyptus and cypress trees shading lush lawns and creeks winding through  1,800 hilly acres above the Golden Gate Bridge and the Pacific Ocean. In fact,  it soon will be a park: The Army plans to move out in 1995 and turn over the  nation's oldest fort to the National Park Service.  </P> <P> Yet, beneath the Presidio's greenery lie the products of decades of spills,  leaks and ill-planned dumping of poisonous chemicals. An estimated 200 fuel  tanks, many thought to be leaking, are buried at the base. There are three  known sites of PCB spills as well as several uncharted landfills, their  contents unknown.  </P> <P> The Presidio is emblematic of the government's legacy at hundreds of federal  facilities across the country, from Energy Department nuclear weapons  laboratories and assembly plants to abandoned mines on Department of Interior  land.  </P> <P> Uncle Sam, who is supposed to enforce the environmental laws, is the country's  worst polluter.  </P> <P> "People don't understand their taxpayer dollars being used to create  pollution," said Rep. Dennis E. Eckart (D-Ohio). "You have to end the federal  government's attitude of 'do as I say, not as I do.' "  </P> <P> The price of cleaning up toxic wastes at federal facilities nationwide --  perhaps a 30-year task -- has been estimated at between $140 billion and $200  billion by the White House budget office. The Presidio cleanup alone is  expected to cost $10 million to $80 million. At California's heavily  industrialized military shipyards, air bases and weapons depots, the cleanup  bill may climb into the billions.  </P> <P> Now, with the Pentagon studying closure of more than 120 domestic bases,  pressure is building to speed investigations of the military's toxic problems  and correct them before the facilities are transferred to civilian use. The  trick will be finding the cash to do it.  </P> <P> "It is a problem of major proportions that has not been faced," said Rep.  Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), whose district includes the Presidio. "We have to  clean up our mess and we have to do it before we close these bases."  </P> <P> Nowhere are the numbers worse than in California. The Environmental Protection  Agency's list of Superfund sites includes 17 Defense Department or Energy  Department installations in California -- more than in any other state. Among  them: the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, which made the list in February.  </P> <P> The Superfund, a federal program set up in 1980 to pay for cleaning up the most  dangerous hazardous-waste sites, identifies places that represent the greatest  risk to public health and the environment.  </P> <P> By September, EPA officials hope to decide whether to propose adding the  Presidio and 23 other federal installations in California to the Superfund  sites. A further 154 federal facilities in the state must produce detailed  reports on their toxic problems. The reports will be reviewed as the first step  toward determining whether the facilities should be on the Superfund list.  </P> <P> Wastes present at these facilities run from radium (a radioactive substance  used for illuminated dials) to solvents, pesticides, coolants, paint scrapings  and old fuel. Waste from these bases has flowed into waterways, settled into  ground water and drifted into drinking water wells.  </P> <P> "There is so much left to be done before we have a complete picture of the  contamination," said Julie K. Anderson, of the EPA's western regional  headquarters in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Tests at El Toro have shown that a carcinogenic grease-cutting agent has seeped  into ground water. So far, the contamination has not been found in wells used  for public drinking water. But the Orange County Water District has discovered  a narrow stream of ground water 3 1/2 miles long stretching from the base to a  point between Jeffrey Road and Culver Drive in Irvine.  </P> <P> Federal and state officials will begin a two-year study in November to  determine the extent of the problem at El Toro and devise a cleanup plan.  Besides the grease solvent, early studies have uncovered evidence of jet fuel  and paint thinners dumped in several pits at the base.  </P> <P> Although private corporations spent much of the 1980s trying to clean the nests  they had fouled, the military only now is coming to terms with decades of  environmental abuses and neglect.  </P> <P> The delay is due in part to the Defense Department's long-standing insistence  that it was not subject to EPA regulation. That position changed in 1986 when  Congress, over the Ronald Reagan Administration's objections, decided that  contamination from military sources was, indeed, the EPA's business.  </P> <P> The Pentagon lost that fight but continues to oppose congressional efforts to  give state regulators the authority to impose fines and penalties on federal  agencies that violate environmental laws. Pentagon officials argue that giving  the states such power would inject politics into highly technical decisions and  skew cleanup priorities toward those states with aggressive, publicity-seeking  attorneys general.  </P> <P> As the severity of the problem becomes more and more apparent, the Pentagon  lately has made some concessions to California. The Defense Department recently  agreed to pay the state Department of Health Services to monitor military  anti-pollution efforts.  </P> <P> The fee will be only 1% of the cost of cleaning up the military installations,  but the dollar amount could be large. The cost of removing toxics from 11  Northern California naval bases alone will be $702.8 million, according to the  Naval Facilities Engineering Command in San Bruno. That estimate could be  "low," Randal A. Friedman, who is coordinator of cleanup efforts at Navy bases  in the Bay Area, warned.  </P> <P> Cleaning up Hunters Point naval shipyard, a Superfund site in San Francisco,  will cost $94 million. At Moffett Naval Air Station in Mountain View, also on  the Superfund list, the job is expected to cost $113 million.  </P> <P> At McClellan Air Force Base outside Sacramento, officials have detected in  ground water the solvent trichloroethylene (TCE), a suspected carcinogen, in  concentrations up to 13,000 times the maximum safe level. The Air Force expects  that cleanup bill to reach $100 million by 1992.  </P> <P> TCE has also seeped into ground water below Norton Air Force Base at San  Bernardino, one of the bases being considered for closure. "The question is not  whether (TCE) will pollute additional wells but how long will it take for it to  get there," said Lt. Mark Wright, chief of environmental planning at Norton.  The Norton cleanup is expected to cost $44 million or more and take decades.  </P> <P> State toxic waste regulators doubt that any of the military bases in California  conceals an environmental horror story on the order of Love Canal or the  Stringfellow Acid Pits, but officials have discovered that finding and fixing  contamination at a military installation is more complex than at most private  sites.  </P> <P> "(Bases) are basically like small cities. They handle everything. They have  sewer systems. They have underground tanks. They have landfills," said Donald  Dawlke, chief of the toxic cleanup division the San Francisco Bay Regional  Water Quality Control Board.  </P> <P> There are also more types of pollutants. While a company may pollute ground  water with pesticides, PCBs or solvents, military bases used, slopped and  dumped the whole spectrum of all-too-familiar toxins along with other, more  exotic poisons.  </P> <P> At Hunters Point, for example, asbestos, heavy metals, radioactive radium dials  and sand and paint chips from the sandblasted hulls of ships were dumped to  fill in 20 acres of tidal lands in San Francisco Bay, in the next cove over  from Candlestick Park.  </P> <P> The Navy left Hunters Point in the mid-1970s and contracted out its ship repair  business to a local company, Triple A Machine Shop Inc. The San Francisco  district attorney is prosecuting Triple A on 16 felony counts of illegal  dumping at Hunters Point.  </P> <P> Today, the Navy is back, embarking on an ambitious plan to clean the base. But  Friedman, the coordinator of the naval cleanup in the Bay Area, said that EPA  cleanup procedures are cumbersome.  </P> <P> "The amount of study you have to do is incredible," Friedman said. "The process  is inherently slanted to the conservative side. You don't want to remove 15  feet of dirt and find out a few years later you should have removed 20 feet."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Atomic Fallout Waste  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Boxer has called on the EPA to investigate what may be a byproduct  of the problems left by Hunters Point. In the years after World War II, ships  contaminated by fallout from atomic tests in the Bikini Atoll were cleaned at  Hunters Point.  </P> <P> Each year in the 1950s, sandblast waste, paint chips and other radioactive  trash were encased in concrete-lined drums, shipped 50 miles off San Francisco  on barges and dumped into the ocean near the Farallon Islands. Now, the drums  are feared to be leaking into what has been a rich fishery.  </P> <P> Military waste is not confined to federal bases and dumps. Over the years, the  Defense Reutilization and Marketing Services has sold old chemicals as surplus.  In several instances, chemicals bought for a few cents on the dollar have come  to haunt local officials.  </P> <P> At a congressional hearing earlier this year in Sacramento, Los Angeles  officials told of their continuing efforts to reclaim port-owned land in  Wilmington where a local businessman stored 40,000 gallons of stale solvents,  paints, batteries and decontaminants used on chemical warfare components. Some  of the materials were sold by the El Toro Marine base.  </P> <P> David McKenna, a deputy Los Angeles city attorney, estimated that the city has  already spent $650,000 on the Wilmington cleanup. If the chemicals seep into  ground water, the cost could exceed $1 million.  </P> <P> Solano County is prosecuting a man who bought 35,000 gallons of highly  poisonous and explosive chemicals at military auctions, starting in 1976, in  the hope of reselling them. They were stored in a barn near Collinsville, on  the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.  </P> <P> The chemicals, discovered last year, came from nearby military installations.  The cost of cleaning up the site topped $1 million, Solano County Deputy Dist.  Atty. Mark Pollock said.  </P> <P> California has sued to force compliance with state laws in the handling of  toxic substances at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, near Vallejo, and at Ft.  Ord, near Monterey. But courts have ruled that the state cannot collect money  from federal facilities that mishandle toxics.  </P> <P> Still, the state Department of Health Services has the authority to inspect  federal bases and issue citations. Health officials have found that some  military officials still have not learned any lesson from the past.  </P> <P> In a series of actions that ended in March, the state Department of Health  Services cited Mare Island Naval Shipyard, a submarine repair base at the  northeastern tip of San Francisco Bay, for sloppy handling of wastes.  </P> <P> State inspectors found 13 violations. Two concrete tanks holding 525,000  gallons of toxins were leaking. A barge held 20,000 gallons of waste oil. If  the drums ruptured, there was nothing to keep the waste from flowing into San  Francisco Bay. Perhaps most troubling was that the tanks had been in place  without proper permits for 13 years and may have been leaking all the while.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Base Closures  </P> <P> As the Defense Department studies closing 121 bases around the country, the  issue of toxics at military bases will loom ever larger. And, if the past is a  guide, the cost of decontamination will be dear.  </P> <P> In the Marin County town of Novato, two developers in 1985 agreed to pay $45  million for 400 acres at Hamilton Field, used over the years by the Navy, Air  Force and Army. But escrow has not yet closed because a 26-acre toxic dump at  the center of the 400 acres has not been cleaned up.  </P> <P> In the end, Boxer said, those 26 acres most likely will have to be fenced off  and abandoned.  </P> <P> The news that Moffett Naval Air Station, in Silicon Valley, might be closed was  cheered not only by peace activists (who said it could prove that closing a  base could benefit the local economy), but by developers also. They saw the  land reborn as a meticulously planned community with trails fronting San  Francisco Bay, reclaimed wetlands, a space museum and affordable housing.  </P> <P> But toxins buried at Moffett threaten to delay any such conversion. The Navy's  preliminary assessment is that wastes probably have leaked into the ground from  unlined holding ponds and cracked fuel tanks. Several landfills also contain  hazardous materials.  </P> <P> Just outside Moffett's fences is another Superfund site, one polluted by  semiconductor manufacturers. These companies say that efforts to clean the  plume of contaminated ground water have been stalled, first by Navy reluctance  to acknowledge that it contributed to the problem and now by the Navy's lengthy  study process.  </P> <P> "We're ready to start (the cleanup) right now," said Charles Bostic of  Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. Until Moffett identifies its pollution sources,  however -- a process that may take two or three years longer -- the companies  will not begin a cleanup for fear of aggravating a problem.  </P> <P> Of all the bases being considered for closure, none holds more promise than the  Presidio. Most of the complex will be left as a park. It is unclear what will  become of the grand officers' quarters, golf course and tennis courts, but  among the suggestions is one that part of the grounds be leased to a  university.  </P> <P> The military museum probably will remain and perhaps be expanded. The Presidio  was first held by the Spanish in 1776, then by Mexico and, finally, by the U.S.  Army. As the oldest military base in continuous operation in the United States,  much of its history is clouded and details of its waste problem are not known.  For example: There are three Nike missile silos on the base, but their contents  are unknown. The doors are welded shut.  </P> <P> Although transforming the garrison into a park is "the chance of a lifetime,"  said Brian O'Neill, director of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and  the official in charge of planning the Presidio's future, the Army must first  clean it up. He said the issue is "at the top" of his concerns.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Presidio Time Bombs  </P> <P> Studies conducted at the Presidio last year by Argonne National Laboratory and  the Army Toxic and Hazardous Materials Agency found "no imminent or substantial  threat to human life or the environment."  </P> <P> But the reports went on to say there are more than 200 underground fuel and  storage tanks at the base, that the locations and contents of many of them are  not known "with any reliability," and that some of them probably are leaking.  </P> <P> Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), a suspected carcinogen used widely to cool  electrical transformers, was spilled in at least three spots, and soldiers  dumped trash at some landfills not yet identified. A 1984 Army study found TCE  and other chemicals suspected of causing cancer or congenital defects in ground  water beneath the Presidio.  </P> <P> The worst known contamination is at and near Crissy Field, where San Francisco  holds its Fourth of July celebrations. The Argonne report predicted that toxins  under the old landing strip will not reach the drinking water supply, but it  warned that the "ultimate discharge point of this ground water is San Francisco  Bay, and marine organisms are thus threatened."  </P> <P> Saul Bloom of the Arms Control Research Center, a private group that advocates  converting military facilities to civilian use, said of the Presidio: "We might  have the first national park listed on Superfund."  </P> <P> </P> <P> CALIFORNIA'S MILITARY AND ENGERGY DEPARTMENT SUPERFUND SITES  </P> <P> Navy-Marines  </P> <P> Moffett Naval Air Station, Santa Clara County  </P> <P> Treasure Island Naval Station at Hunters Point,  </P> <P> San Francisco  </P> <P> Barstow Marine Corps Logistics Base  </P> <P> Camp Pendleton Marine Base, Oceanside  </P> <P> El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, Orange County  </P> <P> Air Force  </P> <P> Norton Air Force Base, San Bernardino  </P> <P> George Air Force Base, Victorville  </P> <P> March Air Force Base, Riverside  </P> <P> Mather Air Force Base, Sacramento  </P> <P> McClellan Air Force Base, Sacramento  </P> <P> Travis Air Force Base, Solano County  </P> <P> Castle Air Force Base, Merced  </P> <P> Army  </P> <P> Riverbank Army Ammunition Plant near Modesto  </P> <P> Fort Ord, Monterey  </P> <P> Sharpe Army Depot, Stockton  </P> <P> Sacramento Army Depot  </P> <P> Energy Department  </P> <P> Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,  </P> <P> Livermore.  </P> <P> PROPOSED FOR SUPERFUND STATUS  </P> <P> Edwards Air Force Base, Kern County  </P> <P> Concord Naval Weapons Station, Concord  </P> <P> Tracy Defense Depot, Tracy  </P> <P> Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Site 300,  </P> <P> outside Livermore.  </P> <P> Source: Environmental Protection Agency  </P></p>

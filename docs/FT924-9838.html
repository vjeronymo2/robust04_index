			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Turkey suffers interest rate blow A 5 per cent interest rate rise by Turkey's largest state- owned bank has dealt another blow to the anti-inflation policy of Mrs Tansu Ciller, the treasury minister. The interest rate hike by Ziraat Bank, the state agricultural credit bank, is likely to intensify competition for funds and raise the cost of the government's own borrowing at the weekly treasury auction. Lowering interest rates has been a central plank of Mrs Ciller's strategy to reduce the government's internal debt servicing - the largest budgetary item accounting for 20 per cent of expenditure. The financing of the public sector borrowing requirement - the budget together with the deficits of the state sector enterprises - is largely responsible for the 67 per cent inflation rate. In 1991 the PSBR rose to a record 12.5 per cent of GNP. Mrs Ciller's interest rate policy has brought her into conflict with Mr Rusdu Saracoglu, the central bank governor. Her earlier moves to increase liquidity as a way of exerting downward pressure on rates, briefly threatened the lira, before the central bank intervened, selling dollars to the market - an operation which cost the bank Dollars 2.3bn in the first six months of 1992. Mrs Ciller was also criticised for resorting to the bank to pay civil servants and other treasury expenditures. The legal ceiling on the central bank cheap lending to the treasury has now been reached, leaving Mrs Ciller with little option but to see the state banks raise interest rates to attract depositors. Ziraat's move, although seen as government inspired, also reflects the special problems of the bank which has been hit by a series of natural disasters like the Erzincan earthquake earlier this year, where it has had to reschedule credits.</p>

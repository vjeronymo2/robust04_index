			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Call to speed up road planning THE TIME it takes to get big road construction schemes under way could be cut from 13 years to four under radical proposals published by the National Economic Development Office today, Richard Tomkins writes. Nedo's report comes just days after Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announced an urgent investigation into the reasons for the long delays in planning road schemes. At present, most big trunk road and motorway schemes take up to 13 years to bring to construction because of long-winded public consultation procedures. Nedo believes a streamlined procedure would prove popular with road-scheme opponents and cut planning time. It proposes that: The Department of Transport should publish a 10-year plan for all forms of transport. The DoT should hand over responsibility for roadbuilding to an executive agency that could compete with the private sector for contracts. The first stage of any road scheme would be a conference of interested parties to agree a tentative plan. That would be subjected to an environmental impact assessment, then put on display for public comment before being submitted for planning permission. An inquiry could still be held, but would consider only matters of detail. Once the plan was published, anyone affected would be able to sell their land at market value plus a bonus of 20 per cent. If they opposed the scheme at a public inquiry, they would lose the bonus. A New Approach to Road Planning. Nedo Books, Millbank Tower, Millbank, London SE1P 4QX.

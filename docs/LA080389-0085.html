			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: ARBITRATOR RULES HALL RELEASED BY BRAVES FOR SUB-PAR PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> An arbitrator ruled Wednesday that the Atlanta Braves released outfielder  Albert Hall because of his poor play, not because he admitted to having a drug  problem.  </P> <P> Arbitrator George Nicolau, who heard the case last month, said: "Hall was  properly released under (terms of) the uniform players' contract. The club's  decision was made in good faith and was not improperly motivated and the  commissioner's drug abuse program did not prohibit the club's action."  </P> <P> Hall, 30, admitted to having a drug problem at the start of spring training. He  completed a drug rehabilitation program March 22 and was released by the Braves  six days later -- just before the deadline for releasing a player without  having to pay his entire salary.  </P> <P> The Major League Players Assn. filed a grievance, claiming that under the  commissioner's policy, players who come forward and admit having drug problems  may not be released.  </P> <P> Hall had a .254 batting average, five home runs and 64 stolen bases in eight  major league seasons.  </P></p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: East Asiatic lifts payout despite fall THE EAST Asiatic Company, which has extensive interests in the Far East, North America and Europe, plans to step up its dividend, despite a fall in net profits to DKr355m (Dollars 55.1m), the lowest figure for six years. Group sales increased by 13 per cent to DKr18.64bn. Earnings after net financial items were down from DKr513m to DKr400m and the group return on equity in the parent company fell from 8.8 to 7.8 per cent. However the company, which expects net profits to start climbing again this year, is increasing its 1991 dividend from 5 per cent to 9 per cent. Mr Henning Sparso, supervisory board chairman, said results at the North American graphics equipment and Plumrose food divisions were hit by the US recession. Operating profits on North and central American operations fell from DKr167m to DKr81m, on sales down from DKr4.65bn to DKr4.31bn. In Europe, a 1990 operating loss of DKr89m became a profit of DKr133m, on sales up from DKr5.55bn to DKr6.48bn. In Asia, operating profits increased from DKr364m to DKr415m on sales up from DKr4.23bn to DKr5.03bn. The group has five functional divisions: graphics equipment, trading, consumer products, Plumrose foods, and energy and property. Mr Sparso said the dividend increase was 'pedagogically correct', reflecting the board's conviction that the group was showing a generally sound and positive development. He said the company was budgeting for a sales increase of 16 per cent for the current year, and an increase in profits before depreciation and financial items of around a third.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HAULING CONSCIENCE OUT OF THE COLD  </P> <P> "Something has to be done to help the homeless." It's being talked and read  about every day, yet whatever is done seems merely temporary.  </P> <P> For instance: Some motels or hotels provide temporary shelter. Now on account  of the recent cold spell, an armory will open its doors to house some of the  needy. Food is being distributed. County social service agencies are trying to  help solve the problem. Yet, as I see it all happening, it is temporary help.  </P> <P> Having seen the sick, the helpless, the direly in need of care, I have a  suggestion which will get rid of each city's problem.  </P> <P> Purchase land in rural country to build a community for all these helpless  people. Build barracks, a hospital and cultivate its land. Have its  administration provide something to do for each able person there. Create a  feeling that life is worthwhile and renew self-respect.  </P> <P> It takes money. Funds from state and city and county. Then too, from churches.  For instance; Have Dr. Schuller of Garden Grove Crystal Cathedral ask its  Sunday congregation to donate $1 dollar to make this community possible.  Millions of donated dollars from millions of churchgoers can make this plan  come true.  </P> <P> PAUL SIMONE  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

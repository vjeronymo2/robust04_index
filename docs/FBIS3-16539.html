His rating was 7.1 on a ten-point scale (slightly down from 8.0  points last January), experts of the Russian Federation's  Political Research Center announced.    Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov ranks second -- 6.1  points  compared to 5.7 points in January.    Third comes Vladimir Isakov, leader of the Agrarian Party --  5.8 points compared to 3.7 in January.    Political scientists believe that the communists' and  agrarians' strong position is due to the success of the  political amnesty granted to the 1991 coup leaders and the  organizers of the hardline revolt last October, initiated by  them.    Leader of the Liberal Democratic Party Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  ranks fourth -- 5.5 points compared to 6.9 last January.  Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar went down from second place  in January (6.4 points) to fifth -- 4.9 points.    Observers also point to a noticeable success of former  minister of foreign economic relations Sergey Glazyev, who  represents the Democratic Party of Russia. He ranked sixth in  February, scoring 4.8 points (compared to 3.2 points in  January). Experts explain his success by the fact that Glazyev  had advanced his own economic program.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nationwide sale shows lessons to be learnt Sir, Andrew Taylor's article ('Estate agents pay price of boom years', October 13) gave members of the Nationwide Building Society useful information about why their estate agents' offices, bought at an average price of Pounds 400,000, were sold at a price of three for a pound and why, as a result of the directors' judgment, their accumulated funds are now Pounds 200m lower than they might otherwise have been. While Nationwide's members are now informed, their power base is too diffuse for the directors to be held accountable in any effective sense. As a result of directors' decisions, Nationwide's balance sheet is arguably at least Pounds 200m weaker than it might otherwise have been. How are Nationwide's directors to be held accountable? The traditional reply of the proponents of the status quo is to point to the power of members to remove the retiring directors at the next annual general meeting. The reality of life is that 97.5 per cent of Nationwide's members chose at the last AGM to act like pure consumers rather than members of a mutual organisation. They neither voted in the election of directors nor attended the AGM. Directors of building societies generally operate in an accountability vacuum and it is not really their fault. If members have given up on mutuality as an effective form of corporate governance, that needs to be recognised. Selling for a pound what has cost Pounds 200m of somebody else's money to acquire is not very clever. What is even less clever is that the somebody else in question will not be bothered to do anything about it. The Treasury's review of current building society legislation, particularly in relation to the accountability of boards to members, will need to recognise the world as it really is if corporate governance within societies is to change and become effective.

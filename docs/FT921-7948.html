			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Accountancy Column: Unaudited figures leave annual reports in the shade PRIVATE INVESTORS rarely do it; financial journalists don't often do it; even analysts supposedly poring over the figures do not always seem to do it. Lots of people fail to scrutinise companies' annual reports. Most focus instead on interim and preliminary announcements, reacting rapidly to the information they provide. This makes auditors feel rather insecure about their role, and some are now calling for the figures to be audited. Interim announcements generally contain simple profit and loss information on a company's half-year results. Preliminaries contain similar information for the full year. Both are issued as soon as possible after the figures are prepared because they are price-sensitive. Neither is audited. The consequence is that half-year externally verified figures appear in the annual report and accounts only months after the interims, while those for the full-year may be published several weeks after the 'prelims' come out. The announcements are released to the Stock Exchange regulatory news service, and accompanied on the same day by a flurry of press releases and company briefings for analysts and journalists. These, in turn, rapidly generate newspaper articles and reports from securities houses. The annual report, by contrast, is a neglected animal. Research into its significance is equally neglected. Little has been added to the academic literature since a study more than 10 years ago by Mr David Tweedie, now chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, while he was professor of accounting at Lancaster University and technical director of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland. From questionnaires sent to the private shareholders of Scottish and Newcastle Breweries, he showed that the chairman's report was the most frequently read part of the entire document. Just over half said they read it thoroughly. At the other extreme, 37 per cent said they did not even look at the notes to the financial statements. In a separate survey, he found that even among institutional investors and stockbrokers, 20 per cent did not read the notes to company accounts thoroughly, while about 10 per cent did not scrutinise the balance sheet and 9 per cent did not study the profit and loss statement closely. The importance of the unaudited figures over the delayed but more comprehensive and audited ones is clearly indicated by share price movements. As the graphs for Wellcome and ABF illustrate above, a company's shares often move sharply after its prelims are announced, as well as after interims. The release of its annual accounts rarely inspires more than a blip, however. The issue is generating angst among accountants. A technical release just produced by the financial reporting and auditing group of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales addresses the weaknesses with existing arrangements for prelims*. The nature of interim statements is currently under the scrutiny of both the Auditing Practices Board and the Cadbury Committee on corporate governance. Nor is the concern entirely new. Mr Edmund Dell, secretary of state for trade in 1976-78, chaired a committee supported by Coopers &amp; Lybrand on 'the audit judgment' in 1987, which was subTrade and Industry. It recommended that auditors should carry out a review of interims before they are published, and consent to the figure in the prelims before they are released. Both should be accompanied by an audit statement, it said. 'It is depressing that so much effort goes into something that attracts little attention,' says Mr Graham Ward, a partner with Price Waterhouse and vice-chairman of the auditing committee at the institute which introduced the topic for discussion late last year. 'There is something slightly anomalous when the primary document governing the communication of results doesn't have particularly stringent rules governing it.' The rules governing the contents of interims are sparse. There is no legislation, and the only guidelines that exist are the listing requirements issued by the Stock Exchange, which stipulate basic profit and loss account information. Those for prelims are even less comprehensive, although they state that the accounts should have been agreed with the auditors as the basis for completing the annual report. 'It would be a foolish board of directors which publishes information knowing the auditor disagrees,' says Mr Ward. But he stresses that the degree of co-operation shown varies considerably. 'The reality is that auditors have neither the power to prevent the publication of a preliminary announcement, nor the right to comment if they disagree with (its) form or content,' his paper concludes. He argues that prelims which are released unaudited leave open the potential for inaccuracies. There may still be formal confirmations outstanding on certain figures, including balances and receipts, and reports from overseas subsidiaries. There may also be post-balance sheet events to be taken into account. 'While most material issues should be confirmed by then, there are still judgments to be made on the numbers,' he says. Mr Ward suggests that with a little more planning - and the encouragement of stricter Stock Exchange requirements - the auditors and the directors could easily co-operate to produce audited prelims, while delaying their release only slightly, and with little extra cost. What his paper omits is the extension of the argument to interims, where many of the same issues arise. It also fails to consider what additional information both statements could usefully provide - although Mr Ward says he personally would like to see greater balance sheet information and a distinction drawn between continuing, acquired and discontinued operations. Examples of actual differences between the figures quoted in the prelims or interims and those published in the annual report, are also hard to find. The Stock Exchange says that it conducted some research a few years ago but it was unable to unearth any cases where variations arose. Nevertheless, the issue certainly deserves a wider debate. Since most users of accounts seem to pay so little attention to annual reports, they ought at least to give serious thought to the nature of the figures on which they do so much rely. *Preliminary announcements.

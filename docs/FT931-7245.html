			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Thomas Cook points to Pounds 15m savings for partners from tie-up THOMAS Cook, the travel and financial services company controlled by Westdeutsche Landesbank, yesterday reaffirmed its commitment to a proposed tie-up with Owners Abroad, writes Richard Gourlay. 'We are fully committed to the alliance,' it said. It was the best deal for Owners' shareholders and for LTU, the German travel company also part of WestLB's travel interests. This proposed alliance would allow Owners Abroad to market its holidays through Thomas Cook travel agencies and would lead to savings for the two companies of at least Pounds 15m during two years.</p>

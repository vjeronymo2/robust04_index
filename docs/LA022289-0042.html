			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMPROMISE ORDERED ON INS SEIZURE OF PAPERS  </P> <P> A federal judge Tuesday ordered attorneys for the Immigration and  Naturalization Service and advocates for farm-worker amnesty applicants to work  out a compromise on a lawsuit filed against Border Patrol agents who have  illegally seized documents from dozens of migrant workers.  </P> <P> U. S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving in San Diego ordered INS attorney  Charles Hamilton and Stephen Rosenbaum, a lawyer with the California Rural  Legal Assistance, to reach a compromise by April 24. CRLA lawyers teamed up  with the American Civil Liberties Union to sue the INS in December to stop the  border agents from seizing the documents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seizure Stopped  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Hamilton argued that the lawsuit is moot because the INS stopped  seizing documents in the Western Region in October and the practice was  discontinued in the rest of the nation by Dec. 28. INS officials admitted that  Border Patrol agents seized amnesty documents from about 350 people who had  legally obtained them from INS offices.  </P> <P> However, Rosenbaum argued that the INS had not gone far enough. Rosenbaum said  he wanted the INS to seek out the people whose papers had been seized and  provide them with new documents. Dozens of migrants charged that Border Patrol  agents forced them to sign phony confessions admitting that the documents they  had received from INS offices were fraudulent. Rosenbaum also asked that these  "confessions that were made through coercion" be stricken from the applicants'  files.  </P> <P> "The judge said that he saw some legitimate claims on these two issues and  ordered both sides to work on a compromise," Rosenbaum said.  </P> <P> Hamilton called the number of documents admittedly seized by Border Patrol  agents insignificant. "The taking of documents from 350 people out of 1.3  million applicants is not a statistically significant number," Hamilton said.  </P> <P> He added that the INS has already agreed to notify "everyone that the INS can  identify who had their documents taken away." He called the dispute minor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Allowed to Work  </P> <P> Some workers have said they received their documents at border processing  stations in Laredo, Tex., San Ysidro and Otay Mesa in the summer of 1987. The  legal papers allowed them to work in the United States for up to 90 days,  during which time they would also have to acquire more documentation to prove  that they qualified for amnesty.  </P> <P> But the migrants said the documents given them by INS officials were seized at  Border Patrol checkpoints by agents who accused them of buying them illegally  and threatened them with prison terms.  </P></p>

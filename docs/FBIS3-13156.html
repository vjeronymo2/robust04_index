			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Avner Regev: "They Are Palestinians, Too"] </F>   [Text] Reacting to last week's events in the Israeli  Palestinian sector, Knesset Member Talib al-Sani' stated: A  wide chasm has been created between the Israeli Arab population  and the Jewish majority, and it is hard to see how it can be  patched up anytime soon. Representing the Israeli Bedouin  population, al-Sani' made it clear that the Hebron massacre was  indeed a terrible thing; yet, it was the way the Israel Police  and other security forces treated the Palestinian citizens of  Israel, who expressed their reaction to the massacre, which made  many of the Arab leaders think that they do not have equal  rights as citizens. They will not accept the fact that there is  different treatment of Jewish and Arab demonstrators. If the  sights in the field express a reality, if indeed they expressed  the way the Jewish majority really feels toward the Palestinian  minority, then there seems to be no chance of holding a dialogue  that would lead to coexistence in the foreseeable future.    The killing by police gunfire of a resident of the Bedouin  village of Rahat during demonstration there last week started a  fire that does not seem extinguishable in the near future. The  reactions by the Palestinian citizens of Israel and the counter  reactions by the security forces created a situation which casts  doubt on the possibility of attaining an arrangement in the  future that would satisfy the demands of one side.    Since the Hebron massacre, the leaders of the Arab public  have been articulating the PLO negotiating demands, calling on  Israel to accept them. For example, they call for dismantling  settlements, disarming settlers, stating that the settlements  and peace cannot coexist. The fact that the Negev Bedouin --  who until recently have not regarded themselves part of the  Palestinian nation -- hoisted PLO flags, is an indication of a  sweeping phenomena which points to a changing reality, currently  forming before our eyes.    We have seen such flags hoisted in the Galilee and the  Triangle, but the sights from the Negev, including the reports  that stones were hurled at cars on the Beersheba-'Arad highway,  make the Jewish population feel that the security situation has  deteriorated -- and not only in the territories, but inside the  Greed Line.    At a seminar of police commanders, convened last week to  discuss aspects of the peace negotiations, the Hebron massacre  was placed on the agenda. To the amazement of many of those  present, some 25 percent of the officers expressed some degree  of support for or understanding of the Hebron murder.  Expressions that do not become police commanders were heard  there, and the silent majority did not react with anger.    If the police commanders' anger in view of the situation in  the territories is understandable at all, the way they reacted  to the events in the Israeli Palestinian sector can probably  explain their conduct as everyday law and order observers.  Hence it is easy to sympathize with Knesset Member al-Sani's  remarks regarding the double standard which prevails in Israel  with regard to its Jewish and Arab citizens.    The continuation of the acts of protest by the Arab public  here, in fact, reveals three levels of reaction:    One expresses pain over the Hebron massacre, in which  worshipers were murdered during the fast of Ramadan while in a  holy mosque, along with real sympathy for their brothers in the  territories.    On a second level, Israeli Arabs express growing anxiety  about acts carried out in the territories which, they believe,  might be repeated against them, mentioning the events of Land  Day and the Kafr Qasim massacre in the same context. They  mainly fear that the Israeli reaction was not an isolated event,  rather that it is the result of a policy which might make them  change their place of residence.    Some Israeli Arab leaders believe that, in parallel with the  transfer of settlers from the territories inside the Green Line,  some of them might find themselves outside Israel's boundaries  -- because of territorial changes or other reasons.    On a third level, the Israeli Arabs point at their distress  over poverty and neglect in their sector, which causes  frustration which, in turn, drags them to support a  fundamentalist religious element which contains nationalistic  elements in it. The combination of religion and nationalism  breeds extremism, and not only in Islam. The Jewish group  residing in Hebron is an example of this, even if this group  does not suffer from poverty and neglect.    Israeli Palestinians and Jews now face a difficult dilemma.  Having been repressed for years, the feelings of hostility and  rage came bursting out, creating a new reality. The Oslo  agreement, in which Israel recognized the PLO as the  representative of the Palestinian people, does not stipulate  whether or not the PLO also represents the Israeli and Jordanian  Palestinians.    Israeli Arabs today regard themselves part of the  Palestinian  nation. Feeling rejected by the Jewish majority in Israel -- as  was seen last week -- they might turn to the PLO for political  asylum. For its part, the PLO will not hesitate to accept them.  The leaders of Israel will then face a problem. It is possible  that the Israeli Arabs will be party to comprehensive Middle  East peace negotiations in which the Green Line will no longer  be sacred.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who is preoccupied with the  political process, must take some time to formulate a  comprehensive policy on the Israeli-Arab conflict. It could be  assumed that it will be difficult to continue with the system of  making interim arrangements to bring about short spells of  quiet. Because the Israeli Arabs are on the political agenda  today, he will have to listen to more voices than he has so far.</p>

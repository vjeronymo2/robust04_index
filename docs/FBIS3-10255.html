The police reported that during the  demonstration some 2,000 students of the Autonomous University  of Santo Domingo detonated homemade bombs, destroyed several  vehicles, and threw rocks at security units.    University Rector Roberto Santana said the students oppose  reforms established by university statutes because "they resist  change and continue to live in the past." For the past two  years, the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo has been among  the centers showing the strongest opposition to the regime of  President Joaquin Balaguer. This has caused frequent  confrontations between students and the police.</p>

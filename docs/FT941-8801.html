			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Bavarian minister out but not down: Rivals compete to inherit the conservative mantle of Franz-Josef Strauss Bavaria is bracing itself for a new battle between its conservative leaders over who can most rightfully claim to inherit the mantle of Mr Franz-Josef Strauss, its legendary post-war leader. The stage-managed resignation on Wednesday night of Mr Peter Gauweiler, the 44-year-old environment minister in Germany's prosperous and fiercely independent southern state, could set the scene for a continuing struggle for the soul of Mr Strauss' ruling Christian Social Union, the smallest partner in the Bonn coalition. Mr Gauweiler, forced out of office in a scandal over legal fees, which he has continued to receive in addition to his ministerial income, managed to dominate prime time national television with his resignation speech to a cheering audience of supporters in a Munich beer cellar. A former student leader who was rapidly promoted by Mr Strauss when he was Bavarian prime minister, Mr Gauweiler told a delighted crowd that he would be back. 'I feel stronger and fitter than many people would like me to be,' he declared. His departure is both a relief and a worry to Mr Edmund Stoiber, the current Bavarian premier, and the principal claimant to inherit the Strauss mantle. Mr Stoiber, who defeated CSU leader, Mr Theo Waigel, Bonn finance minister, to assume the premiership last year, and thus underline his claim to be the party's real strongman, is fighting to defend an absolute majority in Bavaria's state parliament at elections scheduled for September. At the same time the CSU is struggling to maintain its presence in the European parliament at the European elections on June 12: it has to win enough support in Bavaria alone to gain 5 per cent of the national vote  - the minimum needed to gain seats in the parliament. Initial fears that Mr Gauweiler, an outspoken Euro-sceptic would leave the party and campaign against it, are discounted by most Bavarian observers. 'He will certainly stay in the party,' Mr Michael Stiller, domestic political editor of the Suddeutsche newspaper in Munich, said yesterday. 'He hesitated for a long time, and there was talk of him teaming up with the anti-European alliance headed by Manfred Brunner (the Free Citizens' Alliance). 'He is a very good beer-tent speaker. I think he will now go out and campaign for re-election in the CSU, arguing that some people should be re-elected more than others. 'The danger for Stoiber is that Gauweiler is trying to revive the old Strauss era. Stoiber is trying to distance himself from it, to the extent that the memory is tainted with the suspicion of bribery and corruption.' Both men share a common Euro-scepticism, which the CSU is seeking to exploit to keep the far-right wing Republicans at bay in the forthcoming European elections. In that campaign, Mr Gauweiler, who coined the phrase 'Esperanto money' to describe the future common European currency, is needed as a vital ally. Whether he can use his obvious popularity with the party's conservative grass roots to challenge Mr Stoiber himself is more doubtful. But his presence does mean that the Bavarian premier is likely to spend the next seven months watching his back, as well as his more obvious opponents.</p>

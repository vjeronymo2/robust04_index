			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A J.F.K. OBSESSION  </P> <P> Lee Green's story about David Lifton's work ("His J.F.K. Obsession," Nov. 20)  was a real page-turner. Green pointed out that Lifton's book, "Best Evidence,"  was given a negative review by Times' critic Kenneth John Atchity, who felt  that getting to the truth of the matter won't resurrect J.F.K. I say, the point  is not to resurrect J.F.K.; that cannot be done. However, we should not let  whoever assassinated him get away with murder.  </P> <P> MONICA WELLESLEY  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

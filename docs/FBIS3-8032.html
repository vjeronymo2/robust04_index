			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Zagreb, March 2 (AFP) -- Serb and Croat leaders  showed a mixed reaction to the Moslem-Croat federation agreement  Wednesday. Bosnian Moslems mainly welcomed it but others  involved in the conflict doubted its viability and voiced fears  it would either entrench an imperfect peace or prolong the war  by allowing Moslems and Croats to join forces against the Serbs.    In Zagreb, Croat Government officials suggested the  agreement  was a "compromise" with an uncertain outlook.    Under the agreement, signed in Washington Tuesday by Bosnian  Moslem and Croat leaders, the Bosnian federation will be  composed of a number of cantons inhabited mainly by Bosnian  Croats and Moslems. They will be granted equal national rights,  with a central government in charge of foreign affairs, defense  and trade.    "It is clear that the agreement is a compromise," Mate  Granic, the Croatian foreign minister and a signatory of the  accord told Croatia's government-controlled daily VECERNJI LIST.    In its editorial on the agreement, the paper said: "The  vanquished in this affair are certainly the Croats.    "The Serbs will undoubtedly keep all their gains. And the  Moslems will be saved from destruction in a state which is a lot  closer to their idea of the homeland than the way the Croats  think of it," the paper added.    Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was not consulted  in the talks, said in Moscow that he was "studying" the  agreement but added that Serbians should have been involved.  "We can welcome this agreement only if it is not aimed against  Serbs. Only if it leads us to peace and not war," he said.    For the Bosnian Government, Gradimir Gojer, a Croatian and  minister without portfolio in Sarajevo, said he now expected the  United States to "put pressure on the Serb side, using the  Russians" to get the Serbs to join the federation. "You can't  reject the third nation who wants to live with us," he added.    Russia, which held talks with Karadzic Wednesday, said the  accord was "a new turning point in the negotiations." Russian  Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin said that "if correctly  applied it could play a positive role in the political  settlement of the Bosnian conflict," the INTERFAX news agency  reported. [passage omitted]    The strongest negative reaction came in Belgrade where  Vladislav Jovanovic, the foreign minister of the rump  Yugoslavia, warned that "the creation of a bloc, two parties  against a third" would defeat the objective of peace.    Momcilo Krajisnik, the president of the self-styled Bosnian  Serb parliament, told the Serbian Radio Novi Sad: "The Serbs  will not accept a solution which harms the interests of the Serb  people." [passage omitted]    In Sarajevo, Hafiz Ismet Spahic, the second highest cleric  in  Bosnia-Herzegovina's Moslem community, summed up the pragmatic  nature of the agreement. "We have to live in marriage, even if  we don't love each other. Our interests are much stronger than  the fact that we are not in love," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 30 May -- According to Transport and  Maritime Economic Minister Boguslaw Liberadzki "it is time to  privatize our flagship carrier LOT." "We have 49 percent of its  shares for sale," confirmed the minister, although he would not  say to whom he wanted to sell the LOT shares.    "It does not have to be a strategic investor, nor does it  have to be an airline company," noted Liberadzki. Asked by a  PAP journalist whether American Airlines would be involved, the  minister said LOT had concluded a strategic alliance with the  American carrier and "that is enough for the moment." He added  that during the latest conference of transport ministers in  France he talked with the American secretary of transportation  about "aviation and roads."    The minister denied that a two-year deadline for privatizing  LOT (since its transformation into a State Treasury company)  would expire in December this year, as "special legislation  applies in this case." "First we have to establish the true  value of LOT whose book value is 2.02 trillion zloty," he added.</p>

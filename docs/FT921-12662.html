			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Men in the News: Reluctant regulator and his guarded successor - Sir David Walker and Andrew Large Running the Securities and Investments Board is not at the top of most people's lists of the City's most desirable job. And that includes the people who have done the job in the brief history of the UK's chief investment watchdog. The current chairman, Sir David Walker, made his position quite clear at the outset, four years ago. 'I wasn't the first choice for this job, and I wasn't a volunteer,' he told the Financial Times then. A former Treasury high-flyer, his career had taken him to the Bank of England under Lord Richardson in the mid-1970s, where he had risen to become an executive director. Then duty called. A tide of City complaints about the implementation of the Financial Services Act - which gave birth to the SIB and the system of regulation it heads - was threatening to engulf the new body. Something had to be done, and Sir David was seen as the man to do it. This week, on announcing his departure, his position had hardly budged. 'I didn't want to retire a regulator,' he said. The man who will take over from him on June 1, Mr Andrew Large, was more guarded in his comments. Running the SIB would be 'an enormous challenge', he said. Yet for Mr Large, a 49-year-old career investment banker, it is a far cry from the time in the mid-1980s when he was in the forefront of City opposition to much of what the SIB stood for. Through tough campaigning, he is credited with having helped to shape a regulatory system which has proved largely acceptable to international financial firms in London. The result: he became the first chairman of the Securities Association, one of the four self-regulating organisations (SROs) answerable to the SIB. It also seems clear that Mr Large's was not the first name to spring to the mind of the two men charged with finding a successor to Sir David - Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England. They had known since September that Sir David wanted to leave the SIB when his four-year term of office expires at the end of May. Yet in November, Mr Large was parachuted in to take over the chairmanship of the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) after an investment scandal. He will now surrender that post. It is not hard to see why filling the chairman's seat at the SIB is a tough job. It is politically highly charged, not least because the regulatory regime is often held responsible when private investors lose money as a result of investment fraud or incompetence. Appeasing critics in the City, whose instinctive antipathy to the Act had been exacerbated by what they saw as an obtrusive approach taken by Sir Kenneth Berrill, the SIB's first chairman, was equally exacting. Sir David's first task - and one which is only just coming to completion - was to attempt a simplification of the new investment rulebooks. The rewrite has been widely welcomed, although ultimately doing little to shrink the extensive and detailed regulations. There are also the politics of the retail investment industry. Sir David, a forthright, articulate man, has been irritated at the SIB by his inability to act in as direct a way in dealing with industry disputes as he might have wished. His natural manner, according to people who have worked with him, is that of the Bank of England mandarin: bringing warring factions together, cajoling them into reaching agreement, if necessary acting as middleman to resolve disputes. It was a job at which he is said to have excelled while in charge of the Bank's industrial division in the mid-1980s. The SIB has never offered him the same freedom or power. Two years ago, he caused a furore among SROs by hinting that greater powers should rest at the centre. The ensuing row with the SROs led him to back away from confrontation, and has resulted in a less direct approach since. Sir David has made it clear that he is happy to leave these practitioner-led bodies to get on with the job, provided they show they are up to the task. Sir David's inability to deal with the investment industry in the same way that the Bank of England deals with the UK's leading banks has also been a source of frustration. 'He likes to fix things, and fix them himself,' says one person who has worked with him. Dealing with the UK's powerful life companies is the main job that remains undone. The review of retail regulation that Sir David is close to completing will not provide final answers to a web of interrelated problems: how should the commissions paid on life assurance policies be disclosed? How can a level playing field be created to accommodate both independent financial firms and the direct salesman of life companies? Will life companies join together to rescue Fimbra, the financially troubled SRO responsible for independent financial advisers? For Professor Jim Gower, the man whose review of investment protection, begun in 1981, led to the FSA, the inability to resolve these issues remains the biggest disappointment in the existing regulatory arrangements. They are not intractable, he said this week - 'or rather, not completely intractable'. For Mr Large, the challenge will be particularly acute. His experience lies entirely at the international wholesale end of the investment industry rather than the domestic retail one. An investment banker who worked for Orion Bank during the 1970s, he was one of five executives to defect to set up a London investment banking arm for Swiss Bank Corporation in 1980. He helped to build the operation into one of the most innovative and active in the Eurobond and Euroequity markets - the free-wheeling international financial markets which had been attracted to London in part by the absence of regulation. Mr Large is known for having a sharp mind and a no-nonsense, practical way of dealing with problems - though long-term vision is not top of the list of qualities mentioned by others. He was clear about what he could bring to the SIB: a sense of what regulation means to the people who have to live with it. He will be better prepared for the other job that has been consuming much of Sir David's time of late: shaping the regulation for London's wholesale financial markets. This summer he will chair in London the annual meeting of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, the international regulators' club. Senior members of the investment banking community regard Mr Large as one of their own. Whether Mr Large can square the various sides of the job, the domestic and the international, retail and wholesale, will be the yardstick by which he will be judged.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Campaigners opposed to rail privatisation descend on Westminster MORE THAN 1,000 campaigners opposed to rail privatisation descended on Westminster yesterday to lobby MPs, while union leaders described the sell-off plans as 'utterly destructive and sheer lunacy'. Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs urged Tory MPs to join them in trying to wreck the government's rail privatisation legislation currently going through parliament. The Save Our Railways group, which organised the action, produced a survey of rail commuters showing that one in five could switch to cars if fares increased under privatisation. Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the largest rail union, the RMT, said: 'There is a deep and growing anger about the sheer lunacy of the government's proposals.' Other unions backed calls for Tory MPs to rebel and force through an amendment to the railways bill which would allow BR to bid for franchises in a privatised network. Labour warned Tory MPs with small majorities: 'Save our railways or lose your seats.' Shadow employment secretary Mr John Prescott - Labour's former transport spokesman - forecast two weeks of acrimonious debate in the Lords and Commons. 'The bill is in a total mess, the Lords have torpedoed it below the water line, and we will try to make it totally unworkable,' he said.</p>

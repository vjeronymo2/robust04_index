			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses ground for first time in five sessions The Nikkei 225 average lost ground for the first time in five trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was down 82.31 at 20,188.44 after a day's high of 20,397.98 and low of 20,174.43. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 4.19 at 1,639.01. Overseas investors placed active buy orders as the yen fell against the dollar. Expectations of higher interest rates supported the US currency, and it rose above the Y105 level for the first time since April 11. Arbitrage buying also helped shares in the morning. The Nikkei 300 shed 1.08 to 299.67 and losers led gainers by 485 to 489, with 200 issues unchanged. Volume fell to 280m shares from 414m. Some short term investors were attracted to small companies. The second section rose 5.15 to a year-to-date high of 2,330.06, while the over-the-counter market gained 6.92 at 1,853.22. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 3.34 at 1,338.05. Banks faced profit-taking. Bank of Tokyo retreated Y30 to Y1,620 and Mitsubishi Bank declined Y40 to Y2,750. High-technology stocks were mixed, with Hitachi, the day's most active issue, unchanged at Y995 and Toshiba rising Y4 to Y795. NEC, however, lost Y10 to Y1,170 and Fujitsu also declined Y10, to Y1,040. Kureha Chemical Industry moved ahead Y18 to Y593 on reports of the high effectiveness of its cancer drug. Other drugs companies were also firmer, with Takeda Chemical up Y10 to Y1,260 and Daiichi Pharmaceutical appreciating Y20 to Y1,570. Real estate companies, which were higher last week, relinquished some ground. Mitsui Fudosan receded Y20 to Y1,280 and Mitsubishi Estate dipped Y20 to Y1,240. Individual investors continued to dabble in speculative favourites, with Brother Industries climbing Y25 to Y719. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 22.26 to 22,424.48 as profit-taking by institutions eroded earlier gains. Volume was 21.9m shares. Roundup Pacific Rim markets were mixed, with many investors awaiting the outcome of today's meeting of the US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee. HONG KONG continued to find favour with foreign investors and the Hang Seng index finished 118.69, or 1.3 per cent, higher at 9,253.41, with Japanese funds leading the advance. Turnover, however, slipped to HKDollars 4bn from last Friday's total of HKDollars 5bn. Property issues led the rise as newspaper reports of strong buyer interest in local housing developments eased concerns over government plans to cool property prices. Cheung Kong gained HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 39.25, SHK Properties added 75 cents at HKDollars 49.75 and Henderson was up HKDollars 1.75 at HKDollars 42.25. SYDNEY was led higher by strength in the resource sector, and the market closed at its highest level for more than a month. The All Ordinaries index rose 40.9, or 2 per cent, to 2,110.9 in ADollars 543.5m turnover. A strong banking sector also assisted sentiment ahead of results from NAB and Westpac later in the week. Among resource stocks, BHP leapt 68 cents to ADollars 18.26, CRA jumped 56 cents to ADollars 18.36, Western Mining climbed 38 cents to ADollars 8.08 and MIM rose 8 cents to ADollars 3.31. SEOUL edged to a lower close as consolidation in blue chips outweighed renewed interest in companies that are forecast to produce improved business performances. The composite stock index eased 0.71 to 941.67 in volume that dipped to 31.1m shares after last week's daily average of 40m. KUALA LUMPUR ended its quietest session this year broadly lower as investors adopted a wait-and-see attitude amid lack of fresh local factors. The composite index closed 6.71 down at 997.84 in volume of 68.9m shares, against 99.6m on Friday. SINGAPORE was mixed in sluggish business, with trading volume down at one of the year's lowest levels, 74.49m shares, as investors ignored a robust first-quarter gross domestic product growth of 11 per cent. The Straits Times Industrial index put on 4.29 at 2,290.41. TAIPEI closed off the day's highs after active trade as food and construction stocks, which had lagged behind the market's recent rally, performed well. The weighted index was ahead 22.76 at 6,114.78, after touch-ing 6,153.24, in turnover of TDollars 71.8bn. Financials were the only losers, with Business Bank of Taitung down TDollars 3.50 to TDollars 86.50. MANILA fell for the third consecutive session, although there was an improvement in the mining index, helped by strength in world copper prices. WELLINGTON was supported by neighbouring markets and the NZSE-40 capital index added 20.56 at 2,126.25 in turnover of NZDollars 43m. Strength in both Fletcher Challenge and Telecom were the features of the day: Telecom closed 8 cents higher at NZDollars 4.99 and FCL 12 cents ahead at Dollars 3.92.</p>

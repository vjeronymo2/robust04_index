			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> (E) Potential Impacts of Expected Fishing for Groundfish on Halibut Stocks and U.S. Halibut Fisheries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Halibut fisheries will be adjusted to account for the overall halibut PSC mortality limit established for groundfish fisheries. The 1995 groundfish fisheries are expected to use the entire proposed halibut PSC limit of 2,750 mt. The allowable directed commercial catch is determined by accounting for the recreational catch, waste, and bycatch mortality, and then providing the remainder to the directed fishery. How this affects the directed fishery depends on the constant exploitable yield (CEY) determined by the IPHC. Therefore, if the PSC limit of 2,750 mt is instituted for the 1995 fishery, the results could be either positive or negative to the directed halibut fishery, depending on whether the CEY is higher or lower than it was in the previous year's fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> (F) Methods Available For, and Costs of, Reducing Halibut Bycatches in Groundfish Fisheries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Methods available for reducing halibut bycatch include (1) reducing amounts of groundfish TACs, (2) reducing halibut bycatch rates through a Vessel Incentive Program, (3) modifying gear, (4) changing groundfish fishing seasons, and (5) instituting individual transferable quota programs designed to reduce the derby-style fishing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reductions in groundfish TACs provide no incentives for fishermen to reduce bycatch rates. Costs that would be imposed on fishermen as a result of reducing TACs depend on species and amounts of groundfish foregone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Trawl vessels carrying observers for purposes of complying with the Observer Plan are subject to the Vessel Incentive Program. The program encourages trawl fishermen to avoid high halibut bycatch rates while conducting groundfish fisheries by specifying bycatch rate standards for various target fisheries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current regulations require groundfish pots to have halibut exclusion devices to reduce halibut bycatches. Resulting low bycatch and mortality rates of halibut in pot fisheries have justified exempting pot gear from PSC limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations also define pelagic trawl gear in a manner intended to reduce bycatch of halibut by displacing fishing effort off the bottom of the sea floor when certain halibut bycatch levels are reached during the fishing year. The definition provides standards for physical conformation and also for performance of the trawl gear in terms of crab bycatch (58 FR 39680, July 26, 1993). Furthermore, all hook-and-line vessel operators are required to employ careful release measures when handling halibut bycatch. This measure is intended to reduce handling mortality, increase the amount of groundfish harvested under the available halibut mortality bycatch limits, and possibly lower overall halibut bycatch mortality in groundfish fisheries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Halibut bycatch has been reduced by changes in some groundfish fishing seasons. In 1994, the sablefish hook-and-line season started May 18, and the rockfish trawl fishery was delayed until the third quarter, July 1. These delays postponed the start of the sablefish and rockfish fisheries to times when seasonal halibut bycatch rates are lower. In 1995, the season start date for sablefish, under the IFQ program, will be March 1 (&sect;676.23(b)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The anticipated implementation in 1995 of the sablefish/halibut IFQ program should reduce the halibut discard mortality in the sablefish fishery because any legal-sized halibut caught by vessels with quota-share holders onboard must be retained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Methods available for reducing halibut bycatch listed above will be reviewed by NMFS and the Council to determine their effectiveness. Changes will be initiated, as necessary, in response to this review or to public testimony and comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the goals and objectives of the FMP to reduce halibut bycatches while providing an opportunity to harvest the groundfish OY, NMFS proposes the assignments of 2,000 mt and 750 mt of halibut PSC mortality limits to trawl and hook-and-line gear, respectively. While these limits would reduce the harvest quota for commercial halibut fishermen, NMFS has determined that they would not result in unfair allocation to any particular user group. NMFS recognizes that some halibut bycatch will occur in the groundfish fishery, but expansion of the Vessel Incentive Program, required modifications to gear, implementation of the IFQ program, and changes in the season start date for some fisheries are intended to reduce adverse impacts on halibut fishermen while promoting the opportunity to achieve the OY from the groundfish fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As mentioned above, NMFS is pursuing rulemaking that would authorize the annual exemption of the sablefish hook-and-line gear fishery from halibut bycatch restrictions. This action was recommended by the Council based on the anticipation of reduced halibut discard mortality in the fishery under the IFQ program and to support the first-year implementation of the IFQ program. This action would minimize competition within the sablefish hook-and-line fleet for halibut bycatch before individual sablefish quota-share amounts are harvested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> 8. Proposed Seasonal Allocations of the Halibut PSC Limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Under &sect;672.20(f)(2)(iii), NMFS proposes to allocate seasonally the halibut PSC limits based on recommendations from the Council. The FMP requires that the following information be considered by the Council in recommending seasonal allocations of halibut: (1) Seasonal distribution of halibut, (2) seasonal distribution of target groundfish species relative to halibut distribution, (3) expected halibut bycatch needs on a seasonal basis relevant to changes in halibut biomass and expected catches of target groundfish species, (4) expected bycatch rates on a seasonal basis, (5) expected changes in directed groundfish fishing seasons, (6) expected actual start of fishing effort, and, (7) economic effects of establishing seasonal halibut allocations on segments of the target groundfish industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council recommended the same seasonal allocation of PSC limits for the 1995 fishing year as those in effect during the 1994 fishing year. The publication of the final 1994 initial groundfish and PSC specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) summarizes Council findings with respect to each of the FMP considerations set forth above. At this time, the Council's findings are unchanged from those set forth for 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

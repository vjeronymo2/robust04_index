			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Observer: Pitched in After a heady two years trying to run a brewery, Graham Axford, one-time corporate finance boss at James Capel, has returned to the trade he knows best. He has been made head of UK corporate finance at Credit Lyonnais Laing, which is getting a bit of a reputation as a rest-home for yesterday's go-getters. Until last week, Axford was chairing the tiny Wiltshire Brewery - makers of Old Grumble and Old Devil beers - which he helped to bring to the stock market in 1990. However, his big plans for multiplying the market capitalisation of the 130-year-old brewery, in which he had a sizeable stake, don't seem to have worked out and after some hefty losses, control has passed to UB Group, the Indian drinks giant. The new hand on the pump at Wiltshire is one O'Neil Nalavadi who, in one sense, has already made a name for himself. On the day Nalavadi was born 31 years ago, the distinguished Australian cricketer, Norman O'Neill, scored a double century at Bombay cricket ground. Nalavadi's father simply linked custom - which said his son's name had to begin with an N - with his love of cricket. What a good thing Australia's rugby players do not tour India - imagine starting life as Ofahengaue Nalavadi.</p>

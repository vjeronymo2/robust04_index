Hosokawa told the cabinet that he is closely watching  international efforts to deal with the North Korean nuclear  dispute. He said, "President Kim Yong-sam is going to visit  Japan from March 24, and we should keep an eye on the situation  for seven to 10 days. We must make every preparation for an  emergency."    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a press  conference in the morning that Japan should exchange information  with South Korea and Japan and act prudently. He acknowledged  that working-level officials are studying ways to restrict  remittance by ethnic Koreans in Japan to North Korea and  prohibit North Korean ships from calling at Japanese ports.  "But now is not yet the stage for the government to officially  confirm that," he said.    On the military front, Defense Minister Kazuo Aichi  instructed the Self-Defense Forces to reinforce security as  tension rises in Northeast Asia.    Aichi told the press after the cabinet meeting that Japan is  strengthening acquisition of information related to the North  Korean nuclear dispute.    Tokyo is also preparing for a trade embargo in anticipation  of a U.N. decision against the North Koreans. A senior  government official said that in order to implement a  full-fledged trade embargo against North Korea, the government  will need to revise the enforcement regulations of trade-related  and other laws. The Japanese Government is working on such  revision, he said.    It would be difficult to prohibit remittance to North Korea,  he said, but "the government should take every possible step.  We will try to decide on prohibition (of remittance) as soon as  possible."    He emphasized that Tokyo should conduct itself in a cool  manner because if North Korea has succeeded in making nuclear  weapons, it is highly likely they will be targeted at Japan.    Meanwhile, Japanese police checked all areas where President  Kim Yong-sam is scheduled to pass by or stay on his visit to  Japan this Thursday [24 March]. The Japanese police plan to  establish a special comprehensive security headquarters, and  about 16,000 policemen will be deployed to beef up security  around Haneda airport, the Diet and the guest house.</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ivaco to sell 52% Laclede stake IVACO, a Canadian steel products group with 75 per cent of its business in the US, has put its 52 per cent controlling interest in Laclede up for sale, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Laclede, based in the US, has nearly 1m tonnes of modern steelmaking capacity and several product plants. It has weathered the recession in good shape, with book value at around USDollars 100m. However, Ivaco, carrying a high debt load from rapid expansion in the early 1980s, has been hit by the long recession and a high Canadian dollar from 1988 to early 1992. It has appointed Paine Webber, the New York investment bankers, to find a buyer. Lower interest charges and other non-operating factors helped Imperial Oil, Canada's biggest oil company and a subsidiary of Exxon of the US, lift net earnings by 20 per cent last year, writes Bernard Simon. However, lower crude oil volumes, pipeline limitations and narrower margins on refined products continued to depress the company's operating performance. Net earnings rose to CDollars 195m (USDollars 152.3m), or CDollars 1.01 a share, from CDollars 162m, or 84 cents, in 1991. Fourth-quarter earnings were CDollars 51m, compared with a CDollars 124m loss. Annual revenues fell to CDollars 9.13bn from CDollars 9.5bn.</p>

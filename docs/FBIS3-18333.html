Milan assistant public prosecutor Gerardo D'Ambrosio said  the  forty-page affidavit Craxi delivered to the Rome public  prosecutor's office in early February "is, for the most part, a  collection of pieces of records gathered during the Milan  investigations. This is a collage which, in some areas, is even  wrong," he added and cited statements attributed to the wrong  person as an example.    The magistrate from Milan's Clean Hands team also reported,  "This is a technical meeting to avoid an overlap of  investigations of the same case. On the 13 points indicated in  Craxi's affidavit, only five concern investigations which have  not been opened in Milan." D'Ambrosio said jurisdiction "is not  a matter of opinion and certainly is not based on the place in  which the affidavit was submitted." He went on to note that the  name of the administrative secretary of the Democratic Party of  the Left, and of the Communist Party before the name-change,  Senator Marcello Stefanini, and those of others have been added  to the log kept by the Rome public prosecutor's office listing  persons under investigation. "But if it turns out that  investigations of these facts have already been opened  elsewhere, jurisdiction will clearly belong to the magistrates  already at work on these cases," he added.    The Milan judge then explained the five accusations not yet  covered in more than two years of Milan political and business  corruption investigations. The first, he said, is the "Rotiroti  affair, on which Rome is already moving for libel." This case  centers on Craxi's allegation of bribery to the tune of 600  million lire (356,000 dollars) surrounding real estate  transactions in the Bufalotta area on the outskirts of Rome.  The ex-Socialist leader named Primo Greganti, a former Italian  Communist Party official in Turin, and Stefanini.    Rome investigating magistrates Adelchi D'Ippolito and Gloria  Attanasio, who found that the allegations could not be  substantiated, questioned Craxi on February 18 with an eye to a  possible libel charge against him and his source, an  ex-administrative secretary for Craxi's party in Rome, Raffaele  Rotiroti. In the meantime, Stefanini and Greganti have filed  their own libel suits against their accuser.    Another case among the five is alleged financing for the old  Italian Communist Party from the secret police of the Soviet  Union of the time, the KGB, and another is alleged ties between  Naples crime boss Carmine Alfieri, in prison since September  1992, and cooperatives of the left.    The assistant public prosecutor said Rome magistrates would  presumably handle the end involving alleged kickbacks and Naples  would be responsible for issues concerning the Camorra. These  allegations are apparently based on testimony provided by  Pasquale Galasso, a Camorra gangland figure who has turned state  witness.    Another accusation made by Craxi concerns exports of  Sicilian  wine to the Soviet Union of the time and another is that of  placing a man on the board of a social services institute run by  the Treasury.    Turin magistrate Giuseppe Ferrando said he had travelled to  Milan to meet the people he would be dealing with "because we in  Turin were first in contact with Tiziana Parenti," the  magistrate who abandoned the Clean Hands team last year in a  dispute over her insistence on pursuing the investigation of the  Democratic Party of the Left administrative secretary. She is  now on a leave of absence to run for parliament in the March 27  elections on a rightist Forza Italia slate.    Carlo Nordio from Venice said he intended to continue his  investigation into possible Democratic Party of the Left misuse  of 40 billion lire (23.74 million dollars) received by  parliamentary aides. Over the past five years, the  parliamentary aides attached to the MPs of all the parties  represented have between 150 and 160 billion lire (up to 95  million dollars). Investigators suspect that some of the funds  going to those for the Democratic Party of the Left may have  wound up with the local party sections.    A Rome assistant public prosecutor, Gianfranco Mantelli,  said  the investigations under study go beyond the 13 cases cited by  Craxi in his affidavit.    Asked by reporters about the prospect of a slowdown in the  investigations in the run-up to the vote at the end of the  month, D'Ambrosio said, "Don't even dream of it. We're not  thinking like this at all." He also emphasized that the meeting  held today was aimed merely at a better coordination of the  investigations in course.</p>

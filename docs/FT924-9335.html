			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Cabinet agrees spending cuts amid hints of tax concessions THE CABINET yesterday settled the sweeping cuts in government programmes needed to meet its spending targets amid Whitehall hints that next week's Autumn Statement could include a modest package of tax concessions. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will withhold from the cabinet the details of his promised economic 'recovery' programme until a few hours before his speech to the House of Commons next Thursday. The imposition of Budget-style secrecy strengthened the suspicion of ministers that the Treasury is considering tax concessions to boost industrial confidence and prevent a further slump in the housing market. Mr Lamont's colleagues are convinced that the statement will be followed by a further cut in interest rates from the present 8 per cent, taking the level of borrowing costs down to their lowest since the 1970s. The programme will contain separate incentives for private sector involvement in large-scale infrastructure projects and may temporarily lift some of the restrictions which prevent local authorities from spending their capital receipts. Such creative accounting would push up the level of borrowing but would keep increased spending outside the Treasury's spending total. However, warnings from some members of the cabinet that the Treasury would reveal what one described as a 'horrendous' increase in public borrowing tempered expectations of a 'mini-Budget' with wide-ranging tax changes. They believe that an explosion in borrowing - now expected to total over Pounds 40bn next year - may force the chancellor to consider an overall tax increase in next year's Budget, most probably through an extension of VAT. The government's concern about the potential for renewed unrest on the Tory backbenches was underlined by a decision by Mr Lamont, and Mr Michael Portillo, to hold an intensive series of meetings with ministers and MPs. Every Tory MP outside the cabinet will be invited to the Treasury next week to receive a briefing on the harsh economic background to the statement. The cabinet accord yesterday on the cuts in Whitehall programmes needed to meet the target for next year, will involve an intense squeeze on public sector pay, with budgets allowing for increases of less than 2 per cent. But ministers have rejected a pay freeze because of the anticipated political outcry. Ministers are nonetheless braced for a series of possible backbench rebellions over proposed cuts in some social security programmes, a sharp reduction in the defence budget and an agreement to limit the resources to smooth next year's introduction of the council tax. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, has warned colleagues that limiting the amount of money available for 'transitional relief' will mean sharp increases in bills for households in the south. Among the other casualties of the spending round, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, has lost several hundred million pounds from her budget and Mrs Gillian Shephard has faced a tight squeeze on the Employment Department's training budget.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / UN envoy in Finland poll victory Mr Martti Ahtisaari, a senior United Nations diplomat, last night clinched victory in Finland's presidential election, rebuffing a powerful but ultimately inadequate challenge from Mrs Elizabeth Rehn, the defence minister. Mr Ahtisaari, the candidate of the opposition Social Democratic party, won 53.9 per cent of the vote against 46.1 per cent for Mrs Rehn. On a turnout of 82.3 per cent Mr Ahtisaari won by a margin of a quarter of a million votes out of 3.2m cast. Mr Ahtisaari, 57, will succeed President Mauno Koivisto, a fellow Social Democrat who has served two six-year terms, next month. His victory was predicted as long ago as last summer, but was thrown into doubt three weeks ago when the right-of-centre Mrs Rehn, a member of Finland's small Swedish-speaking minority, surged to a surprise second place in a first round of voting and soon outstripped Mr Ahtisaari in the opinion polls. But Mr Ahtisaari clawed his way back with a tough attack on the government's economic policies. He also appears to have benefited from doubts among more conservative Finns about voting for a Swedish-speaking woman. Mr Ahtisaari made a call for greater government efforts to tackle unemployment, which stands at around 20 per cent, his main election platform. Although the president has little power in domestic policy, Mr Ahtisaari has said he intends to persuade the centre-right coalition of Prime Minister Esko Aho to adopt more interventionist policies in order to speed an end to three years of severe recession. The main policy-making role of the president lies in foreign affairs, in which the chief current issue is Finland's application - in parallel with Austria, Norway and Sweden - to join the European Union. Mr Ahtisaari has said he will actively seek a Yes vote in a referendum on membership due this year. He has supported EU membership mainly for the economic benefits he says it will afford Finland. He also favours neutral Finland's participation in the development of EU foreign, security and defence policies following the collapse of the Soviet Union, an important concern among Finns which has recently been given added potency by the rise of Russian nationalist forces that have expressed the view that Finland is a part of Moscow's domain. A career diplomat, Mr Ahtisaari has worked mainly for the UN since 1977 when he became commissioner for Namibia, eventually heading the successful UN operation which oversaw Namibia's transition to independence in 1990. Since then he has worked for the UN on former Yugoslavia.</p>

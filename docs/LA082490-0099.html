			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SAILORS IN TITLE CHASE  </P> <P> Only one point separates David Houser of the Coronado Yacht Club, Mike Hare of  Houston and Brett Davis of St. Petersburg, Fla., going into today's final race  of the single-handed Laser class in the U.S. Yacht Racing Union/Rolex National  Junior Championships at Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Davis started slowly in the five-day, 10-race series but won four consecutive  races before placing second in the ninth race Thursday.  </P> <P> With low score winning, Hare is now the leader with 22 points to 22 3/4 for  Houser and 23 for Davis.  </P> <P> First place is worth three-quarters of a point, and subsequent places equate to  their positions.  </P> <P> Bill Hardesty of the Mission Bay Yacht Club, with crewman Paul Ware, slipped to  fourth -- their worst finish all week -- in the first of two Flying Junior  races but won the second to retain first overall with two races remaining  today.  </P> <P> Hardesty is 3 1/2 points ahead of second-place Jesse Andrews of the American  Yacht Club in Rye, N.Y. Third place is 15 1/2 points behind Andrews.  </P> <P> Scott Elting of Houston took over the lead in the Etchells 22 fleet when Jory  Twist of the host Newport Harbor Yacht Club was disqualified for a premature  start in Thursday's first race. Manning Montagnet of Pass Christian YC in  Mississippi also started early but won the next race, with Twist second.  </P> <P> Twist dropped to third overall, four points behind Elting, but still has a  chance to win with his performance in today's two races under the scoring  system.  </P> <P> The fleets enjoyed their strongest wind conditions of the week, 10 to 15 knots.  </P> <P> Class winners here will be members of the U.S. junior national team.

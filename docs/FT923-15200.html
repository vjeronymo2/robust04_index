			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: US court dismisses claim against T&amp;N A US jury has dismissed a Dollars 75m (Pounds 39.2m) lawsuit brought by Prudential Insurance Company of America against T&amp;N. In a unanimous verdict, the jury found that the engineering group which in the 1950s and 1960s used to supply fireproofing materials containing asbestos, had no liability to compensate Prudential for costs which the US company alleged it had incurred and would incur in removing the material from the Prudential Center, built between 1959 and 1962 in Boston, Massachusetts. Mr Colin Hope, T&amp;N chairman and chief executive, said he was 'pleased, but not surprised' by the outcome. He said that about 130 claims had been made against the company. Of these, about 100 had been dismissed or settled, usually without indemnity. Of the 30 outstanding, two were substantially larger than the others - the Prudential Center and the New York headquarters of Chase Manhattan Bank. The two cases were 'similar, but not identical', because of different laws in different states. So, although there was no 'direct' precedent, the 'dismissal without liability was significant'. T&amp;N argued that the material used was in Prudential's specifications, and the US company would have been as aware of the material's potential dangers as T&amp;N.</p>

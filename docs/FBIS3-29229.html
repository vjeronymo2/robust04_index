			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Roundtable discussion as part of the regular weekly </F> "Discussion" program, with Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura, Shinseito's Kozo Watanabe, the Liberal Democratic  Party's Masasjuro Shiokawa and Kabun Muto; moderated by NHK  commentator Takashi Yamamoto -- live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted on Takemura commenting on the  Japan-U.S. summit in Washington]    [Yamamoto] Mr. Muto, you were foreign minister last summer  when the agreement was made on the objective criteria. What was  the story at the time?    [Muto] We opposed setting such numbers. We felt the same as  the chief cabinet secretary, and we stuck to the position that  we would not accept any measure which would lead to managed  trade. What is now happening is an extension of that position.  Government officials have persisted with that line, and I would  like to praise Prime Minister Hosokawa for doing the same. I  think it was good the talks broke off in failure. What is  wrong, after all, is wrong. I think Mr. Hosokawa said the same.  Both countries believe in free trade. I think the  semiconductor agreement was wrong -- I mean the fact such an  agreement should have been made. Once you have such an  agreement it becomes a precedent. So it would have been better  never to have concluded such an agreement.    Government procurement is done by the government, but  workings of the automobile industry belongs entirely to the  private sector. I think it would, indeed, be wrong indeed to  set numbers that deal with this industry. Besides, the U.S.  auto industry has become more competitive than the Japanese  internationally. I think it was good he spoke against setting  target numbers. [passage omitted on Takemura commenting further  on the summit and Japan-U.S. relations]    [Yamamoto] Minister Takemura, I understand you have another  appointment. Shall we conclude our discussions here? Thank you  so much for having been with us here today. [Takemura leaves]  Mr. Shiokawa, we have heard the government's point of view.  What is your view of the Japan-U.S. summit meeting?    [Shiokawa] I am very concerned. Just now the chief cabinet  secretary said every effort should be taken to ensure the matter  does not affect basic elements in relations between the two  countries. The government must do everything toward that.    Another point is that the general public is not clear about  why the Japan-U.S. talks ended this way. If we look at what the  government has done recently, it is obvious that the process by  which it decides on important matters is far from clear. Things  happen suddenly. Take taxes as an example, while people were  asleep, the government, out of the blue, announced it was  instituting a national welfare tax. It is only natural that  people became angry as a result. As I said, the process is  unclear.    Even in the Japan-U.S. trade negotiations, the government  has  known from the beginning about the numerical targets demand.  The government should have been able to say it had made a  counter- proposal to the United States but that talks broke down  because this counter-proposal had not been accepted. The  problem is that the United States does not know what Japan  wants. I think we should explain to the United States what we  want and this will be the best way to restore the trust  relationship between the two sides.    [Yamamoto] Mr. Watanabe, Mr. Shiokawa has criticized as  confused the way the government makes decisions, even those  connected with the Japan-U.S. talks. What is your response?    [Watanabe] There is no basis at all for such criticism. Mr.  Muto, who has experience as international trade and industry and  foreign minister, made a fair comment a little earlier. While  serving as minister of international trade and industry, I also  had hard time because of U.S. demands on numerical targets.  Each time there was pressure, I told them the United States had  the world's most liberalized economy and that if it and Japan  agreed to doing something that led to managed trade, there would  be reaction in Asia and Europe as well. I told them that when  the overall world economy is taken into consideration numerical  trade targets were not acceptable.    The outcome of the recent summit is not a rupture in  relations, but an agreement not to have an agreement. A  Japan-U.S. relationship in which the United States does as it  pleases because Japan has a trade surplus exceeding $100 billion  cannot be said to be a truly friendly relationship. Even though  the government must make every possible effort to reduce the  surplus by deregulation or expanding domestic demand, what  cannot be done cannot be done. Each country must work together  in areas where government can legitimately act. The recent  Clinton-Hosokawa meeting was unsuccessful, but I think it marks  the start of a process in which relations become more mature and  warmer. I am sure people in Japan understand this. There are  many who tell me they find the outcome of the summit acceptable.  [passage omitted on comments by Dietmen from the Japan  Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party of Japan]    [Yamamoto] Mr. Muto, in the wake of the Japan-U.S. talks,  what do you think the future Japan-U.S. relationship should be  like?    [Muto] As you, Mr. Yamamoto, noted earlier, I had a chance  to serve as minister of international trade and industry during  the Bush administration and also as foreign minister after the  Clinton administration was inaugurated. I see a difference  between these two administrations. I think Mr. Bush was an  excellent politician, even in the area of diplomatic affairs,  who thought about the United States while also thinking about  the world. I receive the impression, even though I have not had  close contacts with him personally, that Mr. Clinton thinks more  about the United States and less about the world. I have met  people around him such as Mr. Kantor and Mr. Christopher. I  think it would benefit Japan if the government takes note of  this in its future actions. I think Japan should strongly  propose that the United States consider the rest of the world as  well. Europe would welcome such an attitude, and so would  people in Asia. There was criticism, even, of the Seattle  conference of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC]  which said that all Clinton did in bringing together the Asian  leaders was to use them to make himself look good. I think  Japan should strongly advise the United States it should think  globally.    Another point. What I want to say to the government is that  if the yen value went up suddenly while we were in power, we  used to ask the G-7 to intervene in the market. The current  government has not taken such actions, even though the yen has  risen sharply in value since last July. I think the government  should have taken some action. I have a feeling a high yen will  be the result of the current dispute. [passage omitted on  discussion of tax issues]</p>

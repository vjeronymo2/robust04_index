			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Irish continue coalition search Ireland's main opposition parties were yesterday engaged in a last-ditch effort to patch together a multi-party coalition to head off an early general election. Mr John Bruton's Fine Gael party, the parliament's second largest party, yesterday convened round-table talks with the Labour party - which abandoned talks with Fianna Fail on continuing the ruling coalition on Tuesday - and the Progressive Democrats and Democratic Left. If no government emerges, elections will be unavoidable. Yesterday a cross-party committee in the Irish parliament was taking evidence on the judicial appointments scandal which brought down the Fianna Fail-Labour party government.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Recruitment: Cutting the head count and cashing in - Longer term performance-related share bonus schemes are a stiffer test of management ability By US standards the Pounds 205,000 rise in basic annual salary awarded to Cedric Brown, the chief executive of British Gas, is nothing to write home about. In the UK, however, a 75 per cent rise for the head of a former public utility could hardly go unnoticed on the weekend of the first national lottery draw when a large proportion of the country's adult population was dreaming of sudden riches. Postal chiefs, in particular, must have been weeping over what might have been theirs but for a few recalcitrant Conservative MPs bent on keeping the Royal Mail in public hands. Michael Heseltine, the industry secretary, appeared to defend the rise when he said that the former state-run utility had been transformed into a 'world class company, winning in the market places of the world.' By 1998, after its reorganisation is complete, the company will have shed some 40,000 jobs out of its UK gas business. The British Gas remuneration committee concluded that its directors were underpaid compared with other UK-based international companies of a similar size. While retention would not be expected to be an issue with Brown, who at 59 has a 39-year career in the industry behind him, the company pointed out that were he to fall under a bus tomorrow it would need to have a competitive salary and bonus package in place to attract potential successors. Gordon Brown, Labour's industry spokesman, has responded by assuring us that he will remove the tax benefits for executive share options which have bumped up directors' pay for so long. It seems that the Conservative Party is working on similar lines. As pointed out here previously, however, removing the income tax exemption is unlikely to make much difference to the popularity of such schemes for the simple reason that the top marginal rate of income tax from which the realised options are exempt is the same as that of Capital Gains Tax from which they are not. The biggest loss in any change would be the annual Pounds 5,800 tax free allowance for CGT and the ability to delay the tax liability to the point at which the shares are sold. The differences made by such a change in tax treatment could not be expected to deter companies from running executive share option schemes. David Tuch, a tax partner at KPMG Peat Marwick, argues against removing the income tax exemption if options are to be used as a way of keeping a director's financial interest in the company. Income tax could force their sale, in part, to pay the tax that would become due at the point the option was exercised, he says, thus reducing the financial interest which remuneration committees are seeking to retain. In a new survey into executive share option schemes, KPMG has found that some Pounds 7bn of the Pounds 10.5bn in publicly quoted shares allocated to executive option schemes in the UK are without reference to the performance of the company. While the situation is changing, says Tuch, slightly more than half the companies introducing schemes since 1988 have provided performance targets for their schemes. Tuch is unimpressed by the various targets linked to earnings per share which he says have not proved very demanding in most cases. He suggests that regulations could be introduced, imposing restrictions extending the period that executives need to hold onto their options after they have been granted. This would reduce the temptation to cut and run. Such restrictions already exist in the US and France. At least British Gas is making its executive pay more visible and replacing its existing executive directors' share option scheme with a long-term incentive arrangement similar to that operated by Reuters. This will align the interests of the executives more closely to those of the shareholders. A suggestion by the MSF technical union this week that chief executives should have part of their pay related to their performance was timely, if also mischievous, particularly when the union added that it could be apportioned on the basis of an appraisal by subordinates. The point that the MSF seemed to be making was that if you are going to introduce certain types of human resource medicines such as performance-related pay you should be prepared to take them yourself. For some reason big companies seem to treat their directors on a different basis than their other employees. General pay rises to the mass of the workforce seem to be awarded using the principle that asks: what is the least we need to pay them while keeping them motivated and in post? In contrast the approach to the board and other higher management often seems to be: if you cut costs and maximise profits you will reap handsome returns for yourself. This has led to what CK Prahalad and Gary Hamel described in their book, Competing for the Future, as an obsession among US and British management with improving their return on investment by reducing each or all of four elements: investment, net assets, capital employed and head count. As Prahalad and Hamel observe, US and British managers can downsize, declutter, de-layer and divest better than any others. The result in Britain during the mid 1980s, they point out, was manufacturing productivity increasing faster than that of any other large industrialised country except Japan. While they cut their workforces, however, British companies did little to create new markets either at home or abroad, according to Prahalad and Hamel. In effect, they say, British companies surrendered global market share. 'One almost expected to pick up the Financial Times and find that Britain had finally matched Japan's manufacturing productivity - and that the last remaining person at work in British manufacturing was the most productive son of a gun on the planet,' they wrote. So who has reaped the financial benefit for this profitability at the expense of jobs? Is it the managers who made it happen? Is that what executive share options have done - awarded big bonuses to people who have learned how to get more out of fewer people? These are the people who have employed equations similar to that quoted, somewhat cynically, by Charles Handy, the business writer - 1/2 x 2 x 3: half as many people in the core of the business, paid twice as much, producing three times as much. Prahalad and Hamel, however, warn against too vicious downsizing. They write: 'What employees hear from such companies is 'people are our most important assets'. What they see is that people are the most expendable asset.' Restructuring seldom results in fundamental business improvements, they write. At best it buys time. What it may have also bought is time for smaller competitors benefitting from growth fed partly by the expertise of those employees cleared out in the recession. In the meantime consultants continue to wrestle with the most appropriate ways of rewarding and retaining higher management. If the British Gas pay package had been structured to encourage its top managers to come into the company, restructure, then take the money and run, the criticism of Brown's pay rise might have had more validity. Unlike many other companies - as the KPMG report revealed - British Gas has tried to link pay and performance in a meaningful and transparent way. In so doing it appears to have overcome the iniquities of simple bolt-on share options where performance is related more to the level of the market. The real performance test now will be whether managements of slimmer, restructured companies can produce the growth to match productivity gains.</p>

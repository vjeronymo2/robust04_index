			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- The Russian prime minister is  holding an emergency conference on the latest developments in  the Crimea, the press service of the Russian Government informed  ITAR- TASS.    The press service has been unable to specify when Russian-  Ukrainian negotiations on the subject at the prime ministerial  level will begin today.    The political situation in the Crimea has been growing  increasingly tense since the Crimean Parliament passed a law to  restore the constitution of the Republic of Crimea adopted on  May 6, 1992. The constitution provides for greater independence  of the peninsula in relations with Ukraine.    Kiev regards this move as a manifestation of separatism and  a  threat to Ukraine's territorial integrity.</p>

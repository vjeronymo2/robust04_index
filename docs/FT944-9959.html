			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Sport: Nice teeth, but who was his sire? - Equestrianism Auctioneer Nick Nugent was struggling. He is one of Ireland's finest men with a gavel, but it needed all his blarney and bluster to coax bids from the packed stands at the High Performance Horse Sales in Warwickshire last week. 'It's a market in which English buyers are going to need educating,' said Nugent, patiently in the circumstances. John Studd, a London chartered surveyor whose hobby is owning and breeding competition horses, sat anxiously awaiting the arrival of Lot 10. His five-year-old chestnut gelding Gunner Killinghurst should make a top three-day-event horse. Normally such an animal would be sold by word-of-mouth, 'out of the field' as horse-folk put it. However, Studd is not alone in believing that times must change. He wants a Continental-style breeding system with full information on the pedigree of every horse which would be sold, vetted and warranted, at a prestigious sale. 'Look at the Verdun auction sale where horses for show-jumping and eventing routinely make Pounds 40,000-Pounds 100,000. There's no private market for these types of animals in Germany,' he said. Studd hoped that Gunner Killinghurst would make Pounds 5,500. The first of the British HPH sales was in 1987. Its aim was to put more science, method and cash into an area of equestrian sport in which the UK had excelled by using traditional methods. So long as the horses won, whether at Olympia or the Olympics, it mattered not whether they were bred and bought in the gloom of a black art. However, as the sports of showjumping, eventing and dressage became more popular in continental Europe, British ways, and the performance of the animals, began to fall out of step with the Continent. Newcomers to the equestrian world also demand a marketplace, where even if they lacked the 'eye for a horse', they could still buy with confidence. Blackpool solicitor Anthony Slater was at the HPH sale to buy a horse for his daughter Jane, 22, about to take up eventing. 'I've never bought at an auction before and I'm finding it a nerve-wracking experience,' he confessed. Slater successfully bid to 9,000 guineas for the five-year-old bay gelding Ben Fox. He was impressed at the chance to inspect the horses over a period of days and compare animals of similar age. Slater, a novice purchaser, felt the sale organisers were reassuringly honest about faults in a young horse. Yet the clincher was probably the clear lineage behind Ben Fox. Prominent in the foyer at the HPH sale were the trailblazers of the British Horse Database. This was set up a year ago, largely on a Pounds 250,00 grant from the Worshipful Company of Saddlers, to tackle the problem that most British horses just have no paperwork to prove their identity or parentage. The phenomenon stretches top to bottom. In 1992, Mary Thomson won Badminton on King William, a horse that represented Britain at the Olympics the same year. The gelding is an orphan child. No one, least of all Thomson, who bought him on a hunch in a farmyard, has a clue about William's breeding. His mare and sire could by now have produced a string of top eventers, with attendant sporting and financial benefits, if there were any breeding records. Of course, breed groups, most notably the Hunter Improvement Society, do keep careful records. Yet they are hard for a non-member to use. The BHD has plans for modem access into its database (as happens in the French equestrian industry via Minitel) and, equally importantly, will monitor how horses perform in competition. 'At the moment, by the time the results are collated and a stallion is identified as a good competition sire he's either quite elderly or dead,' said Flora McDowall, development controller with the BHD. Yet for all the good intentions there are still only 6,000 animals on the database. In a rational world the HPH sale would be where the future winners of Burghley, Olympia and the Olympics were to be bought. And the Thomsons, Whitakers and Todds would be in the audience buying for the late 1990s. But at Stoneleigh, neither the horses nor the buyers had star quality, suggesting that the top animals are still being sold quietly in a field somewhere, for a fraction of their potential value. More than half the horses presented at the HPH sale failed to make their reserve and were withdrawn. The top price was just over 12,000 guineas, an opening bid at Verdun. And Studd? Gunner Killinghurst took all Nick Nugent's skill but he finally sold at 4,300 guineas. 'We're going the right way but it will take time,' sighed the owner.</p>

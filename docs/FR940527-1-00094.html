			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These applications have not been clearly set forth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulations. Therefore, we propose to revise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;413.134(e) and 413.153(d) to clearly address both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are also proposing to make a technical change to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;413.134(d)(1) to correct a reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Proposed Changes for Hospitals Excluded From the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prospective Payment Systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. New Requirements for Certain Long-Term Care Hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Excluded From the Prospective Payment Systems (&sect;412.23)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1861(e) of the Act and the regulations at 42  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR part 482 define a hospital as an institution that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifies to participate in Medicare because it meets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain health and safety standards, known as ``conditions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation'' (COPs). A hospital must be surveyed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the COPs by State agencies that work under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement with HCFA unless, under section 1865 of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and regulations at 42 CFR part 488, the hospital is presumed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to meet the COPs on the basis of accreditation by the Joint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the American Osteopathic Association.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recently, some entities have discovered that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process for becoming a provider under the COPs can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manipulated to permit them to receive exclusion from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment systems. Specifically, hospitals have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> begun to organize themselves under what they themselves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refer to as the ``hospital within a hospital'' model. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this model, an entity may operate in space leased from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital, and have most or all services furnished under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangements by employees of the lessor hospital. The newly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organized entity may be operated by a corporation formed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled by the lessor hospital, or by a third entity that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls both. In either case, the new entity seeks State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensure and Medicare participation as a hospital,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrates that it has an average length of stay of over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 25 days, and obtains an exclusion from the prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment systems. The effect of this process is to extend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the long-term care hospital exclusion to what is for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practical purposes a long-term care hospital unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe it may not be appropriate for a long-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care ``hospital within a hospital'' to receive an exclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the prospective payment systems. The considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underlying exclusions from the prospective payment systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may not apply to these entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the prospective payment systems, hospitals are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paid for inpatient services on the basis of prospectively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined rates. Under section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain hospitals and units are excluded from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment systems including, psychiatric,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitation, children's, and long-term care hospitals,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and psychiatric and rehabilitation units. These hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and units are excluded because they could not be paid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriately under the prospective payment systems. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statute does not exclude ``long-term care units'' of general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The prospective payment systems are based on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> averaging concept which recognizes that some patients will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stay longer and consume more resources than expected, while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> others will have shorter, less costly stays. We expect that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an efficiently operated hospital will be able to deliver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality care to Medicare patients at an aggregate cost no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater than its aggregate Medicare payments under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment systems for each cost reporting period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The DRG system does not, however, apply well to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-stay hospitals. Those hospitals have few short-stay or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low-cost cases, and might be systematically underpaid if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment method applied. Thus, exclusion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entire long-term care hospitals from the prospective payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems is appropriate. However, if an entity that provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-term care is part of a larger hospital, the reasons for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusion may not apply. A long-term care ``hospital within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a hospital'' is essentially a long-term care hospital unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which accounts for only a part of the larger hospital's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient load. The principles underlying the prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment systems do apply to the larger hospital, unlike  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entire long-term care hospitals. Exclusion of long-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care units could inadvertently encourage hospitals to try to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abuse the prospective payment systems, by diverting all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-stay cases to the excluded unit, leaving only the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shorter, less costly cases to be paid for under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment systems. In such cases, hospitals would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> profit inappropriately from prospective payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, we believe it may be inappropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to grant an exclusion to a long-term care ``hospital within a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital.'' Moreover, exclusion of long-term care ``units'' is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistent with the statutory scheme. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act clearly provides for exclusions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the prospective payment systems for long-term care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals, and also for psychiatric units and rehabilitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units, but the statute does not provide for exclusion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-term care units. Also, we note that section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act begins with the phrase ``as used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section'' in referring to hospitals; we believe this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language suggests that the definition of ``hospital'' for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment purposes may be different from other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definitions. Furthermore, section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides that excluded from the definition of prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment systems hospital is a psychiatric or rehabilitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit of a hospital that is a distinct part of the hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``as defined by the Secretary.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe these distinctions were intended to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaningful, and that it would undermine the distinctions if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we allowed exclusion of long-term care units. Because we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe such exclusions are contrary to the purpose and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheme of section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act, we are proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to revise the regulations to prevent inappropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusions. Section 1871 of the Act provides that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary ``shall prescribe such regulations as may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to carry out the administration of the insurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs under this title,'' and section 1102 of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorizes the Secretary to ``make and publish such rules and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations *&blank;*&blank;* as may be necessary to the efficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of the functions with which [the Secretary]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is charged under this Act.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

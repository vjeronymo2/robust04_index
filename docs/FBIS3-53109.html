(Retd)  Nasirullah Babar said Thursday that activists of Al-Zulfiqar  Organisation (AZO) did get terrorist training from the Indian  intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW).    "Training camps were set up in Rajasthan and other areas of  India, where many AZO activists were brain-washed and thus, they  became RAW agents," he said during on informal chat with newsmen  at a lunch hosted by the Senate chairman, Wasim Sajjad.    The minister said that RAW agents were active in Sindh. "I  have read a report which showed that Jam Sadiq was a RAW agent."    "The mere fact that a political worker was lashed or  underwent imprisonment is not a certificate for patriotism," the  minister said when his comments were sought on the credentials  of Suraish Kumar, a supporter of Mir Murtaza Bhutto, who was  dubbed as a RAW agent by the government the other day, and who  was known as a "[word indistinct] of Bhutto" in Sindh.    He told a questioner that Murtaza Bhutto was not involved in  the 1961 hijacking of the PIA passenger plane and this was  mentioned in a report prepared by the Army during the martial  law period. "His name was then put in "Khana [list] number two  (meant for suspects) in the FIR [first information report]."    "Let the time come," was his reply when asked whether the  government would arrest Begum Nusrat Bhutto in connection with  Wednesday's incident in Larkana.    "We are looking into the matter," he said when asked how did  the RAW agents enter into Al-Murtaza, Larkana. He said he would  ask the Sindh government why it did not take the necessary  measures before hand to stop their entry in the residence.    The minister said the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] would  not  split and described Begum Bhutto's statement in this regard as  just a "hubble". He said Makhdoom Khaleequzzaman and Ihtramul  Haq had left the PPP long time back.    He said that the Murtaza factor would have no impact on the  PPP in the Punjab. "When there is a change of generation there  is a change of leadership too, but nobody can be imposed on  workers as their leader."    The interior minister said the Judicial probe into the  Larkana incident was in progress. "It will establish who opened  the firing first. It cannot be said at this stage whether the  provincial government failed to handle the situation."    He said that he received the report of the incident at 11  a.m. on Wednesday from the Sindh government. "We were prepared  to send reinforcement but the provincial administration did not  ask for assistance."    To another question, the minister said it was the flawed  policy of Ziaul Haq which led to the influx of foreigners in  Pakistan. At that time, 8,000 visas were issued to the Indian  nationals to visit Pakistan but, now, the figure has been  restricted to 40 and the police verification has been made  mandatory, he said.</p>

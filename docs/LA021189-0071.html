			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FABERGE TO SELL COSMETICS UNITS TO UNILEVER;  </P> <P> ARDEN, BRUT, AQUA NET AMONG FIRMS INCLUDED IN $1.55-BILLION DEAL  </P> <P> Faberge Inc. said Friday that it has agreed to sell its beauty products and  toiletries businesses -- which include the Elizabeth Arden, Brut and Aqua Net  lines -- to international consumer products giant Unilever Group for $1.55  billion in cash.  </P> <P> The deal is another in a long line of acquisitions in the cosmetics industry  and one that would give Unilever, a British-Dutch company, a much greater  presence in the United States. It also would boost the size of Unilever's  personal products business by more than 25%.  </P> <P> "Unilever has for years planned on becoming more important in the U.S.," said  Suzanne Grayson, a cosmetics and toiletries industry consultant. "They have not  been able to do it on their own. So, they have gone about buying companies."  </P> <P> In 1986, Unilever acquired such well-known American brands as Prince  Matchabelli fragrances and Vaseline when it bought Westport, Conn.-based  Chesebrough-Pond's for $3.1 billion. Unilever, with worldwide sales of more  than $30 billion, also makes such products as Lipton teas, Wisk detergent and  Lifebuoy soaps.  </P> <P> Analysts said $1.55 billion is a high price for the cosmetics and toiletries  divisions of Faberge, which is owned by New York financier Meshulam Riklis.  When word of negotiations between the two parties leaked out last month, some  industry analysts estimated that the divisions would fetch $1 billion.  </P> <P> "They are are probably overpaying," said Grayson, "but it's going to be worth  it in the long run."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Doing 'Very, Very Well'  </P> <P> Under Riklis' ownership, New York-based Faberge has become one of the world's  largest cosmetics and beauty products companies. Elizabeth Arden, which was  acquired in 1987, and Faberge reported combined sales of $800 million and  operating profit of more than $100 million for the fiscal year ending last  month.  </P> <P> "They have been doing very, very well," said Paul Cohen, publisher of Beauty  Age, a trade publication. "They also have increased the volume of spending on  the brands, which has helped each one of the brands strengthen their position  in the marketplace."  </P> <P> Cohen said Faberge's chairman, Daniel Manella, deserves much of the credit for  boosting profitability and sales at Faberge. Manella, reached at his weekend  home in Palm Beach, Fla., said he will continue working for the Riklis family,  as he has for the past 33 years.  </P> <P> Manella boosted profit at Faberge mostly by reducing costs, analysts said.  After acquiring Elizabeth Arden, Faberge moved quickly to meld overlapping  operations worldwide.  </P> <P> "We consolidated factories, offices and warehouses all over the world, and we  did it really quickly," said Manella, who added that Arden's operating profit  more than doubled within a year after Faberge took over.  </P> <P> Faberge products are divided into roughly two large categories: low-priced  goods, such as Brut cologne and Aqua Net hair spray, sold primarily at mass  merchandisers and supermarkets; and higher-priced Elizabeth Arden fine  fragrances and cosmetics sold in department stores.  </P> <P> Faberge will retain the McGregor Apparel Group, which includes clothing lines  such as Botany 500, Wonderknit and Billy the Kid.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Keep Building Image  </P> <P> Manella said there never were any plans to sell Faberge but that the Unilever  offer "was something that had to be explored. They are getting a bargain. The  company will appreciate in value in by several hundred million."  </P> <P> "This is the best thing that has ever happened to Arden," said Grayson,  maintaining that Unilever has the money needed to continue building the brand's  sales and image. Arden has "not been able to get a younger image," she said.  "It's a tough business and everybody in the industry is working hard and the  competition is terrific."  </P> <P> In a prepared statement, Unilever said: "The Faberge and Elizabeth Arden  businesses provide an excellent fit with Unilever's existing personal products  operations worldwide. Elizabeth Arden's portfolio of brands will provide  Unilever with a global presence in the prestige segment of the skin care and  color cosmetics markets."  </P> <P> Industry analysts said the acquisition is one of many in recent years that have  reduced the number of players in the slow-growing and highly competitive U.S.  cosmetics industry. In one of the biggest previous deals, Revlon purchased Max  Factor in 1986 for $345 million.  </P> <P> "The total industry is in the mature phase of the life cycle," said Cohen at  Beauty Age. "It is normal for to go through a lot of consolidation."  </P></p>

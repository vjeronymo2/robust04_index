			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Attitudes harden in dispute at Bank of Italy over pay A LONG-running dispute at the Bank of Italy over the renewal of a three-year wage and work conditions contract for the bulk of the institution's 9,400 employees has become more entrenched and the unions are threatening stoppages and other disruptions next month, writes Robert Graham in Rome. Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the governor, is holding firm against a wage increase which would breach the 4.5 per cent ceiling laid down in the 1992 budget for public sector pay rises. The bank cannot afford to be seen to be setting a bad example at a time when it has been critical of high public sector wage claims in the previous two years which have helped fuel inflation. But the unions are arguing that the current rate of inflation is unlikely to be below 5.5 per cent this year and that the wage ceiling increase is unrealistically low.</p>

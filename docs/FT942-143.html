			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Lower' gas prices may not seem that way Sir, In their vision of lower prices for all gas consumers (Letters, June 24), Mr Ted Trafford and his six colleagues attribute a contrary view, that there will be 'winners and losers' to the opponents of competition. It is actually a view held by supporters of competition, including the Gas Consumers Council and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The latter's 1993 gas report said 'some groups may be worse off than at present', a theme acknowledged by Ofgas, the industry regulator, and the Department of Trade and Industry in their joint consultation document's emphasis on the need to avoid 'unacceptably abrupt price movements for particular groups of consumers'. A common objective for the GCC, the DTI and Ofgas, in their support of competition, must be to minimise or, better still, avoid price increases during transition from monopoly to competition. British Gas has only until April 1996 to follow government policy by re-balancing its monopoly tariffs to the cost-reflective basis which will allow competition to thrive. The question is whether today's cross-subsidies, which enable British Gas to supply millions of customers at below cost, are of such a size that their removal will cause significant price rises for those who use little gas or live far away from North Sea terminals. Mr Trafford's prophecy stands a good chance of fulfilment, but if the promised 'lower' prices are initially higher for many people than they pay today, those consumers may not see the point of the whole exercise.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L.G. Ilina, A.N. Galkin, doctor of agricultural </F> sciences, and A.I. Kuzmenko, candidate of agricultural sciences,  Slita Polvolzhya Scientific Production Association; UDC  633.111.1''321'':631.526.32]    [Abstract] The variety Saratovskaya 58 was developed at the  Scientific Research Institute Agriculture of the Southeast by  graduated hybridization. The starting plant was selected from  the population of the last cross of Saratovskaya 46 x  Saratovskaya 39. It has been regionalized in regions I and III  of the Saratov Oblast since 1991 and in the oblast's II region  since 1992. It is of the variety lutescens. The spike is  cylindrical and of average compactness. Its glume is of average  size, and the tooth of its glume is short. The grain is red,  oval, and glassy. A total of 1,000 grains weighs 35.9 g.  Saratovskaya 58 is a medium-maturing variety, with a growth  period averaging 84 days and with a period of 45 days from the  appearance of shoots to the heading stage, which is practically  on a par with the standard Saratovskaya 46. Saratovskaya 58 is  more drought resistant than the latter and thus provides a more  stable yield from year to year under the conditions of the right  bank of the central lands along the Volga. The upper leaves of  Saratovskaya 58 have a higher water retention capability than  Saratovskaya 46. When compared with varieties previously  regionalized in the said region, Saratovskaya 58 has a higher  multiyear yield: In tests conducted over a 3-year period at  government variety-testing sections in the Saratov Oblast,  Saratovskaya 58 averaged 2.1 metric tons per hectare versus 1.8  metric tons per hectare for the standard. In commercial tests  conducted in 1989 at the Kolkhoz imeni N.G. Chernyshevskiy in  the Novoburasskiy Rayon of the Saratov Oblast, the yield of  Saratovskaya 58 was 16 percent higher than that of Saratovskaya  46. Saratovskaya 58 is virtually completely resistant to smut  and is resistant to sprouting of the grain (in comparative  tests, only 0.2 percent of Saratovskaya 58 grains sprouted  versus 30.5 percent of Saratovskaya 46 grains). From a grain  quality standpoint, Saratovskaya 58 is a hard wheat, and from  the standpoints of gluten and protein content, it is somewhat  superior to the best hard wheat (Saratovskaya 29). Saratovskaya  58 has a higher gluten content than the standard Saratovskaya 46  and is in quality group 1. Like all hard wheat varieties,  Saratovskaya 58 must be raised in rather fertile soil that is  free of weeds, and it must be sown as early as possible in  moist, well-prepared soil at a rate of 120-150 kilograms of seed  per hectare.

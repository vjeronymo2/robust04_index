			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> A LOWBROW LOOK AT THE 'LITTLEST VICTIMS' OF AIDS  </P> <P> It's 1982, and a doctor has diagnosed AIDS in several of his non-gay,  non-addict patients, but the public, the medical community and especially the  Reagan Administration are all seen as suspicious or nonplussed about what was  still widely considered a "gay plague." It's "the wrong disease, hitting the  wrong people," says one of the many naysayers who tries to keep this medical  maverick in his place.  </P> <P> Does this sound a little like something out of "And the Band Played On," the  landmark investigative book about the neglect of AIDS in the earlier part of  this decade? It should, but it's been watered down for popular consumption.  "The Littlest Victims," a TV movie airing Sunday at 9 p.m. (on Channels 2 and  8), is pretty much the lowbrow companion piece to that tome, assigning plenty  of historical blame for the escalating AIDS crisis but in a dramatically  simplistic and sentimental manner that Mom, Dad, Grandma and, heck, the whole  family can enjoy.  </P> <P> Hypocrisy hunters might be able to find a wee twinge here: The film makers get  on the case of the authorities for underplaying the disease's significance as  long as it was mostly limited to homosexuals. Yet the movie's way of tugging at  heartstrings includes neglecting to create a single gay character among the  litany of victims.  </P> <P> Instead we get cute kids, all about to be cut down in the prime of their  presumably heterosexual childhood, all due to bad blood transfusions or  repentant parents who made boo-boos. It's a sympathetic way into the tragedy  for a TV audience, certainly, but can the film makers really be critical of  those who leave homosexuals out of the equation when they do the same thing  with their plot?  </P> <P> That debatable quibble aside, the movie has its politically correct heart in  the right place. It's only dramatically that it is really prone to attack. The  hero is Dr. James Oleske (Tim Matheson), a New Jersey pediatrician who butts  heads with his superiors when he concludes that several children suffer a  condition previously assumed to be exclusively sexually transmittable.  </P> <P> Generally unconvincing as it is, "The Littlest Victims" is not without moments  of clarity, as when a distraught mother asks, "I messed up my own baby -- is  that what you're saying to me?" Even that scene doesn't play as an epiphany  should, but set apart from its soft dramatic bed to loll around in the  consciousness of the viewer, it's a horrifying thought -- which, when all is  said and done, may be enough for one show to induce.

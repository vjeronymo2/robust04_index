			<p>BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 9  June.    The inflation rate calculated by the Economic Research  Institute Foundation, Fipe, indicates a 1.12 percent drop  compared to the April rate. The most accentuated drop was in  the price of foodstuffs, which increased 44.4 percent in April  and only 37.59 percent in May. The price of beef increased 22  percent, well below the level of inflation, while the price of  beans decreased 8 percent. The May Average General Price Index,  IGP-M, measured by the Getulio Vargas Foundation, totalled 42.58  percent and was lower than expected. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO  BRASIL in Portuguese 7 Jun 94 p 1)    Science and Technology Minister Israel Vargas has reported  that President Itamar Franco authorized an amendment to the  budget allowing the allocation of $120 million of privatization  resources to science and technology projects. He said that in  addition to 30 percent of all Bank of Brazil Foundation  resources, the $300 million in loans granted by the  Inter-American Development Bank will also be assigned to the  sector -- $200 million to finance scientific and technological  development projects at Brazilian private companies, and $100  million to the official research organizations.

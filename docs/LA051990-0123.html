			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION 5-A BASEBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> EDISON DIGS EARLY HOLE, FALLS TO TORRANCE  </P> <P> Edison High School Coach Paul Harrell knew his team was facing a good-hitting  team in the first round of the 5-A baseball playoffs. But he never figured to  be down by seven runs after the first inning Friday.  </P> <P> Torrance, which came in with a .333 team batting average, sent 12 men to the  plate in the first and went on to a 10-7 victory over Edison at Torrance Park.  </P> <P> "I knew there would be a lot of scoring going on," Harrell said. "But you can't  spot a team like Torrance seven runs. It's awfully tough to come back."  </P> <P> Edison's Donnie Smith (5-2) hit the first batter he faced, then walked the next  three. Then Torrance's Kendall brothers -- sons of former big league catcher  Fred Kendall -- jumped on reliever Phil Jensen.  </P> <P> Sophomore catcher Jason Kendall greeted Jensen with a two-run single and an  error on the play allowed a third run to score. Then older brother Mike lifted  a towering home run to left to give Torrance a 6-0 lead with no outs. The final  run in the inning was unearned.  </P> <P> Edison (18-8) cut the deficit to 7-4 with five singles off senior right-hander  Mike Kendall (9-3) in the second and third. But Torrance scored three more runs  in the fourth, highlighted by Ruben Montoya's third hit of the game, a two-run  single.  </P> <P> The Chargers scored three times in the seventh on run-scoring hits by Bryan  Higgins, Steve Thobe and Rocky Balch.  </P> <P> Balch's two-out double off the left-field wall put Edison runners on second and  third.  </P> <P> Antone Williamson Torrance's regular third baseman, came in to pitch and struck  out Josh Gingrich on four pitches -- the last one a fastball on the outside  corner for called strike three -- to end the game and record his second save.  </P> <P> Torrance (19-8), tri-champion of the Bay League, will play Westlake (26-1), the  No. 2 team in the nation in USA Today's Top 25, in the second round Tuesday.  </P> <P> In other 5-A games:  </P> <P> Katella 7, Royal 2 -- Traveling two hours from Anaheim to Simi Valley didn't  disturb the Knights.  </P> <P> Katella's Dennis Briggs led off the game with a home run, knocking a  three-and-one pitch over the 390-foot mark in center field for his second homer  of the season.  </P> <P> "We enjoy going on the road because we have the chance to take advantage of the  smaller fields," Katella Coach Tim McMenamin said. "We play in a park with a  415-foot center field."  </P> <P> Outfielder Eric Boyd also enjoyed the Highlander park, smacking a two-run home  run over the right-field fence in the fourth, scoring Briggs, who was three for  four. Boyd's homer, his second, gave Katella a 5-0 lead.  </P> <P> Danny Allen (8-3) pitched five innings, allowing six hits and four walks with  three strikeouts. Chris Drummond, who is 7-1 with six saves, allowed one hit  over the final two innings.  </P> <P> Mater Dei 5, Fontana 2 -- Doug DeJardin had two hits and scored twice, Lionel  Hastings had two hits, scored twice and had one RBI and Cale Carter had two  hits and three RBIs to lead host Mater Dei. Carter's two-out single in the  first inning gave Mater Dei (19-8) a 2-0 lead. Sean Sutton (7-4) pitched a  seven-hitter, struck out seven and walked one for Mater Dei.  </P> <P> Esperanza 6, Beverly Hills 4 -- Rich Hills and Jason Hodges each had two hits  and two RBIs to lead Esperanza (20-6). Shade Summers (8-0) pitched 3 1/3 relief  innings for the victory and Dan Redington got fifth save in pitching the last 1  2/3 innings.  </P> <P> Marina 4, Hacienda Heights Wilson 2 -- Marina scored three runs in the third  inning on Mark Newfield's RBI single and Nick Valencia's two-run single to win  at Wilson (23-5). David Schultz had a RBI single in the first inning and scored  in the third for Marina (13-12-2). LISA GRALL  </P></p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Demand for water stocks WATER SHARES were boosted by a series of broker buy recommendations and also by heavy demand from Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, which yesterday announced the creation of a 'Water Basket' comprising call and put warrants on the four water stocks in the FT-SE 100 index. These are Anglian, North West, Severn Trent and Thames, all of which were outstanding performers in the sector. Salomon has been a big buyer of the four stocks over the past couple of trading sessions. Thames was the most heavily traded (4.6m shares) and the biggest gainer in the sector, ending 9 higher at 382p, closely followed by Anglian, 8 up at 374p, North West, 6 better at 378p, and Severn Trent, 5 to the good at 350p. Mr Steve Doe at Smith New Court pinpointed Anglian, Southern (4 up at 340p), North West, Thames and Yorkshire (3 firmer at 387p) as best buys in a sector which he said: 'Fails to take account of the possibility of a Tory government, or even a laissez-faire Labour government.' A broad review of the outcome of the forthcoming general election by Nomura's utilities team was highly positive for North West and Severn Trent. BP above worst An oil sector still bruised by last week's disappointing trading statement from BP and worries over the group's dividend prospects was further depressed yesterday by a negative view of the latest Opec agreement. The agreement, by Opec members, to reduce output by around 1.4m barrels a day disappointed oil specialists, who had expected bigger cuts. 'It should have positive implications for equity markets but not for the oil sector,' said Mr Nick Clayton at Smith New Court, who saw British Gas as 'the only safe high-yielder in the sector'. County NatWest was aggressively switching from BP into British Gas yesterday, according to dealers. Mr Simon Flowers at County said that, with BP set to underperform, Gas looked more attractive. BP was again the most heavily traded stock on the London market, with turnover exceeding 15m shares. It closed 5 off at 263p, but after having dropped to 248p at one point. British Gas climbed 7 1/2 to 248p on 6.5m traded. Shell Transport, due to report preliminary figures on Thursday, managed a minor gain at 468p, responding to switching from BP in a move described by specialists as 'a flight to quality'. Reuters still busy Reiteration of a buy stance ahead of an enthusiastic note helped Reuters Holdings climb 21 to 1156p with 1.1m shares traded. Securities house Henderson Crosthwaite says the shares are on a very low rating. A research document from Henderson, to be published today, also argues that rival companies' products, designed to compete with Reuters' new automated foreign exchange system, Dealing 2000-2, are experiencing technical diff-iculties. Analyst Mr Brian Newman of Henderson said: 'The shares look set to assault the previous Pounds 13 high reached in July 1990.' The stock has also been moved higher by a revival of interest from the US. Stores firm Stores received a boost from a report by the Confederation of British Industry that sales in the distribution sector are showing signs of improvement. The CBI report reinforced hopes that tomorrow's UK retail sales data for January will show a recovery from December's fall of 0.9 per cent. City forecasts point to a January rise of 0.2 per cent. Hopes that the sector may lead Britain out of recession inspired a rise of 9 to 245p in Dixons, as 1m shares changed hands. This followed a recent recommendation from Barclays de Zoete Wedd that Dixons is poised to be one of the major beneficiaries of an upturn in consumer spending. Marks and Spencer moved ahead 7 1/2 to 323p on turnover of 3.8m and Kingfisher put on 5 to 507p in a market trading 1.9m. The better than expected CBI distributive trades survey encouraged Boots to rise 9 to 461p. WH Smith 'A' also gained from hopes of a recovery in sales, adding 14 at 457p, while Great Universal Stores 'A' improved 40 to 1479p. Monument Oil &amp; Gas slipped a penny to 33 1/4 p; the overnight ticker revealed that 22m shares were traded at 32p after the market closed last Friday. The deal was believed to be the two sides of a share sale by Secab, the investment division of Swedish group Mercurius. PowerGen and National Power underperformed, closing only marginally up on the day, while the Scottish generators made good progress in heavy trading after Kleinwort Benson was said to have recommended a switch into the two stocks. Scottish Hydro rose 3 to 107p on 4.6m shares. Scottish Power, with 6m traded, put on 2 to 103 1/2 p. British Aerospace ended easier at 270p in nervous trading ahead of tomorrow's full-year figures. Engineering group Bullough gained 5 to 551p. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is a buyer of the stock and said: 'Trading on a discount to the market . . . and offering yield premium and strong asset backing, the shares represent one of the best recovery plays in the sector.' Press comment benefited a number of transport-related stocks. BAA jumped 12 to 577p, while British Airways put on 4 to 258p on turnover of 4.1m. P &amp; O bounced 10 to 388p on reports that Chelsfield, a private company with whom it operates the Pall Mall Properties joint venture, is planning a public listing. Expectation of good news from the interim results on Thursday lifted Glaxo by 25 to 840p. Analysts are looking for profits between Pounds 690m and Pounds 730m, against Pounds 623m for the comparable half year. Protective clothing and equipment manufacturer Wardle Storeys declined 9 to 336p after one securities house was apparently unable to place a line of 1.2m shares in the market. Waste management group Attwoods finished 2 easier at 144p in spite of a brokers visit to Germany yesterday and today. Analysts said there were still worries about financial controls. Pharmaceutical retailer Macarthy forged ahead 18 to 305p on hopes that the Department of Trade and Industry will this week clear two rival bids for the company. A weekend press article revived optimism that the bids, from Lloyd's Chemists (unchanged at 336p) and Unichem (off 2 at 207p), which have both been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, will be cleared. Food retailer William Low dropped 38 to 224p on a warning from the company that difficult trading conditions and the cost of new openings meant profits for the year to September 1992 would fall short of last year's figure of Pounds 23.56m. Analysts were looking for profits of around Pounds 26m. Mr Nick Irens, regarded as a significant contributor to First Leisure's fortunes, resigned as finance director to set up his own business, although he will remain with the company until a replacement is found. The shares lost 2 to 294p. Bid speculation returned to Mountleigh and Rosehaugh. Mountleigh edged up a quarter of a penny to 10 1/4 p on busy turnover of 3m following weekend press reports that it could be a target for Chelsfield, Mr Elliott Bernerd's private property group, which is being prepared for flotation. Rosehaugh, a popular bid target, was also fingered as a possible candidate, the shares adding 1 3/4 at 10 1/4 p in active volume of 1.2m. George Wimpey, the housebuilding group, moved up strongly to close 6 higher at 117p, with turnover of 5.2m said to have been substantially boosted by a series of agency crosses. A Kleinwort Benson recommendation was behind a surge in Wickes shares, which closed 8 ahead at 80p, after 82p. Kleinwort's retailing team described Wickes as 'one of the best recovery plays in the sector'. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (66).

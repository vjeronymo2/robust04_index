			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The Australian market, after easing throughout last week, stabilised when sales were resumed and showed a little morestrength yesterday. This represents an overall picture as indicated by the Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator, which a week ago was 468 cents a kg., and by yesterday was at 469 cents. Some wool types eased, mainly finer Merinos, but others were firm to dearer, with middle range Merino fleece in strong demand yesterday at Adelaide. Trade generally subsided a couple of weeks ago with prices and buyers remaining cautious.</p>

The  agreement established a broad base for us to build on, he said.    Shahaq was speaking after the morning session of talks in  Taba. He said that a number of security issues were discussed,  including the formation, responsibilities, and mission of the  Palestinian police force. He said this subject will be  discussed further during the negotiations, which will continue  for a week.    Shahaq said the Palestinian-Israeli Civilian Affairs  Committee will begin meeting tomorrow, Tuesday, until Thursday.    He said the committee will discuss Palestinian detainees in  Israeli prisons. This subject, he added, was discussed in the  early rounds of the Taba talks, and will be completed in the  current round.    Shahaq said the negotiations agenda was changed because of  the month of Ramadan.    MENA has learned that tomorrow's session will be held from  0800 to 1400, and will resume from 2000 to 2200 Cairo time.    General Shahaq and Palestinian chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th  first held a private meeting. The two delegations then held an  expanded meeting. Absent from the talks today were lawyer Jamil  al-Tarifi, head of the Palestinian delegation to the Civilian  Affairs Committee, and Gadi Zohar, head of the Israeli  delegation to the same committee. Al-Tarifi will arrive in Taba  this evening.    The Palestinian and Israeli delegations held a second  session  of talks in Taba this afternoon; it is expected to continue  until just before iftar [breaking of the fast], when the Israeli  delegation will leave Taba for Israel.</p>

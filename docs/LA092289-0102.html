			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOP SENATORS AGREE TO OFFER A NEW DRUG PLAN  </P> <P> Republican senators, following six hours of negotiations with Democrats, agreed  late Thursday to take a new plan for financing the war on drugs to the White  House for consideration.  </P> <P> Sources said the plan contained some of the selected cuts in spending the Bush  Administration had wanted as a way to offset increases in the drug program as  well as an across-the-board reduction in federal programs to raise the bulk of  the money.  </P> <P> Republicans said they would not consider the plan a tentative agreement without  White House approval and they indicated that there was no rush on the part of  the Administration to provide that.  </P> <P> "We've been on the phone to (White House chief of staff John H.) Sununu all  night," Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.) said as he emerged from the negotiations  along with other tired senators.  </P> <P> Republicans said they would take the plan to the White House today and then  reconvene their negotiations with the Democrats. Senators declined to comment  on specifics of the plan.  </P></p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / The ERM Crisis: Delors warns of dangers to single market MR Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, warned last night that a collapse of the European monetary system would be a serious blow to the single market, agencies report from Paris. He was speaking while finance ministers and central bank officials of the twelve EC countries were still meeting in Brussels in a marathon session to try to salvage the European exchange rate mechanism after the latest turmoil in the currency markets. His remarks came before ministers announced their decision on wider bands of fluctuation for most ERM currencies. The single market, launched at the end of 1992, 'could not survive if there were constant exchange rate fluctuations or competitive devaluations,' Mr Delors said in an interview with the FR3 television channel. 'Without stable exchange rates inside the Community, we would lose all the benefits of a big single market,' he said from his holiday home in central France. The single market is the EC's ambitious programme, largely in place, to remove barriers to the movement of goods, currency and people within the 12 member states. Mr Delors said he personally favoured floating the D-Mark. He saw this as the best solution to the latest crisis in the EMS since the problems stemmed from a unique situation in Germany created by unification. 'Given that there is a country which is undergoing difficulties because it has to finance German unification, and given that it has an inflation rate a little higher than the others but with a currency respected worldwide, it could take a break from the system for a few weeks or months,' he said. Mr Delors added that a few years ago the exit of the D-Mark from the European monetary system would have destroyed it. But he said: 'Today there are five other strong currencies in the system and as a result the system is completely different from that of a few years ago. 'It is true that the D-Mark is the world's second reserve currency, but the other (EMS) currencies are stable and strong and they are able to co-operate among themselves.' Mr Delors said he had discussed the currency crisis by telephone with several heads of state but gave no details of these discussions. Mr Lamberto Dini, deputy governor of Italy's central bank, predicted at the weekend that the European monetary system would survive its worst battering since it was founded in March 1979 to bring stability to exchange rates.</p>

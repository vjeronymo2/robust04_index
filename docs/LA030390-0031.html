			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPER MATH TEACHER JAIME ESCALANTE  </P> <P> I am not surprised that Escalante has decided to quit public school teaching.  </P> <P> Escalante's success in teaching an academic discipline is an aberration in a  school system that lobotomizes its students.  </P> <P> In fact, those who begrudge his success would have offered him unconditional  love, moral support and admiration had he been a championship football coach,  the sponsor of a massive fund-raiser or one of the countless mindless,  frivolous non-academic extracurricular frills that abound on the campus of  every school, college and university throughout the nation.  </P> <P> Teachers who ask for academic reforms must be punished! Five years ago a former  principal took away the French classes she knew I loved to teach, and last  summer I was blacklisted when I applied for a French teaching position in  another school.  </P> <P> Our public schools will never improve until anti-academic administrators are  replaced with those who will reward dedicated, brilliant, hard-working and  gifted teachers like Escalante, instead of kicking them out of the school  system!  </P> <P> GILBERT A. RUBIO  </P> <P> La Puente  </P></p>

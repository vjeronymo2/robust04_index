			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- China has established  a ground-based test system for space flights, paving the way for  the further development of the country's aerospace industry.    The various kinds of ground test facilities and devices that  have gone into operation make it possible to carry out any  conventional or routine test on satellites and rockets on the  ground.    Wind tunnels provide test results at different stages of  rocket launching while large-sized heat-testing devices ranging  from one m to seven m in diameter allow simulations for  satellite flights in outer space and in different temperatures.    China has also built a gigantic rocket testing launch pad  which is 59 m high, 41 m long and about 22 m in width, providing  a large amount of test data for rocket engine system designs.    In addition, it has also built a huge centrifugal machine  and  vibration test tower, both controlled by modern computers.</p>

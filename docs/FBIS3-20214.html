Following  his afternoon meeting with Denktas, Feissel said the situation  has not changed since last week and the United Nations did not  receive the answer it wanted. He added that now is the time to  prepare the report to the UN secretary general, who will make  his own observations.    The UN secretary general's report to the Security Council on  the progress of efforts to implement the confidence-building  measures [CBM's] is expected to be submitted by the end of the  month.    Answering a question on the topic, Feissel said he had  personally asked for the meeting with Denktas and that no new  meeting has been set. Asked whether there is a deadlock,  Feissel said never and nothing is ever final but he added that  it is relatively clear that the UN goal has not been achieved  now. He said that he would brief President Glavkos Kliridhis on  the outcome of the meeting but first he would inform the UN  secretary general about the situation and what has happened in  the past few weeks.</p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Thailand expects budget deficit THAILAND'S Bt560bn (Pounds 15.17bn) budget for fiscal 1993, which predicts a budget deficit for the first time in four years, was passed by the House of Representatives in Bangkok at the weekend. The bill was approved on Saturday after hours of squabbling between members of parliament over such issues as the budget money that Thai MPs are authorised to spend on projects in their own constituencies. The appointed Senate is expected to endorse the budget this week. Revenue is estimated at Bt534.4bn. Officials of the budget bureau defended the deficit, amounting to Bt25.6bn or about 0.9 per cent of gross domestic project, on the grounds that additional funds were needed for investment in roads and other infrastructure. Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Democrat prime minister, has promised to develop rural areas. It is possible that the projected deficit will in any case never materialise. Last year the budget was balanced, but the government ended up with higher revenues and lower spending than expected, leaving a surplus of Bt52.3bn, or about 2 per cent of GDP. This year's budget, covering the fiscal year from October 1992, is six months late because of the political upheaval in the country last year. Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon was removed from the premiership after 50 pro-democracy demonstrators were shot dead by soldiers in Bangkok in May, and an interim government ran the country until the September elections which brought Mr Chuan to power. Economists have mixed views on the budget. Proponents of higher spending point out that the treasury is now sitting on an accumulated surplus of Bt220bn and that expenditure for the first half of this year has already been held at last year's levels by the delay in preparing the budget.</p>

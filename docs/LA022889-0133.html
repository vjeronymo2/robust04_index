			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK;  </P> <P> SADUNAS HOPES TO SWEEP MATER DEI TO GIRLS' SOCCER CHAMPIONSHIP  </P> <P> Saule Sadunas is a serious student. She is just as serious on the soccer field  where she plays sweeper for Mater Dei. She has to be.  </P> <P> She often is the last line of defense before the goalie.  </P> <P> Sadunas, The Times' athlete of the week, is one of the county's best sweepers  and a major reason for Mater Dei's success this season. The Monarchs won the  Angelus League title, are 22-4-2 and will play host to Canyon in the semifinals  of the Southern Section 3-A playoffs at 3 p.m. today.  </P> <P> Mater Dei has scored 69 goals and allowed only 11.  </P> <P> "The thing I see about Saule that carries her beyond other sweepers is, number  one, she is unbelievably consistent, and she does what we call in soccer  'constructive distributions,' " Coach Marty Breen said. "She doesn't just kick  the ball up field to get the pressure off . . . when Saule moves the ball, we  retain possession. She is constructively building something, not just kicking  it away, but generating a quick counterattack. That comes from her intelligence  and ability to see how things are evolving on the field."  </P> <P> Saule has earned a 4.3 grade-point average on a 4.0 scale by taking honors  courses in English, history and algebra.  </P> <P> An intelligent sweeper is a luxury, said Monarch goalie Michelle Lodyga, who  has logged 20 shutouts this season thanks to her abilities and her defensive  support.  </P> <P> She and many of her teammates credit Saule as the team's unsung hero.  </P> <P> "It's hard to play with a sweeper who is either not confident or not smart  enough to realize something is not working. But Saule is very confident,"  Lodyga said.  </P> <P> Saule, a junior, played her first two seasons on varsity as a forward.  Initially, she was upset about the switch to the low-profile position of  sweeper this season, but she has adjusted.  </P> <P> "I think a lot of the team realizes my contribution," she said. "They tell me  how they know I don't get a lot of recognition, but that they really appreciate  what I do. So in a way I do get recognition."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Joni Easterly scored 44 points in two games to help Katella's girls' basketball  team to Southern Section 4-A playoff victories over Woodbridge and top-seeded  Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> Keri Erkenbrack's three-point shot with 7 seconds remaining gave Canyon a 49-48  semifinal victory over Camarillo in a 4-A playoff game. She finished with 29  points.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda guard Aimee McDaniel connected on 15 of 16 shots for a season-high  35 points in the Wildcats' 3-A quarterfinal victory over St. Lucy's of Glendora  Thursday. She scored a team-high 18 points Saturday in a semifinal victory over  St. Joseph of Lakewood.  </P> <P> Goalie Michelle Lodyga made nine saves and recorded her 20th shutout of the  season for Mater Dei (22-4-2) in a 1-0 quarterfinal victory over Long Beach  Wilson Wednesday in the second round of the 3-A soccer playoffs.  </P> <P> Sophomore Lynn Murray scored two goals, including the game-winner in overtime,  and assisted on another goal to pace the top-seeded Esperanza girls' soccer  team to a 3-1 victory over Chaffey Tuesday in the second round of the 4-A  girls' soccer playoffs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Saule Sadunas  </P> <P> Mater Dei High School  </P> <P> Position: Sweeper  </P> <P> Height, Weight, Class: 5-4, 115, Junior  </P> <P> Last Week: Saule was the starting sweeper in two playoff victories in which the  Monarchs allowed only one goal.  </P> <P> Season: Saule anchors a Monarch defense that has posted 20 shutouts.  </P></p>

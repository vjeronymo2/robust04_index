			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Major backs Patten stance CHINA'S ATTEMPTS to undermine the position of Mr Chris Patten, the governor of Hong Kong, were bluntly repudiated by Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday. While reaffirming Britain's readiness to have further talks with China without pre-conditions he told the Commons that the government stood 'four square' behind Mr Patten. 'No one should doubt that the governor has our total support,' he said. In a tribute to Mr Patten the prime minister said he had acted 'sensitively, resolutely and correctly', and assured MPs that Britain would continue to make this clear to China, which is due to regain sovereignity over Hong Kong colony in 1997. Mr Major stressed that the governor's proposals for wider democracy were widely supported in Hong Kong, in the UK and in the international community. Mr Patten had acted entirely within the terms of the documents agreed with China. 'We expect the Chinese government to do likewise,' he said.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Strangeways team beats private-sector bids THE REBUILT Strangeways Prison in Manchester will be managed by a public-sector in-house team that yesterday beat six private-sector companies in competitive tendering to run the jail. Strangeways - seriously damaged in Britain's worst prison riots three years ago - was the first example of public and private sectors competing for a prison management contract. Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the Prison Service, announced yesterday that the Pounds 79m five-year contract would go to the in-house team led by Mr Robin Halward, the governor. The public-sector bid, said Mr Lewis, was a 'strong and imaginative proposal which offered the best overall value for money'. All seven bids were scrutinised by an evaluation panel chaired by Mr Peter Chapman, a Home Office official. Four were rejected - one on cost grounds and three because of doubts about ability to deliver the contract. Mr Chapman said the decision to recommend acceptance of the in-house bid from the shortlisted three was reached by a majority vote. Ministers are pledged to developing private-sector involvement in the criminal justice system, but will not be unhappy about the outcome at Strangeways. In order to win the bid Strangeways staff have made a variety of concessions on working arrangements, including accepting a procedural agreement that restricts their right to take industrial action. Such developments at local level will be seen as a means of eroding the traditionally tough industrial relations stance taken nationally by the Prison Officers' Association, the service's main union. One of the final three bidders was Group 4, the private security company that runs Wolds Remand Prison, Humberside, and prisoner escort services in the east Midlands and Yorkshire region. Mr Jim Harrower, its managing director, said: 'I am delighted that the public sector has won - that is what competition is about. I welcome the POA to the prison privatisation programme.' Mr Lewis said the spur of competition had generated bids which represented levels of performance and value for money not previously seen. The outcome provided proof of the capability of the Prison Service. He added that the private sector should not be discouraged, as it had been a close-run thing. The public-sector bid is based on staffing levels of 450 - compared with 523 under the old regime - although the new Strangeways will house fewer prisoners. Financially, the bid envisages a cost structure of Pounds 350 per prisoner week, compared with a national average of Pounds 437 in 1991-92. It provides for prisoners spending up to 14 hours a day out of their cells with full-time work, education and training programmes.</p>

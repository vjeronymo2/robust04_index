			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Letter: Lloyd's Name denies not having shared risks Sir, Your article, 'Tory MP Names attack Lloyd's' (May 21), mentions the reference to me in the Commons early day motion tabled on Wednesday by Paul Marland MP. Although I am no longer involved in the day-to-day running of this company, I can confirm that when I was its proprietor (up until October 1990), a fundamental principle of the agency was that either I or my wife, also a director of the agency, would participate on all syndicates on which our Names were placed. This was the agency's policy from inception of the company in 1976. In the case of the syndicates referred to in the early day motion on which Donner Names were placed - ie Bohling syndicates, managed by Devonshire, and Marine Syndicate 299, managed by Gooda Walker - my own, or my wife's involvement has meant that we have both suffered our share of the losses. I considered it my responsibility to share the fortunes of recommendations with Names and this policy was clearly communicated to them - indeed, many Names found this very reassuring. My involvement in syndicate 45 was also mentioned in the early day motion being a syndicate I joined in the mid-1960s. I endured the major losses it suffered when it crashed at the end of that decade. When the syndicate was restored to profitability, I sought additional capacity for Names whose affairs I was managing but was refused, despite the strenuous part I had played in the syndicate's rehabilitation. I appreciate that Mr Marland is, like myself and many other Names, suffering personal losses at Lloyd's, but I bitterly resent that he should use his parliamentary privilege to vent inaccurate accusations.

			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / UN says 250,000 flee Rwanda slaughter United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali yesterday urged the Security Council to consider authorising the dispatch of a large military force to halt the slaughter in Rwanda, where he said 200,000 people may have been butchered in the past three weeks, Reuter reports from the UN. The killings have resulted in a huge flow of refugees, with the UN refugee agency reporting that more than 250,000 Rwandans had flooded into Tanzania in the previous 24 hours in the largest and fastest exodus it had ever witnessed. The UN chief made the recommendation in a letter to the council only eight days after it voted unanimously to reduce a 2,500-strong UN force sent to that central African country last year to only about 270. Citing evidence that new massacres were being planned, Mr Boutros-Ghali said: 'I urge the Security Council re-examine the decisions which it took  . and to consider again what action, including forceful action, it could take, or could authorise member states to take, in order to restore law and order and end the massacres.' Mr Boutros-Ghali did not say how many troops might be needed to end the slaughter, which erupted after Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and President Cyprien Ntaryamira of neighbouring Burundi were killed April 6 when their plane was shot down as it was landing at Kigali, the capital. The US yesterday circulated a resolution within the Security Council that would impose a total trade embargo against Haiti and punish its military rulers. US diplomats said they were sending copies of the draft to the other 14 members of the council. They hoped the resolution will be adopted next week. The council has already imposed an oil and arms embargo against Haiti. The new sanctions would ban all trade, except food and medicine. The resolution would also give key military and police figures 15 days to leave office or the country.</p>

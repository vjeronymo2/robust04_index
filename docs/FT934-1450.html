			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Metallgesellschaft Just ten days ago, Mr Hilmar Koppar of Deutsche Bank advised people to be more relaxed about Metallgesellschaft. It is difficult to be so now. Seldom do German banks axe virtually the entire top management from a company they effectively control. Seldom, too, does a supervisory board complain that management has deliberately withheld information. A special audit of the group's US activities, a revision of the latest annual accounts which showed a loss of DM347m, and explicit reference to the need for a capital restructuring all suggest problems extending beyond mere over-trading of US oil futures. Two things stand in Metallgesellschaft's favour. First, it is difficult to imagine the banks allowing such an important company to go to the wall. Second, Mr Kajo Neukirchen, who they have brought in to run it, has a strong reputation as a troubleshooter, having already sorted out KHD, Hoesch and Kugelfischer. But yesterday's statement shows that even the supervisory board has no clear idea of the task he faces. Quite apart from the German recession, which has made Metallgesellschaft's expensive investment in pollution controls look singularly ill-timed, the omens are not good. Unlike other German companies, Metallgesellschaft refuses to break exceptional gains out of its profit figures. That raises doubts about the underlying returns from the extravagant acquisition programme of the late 1980s. To raise cash, Mr Neukirchen may be forced to sell off valuable assets like Lurgi and Buderus, while the looming rights issue could be substantial. The market's initial inclination to treat the management change as a portent of recovery looks premature.</p>

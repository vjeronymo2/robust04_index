			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa said Wednesday Japan will accept in principle draft  sanctions against North Korea mapped out by the United States.    The proposed sanctions are on the whole close to what Japan  thinks proper to cope with the nuclear crisis, Kakizawa said  after an emergency meeting of government leaders called to  discuss the issue.    The U.S. plans to propose a sanctions resolution to the UN  Security Council over the nuclear standoff triggered by North  Korea's refusal to allow international inspections of its  suspected nuclear arms development program.</p>

(OMI), acting on its own behalf and as attorney-in-fact for Vulcan Carriers, Ltd. (Vulcan) requests, pursuant to section 608, section 804 and section 805(a) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (Act), 46 U.S.C. sections 1178, 1222 and 1223, Article II&hyph;16 of Operating-Differential Subsidy Agreements (ODSAs) MA/MSB&hyph;167(a), (b), (c), and (d), and Article 36 of Bareboat Charters between OMI Patriot Transport, Inc. (OMI Transport), OMI Courier Transport, Inc. (OMI Courier Transport), OMI Rover Transport, Inc. (OMI Rover Transport), or OMI Missouri Transport, Inc. (OMI Missouri Transport), and Vulcan, (1) permission to assign the ODSAs to OMI; and (2) following assignment of the ODSAs to OMI, a waiver of section 804(a) for OMI to operate vessels in the foreign trade and permission pursuant to section 805(a) for OMI to operate vessels in the coastwise trade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Transfer of the ODSAS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Article 36 of the Bareboat Charters dated February 5, 1990, between OMI Patriot Transport, OMI Courier Transport, OMI Rover Transport (formerly subsidiaries of OMI Bulk Transport, Inc. and now subsidiaries of OMI Corp., collectively the ``OMI subsidiaries''), or OMI Missouri Transport and Vulcan (collectively, ``the Bareboat Charters'') authorizes the OMI subsidiaries and OMI Missouri Transport, with the consent of OMI Oriole Transport, Inc. (OMI Oriole Transport) as time charterer, to name a successor bareboat charterer for the vessel named in the Bareboat Charter. The vessels named in the repective Bareboat Charters include the PATRIOT, COURIER, RANGER, ROVER, OMI MISSOURI and OMI SACRAMENTO (Official numbers 571049, 578746, 573810, 577241, 662123, and 662124, respectively.) These vessels operate under a subsidy sharing agreement pursuant to the terms of the ODSAs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, a successor bareboat charterer can be named, without cause, at any time after the first anniversary of the effective date of the Bareboat Charters, upon 90 days written notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In support of its instant application, OMI points out that it is an established vessels operator with over 25 years in operating experience. In addition, it is the second largest U.S. independent operator of bulk vessels. OMI notes in this regard that it has the ability, experience, financial resources, and other qualifications necessary to become an ODS operator. OMI is a citizen under the provisions of section 905(c) of the Act, and OMI's citizenship affidavit is on file with the Maritime Administration. OMI states that information on the experience and background of its personnel responsible for the administration of the ODSAs will be submitted prior to approval of the assignment of the ODSAs to OMI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Waiver of Section 804  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In addition to the transfer of the respective ODSAs to OMI, OMI requests a waiver of the provisions of section 804(a) for its continued operation of foreign-flag vessels. OMI requests that this waiver be valid for the duration of the ODSAs. The termination dates are April 2, 1996 (PATRIOT), July 30, 1996 (RANGER), January 26, 1997 (COURIER), and January 28, 1997 (ROVER).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OMI currently operates 34 owned and chartered-in foreign-flag vessels, primarily crude and product tankers and dry bulk vessels. OMI also has one foreign-flag vessel on order. OMI advises that operation of its foreign-flag vessels permits it to help cover administrative expenses related to the operation of U.S.-flag vessels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OMI believes that authorizing it to continue to operate foreign-flag vessels subsequent to the transfer of the ODSAs will not harm any U.S.-flag service. Moreover, no new service will be provided and no new vessels are being added to a trade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

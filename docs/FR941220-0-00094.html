			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Final Rule provides needed clarification by directing the employer to the ES complaint process and alerting the employer that a challenge of a SESA prevailing wage determination may be made only prior to filing an LCA in which that SESA determination is used. Implicit and essential in this process is the requirement that once an employer obtains a prevailing wage determination from the SESA and files the LCA without challenging the SESA's determination through the ES complaint process, the employer, in effect, has accepted the determination and waived its right to challenge the determination. Permitting an employer to operate under a SESA prevailing wage determination and later contest it in the course of an investigation or enforcement action is contrary to sound public policy; such a delayed, disruptive challenge would have a harmful effect on U.S. and H&hyph;1B employees, competing employers, and other parties who may have received notice of and/or relied on the prevailing wage at issue. Section  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .731(a)(2)(iii)(A) of the Final Rule explicitly states the Department's clarification of the use and consequences of the ES complaint process. Challenges to SESA prevailing wage determinations are made only through the State agency's ES process. See 20 CFR 658.410  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where the prevailing wage determination is made by the SESA prior to the filing of the LCA, the employer's avenue of appeal is through the ES complaint system, entering the system at the State level. See 20 CFR 658.410  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . However, where the prevailing wage determination is made by ETA (with or without consultation with the SESA) during the course of a Wage and Hour Division enforcement action, the employer's avenue of appeal also is through the ES complaint system, but the employer enters the system at the ETA regional office level. The employer will be notified where to file any appeal. For purposes of the H&hyph;1B program only, this is a collateral change to the ES complaint system regulations, which generally require all complaints to be filed at the SESA level (see 20 CFR 658.420  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .) and is notwithstanding the provisions of 20 CFR 658.421(a) and 658.426. Similarly, &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .731(d) provides that, where the employer does not have a valid prevailing wage determination, the Administrator, during the course of an investigation, may obtain a prevailing wage determination from ETA, which, in turn, may consult with the SESA and then determine the appropriate prevailing wage. Some employers also are contesting these ETA prevailing wage determinations at the Wage and Hour enforcement hearing provided under &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .835. The Department believes that the proper forum for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> all <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  prevailing wage determination challenges_whether the wage determination was obtained by the employer or by the Administrator (where the employer does not have a valid prevailing wage determination)_is the ES complaint process. Once the prevailing wage determination is final, either through the lack of a timely challenge or through the completion of the ES process, the determination shall be conclusive for purpose of enforcement. In such cases where the prevailing wage determination is made by ETA at the Administrator's request, any challenge must be initiated at the ETA regional office level within 10 days after the employer receives the ETA prevailing wage determination. Section  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .731(d) has been amended to reflect this clarification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .840(c) provides that where the Administrator has found a wage violation based on a prevailing wage determination obtained by the Administrator from ETA, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in the enforcement proceeding ``shall not determine the prevailing wage  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de novo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , but shall *&blank;*&blank;* either accept the wage determination or vacate the wage determination.'' This provision has been interpreted by some employers as permitting the challenge of prevailing wage determinations obtained by the Administrator from ETA. Section  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .840(c) was not intended to function as a forum for such challenges. Accordingly, &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .840(c) has been clarified to reflect that once the Administrator obtains a prevailing wage determination from ETA and the employer either fails to challenge such determination through the ES complaint process within the specified time of 10 days, or, after such a challenge, the determination is found to be accurate by the ES complaint process, the ALJ must accept the determination as accurate and cannot vacate it. As with other final decisions of the Department, the employer continues to have access to the Federal district court if the issues are not satisfactorily resolved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> h. Enforcement of wage obligation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (See &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .731(c)(5).) The Act requires employers to state that the employer is offering and will offer the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant, during the period of authorized employment, wages that are at least the required wage rate_the actual wage rate or the prevailing wage rate, whichever is greater. Furthermore, the employer is required to indicate on the LCA whether and H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant will work full-time or part-time. Under the Secretary's statutory authority to implement the Act, the regulations do not authorize an employer to decrease the payment of the required wage rate. In enforcement proceedings, however, the Department has encountered confusion over the employer's obligations where the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant is in a nonproductive status or circumstance. To alleviate such confusion, the following guidance is provided. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is no statutory or regulatory authorization for a reduction in the prescribed wage rate for any H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant who is not engaged in productive work for the LCA-filing employer due to employment related conditions such as training, lack of work, or other such reasons. The H&hyph;1B program was not intended to provide an avenue for nonimmigrants to enter the U.S. and await work at the employer's choice or convenience. Compare 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(iii). Instead, the H&hyph;1B program's purpose is to enable employers to employ fully-qualified workers for whom employment opportunities currently exist. The employer, having attested to the duration and scope of the intended employment ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , beginning and ending dates; full or part-time), has total control of the nonimmigrant's employment status. The Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(1)) requirements are such that once the H&hyph;1B status has been approved for the period specified by the employer, the employer controls the status and work of the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant, who is unable to accept employment elsewhere without a certified labor condition application and approved I&hyph;129 petition filed on the worker's behalf by another employer. For the purpose of DOL administration and enforcement of the H&hyph;1B program pursuant to these regulations, and H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant is considered to be under the control or employ of the LCA-filing employer from the time of arrival in the United States and throughout the period of his or her employment_regardless of whether the nonimmigrant is in training or other nonproductive status,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> except <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that if during the period of employment an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant experiences a period of nonproductive status due to conditions which are unrelated to the employment and render the nonimmigrant unable to work_e.g., maternity leave, automobile accident which temporarily incapacitates the nonimmigrant, caring for an ill relative_then the employer shall not be obligated to pay the required wage rate during that period, provided that the INS permits the employee to remain in the U.S. without being paid and provided further that such period is not subject to payment under other statutes such as the Family and Medical Leave Act (29 U.S.C. 2601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .) or the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League Secretary Umberto </F> Bossi by Guido Passalacqua at Ponte di Legno; date not given:  "Bossi's Broadside; `Democracy at Risk'"]    [Excerpt] Ponte di Legno -- [Passage omitted] [Passalacqua]  Mr. Deputy, on Wednesday [6 April] you will start consultations  with all the political forces in Rome. However, in Milan, your  men, Roberto Maroni, [League lower house floor leader] and  Speroni, are meeting with [Forza Italia leader] Silvio  Berlusconi. Which of the two is the real negotiating table?  The Roman or the Milanese one?    [Bossi] Everything is useful. I do my share. The League  wants to understand and assess the maturity of the various  political forces. We are living through an emergency situation  which is dangerous for democracy.    [Passalacqua] What do you mean by dangerous?    [Bossi] Do you realize that the winner may be a nonexistent  political force, Forza Italia -- an invented force -- and,  moreover, that the winner may be a single man, Berlusconi? We  do not want to be polemical, but we must be intellectually  honest. Democracy is in danger, we had never before faced this  kind of situation. Moreover, where can we go from here?    [Passalacqua] If, however, the League is forced to form a  government with Berlusconi, will such a decision make sense?    [Bossi] Of course, in order to save democracy.    [Passalacqua] How is this? First you form an alliance, then  you attack him. It is not very clear.    [Bossi] You see, people are asking us to be both the hangman  and the victim.    [Passalacqua] How do you mean?    [Bossi] I could form a government with "Napoleon"  [Berlusconi  nickname] and then, since my hands would be tied, I would have  to bash him with my head. I would have to do so every five  minutes. I would have to act as democracy's custodian. In such  a case, the League would be democracy's guarantor for the  country.    [Passalacqua] If Berlusconi is Napoleon, who are you?    [Bossi] I am general Kuznetzov. He is Napoleon, but  Kuznetzov won.    [Passalacqua] However, the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] is  granting you federalism, which is your main objective.    [Bossi] It is not mentioned even once in his platform. I  think that he does not even know what federalism means. It is  not enough to say "yes." I will continue to highlight the  Left's responsibility in this respect. It was Achille Occhetto  [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] who  legitimized him on television -- anything to defeat the League.    [Passalacqua] Many believe that you are saying all this in  order to get a higher price.    [Bossi] It would be simpler for us not to have any ties --  very little would be enough.    [Passalacqua] Meaning?    [Bossi] It is apparent from everything I have said that the  League is the only political force that can guarantee democracy,  the only political force that can hem in Berlusconi, that can  stop him, that can block the technocratic machinery set up by  Berlusconi.    [Passalacqua] In short, are you the only person who can do  all this?    [Bossi] The Left preferred to serve as a rival attraction to  Forza Italia, it preferred to attack the League in the election  campaign, without thinking of the consequences.    [Passalacqua] However, you have set up two negotiating  tables, one in Milan and another, as of Wednesday, in Rome. Why  is this?    [Bossi] I am in favor of a broad constituent government, as  broad as possible.    [Passalacqua] What does as broad as possible mean?    [Bossi] It means as broad as possible. I think I am speaking  clearly enough. I want to understand. I want to see who will  agree to this. I need to muster quite a lot of support in  parliament. The question is to start from the platforms, rather  than from "I won, I lost."    [Passalacqua] But are you still insisting on the  prerequisite  that President Scalfaro entrusts you with the exploratory task?    [Bossi] I believe so. I think that the League is the first  party in the Chamber of Deputies.    [Passalacqua] The president of the republic said that, in a  democratic system, you must know how to talk things over.    [Bossi] Scalfaro must entrust us with this task for two  reasons: a formal one, and an essential one. We are the first  party, and people have voted for us as the guarantors and  custodians of the Constitution. Berlusconi won, OK, but we know  that behind him, the winners are Craxi and Andreotti. The  other, formal, reason, is that we have the greatest number of  deputies in the lower house.    [Passalacqua] What happens if Scalfaro does not entrust you  with this task?    [Bossi] What can I do? You must make people understand what  is happening. Each is staking his own credibility before his  conscience.    [Passalacqua] Deputy Bossi, during the election campaign you  repeatedly put forward two slogans, two conditions, at every  rally: the first was "no" to Berlusconi as prime minister, the  second was "no" to the MSI [Italian Social Movement] in  government.    [Bossi] These are still our prerequisites. They remain  intact. The problem can once again be posed in terms of  federalism. We have seen the MSI opposing the regional  governments in parliament. What sort of federalism do you think  they could possibly favor? And Berlusconi -- are you aware of  what he stands for? I believe the real prerequisite is not to  give a mandate to anybody who represents all this.    [Passalacqua] In other words?    [Bossi] People have not understood the situation properly.  For example, the Mammi law [on broadcasting] must be redrafted,  we must clarify matters in this field.    [Passalacqua] You are saying that Forza Italia does not  share  a "common outlook" with the League. Berlusconi for his part is  taking you to task, he is threatening you with the possibility  of a split.    [Bossi] In this respect, Berlusconi is mistaken. Let him  grasp this: We have no allies. Let him grasp this: We reached  an agreement with him only to knock him down.    [Passalacqua] Berlusconi is saying that you are rehashing  the  Cencelli manual [power-sharing system].    [Bossi] What right does this guy have to say anything,  seeing  that he is only interested in sharing power. He, of all people,  who proposed a new twenty years [of fascist rule] when I spoke  to him?    [Passalacqua] You claim the League played a decisive role in  destroying the old system. Today Berlusconi is saying the  opposite. Who is right?    [Bossi] What can I say -- these guys are just a recycled  bunch.    [Passalacqua] In short, what is your opinion of Forza  Italia?    [Bossi] Forza Italia does not share our outlook. It was born  over a period of two years. Contrary to what is being said, it  was a longstanding project. It then found its men within a  period of 15 days, but there is nothing behind it. Forza Italia  is not even a tool in anyone's hands. We should be calling  Occhetto to account, given that he launched Forza Italia on TV  together with [MSI Secretary] Gianfranco Fini. A nonexistent  party was less frightening than a party like the League, that  had shattered the establishment.    [Passalacqua] So, Occhetto is to blame?    [Bossi] They turned a blind eye. They sniggered, "Ha, ha,"  now we will pull a fast one on the League, we will now share its  votes.    [Passalacqua] And now?    [Bossi] They are now confronting an uncontrollable  phenomenon  -- something dangerous enough, at times, to cause serious  concern.    [Passalacqua] Serious concern?    [Bossi] Anybody controlling TV changes the normal course of  events.    [Passalacqua] Meaning?    [Bossi] The risk is that this may become a technocratic  mechanism capable of interfering with the normal course of  democracy.    [Passalacqua] But could you govern together?    [Bossi] I do not know whether anybody can govern with that  bunch. What people are asking the League today is not to give  in as far as federalism is concerned.    [Passalacqua] You insist on a federal constitution,  something  which at least on paper, both Berlusconi and Fini are prepared  to grant you. However, what will this constitution retain from  the past? Many on the Left are demanding that the Resistance  should not be disowned. For years you have been repeating that  the League is anti-fascist. What have you got to say now?    [Bossi] I am saying that, as a continuation and at the same  time as an overcoming of the constitution which was born by the  people's struggle against the fascist dictatorship, what we need  today against the partyocratic dictatorship is a federalist  constitution.    [Passalacqua] As a continuation?    [Bossi] As a continuation.</p>

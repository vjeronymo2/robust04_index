			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The practice of placing bait (food or scent to attract wildlife) is a hunting activity allowed by some State laws and regulations. The baiting of bears is particularly controversial. While the total number of States allowing bear baiting has declined, State fish and wildlife agencies permit the baiting of black bear as a hunting activity in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The Forest Service intends to work diligently through its ongoing cooperative efforts to encourage the States to evaluate their regulation of the practice of baiting bears. In the meantime, the agency is issuing interim policy regarding the use of bait on National Forest System lands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the past, some national forests have regulated the placement of bear baits by requiring hunters and commercial guides to obtain special use authorizations in order to prevent conflicts with other users or other problems associated with the location and removal of bait. Additionally, some Forest Service Regions have issued orders under 36 CFR Part 261 to control litter, as well as to close certain areas to bear baiting where the practice would create unacceptable adverse effects on other resources or forest users. In early 1992, the Forest Service's role in the regulation of bear baiting on the national forests in Wyoming became an issue. Special use authorizations for bear baiting had been issued on a number of national forests in that State. Typically, those special use authorizations included conditions with which the holder had to comply to minimize adverse effects created by placement of bear bait. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In March 1992, the Regional Foresters for the Rocky Mountain and Intermountain Regions issued a joint closure order prohibiting bear baiting in the national forests in Wyoming, unless the baiting activity was conducted in compliance with the requirements of the order pertaining to the placement and disposal of baits. Like the conditions that previously had been included in special use authorizations, the requirements of the order were intended too minimize adverse effects on forest resources and users.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Fund for Animals and the Friends of the Bow brought suit to challenge the Forest Service's closure order and to challenge what Plaintiffs considered a shift in established policy, that is, no longer requiring special use authorizations for bear bait placement and using closure orders instead ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Fund for Animals  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Robertson, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (D.D.C. Civ. No. 92&hyph;1694&hyph;TPJ)). These groups perceived this shift in method as a diminution in the level of Forest Service regulation and wildlife protection. The parties settled the case upon the Forest Service's decision to rescind the closure order and, in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, to analyze the effects of eliminating the practice of issuing special use authorizations for the placement of bear bait on National Forest System lands in Wyoming. The Regions then prepared an Environmental Assessment to disclose effects on the proposed action and alternatives to the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon completion of the Environmental Assessment and issuance of a Decision Notice by the Rocky Mountain and Intermountain Regional Foresters in April 1993, there were new challenges to the agency's position. Subsequently, the Deputy Chief for the National Forest System decided that national direction was needed to end the conflict and controversy. Accordingly, the Decision Notice was rescinded, and bear baiting in national forests in Wyoming was prohibited pending issuance of national direction. However, because the spring hunting season will begin before a final policy can be adopted, the agency has determined that in fairness to outfitters, guides, and individual hunters, an interim policy should be issued to ensure consistency and uniformity of policy and practice by the Forest Service. State agency regulations have been developed and published in Wyoming and other States governing the use of bait in spring hunts for 1994. These new Wyoming regulations were developed in close coordination with the Forest Service to be in concert with federal regulation and law on the national forests involved and to be protective of National Forest System resources. In addition, hunters, outfitters, and guides in Wyoming have moved forward with the normal practice of planning and booking hunting activity based on the expectation that the Forest Service would have a final policy in place for the spring hunting season. It is unfair to continue the bear baiting prohibition in Wyoming when such a prohibition is not in effect on other National Forest System lands in other States where the practice is permitted, because of the agency's delay in adopting a final policy. Therefore, the agency has issued an interim directive to Forest Service Manual Chapter 2640, which is set out at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service special use authorization regulations at 36 CFR 251.50 exempt noncommercial use and occupancy, including ``hunting,'' from the special use authorization requirement. Since hunting methods subject to State regulation are included within the term ``hunting,'' the interim directive makes explicit that where State regulations permit baiting, the Forest Service will not require a special use authorization for the practice of baiting connected with hunting on National Forest System lands. Outfitter and guide activities require a special use authorization. Outfitters and guides must comply with applicable State laws and regulations, and Forest Service closure orders as a condition of special use authorizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, if the placement of bait should become a land or resource management issue and it is determined that the State regulations governing baiting would not protect resources in an area adequately or would otherwise be inconsistent with the applicable forest plan or conflict with federal laws such as the Endangered Species Act, then the authorized officer will issue an order to close the area to baiting. The authorized officer also may close an area to baiting considering the likely impact on a site-specific basis on water quality, public health and sanitation, or the potential threat to the viability of wildlife. Finally, the policy would explicitly prohibit the issuance of a special use authorization to individuals for the specific act of placing bait on National Forest System lands for hunting purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

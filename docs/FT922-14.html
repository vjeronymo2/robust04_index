			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: NY Daily News wins more time A US bankruptcy court last night approved a one-month extension - until the end of July - of the deadline by which The New York Daily News has to file its reorganisation plan under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law, writes Alan Friedman. The postponement will give more time for talks with prospective buyers of the New York tabloid, which was bought by the late Mr Robert Maxwell in 1991. The two main contenders for The News are Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian publisher who also owns the Daily Telegraph in London, and Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, the property developer who owns US News and World Report and Atlantic Monthly magazine. The key issues for both bidders are the reaching of an agreement with the trade unions representing the newspaper's 2,100 full and part-time workers and the settling of claims by the paper's creditors. Mr Black has already offered to set aside Dollars 75m for severance payments, working capital and his offer to pay between 25 and 50 cents on the dollar to creditors who are owed Dollars 43m. Mr Zuckerman is believed to be his making proposals to union leaders this week. ***** CBS/FOX FILM, the home-video venture of CBS and Twentieth Century-Fox with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer said they have settled a lawsuit in which CBS accused MGM of cheating CBS/Fox out of video cassette rights to successful films, AP-DJ reports from New York. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. CBS/Fox filed its lawsuit against MGM in November 1989 in Manhattan, seeking damages of Dollars 250m and an injunction granting it the home-video rights to the film 'Rain Man' as well as other hit films. The lawsuit also accused MGM of producing low-budget, inferior films solely to satisfy the company's obligation to provide films to CBS/Fox under a home-video contract. ***** A CLASS action lawsuit has been filed by a New Jersey consumer against Sears, Roebuck, the US retail chain, on behalf of people who paid Sears for unnecessary and/or over-priced car repair services, AP-DJ reports. The allegations include installation of parts that were not necessary, or charges for repair services that were not performed. The suit also alleges that Sears unjustly marked-up the prices for parts sold in connection with the repairs. ***** A SERIES of lawsuits against non-US steelmakers alleging unfair trading practices may be launched today by the six largest American steel companies, writes Alan Friedman. Although the legal actions could bring retaliation from foreign steel producers in up to 20 countries, US companies such as USX, Bethlehem Steel, LTV and Armco are expected to file anyway. ***** WASTE Management, the leading waste services company, expects second-quarter earnings to increase by about 23 cents a share to a total of about 67 cents, writes Barbara Durr in Chicago. This results from gains from an initial public offering (IPO) of shares by Waste Management International and some special charges.</p>

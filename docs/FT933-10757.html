			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / US Money and Credit: Treasuries soar on poor GDP data MR Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve and a central banker who places a lot of faith in close analysis of economic statistics and forecasting, was left with egg on his face last week. To the delight of Treasury investors, the second-quarter gross domestic product report came in well below market forecasts. News of the 1.6 per cent growth in second-quarter GDP sent bond prices soaring, and the yield on the benchmark 30-year issue back down to near 6.5 per cent, its all-time low. Analysts had been expecting growth of around 2.2 per cent, while Mr Greenspan, who should know about these things, told Congress just over a week ago that GDP would advance by nearer 2.5 per cent in the April-to-June period. Those comments, plus some heavy-handed remarks about inflation and the possibility the Fed will have to put up interest rates to stem rising prices, had been taken to heart by the bond market, which was confronted with the unwelcome prospect of rising economic growth, rising inflation and rising interest rates. After the declines of that week, this latest bond market rally came as a pleasant surprise, not least for equity markets investors, who several days ago were fearful interest rates may have bottomed. A variety of explanations have been offered as to why Wall Street's best economists, the Fed chairman, and everyone else for that matter, got the GDP numbers wrong. The most convincing of these concerns inventories. During the first quarter, when growth was extremely weak, companies piled up their inventories in the absence of strong consumer demand. When demand revived in the second quarter (consumer spending rose a healthy 3.8 per cent between April and June), rather than boost production, manufacturers ran down their stockpiles of goods. Clearly, analysts missed the inventory situation, which is why their forecasts were so awry. If the slowdown of inventory accumulation adequately explains the surprisingly poor rate of growth in the second quarter, then by the same theory, the pace of economic activity in the next three to six months should pick up handily as manufacturers step up production to keep demand satisfied. This prospect, however, does not seem to worry Treasury investors, who concentrated on the headline GDP number. Combined with the even weaker first-quarter figures, the economy grew at a meagre 1.2 per cent rate in the first half of 1993, a sharp slowdown from the 4.1 per cent growth rate achieved in the final six months of 1992. And, as Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette points out in its latest credit market circular: 'It is even more disappointing and somewhat worrisome that the growth rate in the first half of 1993 was a full percentage point lower than the growth rate of the economy during the first half of 1992.' The first half of 1992 came not long after the economy had pulled out of recession, so everyone expected growth to be weak back then. That the latest growth rates cannot match the performance of a year ago suggests the economy is in a poorer state than many imagine. All of this is good news for bonds. The Treasury market is receiving an additional boost from overseas, namely the turmoil in the currency markets. As the European exchange rate mechanism, and with it the entire European Monetary System, teetered close to collapse, international investors fled volatile European currencies for dollar assets such as government securities. There was, however, at least one factor against US bond prices last week - the Bundesbank's decision not to lower the all-important German discount rate. If the Bundesbank had cut the discount rate, even more money would have flowed into Treasuries. As it is, the bond market is doing well enough on its own, and forecasters are now looking forward to a 30-year yield below 6.5 per cent some time in the near future.</p>

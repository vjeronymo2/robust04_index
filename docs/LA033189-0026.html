			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY  </P> <P> The way to cut down on oil consumption, and thus oil transport and thus oil  disasters, is by substitution. And that means nuclear power. But just as  Americans do not want to pay a few extra pennies for gas, they refuse to run  the one in a zillion chance of getting killed in a nuclear-power accident like  Three Mile Island.  </P> <P> The opposition to nuclear power is fueled by risk aversion. But the idea that  we are reducing risk by burning coal and oil is an example of willful myopia.  The ecological risks of coal and oil are immense. They are, however, not always  immediately visible. They are shunted far away, to the atmosphere, to Alaska,  to future "greenhoused" generations -- anywhere but my back yard.  </P> <P> A country that, for no better reason than the fear of fear itself, kills a  $5-billion modern and safe nuclear plant in Shoreham, Long Island, before it  has produced a watt of usable energy has no right to complain when its Alaskan  shoreline is devastated by a tanker bringing portable fuel from elsewhere.  </P> <P> The lamentations rise for the fish and fowl and future of Prince William Sound.  The blame-laying and the breast-beating has begun. They miss the point. The  Valdez disaster represents America's attempt to export risk. The only reason we  are now so upset is that this time we did not export it quite far enough.  </P></p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Elf places Pounds 70m N Sea order ELF ENTERPRISE announced the award of a Pounds 70m contract to SLP Engineering to build an accommodation platform for its Claymore oilfield in the North Sea yesterday. The platform will include the up-to-date safety measures in the accommodation module that are required in the wake of the Cullen report on the Piper Alpha oil platform tragedy, in which 167 people died in 1988. It will replace the existing accommodation facilities on the Claymore A platform and the floating unit moored alongside. Safety measures on all North Sea facilities must be updated as a result of recommendations in the Cullen report. The new 11,000-tonne accommodation platform will be built at SLP Engineering's two yards at Lowestoft and Teesside. The platform will provide work for 670 people and is due to be installed in early 1995. Phillips Petroleum yesterday announced the award of a Pounds 28m contract to Kvaerner H&amp;G to design and supply facilities for its Judy and Joanne oil and gas fields in the North Sea. The company is discussing development plans for the fields with the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>

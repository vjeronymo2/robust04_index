			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Lloyds Pounds 1.8bn bid for C&amp;G may cut home loan costs: Bank's shares rise sharply - Building society members set to gain at least Pounds 500 each Lloyds Bank yesterday made a Pounds 1.8bn cash bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society in a move that could spark sharply increased competition to sell mortgages in the UK, and lead to a restructuring of the financial services industry. The bid, the first attempt by the UK's fourth largest bank to make an acquisition since the failure of its attempt to take over Midland Bank two years ago, would reward the society's 1.4m members with a minimum cash payment of Pounds 500 each. Lloyds' shares rose sharply after it disclosed the offer, closing 48p up at 585p. Shares of Abbey National, the biggest mortgage lender last year, dropped by 17.5p to 446.5p on the prospect of fiercer competition. The bid would create the fourth largest mortgage lender in the UK, supplying 7 per cent of the home mortgage market, if it is approved by the society's members. Lloyds would pay the cash to them in the second quarter of next year. The bid will have to be tested in the High Court because the Building Societies Commission, regulator of the UK's 84 societies, has issued guidance casting doubt on whether a third party can make payments to a society's members, and whether relatively new members are entitled to a share of the cash. A Lloyds acquisition of C&amp;G, which is the sixth largest society with assets of Pounds 17.7bn, would provide the biggest shake-up in the mortgage lending industry since the public flotation of Abbey National in 1988. It follows the failed attempt to merge Leeds Permanent and National &amp; Provincial Building Society last year, which was prompted by consolidation of the retail financial services industry amid flat mortgage demand. In an effort to preclude a rival bid, Lloyds has agreed with C&amp;G that the board will not put any other offer to its members for an undisclosed period. The full terms will be disclosed in a transfer statement this October. The bid follows prolonged speculation in the banking industry over whether Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, who is due to retire next year, would use the bank's growing capital to finance an acquisition. Mr Pitman said Lloyds would not be able to make a further cash bid of a similar size, but he did not rule out using shares to make another acquisition. He said demand for loans was likely to remain subdued and banks and societies would compete strongly. Under the proposed deal, C&amp;G will retain its own board and act as a separate subsidiary of Lloyds. It will sell its own mortgages, and design mortgages for Lloyds to sell in its own name. Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G's chief executive, will join Lloyds' board, along with the society's chairman Mr John Bays. Lloyds will nominate two non-executive directors to C&amp;G's board but will not exert executive control. C&amp;G approached Lloyds in late October through its adviser, the US bank JP Morgan, which it had hired 15 months ago to work on options including flotation. Among other banks which expressed interest was Royal Bank of Scotland. Other large building societies said the deal made sense from the point of view of both organisations, but some executives were sceptical about the commitment not to close any branches or lose any jobs. The cash payments to C&amp;G's members will include even those who are unable to vote, and will give the greatest rewards to those with the largest investments, subject to a maximum of Pounds 10,000 for any one account.

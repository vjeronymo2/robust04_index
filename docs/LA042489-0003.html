			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Islamic militants in Sudan attacked a Roman Catholic center for the destitute  and dying, injuring a nun and three other people, a Khartoum newspaper  reported. The newspaper Sudani said the Muslims left a mosque Friday after a  clergyman criticized the presence of the church-run relief center and attacked  the hospice in Omdurman, twin city of Khartoum. It said the militants reacted  after the government refused to impose strict Islamic sharia law on the  country. The next day, the paper said, a group of Christians retaliated with an  arson attack against mosque.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Anhui Raises Financial Work to New </F> Level"]    [Text] Last year, thanks to all levels of governments'  further unified thinking on financial management, stepping up  reform efforts, expanding sources of revenue, and cutting back  on spending, the finances of the entire province rose to new  heights. According to statistics, the province's financial  revenue in 1993 was 7.32 billion yuan, an increase of 32.7  percent over the same period last year. At the same time,  because of strict controls on and a rational arrangement for  spending, the province basically realized a balance in revenues  and expenditures and satisfactorily fulfilled the 1993 financial  targets set out by the new term of the provincial government.    Because of correct decisionmaking, the provincial CPC  committee and the provincial government achieved satisfactory  results. Last year, in view of the province's difficult  financial situation, the provincial CPC committee and the  provincial government called on all localities to build up  confidence and to reverse the financial situation. They called  for achieving 7 billion yuan in revenues in 1993 and for  realizing a basic balance in revenues and expenditures. They  worked out an eight-point plan on promoting the financial work  and set out specific demands on reaching the targets for  financial revenue and balance, and on devising measures to  realize these targets. The provincial government also signed  letters of responsibility with provincial financial departments,  various commissions, and city governments.    At the same time, all levels of departments changed their  thinking on financial management and also implemented the  thinking of self-reliance, of increasing revenues and reducing  expenditures, and of striving to achieve a balance through their  own efforts. Party committees and governments increased and  strengthened their support and leadership over financial work  and exerted more effort to explore new sources of revenue and to  cut expenses. While striving to increase sources of revenue,  many local governments also made efforts to rectify defects in  the fiscal contract responsibility system, to prevent revenue  losses, to exercise strict control over granting tax reductions  and tax exemptions, and to ensure the steady growth of financial  revenues. In 1993, prefectures and cities witnessed a  comprehensive growth in revenues. The province recorded a  breakthrough in revenues of more than 6 billion yuan, which was  followed by another breakthrough in revenues of more than 7  billion yuan. Many localities not only achieved a balance in  revenues and expenditures but also eliminated some of their past  deficits. None of the counties under the jurisdiction of  Xuancheng Prefecture suffered financial deficits over the past  decade. The province's deficits in 1993 were down from the  projected deficits by more than 500 million yuan. The improved  financial situation has greatly promoted the province's  sustained, healthy, and rapid development of its economy.</p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Technology: A new field of exploration - The oil industry could be revolutionised by a software standards project in Houston The half-a-dozen Texas oil men and computer industry executives sitting round a boardroom table in Houston last week bore little resemblance to die-hard revolutionaries. Sipping soft drinks, their demeanour was more that of correct corporate citizens. But their rhetoric revealed a true believer's commitment to nothing less than the wholesale destruction of the current structure of the world oil industry. Their chosen weapon is a new set of software operating standards being developed by the Houston-based Petrotechnical Open Software Corporation (Posc), a non-profit organisation set up in 1990 by British Petroleum, Chevron, Mobil and Texaco of the US and Elf Aquitaine of France, five of the world's biggest international oil companies. If implemented, the standards should ease the growing problem of data management and incompatible computer communication systems within one of the world's most technologically-intensive industries. And that could lead to early cost reductions in the 'upstream' exploration and production end of the oil and gas business. But the real power of the new standards is that they would enable companies to break down the barriers that have been built up over decades between the various technical and scientific disciplines involved in oil and gas exploration. Posc technology can be 'a destroyer of current organisations', according to Larry Gehagen, a BP executive seconded to the corporation. He believes that adoption of an industry-wide computing standard will be as important to oil companies as the adoption of a common gauge for track was to US railways in the last century. The result, he predicts, will be a radical restructuring of oil companies, with whole layers of bureaucracy being abolished. It could also usher in the era of the 'virtual oil company', in which small teams of specialists located around the world exchange complex geological and scientific data in near real time via information superhighways. That prospect, according to a Posc executive, caused one Alaskan oil man to note recently that: 'If this thing really works, one man and his dog could develop an oil field. And you might not even need the dog.' Several of the large computer groups and software suppliers such as IBM, Digital and Hewlett-Packard, are co-operating with the Posc project, along with government agencies such as the Department of Trade and Industry in the UK and the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. The need for a unified data and computer communication model for the exploration and production industry has long been recognised, according to Posc supporters. But attempts by companies, even the largest ones such as Exxon, to integrate the various technical functions failed because of the high costs involved. The scale of the problem has been exacerbated in recent years as exploration and production companies experienced an explosion of data from new seismic and other scientific techniques which have been developed. The current structure of most oil companies has also proved to be a problem. At present, most are divided into functional departments, such as geology, petrophysics and reservoir engineering, a structure which industry executives say tends to reinforce existing cultural differences between the groups. Traditionally, these departments have operated in relative isolation, and over the years they have tended to acquire unique solutions to their technical problems, both in terms of computer hardware and software. The result, according to Posc executives, is that information held by one department is often inaccessible by, or unknown to, another. In addition, the inability of the departments to share information without reformatting it to different standards has reinforced a linear corporate structure. And that has made it difficult to put in place the inter-disciplinary teams that many industry executives believe are the most effective way to organise the industry. Gehagen notes that the poor standard of data management within the industry can have expensive consequences. One company recently mobilised its resources for an urgent seismic survey in a portion of the Gulf of Mexico in advance of a US government auction of oil leases. At the last minute one member of staff remembered that some years before the company had not only conducted a seismic survey of the area, but had also drilled some inconclusive wells before handing it back to the government. 'Eighty per cent of data held by oil companies is historical and static,' according to Gehagen. Only 20 per cent is generally in current use, with an even smaller amount considered as secret, commercially strategic information. Even so, many companies jealously guard it, although a large number 'don't know what they have or can't find it' when they need it. All too often the result is that geologists and other professionals can spend up to 60-70 per cent of their time searching for information rather than using their skills to analyse it. One of Posc's main aims is to create standards that make consistent the way in which the industry stores information so that it can can be used more effectively. Handing over the management of such technical data to an outside company which could put it in a Posc-compatible format would save millions of dollars a year for most oil companies, says Gehagen. The development of such large-scale databases open to the industry would also free the various experts within the oil companies to spend the bulk of their time doing their job rather than tracking down data. The opportunity to transfer data easily between disciplines could also result in large cost savings. A recent pilot project in the US estimated that the time taken to drill a new well in an existing oil field could be halved if all disciplines were working to a common data model. 'Exploration and production companies continuously adopt new computing technology,' says Bill Bartz, Posc's president. 'If they proceed without the benefit of standards, they risk incurring unnecessary costs and experiencing critical delays in implementation.' It is that element of Posc technology that could propel oil companies into a radically different future. Most have launched extensive restructuring programmes to save costs in an era of relatively low oil prices. But they 'have slashed and burned without fundamental changes in their business structures,' says Gehagen. He believes that adoption of Posc standards would enable executives to make the best use of the team structure now being promoted by many companies. 'People around the world could be much more productive if they were working with the same underlying system.' The adoption of Posc would also have a big impact on information technology companies, which advise companies on how to implement such far-reaching changes, and on the software houses that supply the industry. The first software products designed to the new standards will begin appearing next year, although industry experts expect it could take three to five years to fully change over.</p>

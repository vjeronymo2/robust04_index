Kama  referred to a claim by a Pyotr Rozhok that a section of the  party, headed by the extremist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, is active  in Estonia. Since only registered political organisations are  allowed in Estonia and only Estonian citizens can form parties,  the activities of the Russian Liberal Democratic party in  Estonia are illegal, Kama stressed.</p>

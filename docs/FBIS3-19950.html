			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Bente Egjar Engesland report: "Warm Defense of Negotiated </F> Package"]    [Text] Norway has achieved good solutions in "all the  central areas," the prime minister said in defense of the EU  [European Union] agreement yesterday.    The new phase of the battle surrounding the EU was marked in  earnest yesterday with Gro Harlem Brundtland's report to the  Storting. After 11 months of negotiations, she was able  yesterday to brief the Storting on the agreement and make her  formal recommendation: yes to EU membership. In the course of  the spring Storting session, the government will put forward its  own report to the Storting on the agreement and an Odelsting  bill for a referendum.    The prime minister warmly defended the European Union's  "central idea" of "committed cooperation among independent  countries," before she turned to the contents of the agreement.    "Our point of departure was not to demand lasting exemptions  from the EU's body of regulations. In the negotiations the  government had more ambitious goals -- we have worked for  peculiarly Norwegian features and conditions to become part of  the EU and not for them to be exemptions," she said. The  government takes the view that Norway's "vital interests" have  been met with understanding. The prime minister pointed to the  detailed statement on sovereign rights over energy resources,  new arrangements for northern agriculture, and the fact that  Norway's arrangements for the administration of fisheries  resources will form the basis for the EU's fisheries policy in  northern waters.    On the subject of the controversial fisheries agreement, she  said that Norway has ensured "its right of ownership over our  share of fish resources," that the administration policy in  northern waters will be continued after a transitional period,  and that there will be duty-free access to the EU market for  fish and fish products.    The prime minister categorically rejected the notion that  Norwegian fishermen will have competition in their fishing  waters: No one will be allowed to fish for fish to which Norway  has the rights today. As in the past we will own over 98  percent of our share of cod in northern waters, and it is  therefore not the case that Spaniards or others can threaten the  resource base of Norwegian fishermen, she said. Only on one  point did she declare herself "not fully satisfied" -- Ireland's  freedom to fish its mackerel quota in the North Sea for part of  the year.    Around 85 percent of the land under agricultural cultivation  in Norway has been classified as production areas with special  difficulties. The prime minister also stressed the new system  of support for northern agriculture, which embraces the whole of  northern Norway and parts of southern Norway. The government is  "confident" that it will be possible to carry out the necessary  reorganization of Norwegian agriculture in such a way that "new  development possibilities" are guaranteed.    A basis for Norway's membership application was the  Maastricht Treaty's goal of political, economic, and monetary  union. Yesterday the prime minister focused on the goals of a  reduction in the public budget deficit, low inflation, low  interest rate levels, and a stable exchange rate. She called  these central elements in an economic policy for full  employment. According to the government, a common currency will  prevent speculation against individual currencies.    Yesterday Gro Harlem Brundtland concentrated on individual  elements in the agreement, but she also stressed her fundamental  argument for saying yes to the EU -- Norway will have greater  influence if it is a member than if it remains outside. "We are  not giving away our right of self-determination if we become an  EU member -- we strengthen our self-determination in relation to  forces over which we today have too little control," she said.  She stressed in particular the security policy challenges in  Europe and said that no individual country can secure security  and peace alone.</p>

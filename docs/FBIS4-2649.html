			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Full text" of 12 April RENMIN RIBAO editorial: "It Is </F> Necessary To Permanently Sound the Warning Alarm of  Anticorruption and Advocation of Honesty"]    [Text] Beijing, 11 Apr (XINHUA) -- Today, this paper made  public two important cases of economic crime, the verdict of  which was decided by the Higher People's Court of Beijing  Municipality. The first case is: Shen Taifu, former president  of the Beijing Changcheng Machinery and Electric Science and  Technology Industrial Corporation (hereafter referred to as  Changcheng Corporation), took advantage of his position to  embezzle public funds by resorting to fraud and other means. He  also unscrupulously bribed state functionaries. Because he  committed the crimes of embezzlement and offering bribes, he was  sentenced to death according to law. Sun Jihong (Shen Taifu's  wife), an offender in the same case, was also sentenced to 15  years of fixed-term imprisonment after being convicted of the  crime of embezzlement. The second case is: Li Xiaoshi, former  vice chairman of the State Science and Technology Commission,  accepted bribes from Shen Taifu and other people, and also took  advantage of his position to embezzle public funds. Because he  committed the crime of accepting bribes and embezzlement, he was  sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of 20 years, a punishment  for committing more than one crime.    As everybody knows, the illegal fund-raising activities  conducted by Changcheng Corporation has been a major financial  case rarely seen since the founding of New China. The size of  the capital raised by the corporation, the scope of such  activities, and the odious consequences caused by the case are  shocking. This has once again proved that in the process of  reform, opening to the outside world, and building a socialist  market economic structure, it is very important and necessary to  adhere to the principle of "grasping two links simultaneously,"  persist in cracking down on serious economic crimes, strengthen  the building of a clean government, and continue to launch the  anticorruption struggle in a sustained way. We should educate  the cadres and the masses by taking advantage of the negative  examples involving Shen Taifu and Li Xiaoshi, and draw useful  lessons from them.    Under the signboard of establishing civilian-run collective  enterprises and developing high science and technology, Shen  Taifu played the sinister trick of accumulating wealth by unfair  means by using high returns as a bait and taking advantage of  the weaknesses of some people who hoped to get quick returns  through investment and who were not familiar with financial  investment. He was the loudest advocate in raising funds to  develop energy-saving electrical machinery. For a time he  became a dignified noted figure devoted to pushing reform and  developing high science and technology. In fact, there was  neither operation nor development in this so-called machinery  and electric science and technology development enterprise, and  Shen Taifu himself had no specialized strong points in this  field. What he did was unscrupulously squandering the huge sum  of money he had swindled. The case of Shen Taifu should serve  to wake us up to this fact -- some economic criminals are very  good at pretending. Under an impressive signboard, they can  take advantage of loopholes in our work to market their  treachery by fishing in troubled waters. The principle of  opening up fund-raising channels to establish civilian-run  science and technology entities is correct, but enlivening the  economy must be done in an orderly manner, and breaking the law  is not permitted in opening to the outside world. If we pay no  attention to this point, we will be taken in by people with  ulterior motives like Shen Taifu. We must support those people  who are genuinely devoted to reform, but we must expose those  who seek private gain and even violate laws and discipline under  false pretenses. We must never let these people harm the  country and the people and smear the reputation of reform. The  masses should also improve ability to distinguish people,  enhance their awareness of the legal system, and learn necessary  economic knowledge in order to avoid being taken in.    Using money to clear obstacles and get things done was  Shen Taifu's habitual tactic. In this way senior cadre Li  Xiaoshi became captive of "sugarcoated bullets." Li Xiaoshi was  not unaware of Shen Taifu's sinister intentions, but he, out of  greed, used his power and influence to clear the obstacles in  support of Shen Taifu. What were hidden behind all of these were  nothing but a succession of deals between power and money.  However, the external cause can be activated only through the  internal cause. "Things must first rot before they are infested  with worms." The fact shows that Li Xiaoshi's embezzlement and  bribe-taking did not start at the Beijing Changcheng Corporation  case, and this was why he was instantaneously hit by Shen  Taifu's sugarcoated bullets. The fact that Li Xiaoshi  degenerated from a senior cadre to a criminal offender provides  us with a penetrating lesson, which shows that powers in the  hands of cadres, especially leading cadres, of some government  departments can often easily become the target sought after by  lawless elements. Each and every cadre must clearly understand  that power in our hands is given by the people and cannot be  sold out. Resisting the temptation of money and performing  duties with honesty and self-discipline is the basic requirement  of cadres. Should they lower guard and be swollen with selfish  desire, they will make blunders sooner or later.    It is also necessary to point out that in order to hoodwink  the public and fabricate lies, Shen Taifu extended and succeeded  partially in extending his sinister hand to some press units and  other government departments. Through publicizing this typical  case, we should educate journalists to strictly abide by  professional ethics, to stop "paid news," and to safeguard the  party's clean reputation in the journalistic undertaking.  RENMIN RIBAO, as the organ of the party Central Committee, is  determined to set a good example in stopping "paid news" and  strengthening the construction of clean government, and we  sincerely request the supervision by readers at large.    Shen Taifu has been executed and Li Xiaoshi punished, and  the  judicial organ will, after verifying facts, successively deliver  verdicts on some other people involved in the case. All of  these can serve as a warning to certain people: It will be a  miscalculation to exploit the opportunity of relaxation to  invigorate economy and to try by hook and by crook to  unscrupulously reap some profit. No matter how criminals  conceal themselves and resist obstinately, they cannot escape  the punishment by law in the end. We must resolutely implement  the party Central Committee's plans on the anticorruption drive.  Leading cadres at all levels must take the lead in complying  with various regulations for honesty and self-discipline to  ensure the achievement of more conspicuous results in the  anticorruption drive. In the course of reform, opening up, and  modernization construction, the fight against corruption is a  protracted task and the warning alarm of anticorruption and  advocation of honesty must sound continuously.</p>

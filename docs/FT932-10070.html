			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Arts: Bournemouth Symphony - Brighton Festival The musical part of Brighton's as ever well-stocked annual feast opened on Friday evening with the first of two concerts by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, on the verge of their centenary season. The occasion brought the professional debut in this country of the 12-year old violinist David Garrett, playing Mendelssohn's concerto with such poise and spontaneity that (apart from the light tone, inevitable from such a small frame and in any case of fine quality), one could judge it as an adult performance. What is more, and this meant as a compliment, one could safely concentrate on the music. The concerto is no longer over-played, and when one hears it done as here musically as well as with technical assurance brilliance, it is a delight. The main work was Mahler's Fifth Symphony. Now the BSO under their principal conductor Andrew Litton, discreet and attentive accompanists in the Mendelssohn, could let fly. This was a reading remarkable for combining 'speaking' intimacy with controlled aggressiveness. We were not spared the snarls, the grotesqueries, the Bacon-like shrieks that may be hysterical collapses or merely grimaces. Thanks to the admirably secure horn section, the moments in the Landler movement when mountain vistas open up were fully eloquent. The playing was so vital and immediate that for once I felt that the dreary Dome was not such a bad concert hall after all. The second BSO concert on Sunday brought a Festival commission in the form of a Symphonic Mass by George Lloyd, duly receiving its world premiere with the Brighton Festival Chorus. The composer, a sprightly elf with a mop of silver hair, one month short of his 80th birthday, conducted himself. 'Symphonic' he says, because the Mass is not intended for the liturgy but also, surely because the choral writing is straightforward, with much use of unison, the orchestral material is usually developed (Lloyd is a prolific writer of symphonies), sometimes beyond the necessary length. The purely orchestral Offertorium on the other hand is surprisingly short. Cries of anguish are heard, for example at the opening and again in the closing Agnus Dei. Cheerful banality, however, breaks insistently through with something resembling memories of wartime dance-band rhythms - short phrases and metrical patterns much repeated. The scoring is bright, noisy and professional, not unlike Eric Coates. There is a Russian-style chant which would be more effective if used more sparingly. Lloyd as conductor evidently enjoying himself hugely, appeared to make little effort to keep the orchestra down. Huddled on an inner stage hung with tone-devouring drapes, the choral sound was muffled and moreover riven by obstreperous percussion. The large audience loved it none the less. In the first half Lloyd lavished his enthusiasm on Elgar's orchestration of Bach's organ Fantasia and Fugue in C minor. It was a pleasure to hear such a vigorous reminder of the explosive effect this transcription had in the twenties at a time when in England the discovery of Bach by the wider public was still in progress and was being taken, by the organ world especially, with oppressive solemnity. In spite of masterly playing by John Lill, Rachmaninov's Paganini Rhapsody suffered from the open lid of the enormous concert grand deadening the woodwind. Since the interweaving of piano and orchestra was one of Rachmaninov's wizard skills, this was a pity.</p>

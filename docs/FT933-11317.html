			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Veba unit sets up Russia barter deal MEDIUM-SIZED German mining equipment manufacturers, fighting for their survival as Germany reduces its domestic coal production, have set up a consortium to sell mining equipment in Russia. The barter deal has been brokered by Raab Karcher, the diversified trading arm of Veba, the west German energy group. Raab Karcher, which had a 1992 turnover of DM10.5bn (Pounds 4bn), recently signed a contract to import 350,000 tonnes of hard coal from the Karagandaugol mine in Kazakhstan. Proceeds from the sale of coal - to be marketed mostly in Germany, England and France - will partially go toward repaying the German enterprises delivering mining equipment in Russia. The deal, which will be in part financed by subsidies from the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, aims to give a second life to small mining equipment producers by opening new markets in east Europe. Manufacturers of coal mining equipment and spare parts are struggling to cope with falling orders as German mines reduce hard coal capacity from the current 65.5m tonnes output to an estimated 50m tonnes by the year 2005. Germany hopes to replace its expensive local production with cheaper imports.</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRANDO'S DAUGHTER NOT EXPECTED TO TESTIFY  </P> <P> Prosecutors trying Marlon Brando's son for murder said Tuesday they probably  will fail in bringing the actor's daughter back to California in time to  testify against her half-brother.  </P> <P> At a hearing Tuesday in Santa Monica, a judge ordered jury selection to begin  Nov. 5 in Christian Brando's first-degree murder trial in the shooting death of  his half-sister's boyfriend.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office has sought for months to return Cheyenne Brando  from Tahiti. "We're not really overly optimistic it will happen," said Deputy  Dist. Atty. William Clark. "If we had a couple of years, we might be able to  pull it off."  </P> <P> She flew to Tahiti shortly after the May 16 death of her Tahitian boyfriend,  Dag Drollet, who was killed at her father's mountaintop estate. Cheyenne gave  birth in June to Drollet's child.  </P> <P> Christian Brando, 32, had admitted shooting Drollet, but contends the gun went  off accidentally while struggling for the weapon with Drollet.  </P></p>

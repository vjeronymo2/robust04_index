			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: Reflex back in the black with IPounds 0.3m REFLEX GROUP, the Dublin-based computer services and software combine, returned to profit in the first half following two years of pre-tax losses. The group, which has been switching from computer leasing to provision of applications software and persuaded Mr Tony Kilduff to come in as chairman last year, reported pre-tax profits of IPounds 316,000 (Pounds 293,000) in the six months to June 30. In the previous eight months to December 31 the group incurred a pre-tax loss of IPounds 4.53m, including IPounds 3.07m of provisions for discontinued operations, other exceptional costs and goodwill on discontinued operations previously written off to reserves. Turnover from continuing operations increased by 23 per cent to IPounds 4.28m from IPounds 3.45m in the previous period when discontinued operations added another IPounds 2.13m. The group incurred a IPounds 1.45m operating loss including IPounds 470,000 on discontinued operations. Mr Kilduff attributed the turnround to continued tight control of costs and the withdrawal from the loss-making hardware sales activity in the UK, coupled with a successful performance of the UK computer services businesses and lower interest costs resulting from reduced debt levels and interest rates. He said the introduction of the group's application software products in the UK required continued investment but was expected to contribute to profitability in the second half. Mr Aidan Farrell, chief executive, said that during the latest period 41 per cent of the group's gross margin was earned from the licensing and support of application software products, compared to 21 per cent last year. The remainder was generated by computing services activities. Overall the Irish market generated 49 per cent of gross margin with the UK accounting for the rest. At the end of June the group had net debt of IPounds 2.69m, down IPounds 700,000 since the end of the year. Its residual book of leases continued to be run off and the balance sheet at the end of June included IPounds 1.2m of assets related to discontinued leasing activities, down from IPounds 1.7m at the year end. Continuing cash flow from these leasing assets, together with cash from operations will contribute to a further 'significant' reduction in debt during the second half. Earnings per share were 2.01p in the first half, compared to a loss on continuing operations of 7.98p in the previous eight months and total losses of 26.85p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Athens, 25 Jun -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin  left Athens today for Russia. On 24 June, on the Greek island  of Corfu, he signed an agreement on partnership and cooperation  between the Russian Federation and the European Union [EU].  Yeltsin was seen off at Athens Airport by Greek National  Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis, Russian Federation  Ambassador to Athens Valeriy Nikolayenko, and other officials.  The farewell ceremony was simplified as top Greek leaders are  staying in Corfu, where the EU summit ended earlier today.    The Russian president travelled from Corfu to the port of  Piraievs in the yacht Alexandros, which had served as his  residence during the visit.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 20 (XINHUA) -- Taking practical  steps to enliven state-owned enterprises has been put as a major  task for the Shanghai government.    Some 40 enterprises, which are at present in the red, are  required to make a profit this year. Eleven of these have  already put forward detailed plans based on their particular  conditions.    The city government has helped enterprises to find the  causes  for their losses. Results show that the losses come from  inefficient operation and poor management, as well as left-over  debts and the heavy financial burdens imposed on them.    The city government formulated measures and policies to help  change the situation so that they can thrive and enhance their  competitive ability in the market.    Strong leadership and qualified staff were considered as the  key to making profits, and a contingent of outstanding business  operators have been selected or assigned to be managers of these  enterprises.    Enterprises with no hope of becoming profitable, whose low-  quality products can find no demand, will be forced to go  bankrupt, be merged with successful companies or have their  ownership transferred.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed LVE/MTH/PHF: "Willy Claes More Optimistic </F> on Fate of Arrested Kurdish Deputies"; as released by Brussels  BELGA Database]    [Text] Istanbul, 29 Mar (BELGA) -- Belgian Foreign Minister  Willy Claes came out of his meeting on Tuesday [29 March] with  Husametin Cindoruk, speaker of the Turkish Grand National  Assembly, reassured with regard to the fate of the six Kurdish  deputies who were arrested at the beginning of the month after  their immunity was lifted for collusion with the Workers Party  of Kurdistan (PKK).    Mr. Claes said at the end of his meeting with Cindoruk:  "This meeting showed me the light at the end of the tunnel. I  have every hope that major and relatively long-term progress  will be made, and I had the feeling, after listening to Mr.  Cindoruk's explanations, that there is less risk of very stiff  punishments being imposed."    The six deputies, members of the Democratic Party [DEP],  stand accused of "separatism" and of "endangering the integrity  of the state," charges laying them open to the death penalty.    The Belgian foreign minister refused to give further details  on the assurances he had received from Cindoruk "in the  interests of the six deputies themselves."    Even though he does not know with certainty whether the  Turk's undertakings were based on concrete facts or a on  personal analysis, Mr. Claes expressed the hope that "the fate  of the deputies will not be decided in the way we feared."    Mr. Claes had already raised the issue on Monday with his  Turkish counterpart, Mr. Hikmet Cetin, and the head of state,  Suleyman Demirel. He stressed at the time that sentencing the  deputies could only lead to negative reactions from the  international community and would adversely affect Turkey's  credibility.    The foreign minister is to return to Belgium on Wednesday  evening.</p>

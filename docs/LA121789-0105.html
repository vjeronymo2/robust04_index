			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REDONDO CITY SCHOOL BOARD VOWS TO KEEP DISPUTED TEXTS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: AT LEAST TWO SCHOOL TRUSTEES WANT TO ALLOW USE OF THE PREVIOUSLY  WITHDRAWN FIFTH-GRADE READERS FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.  </P> <P> Despite pressure from a coalition of parents who have joined a national  campaign against a set of grade-school readers, it is unlikely the books will  be removed from the curriculum in Redondo Beach, school trustees said last  week.  </P> <P> "This issue is really getting out of hand," said Rebecca Sargent, president of  the Redondo Beach City School District Board of Trustees. "If this board is  asked to ban textbooks -- well, that's just not going to happen in Redondo  Beach."  </P> <P> Sargent's reaction -- echoed by a majority of the five-member board -- came in  the wake of a packed Tuesday night board meeting, where members of the newly  formed Coalition of Concerned Parents demanded the "Impressions" reading series  be sent back to the publisher.  </P> <P> The demand, spearheaded by a group of parents from Hope Chapel, a local  conservative Christian church, was the latest salvo in a national war on the  textbooks that has been backed mostly by fundamentalist Christians and others.  They say the stories in the books are violent and immoral.  </P> <P> Because the issue was scheduled on the agenda as an "information only" item,  the board did not act on the request. However, TRW engineer John Ryan,  spokesman for the coalition, said the group intends to force the matter to a  vote and is circulating a petition demanding the series be eliminated from  Redondo Beach's classrooms.  </P> <P> In an interview after the meeting, Bart Swanson, vice president of the board,  noted that the books went through a thorough screening process before being  accepted as the basal reading text in the city's elementary schools. Part of  that process, he and others added, was a period of several weeks this past  spring when the books were made available to any parent for examination.  </P> <P> When parents in other school districts began to complain about the books  earlier this school year, the trustees tried to preempt controversy in Redondo  Beach by temporarily pulling the most highly criticized book -- a fifth-grade  reader -- and replacing it for the first semester of the school year with  another volume of the series by Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston of Canada Ltd., a  subsidiary of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.  </P> <P> Now, Swanson and Sargent said, they are inclined to allow teachers to use the  fifth-grade text during the second half of the year. The two said they have  studied the book, and, despite a much-publicized poem in it about  excreta-eating pigs, they found nothing in it to substantiate claims that its  text teaches satanism or is immoral.  </P> <P> "I don't care for this after-the-fact situation," Swanson said.  </P> <P> Added Trustee Howard Huizing, "These stories are just a few pages out of a big  work." To shelve the whole series, he said, "would be a hasty decision to make  about hundreds and hundreds of pages of literature."  </P> <P> Besides the poem on the excreta-eating pig, the fifth-grade reader contains  another, "He's Behind Yer," about a monster that bites off a child's head. A  chapter on sorcery is included in the fourth-grade book.  </P> <P> The "Impressions" series has stirred a dispute in several California school  districts, including the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District in the San  Gabriel Valley, where it was dropped, and the East Whittier School District,  where trustees were dismayed when the publisher sent the U.S. version of the  series instead of the toned-down Canadian version.  </P> <P> Lawndale, too, had ordered the Canadian texts but received the U.S. versions  for their fourth-, fifth- and sixth-grade readers. Trustees decided the fourth-  and sixth-grade readers were acceptable, but fifth-graders there are using  another text, pending state approval and receipt of the book's Canadian  version.  </P> <P> It is the U.S. version that is being used in Redondo Beach schools.  </P> <P> Ryan, who launched the local effort against the books only a few weeks ago,  after hearing about the series' problems in other districts, said he was not  surprised at the reaction of Redondo Beach trustees.  </P> <P> "They're right," he said. "We should have looked over the books before they  were approved. But parents sometimes just trust the school to do the right  thing."  </P> <P> Ryan added, however, that he isn't discouraged by the trustees' remarks. By the  time his coalition gets the issue onto the board agenda for a vote, public  sentiment against the books may have gathered so much steam that the trustees  may be forced to change their minds.  </P> <P> "Any parent who reads this material would not want their child to see it," he  said. "It's time to see now how many of them are willing to stand up."  </P></p>

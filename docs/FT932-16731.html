			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Arts: Son of 'Heimat' - Screen / Victor Price on director Edgar Reitz and his second epic SO THE admirable Maria has died at last, and all Schabbach has turned out to see her off. Eccentric Glasisch has chosen this moment to slip away himself. By five past one this morning Edgar Reitz's 15-hour epic had drawn to a close on BBC 2. But Heimat is dead, long live Heimat. Because for the past eight years Reitz has been working on a sequel, which the same channel will be showing in weekly episodes, starting on April 17. Fifteen other countries will be running the film as well. The Second Heimat, which was premiered at the Venice Biennale and also shown at last autumn's London Film Festival, takes us back in time to 1960, when Maria's favourite son Hermann leaves the village to study music at the Munich Conservatory. We already know from Heimat 1 that he becomes a well-known composer. Heimat 2 shows us precisely how that comes about. But, like the first epic, it is more than the story of just one man. It is the portrait of a whole society, the artistic and bohemian world of the Bavarian capital in the 1960s, and its 13 episodes have a total running time of over 25 hours, the longest film ever made. Each of the episodes tells the story of one of the young artists, students and rebels whose lives intersect with Hermann's during the decade in question. Reitz calls them the fatherless generation because their fathers were either killed in the war or compromised by the Nazi past. They comprise avant-garde composers, young film-makers, a lonely and slightly ridiculous philosopher, a poetess turned Baader-Meinhoff terrorist, a refugee from the GDR and many others. They experience the building of the Berlin Wall and the assassination of President Kennedy. They experiment with art, drugs and sex. They live in communes. They get involved in demos. They do not quite know what they want or where they are going. Some succeed, some fail. The thread which holds them loosely together is the career of Hermann, Reitz's alter ego. And Hermann's destiny is in its turn determined by his love for the fiercely independent Clarissa, who is wedded to her cello. Both make unsuccessful marriages before coming together briefly in the final enigmatic episode, before Hermann withdraws to his native Schubbach, to wait. On April 12, BBC2's Arena will be curtain-raising Heimat 2 with a documentary Edgar Reitz: Return to Heimat, which tells how the second epic was made. Reitz emerges as a man of endless charm and patience who is nevertheless uncompromisingly dedicated to his work. To make such a sequence of films one needs phenomenal stamina: to finance them, one needs both a genius for negotiation and complete faith in what one is doing. The Second Heimat is, like its predecessor, freely-handled autobiography. Reitz uses episodes from his own experience not as an ego-trip but to build up a valid story. As he creates, the present flows into the past; the telling of Hermann's love for Clarissa, for instance, has certainly been influenced by Reitz's own developing relationship with Salome Kammer, the actress who plays her. The films have been made in chronological sequence, which has allowed the actors to develop the characters over a span of time. And four years of intense work together has given the team - and the films they have made - a rare sense of unity. Technically Heimat 2 carries on where the first Heimat left off. It is discreetly original. For example, colour and black-and-white alternate here too; colour is generally used for night sequences and black-and-white for day, but not rigidly; it is more a question of the emotional feel of the scene. Pre-Heimat Reitz was an experimenter, and he can still invent brilliant shots, as when the camera races over a dozen canteen table-tops to home in on the young composers gleefully improvising a work for percussion with cutlery, glasses and the top of a radiator. But such things are used sparingly; true film, says Reitz, is not about the visible, but the invisible. Reitz is a literate, not to say literary film-maker; Heimat 2 puts one in mind of certain German novels about artists' life in Munich, like Keller's Green Henry or Hesse's Peter Camenzind. He is a conscious artist, not afraid to say that his object is to rescue something from death. As this sequence of films unfolds, in its leisurely, funny, sad and ironic way, it will become clear that he has achieved just that.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Credit card war THE UK credit card market is hotting up. Vauxhall's launch yesterday of credit cards offering discounts on the purchase of its cars and comparatively low interest rates is the biggest threat so far to a business traditionally dominated by clearing banks. Vauxhall clearly means to make an impact. A similar card launched in the US by General Motors, its parent, has attracted 8m customers in just over a year. Moreover, Vauxhall is not on its own. Financial services group Save &amp; Prosper recently introduced a card with an interest rate of 14.6 per cent, much less than the 23 per cent average. MBNA, a US bank, is planning to base its European credit card operations in the UK. Other non-financial companies  -with Ford, General Electric and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph touted as likely candidates - are expected to follow Vauxhall's lead. This process promises advantages for both new entrants and consumers. For a company like Vauxhall, a credit card could be a powerful tool to build brand loyalty. Users will have an incentive to buy Vauxhall cars rather than those made by rivals. For customers, stiffer competition should bring lower interest rates as well as a wider variety of services. While credit card users have not been badly served by the clearing banks, there have been complaints. Chief among these are the introduction of annual credit card fees in the past few years and a switch to charging interest from the date of the transaction instead of the date of the statement. To this is added the constant gripe that interest rates are much higher than base rates. Consumers themselves are partly to blame for not shopping around more vigorously. Research shows that most do not know what interest charge they pay. But banks and building societies are also to blame in that they have generally failed to differentiate their services, so offering consumers little opportunity to exercise choice. This in turn largely reflects lack of initiative. There is, however, one anti-competitive practice which could usefully be swept away: Visa and Mastercard, the dominant credit card networks, generally do not admit non-banks to their club. Vauxhall has avoided this restriction by using the services of HFC Bank. But this is cumbersome. If the market is to develop to its full potential, credit card clubs should be pressed to open their doors.</p>

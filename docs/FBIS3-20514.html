Laying stress on the key points, doing a sound and solid  job.    Closely linking the buildup of the grassroots party  orgnization in the farming and lifestock breeding areas with the  overall development of the rural economy.    Substantially strengthening leadership in the buildup of  grassroots party organization in the farming and livestock  breeding areas.    On 9-11 January, the autonomous region held report-back  meetings in Kashi and Kuitun on the buildup of the grassroots  party organization in the farming and stockbreeding areas of the  northern and southern sectors of Xinjiang. At the meetings,  experiences were reviewed and exchanged with regard to the  buildup of grassroots party organization, which had actually  been carried out during the past two months in the various  farming and livestock breeding areas. The meetings also analyzed  existing problems and made plans and dispositions as to the next  phase of work.    Zhang Fusen, deputy secretary of the Autonomous Regional CPC  Committee, and Zhou Guofu, member of the Standing Committee of  the Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and director of the  Organization Department, presided over the northern Xinjiang  meeting and the southern Xinjiang meeting, respectively.    Judging by the situation reported by the leadership of the  various autonomous prefecture cities and key counties (cities),  initial successes have been achieved in the work of building up  the grassroots party organization, which had indeed been carried  out since the early part of November of last year in the various  farming and stockbreeding areas. In 15 key counties (cities),  184 key townships (towns), and in 1,453 less developed villages  throughout Xinjiang, a comprehensive overhaul of party branches  had been instituted. From various places, 7,580 cadres had been  selected and despatched for work in the key counties, townships,  and less developed villages, and 976 young and promising cadres  from government agencies were despatched to these less developed  villages to assume duties or register for work. By laying stress  on the key points and adopting forceful measures, a healthy  development was achieved in the buildup of the grassroots party  organizations in the farming and stockbreeding areas.    Leading cadres from various autonomous prefecture cities and  key counties (cities) who attended the meetings analyzed  existing problems and then expressed the opinion that, although  the buildup of the grassroots party organization in the farming  and lifestock breeding areas had been effective, the  development, comprehensively speaking, has been very uneven.  Leading cadres in some places showed insufficient understanding  of the importance, necessity, and urgency of the buildup which  has to take place at the grassroots in the farming and lifestock  breeding areas; they had been slow in taking action and not  forceful in their performance. In some places they had not  accurately taken charge of the key points in their work; they  had failed to study sufficiently thoroughly the difficulties in  building up the grassroots party organization in the farming and  stockbreeding areas and had adopted rather ineffective measures.    In their concluding speeches at the report-back meetings in  the northern and southern sectors of Xinjiang, Comrades Zhang  Fusen and Zhou Guofu presented four demands relative to a more  effective future buildup of the grassroots party organization in  the farming and stockbreeding areas:    One. Further deepening of understanding, unremitting and  energetic development of the grassroots party organization in  the farming and stockbreeding areas. The grassroots party  organization is the foundation of the entire fighting power of  the party. This is a point that all leading cadres in party and  government must understand very clearly; there must be not the  slightest ambiguity in this regard. Party committees at all  levels must grasp this matter of strengthening the buildup of  the grassroots organization in the farming and lifestock  breeding areas as an important and urgent task within the  party's overall work in the rural areas.    Two. Guiding ideology must be clear and definite, work  performance must be sound and solid. Guiding ideology must  stress the basic things, lay the foundation, strive for  stability, and spur on development. When engaged in  strengthening the buildup of the party's grassroots organization  in the farming and stockbreeding areas, it is necessary to  primarily concentrate on the key points, focus all energy and  strength on the effective education of party members and on the  effective rectification of party branch committees in the key  counties (cities), townships (towns), and less developed  villages. It is not only necessary to make a good selection of  the person of party branch secretary, but the entire set of the  party branch committee must be well and effectively constituted,  and there also has to be some down-to-earth work performed for  them.    Three. It is necessary to closely link the buildup of the  grassroots party organization in the farming and stockbreeding  areas with the overall development of the rural economy.  Economic development is the central task of the party, as it is  also the fundamental starting point and the point where the  party will make its stand in its efforts to strengthen the  grassroots organization in the farming and stockbreeding areas.  Leading cadres of all ranks must firmly espouse the guiding  ideology of "pay attention to party construction as a matter  bound up with the economy, pay attention to party construction  as a means to spur on the economy." The extent to which  townships and villages will achieve a moderate degree of  prosperity at an early date must be major criterion for whether  the buildup of the grassroots organization has been effectively  accomplished.    Four. Party committees of all ranks must effectively  strengthen their leadership in the work of building up the  grassroots organization in the farming and stockbreeding areas.  Main leadership problems require personal attention of the  leading cadre, assigned leadership problems must be attended to  with all the assignee's strength, other leadership problems must  be made coordinated efforts. In this matter of strengthening the  buildup of the grassroots party organization in the farming and  lifestock breeding areas, it shall also be incumbent to  institute the leadership responsibility system.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Provisions restrain CS Holding NET INCOME at CS Holding, the financial services group which includes Credit Suisse among its operations, rose by just 5 per cent to SFr1.03bn (Dollars 726m) last year. This follows heavy provisions on Swiss lending and a fall in net income at CS First Boston, the group's 63 per cent owned investment bank. However, Mr Rainer Gut, chairman, said the first quarter of this year had been 'very, very good' in Switzerland, with cash-flow up by 20 per cent compared with the same period last year. Provisions of SFr1.52m at Credit Suisse, announced last month, accounted for the bulk of the group's SFr1.77bn of provisions and write-downs. Provisions would reach almost the same level this year, said Mr Josef Ackermann, president of the executive board. Volksbank said its first-quarter result clearly surpassed that of the same period in 1992 and exceeded targets. Its assets fell to SFr44.95bn at the end of March from SFr46.01bn at the end of December, reflecting the transfer of its international branches' assets to Credit Suisse. CS First Boston reported net income of Dollars 176m, down from Dollars 216m the previous year, as its tax charge jumped by Dollars 51m to Dollars 101m. The 1991 figures had benefited from tax losses carried forward from previous years, said Mr John Hennessy, chief executive of the investment bank. Revenues at CS First Boston rose by Dollars 214m to Dollars 1.82bn, as investment banking contributed Dollars 868m, up from Dollars 703m in 1991. Mr Gut said the group had decided to drop a plan, announced two years ago, to sell up to 20 per cent of Credit Suisse to raise additional capital. Instead, it is launching an American depositary receipt programme this week in the US to encourage investors there 'to participate in future capital increases'.</p>

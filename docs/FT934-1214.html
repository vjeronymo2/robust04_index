			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / S African right seeks eleventh hour deal South Africa's right-wing Freedom Alliance was in eleventh-hour talks last night with the government and the African National Congress aimed at securing the alliance's agreement to the post-apartheid constitution before parliament votes it into law tomorrow. Attempts were being made to agree constitutional changes accommodating the demands of the right wing, which includes the Inkatha Freedom party and white groups, for greater fiscal and legislative powers for regional governments, including amendments which would leave room for an Afrikaner homeland. The ANC and the Afrikaner Volksfront announced yesterday they would today sign an agreement in principle endorsing the idea of such a homeland. However, this represents only a tentative first step towards a 'volkstaat', which is likely to have only limited autonomy. Nevertheless, the agreement appears to have prompted divisions among right-wing Afrikaners: between moderates, represented by General Constand Viljoen and his Afrikaner Volksfront, and Conservative party radicals, led by Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg. It is believed that Mr Hartzenberg will not sign the accord, although some more moderate Conservative party MPs will attend the ceremony in support of it. The agreement will be signed by Gen Viljoen and Mr Jacob Zuma for the ANC. The absence of Mr Hartzenberg from the ceremony highlights a potential split between the right, and the risk that the ANC might be unable to persuade the radicals - including the paramilitary Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement) - to accept a constitutional settlement and participate in next year's all-race elections. The ANC has been treading a difficult path, trying to draw in the far right without conceding too much autonomy to any future Afrikaner homeland and alienating its own supporters. The Freedom Alliance, government and ANC, meeting together for the first time, have until 8am today to secure agreement before a final draft of the constitution is printed for a parliamentary vote.</p>

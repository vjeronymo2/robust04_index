			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / PM backs Lamont as Pounds hits new lows MR JOHN MAJOR staged an ostentatious display of support for Mr Norman Lamont yesterday in an attempt to shore up the chancellor's authority in the run up to the March 16 Budget. But his defence of the chancellor failed to rally the pound, which slipped to new lows on the foreign exchange markets. Downing Street refused to be drawn on the speculation at Westminster that Mr Lamont will be moved from the Treasury in a summer cabinet reshuffle. Senior officials cited a long-standing policy of refusing to comment on how long any individual would remain in a particular post. That left most Tory MPs believing that Mr Lamont probably would be given another department in June or July. The prime minister, however, may seek to buttress further the chancellor's position in a keynote policy speech to senior Tories tonight. In a carefully planned performance which saw Mr Major and Mr Lamont side-by-side in the House of Commons, the prime minister flatly rejected Labour charges that speculation about Mr Lamont's future had fatally undermined his credibility. During angry exchanges with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, he said that neither he nor Mr Lamont would be 'pushed around' by unfounded reports that they were at odds. 'It may be that many people would like to find divisions between him and I - but there are none.' Listing Mr Lamont's achievements at the Treasury, Mr Major said he had cut inflation to 2.5 per cent, introduced tax reforms, offered help to industry and reduced interest rates. 'That's a record that he can be proud of and that I fully support.' Mr Smith said the confusion of recent days had demonstrated that 'we have a chancellor with no credibility and a government with no economic policy'. Mr Major's support for the chancellor had little effect on foreign exchange markets. In late London trading, the pound slipped to Dollars 1.44 against the dollar, a new low for this year, before closing nearly a cent down on the day at Dollars 1.446. It eased further in late New York trading to Dollars 1.4443. Against the D-Mark, the pound slipped  1/2 a pfennig in London, closing at DM2.375, and it eased to DM2.3714 in New York. The sterling index, which is monitored by the chancellor as an overall guide to the currency's strength, closed at an historic low of 77.1, down 0.3 percentage points on the day.

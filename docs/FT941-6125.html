			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Public-sector pay up 10% before general election The public-sector pay bill rose more than 10 per cent in the year 1992-93, according to a newly-published statistical supplement to November's Budget. The supplement shows that public-sector pay rose from Pounds 68.8bn in 1991-92 to Pounds 76.2bn in 1992-93, meaning an average pay rise after inflation of 7 per cent. The level of the increase during a recession may help explain the current squeeze on public pay. In 1992 the findings of the pay review bodies were all accepted in full  - with the general election looming. These included a 7.5 per cent increase for teachers. One of the effects of the large rise was a slight fall in current expenditure in 1992-93. The swing from such a large increase to a rise of only 1.5 per cent in 1993-94, and now the planned pay freeze until 1997, will today be highlighted by Mr Chris Trinder, an analyst at the Public Finance Foundation, at a Trades Union Congress conference on public-sector pay. Today's conference, to be addressed by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, will also be shown a TUC analysis of the effects of the impending tax changes on public-sector workers. The TUC says an ambulance worker will be Pounds 17.13 a week worse off, a local government worker Pounds 9.63 a week worse off, while a train driver will lose an extra Pounds 10.08 a week, assuming no pay rise this year. The statistical supplement reveals that the government plans a cut in real terms of total civil service spending between 1993-94 and 1996-97. However, employment is planned to fall only 25,000 to 523,000 over the same period. White- and blue-collar workers in local government said yesterday that they would put in a joint pay claim for the first time. Mr Jack Dromey, public services national secretary for the TGWU general union, said that all forms of discrimination against manual workers should end. He added that local government workers would be seeking a rise of at least 2.9 per cent, the level received by most workers covered by the pay review bodies. Local government employers welcomed moves towards phasing out the distinction between white- and blue-collar workers, but said there was little room for manoeuvre on pay.</p>

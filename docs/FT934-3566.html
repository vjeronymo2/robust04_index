			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Swalec ahead but dividend disappoints City South Wales Electricity yesterday unveiled an 18 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 44.4m from a re-stated Pounds 37.6m and said it was increasing the dividend from 6.6p to 7.5p. The 13.6 per cent dividend rise was less than both Eastern Electricity and Midlands, the only other regional electricity companies to report so far this season, and Swalec was the only rec to see its shares fall on the day. Earnings per share for the half year to September 30 advanced by 19 per cent to 31p (26p). Swalec increased turnover from continuing businesses from Pounds 259.8m to Pounds 274.7m. Cost of sales rose to Pounds 172m (Pounds 163m) and operating costs amounted to Pounds 64.1m (Pounds 62.4m). Operating profits in the distribution side grew by 10 per cent to Pounds 32.9m. Electricity distributed was up overall by 1.7 per cent, with domestic usage up 2 per cent and commercial by 0.9 per cent. Industrial customers took 1.5 per cent more with large industrial customers leading the way. Supply profits at Pounds 2.1m were unchanged after last year's figures were restated to reflect seasonal volume patterns. Celtic, the company's contracting arm, contributed Pounds 200,000 to profits against last year's first half losses of Pounds 700,000. Staffing fell by 2 per cent in the half year to 2,534. Mr David Jones, departing chief executive, said that further small reductions would be likely for the rest of the year. COMMENT The City likes cautious utilities, but not, judging by the reaction to its results, when they are as cautious as Swalec. The rec was giving little away yesterday, either in information about the company, or by comparison with other recs, in the dividend. Its shares, down 2p to 699p, are on a yield of about 4.5 per cent if the company pays out 25.4p for the full year. The prospective yield is among the highest of the recs and reflects the concerns about the company's recent expansion in contracting. Swalec may rise in the ratings list when Mr Andrew Walker, formerly of TI and Dowty, gets his feet under the table, and when and if it can demonstrate the telecommunications diversification is a winner. But there is nothing immediately to suggest a re-rating.</p>

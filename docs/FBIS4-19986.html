			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/320: "China/European Union </F> Cooperation: Meeting Between Mrs. Christiane Scrivener and Mr.  Gu Yongjiang, Chinese Deputy Minister for Trade and Economic  Cooperation"]    [Text] Mrs. Scrivener [commissioner for taxation and  customs affairs] and Mr. Gu Yongjiang held talks [venue not  specified] on 20 April on the occasion of an official visit by a  Chinese delegation. China's reintegration into GATT was one of  the items on the agenda.    Mrs. Scrivener recalled that the European Union (EU) has  always supported this request. "It falls within the scope of a  deeper integration of China into world trade," she added. It  logically follows the objectives that were defined in Marrakesh  during the formal conclusion of the Uruguay Round.    Mrs. Scrivener added that China was expected to clearly  commit itself to meet specific conditions, to adopt a pragmatic  approach, and to implement provisional stages.    The European commissioner stressed "it is necesssary that  trading partners like China and the European Union clearly show  their determination to guarantee fair trade, an essential  condition to give each country a chance to ensure its economic  development."    Mrs. Scrivener welcomed the initial results of the technical  assistance developed with China in customs matters, and she  proposed that a joint activity program be set up in customs and  taxation matters. "Working together to fight evils like  counterfeiting and fraud will make the economic agents more  confident."    The Chinese deputy minister has agreed in principle to this  approach. Mrs. Scrivener, who is satisfied with the economic  reforms initiated by China on the path to a market economy and  with the reforms carried out in taxation matters (a tax on  corporate profits as well as a VAT [value-added tax] system have  been introduced), welcomed the Chinese authorities' commitment  to deal with European companies on an equal basis, as confirmed  by Gu Yongjiang.    "Customs cooperation between the European Union and China  must be enhanced," Mrs. Scrivener said. "This will help  guarantee more competitive trade relations between China and the  European Union."    At the end of the talks, Mrs. Scrivener accepted the  invitation extended by Deputy Minister Gu to visit China in the  coming months.</p>

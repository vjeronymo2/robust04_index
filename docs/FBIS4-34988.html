			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar has flatly  denied discussing matters related to the tranfer of U.S. Air  Force troops to Palmerola with U.S. Secretary of Defense William  J. Perry. Paz Aguilar made that remark after the top Clinton  Administration official boarded the airplane that flew him to  Puerto Rico.    "We discussed matters of common interest only," the foreign  minister said after listing the points that, according to him,  were discussed during the approximately 20-minute meeting. "We  broached the future of the U.S. military presence in the  country, strengthening civil-military action programs,  establishing a regional center to combat drug trafficking, and  the situation Haitians are experiencing."    Perry categorically noted that only U.S. Air Force units  stationed in the Southern Command could be moved to Honduran  territory. He noted that the U.S. military presence in Panama  concludes on 31 December 1999 and that Palmerola will remain a  center where U.S. troops have access facilities.    "At no time was there any mention of turning Honduras into a  platform for regional operations. The U.S. policy worldwide is  to close bases and reduce the number of soldiers, and I do not  think they are interested in increasing their military presence  here," Paz Aguilar indicated.    He added that there are troops in Panama to guarantee the  permanent and definite neutrality of the Panama Canal and that  there are barely 1,000 U.S. soldiers in Honduras, who are  operating within the framework of reciprocal assistance.    "I reiterate that that topic was not discussed, but it is  clear and definite that Honduras has to refine its relations  with the United States based on dignity and respect for national  sovereignty," Paz Aguilar noted. The official said that the  bilateral military assistance treaty is the product of an era  that ended with the Cold War. He added that the 1990's face  totally different challenges, such as drug trafficking. "We  would like Palmerola to serve as a regional base to fight drug  trafficking," he stated, as he explained that U.S. specialized  agencies are waging the war on drug trafficking.    When asked to comment on Perry's visit, Presidential  Designate Walter Lopez Reyes said it was a courtesy visit and  that they discussed general topics of mutual interest.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Suleyman Demirel by Tamar </F> Chikovani in Ankara; date not given: "We Are Not Friends But  Brothers"--first paragrais DRONI introduction]    [Text] "We are not friends but brothers." This is what  Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said at a meeting with  Georgian journalists in Ankara. Five times prime minister and  now president, Demirel has a great standing both in Turkey and  among foreign political circles. In spite of his busy schedule,  he nevertheless found time to speak to us as he believes that  Turkish-Georgian relations have a great future.    [Chikovani] Mr. President, what are the prospects for  Turkish-Georgian relations? What could we have achieved in the  past and what can be achieved today?    [Demirel] First of all, I would like to repeat that the main  principle underlying our foreign policy is the establishment of  friendly and business-like relations with all our neighboring  states on the basis of international norms. In this respect, we  attach great importance to the development of all manner of  relations with Georgia. So, I would like to emphasize that  Turkey recognizes Georgian sovereignty and territorial  integrity. We hope that we will see the development of economic  and human resources in conditions of peace and democracy.    The Abkhazian conflict gives us cause for great alarm. We  believe the problem will be resolved within the framework of the  UN Charter and the Helsinki Final Act so that peace can be  established in your homeland that has been ravaged by war. At  the same time, the peaceful settlement of the Abkhazian conflict  in ethnically diverse Georgia will be a good example for the  other Caucasian countries.    I am glad that Georgia has taken important steps toward  democracy and the process of integration with the world. I will  remind you that Turkey, within the limits of its own  possibilities, has rendered all manner of assistance to Georgia  during what has been a difficult period for it. I will give you  some precise figures. We have dispatched humanitarian aid to  the value of $47,455,275, including wheat valued at $13,432,000.  We have given credits worth $50,000,000 to the Exim Bank. We  have unhesitatingly supplied our neighbor with electric power  when considerable problems were created in this sphere in  Georgia. This was precisely an expression of our good will  toward Georgia during a difficult time.    We are continuing to support Georgia. I believe that an  economically developed democratic Georgia will be a factor of  stability in the Caucasian region.    Thus, we attach great importance to the development of  economic relations with Georgia. The geographical proximity of  our two countries will enable us to become natural trading  partners. During President [as published] Shevardnadze's visit  to Turkey, we signed many treaties in the political, economic,  cultural, and technical spheres, which creates a legal basis for  our relations. Several projects are already being elaborated in  the fields of telecommunications, transport, trade, and tourism.  The construction of a new border crossing will enhance our  commercial relations still further.    It is a pleasure for me to have a close friendship with  President Shevardnadze, who is a strong and an experienced  statesman. I am convinced that, under his wise leadership, the  Georgian population will realize all its wishes and aims.    [Chikovani] How do you assess the Turkish factor regarding  the establishment of stability in the Caucasus?    [Demirel] In my view, there exist two fundamental  preconditions for achieving peace and stability. First:  Respect for internationally recognized norms, which are  expressed in the UN Charter and the Helsinki Final Act. Second:  The formation of a base for economic and social prosperity,  which is possible through close commercial cooperation between  the region's countries. I do not think that the second  precondition will be disputed given that the world today is  striving toward economic integration.    Turkey has recognized the independence of Georgia,  Azerbaijan, and Armenia and expressed the desire to establish  close relations with all three countries without any form of  discrimination. This governing and rational principle clearly  demonstrates the importance we attach to stability in the  Caucasian region.    Turkey has always supported and defended the principles of  territorial integrity and the protection of international  borders by the use of force. Respect for these principles is  the chief criterion for achieving stability in the Caucasus that  is the homeland of diverse ethnic groups that have lived  alongside one another for centuries. In many cases, we have  seen that it is precisely the policy of the historical  distribution of territories that has been the initial cause of  instability. I deeply believe that territorial disputes should  be settled only through negotiations and by taking into account  human rights.    At the same time, we believe that, in the matter of  establishing peace and stability in the region, the greatest  importance is given to economic cooperation between countries in  the region. We should establish close relations in all spheres  on the basis of mutual interests and faith. I take this  opportunity to express once more my belief that, by taking into  account cooperation with the Russian Federation, the region's  countries will be able to establish close relations. This  belief was the main factor behind the economic cooperation  initiative involving Black Sea countries. It is hoped that our  relations will turn the Black Sea into a sea of friendship and  growth.    [Chikovani] The problem of aggressive separatism is also  familiar to Turkey. Do you think it is possible to resolve this  problem in a peaceful way?    [Demirel] Turkey is indeed familiar with separatist  actions that have been carried out by the PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] terrorist organization since 1984. In accordance  with a decision by the Turkish Government, this problem will be  resolved in a lawful way. Whilst our security forces are  fighting the terrorists, the government is conducting reforms to  regulate the economic difficulties in southeastern Turkey. We  are investing huge sums of money into this region. The  southeastern Anatolian project, which is gradually being  launched and which will be implemented on a large scale in a few  years time, will radically bolster economic activities and  create jobs. I am convinced that the great importance of the  economy will split the terrorist group and the "silent majority"  of citizens who are not raising their voice against the  terrorists today.    [Chikovani] The world community is trying not to get  actively  involved in conflicts and often satisfies itself with just  adopting resolutions or statements. In your view, what is the  reason for this and to what extent is it justified?    [Demirel] Following the defeat of communist ideology, the  process of the strengthening of pluralism, the supremacy of law,  and respect for human rights got under way in the former Soviet  republics. On the other hand, the world has certain doubts as  they are threatened by radical nationalism and ethnic conflicts.  As a European country that borders on the continent's hottest  spots, Turkey has taken upon itself to contribute to the process  of establishing peace and stability in the whole region. Today,  Turkey is trying to accelerate the transformation of instability  into a factor of cooperation and solidarity. Naturally, in  order to achieve this aim, one of our priorities are relations  with international organizations. We believe that such  international organizations as the UN and the CSCE are searching  for the right position in order to satisfy the demands of the  current transitional period. Of course, the chances of such  organizations being able to resolve these problems depend upon  the willingness of their members to assume responsibility.    [Chikovani] A number of terrorist acts were committed during  the preelection campaign in Turkey. To what extent is terrorism  a characteristic feature of daily life in Turkey?    [Demirel] Terrorists are enemies of the state. The PKK  insists that it is protecting the interests of the people yet,  at the same time, it is slaughtering Turkish citizens, many of  whom are Kurds. The PKK continued its bloody actions during the  preelection campaign. As a democratic country, Turkey will not  allow anyone to commit terrorist acts. By a decision of the  government, our security forces are implementing the most severe  measures against terrorism.    Terrorism is not a characteristic feature of Turkey today.  It is confined to specific geographical regions -- southeastern  Turkey -- and, as I have told you, we hope that we will wipe out  the terrorists very shortly.    [Chikovani] When mentioning Turkey one thinks of the East.  However, Turkey has chosen the Western path of development. Has  this not led to a change of identity on the part of the people  and to what extent has Turkey preserved its centuries-old  traditions?    [Demirel] Proceeding from its geographical position, I would  call Turkey the Eurasian focal point [posti] of the NATO  countries. Therefore, we are both in Europe and Asia. Turkey's  vast historical experience and cultural inheritance have  contributed greatly to its occupying such a unique position.  Turkey is an indivisible part of Europe as far as political,  economic, and security issues are concerned. Furthermore, the  fusion of Eastern and European values has taken place naturally  in Turkey, which is further enriching Turkish life.</p>

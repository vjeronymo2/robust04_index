			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Accountancy Column: Mass of fine print may obscure judgments  -Roger Davis argues that professional experience and instinct should count for more than rigid adherence to the rule book with the unprecedented volume of pronouncements - has been the cry of 'too much'. But I have another concern: over-engineer the rules and you will endanger accountancy as a real profession. There are still too many options for accounting for the same thing, when no one way can rationally be said to be right or best. The Accounting Standards Board needs support and encouragement in resolving the remaining issues. It is time, also, to extract ourselves from a stick-in-the-mud attitude to the need to redefine and revitalise the audit. But you need a well sharpened pencil to draw the line between narrowing choices and compromising professional judgments. I readily acknowledge that practising accountants should now reassert the authority of those judgments and thus render an almighty rule book unnecessary. For that is what professionalism means: forming judgments from professional experience and then sticking to what your guts tell you, however tough the going. Most accounting is commonsense. An experienced auditor conducting a rapid financial investigation of a company will instinctively judge its financial state without pondering over the fine print of the rule book. That is what a good audit represents, or should do. But I am currently seeing its reverse. The threat of sanctions (not least through litigation for absurd sums) engenders an attitude which says 'stick to what the rules say - it's safer'. Auditing should remain an art. It is overlooked that the term derives from the latin auditore - to listen; that is, to listen to explanations and to judge on whether they stand up. The growing complexity of the different parts which make up a business, and of the environment in which it functions, requires more judgment, not less, by the auditor. The problem is that the more rules you have, the more the avoidance industry will find the loopholes; and the inevitable consequence being yet more rules. It is so obvious that I stress it only because it is what I see happening in practice. Write a 50-page standard on the meaning of each of the 10 commandments and those inclined to adultery will find something to excuse their indulgence. Applying that analogy to accounting, you find the need for yet more explanatory notes to the accounts as an excuse for not getting the figures right in the first place. It adds yet further to the complexity of company accounts. There is a danger of reaching a level of auditing and accounting precision with which business will not be able to cope. Companies will adopt one accounting policy for their external reporting and another for internal management purposes. There can be no sense in that. I fear for a profession more concerned with whether the figures get into the right boxes, rather than with a sensible overall picture of business performance, encapsulated in this recent exchange with one of our brightest managers: 'If you were running this company would you think you had done well or badly?' answered by 'It depends on how you interpret the standard'. So we have a stark choice. Auditors will go on shielding behind an ever-growing rule book. Or they will stand up to be counted on accounting that flies in the face of commonsense; I believe auditors did lose some of that culture in the 1980s, because of competitive pressures to retain business in an environment which was already encouraging a legalistic approach to accounting. Thankfully, my evidence is that the climate has changed; company boards are increasingly asking auditors robustly to challenge their thinking on financial reporting and stewardship. The practising accountant should capitalise on the mood. For I fear the consequences if the trend continues and a rule book mentality really does get a grip on auditing and accountancy. At best you will narrow the outlook of the people in the profession and they will increasingly lose sight of the underlying commercial drivers of the business being audited. At worst you will no longer be able to attract or retain those with the able and agile minds auditing needs if it is to serve the public interest. It will also be deleterious to the outstanding business training which the profession has traditionally given to its graduates and from which industry has benefited. That is equally true of more rules on what the auditor can and cannot do, such as so-called audit quarantining to build fences between auditors and management: a red herring if ever there was one, and something that betrays an outdated understanding of the profession. Because the professional accountant's traditional business advice has required more specialism, many accountancy firms have become multi-disciplinary partnerships. Rather than threatening audit independence, all their services represent a professional challenge, founded on the audit discipline. Increasingly audit itself needs industry and functional specialists from non-accounting disciplines. The final audit report to shareholders should be based on regular assurance to management from a unique professional perspective, and by working on the correct assumption that most British management is trying to do its best for stakeholders. When the chairman of one of our largest clients said to me recently, 'As the company's auditor, do you think the board should involve itself in this transaction whose ethics could be questioned?' should I have said 'I am not allowed to advise you but I will tell you after the event'? The good auditor has a knack of sensing those who are only on the make for themselves. No amount of rules will help: not highly prescriptive accounting standards; not lengthy auditing standards; not lengthier company accounts; and not longer audit reports. Quite simply an auditor should not put his or her name to a company report if the professional instinct says the basic message is wrong. But that is not the way we are going. This is where we get back to professionalism. It is about none of the above, but the ability and attitude of those who work in the profession. The vicious circle is ever more regulations and a disinclination for brighter graduates to join the party. The virtuous circle is the opposite. Can auditors be trusted with flexibility? Auditors have to earn that trust. I suggest: Practising accountants should view the rule books as the underpinning and not the driver of their judgments. They should be able to stand up for those judgments without fear of the consequences. So they need support, which they don't always get, not just from company managements but from all those institutions who share the responsibility for good corporate governance. Those who write the rules should concentrate on the spirit and avoid the growing tendency to over-engineer commonsense subjects. Those who interpret the rules in regulating company accounts and auditing should do likewise. For example, I would like to see the Financial Reporting Review Panel taking to task those who have followed the rules when to do so was perverse. Quite simply, without trust professionalism is dead.

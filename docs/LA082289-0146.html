			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> ODD CHARACTERS BUOY 'MUSICAL COMEDY MURDERS'  </P> <P> Whodunits, with their arch characters and exaggerated plot turns, are ready  made for teasing. One of the best murder mystery spoofs is "The Musical Comedy  Murders of 1940," now at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center's  Theater-on-the-Green.  </P> <P> The Resident Theatre Company of Fullerton, under Allison Liddi's direction,  dives right into John Bishop's comedy, thickening the silly accents and gassing  up the outlandish acting. The first act, which sets up the goofy elements  surrounding the unmasking of the deadly "Stagedoor Slasher," is better than the  production's whole -- the second act is a tad labored and confusing -- but this  is still an engaging, often witty show.  </P> <P> The plot is stubbornly chaotic, hanging loosely on a murderer lurking about as  an eccentric group of show-biz types gather in an isolated mansion to rehearse.  As with most whodunits, the odd characters are the ones that usually keep us  interested, and there are several here, kiddingly played by this capable cast.  </P> <P> We might as well start with the mysterious, goose-stepping maid, Helsa (Holly  Cardone), who at one moment appears almost nude, hanging dead in a closet, and  the next is serving a tray full of appetizers. Then there's foppish Roger  Hopewell (Bruce Dent), a songwriter of dubious talent who collaborates with the  boozing Bernice Roth (Elisabeth Graham).  </P> <P> Bishop has thrown a comic into this bunch, the wise-guy Eddie McCuen (Mark  Edward Hawkins) and his love interest, the mouthy chorine, Nikki Crandall (Kat  Van Schaik). There are assorted other characters as well, all watched over by  the seemingly amiable director, Ken De La Maize (Kevin Skousen).  </P> <P> Of course, any one of these folks could be the bad guy, and the usual clues are  laid about to help the audience do its own detective work. But Bishop is more  interested in generating gags -- some corny, some fresh -- at the mystery  form's expense. You can enjoy this comedy even if you are completely baffled by  what is going on.  </P> <P> The staging at the Muckenthaler is atmospheric, owing much to Steven Pliska's  well-crafted lighting. The comic scenes have an almost garish spotlighting; the  more dangerous scenes, all in shadows, have the right eeriness. Mela  Hoyt-Heydon's costumes complement the overall look.  </P> <P> Gil Morales' set is fairly ambitious for this kind of theater, involving all  sorts of revolving doors and hidden spaces. It also captures the appearance of  a wealthy mansion, while adding the needed edge of colorful satire.  </P> <P> 'THE MUSICAL COMEDY MURDERS OF 1940'  </P> <P> A Resident Theatre Company production of John Bishop's comedy.

We still strive to create  good-neighbourly links and help ethnic Hungarian minorities get  the institutional frameworks they need to survive," Hungarian  Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said on Thursday.    On his Sarajevo visit, Jeszenszky said peace talks would be  more successful if held in Sarajevo, since the different sides  would also be prompted emotionally towards reconciliation by the  sight of suffering people and destroyed buildings.    "People in Sarajevo would have already starved in tens of  thousands had Europe not helped, but the same Europe cannot  arrange a lasting settlement," said the foreign minister.  Everyone has an interest in the Balkans not becoming a new  Lebanon, he added.    Jeszenszky restated Hungary"s principal position of not  participating even as peacekeepers in conflicts affecting its  neighbours. There are Hungarians in Serbia, and anything could  be misunderstood. Requests from both Bosnian Croats and Muslims  would have to be considered by Parliament, Jeszenszky said.</p>

I plan to get  surge suppressors to protect them. How do I select among the many surge  suppressors available, and do they use much electricity?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Electric surge suppressors are a must for today's homes. Almost every  electric device, including your radios, TVs, furnace, air conditioner, clothes  washer and dryer, cordless telephones, etc., has electronic circuitry that can  be damaged by common super-high-voltage surges.  </P> <P> These high-voltage surges in your house wiring can reach 6,000 volts and occur  thousands of times each year. Although the surges occur for only a few  millionths of a second, they can instantly burn out or slowly destroy any  electronic circuit. Even if the television or microwave is turned off, a strong  surge can jump the switch and still harm the electronics.  </P> <P> High-voltage surges are generated both from outside and inside your home.  External surges come from lightning, accidents involving electrical poles and  nearby businesses. Inside your home, they occur when a clothes washer, air  conditioner, refrigerator, any device with a motor, turns off.  </P> <P> You should mount a whole-house surge suppressor on the circuit breaker box.  This blocks external surges from getting into your home. Plug small surge  suppressors into outlets where you plug in electronic equipment. These protect  it from internal surges. You can also get surge suppressors to protect your  telephone line and TV cable from high voltage.  </P> <P> The level of protection varies significantly among similar-looking surge  suppressors. Different types of electronics require different levels of  protection. Good suppressors should respond within 1 billionth of a second to  block surges. The shortest response time specification is best.  </P> <P> Another important specification is the clamping voltage. This indicates at what  voltage level the surge suppressor begins to block the surge and dissipate it  harmlessly. It can range from about 330 volts upward and should meet  Underwriter's Laboratories standards. A lower clamping voltage offers better  protection.  </P> <P> The total surge energy capability indicates how powerful a surge the suppressor  can dissipate. A higher number is better. A whole-house suppressor is highest,  up to 400 joules, to block the very powerful external surges. A surge  suppressor uses very little electricity itself.  </P> <P> When you purchase surge suppressors, compare the specifications. Some also  offer a guarantee covering your electronic equipment repair costs if it is  damaged by a surge. You can get whole-house kits containing suppressors for the  breaker box, wall outlets, telephone and TV antenna or cable.  </P> <P> You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 356 listing manufacturers of  surge suppressors, types of suppressors they offer, specifications, guarantees  and information on the whole-house suppressor kits. Please include $1 and a  self-addressed stamped business-size envelope. Send your requests to James  Dulley, c/o Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244.  </P></p>

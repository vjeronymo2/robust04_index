			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / UN tells Bosnian factions to allow full-scale relief THE United Nations Security Council last night called on the warring factions in Bosnia-Hercegovina to allow full-scale humanitarian relief operations to resume. It was stung into issuing the demand after a surprise decision by Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, to suspend almost all aid deliveries because of political interference. While the council backed Mrs Ogata's decision, some diplomats privately criticised her for bringing the issue to a head without consulting them. Mrs Ogata said that political leaders on all sides had 'made a mockery' of UN efforts to get food and medical aid through to people caught up in the ethnic conflict in the former Yugoslav republics. 'I have done everything I can to persuade leaders to distinguish humanitarian aid from the conflict,' Mrs Ogata told a news conference in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. Deliveries to the besieged city of Sarajevo are being blocked by the Bosnian government to draw attention to the plight of Moslems stranded in towns in eastern Bosnia. Serb forces meanwhile are preventing aid getting through to the Moslems in those towns. UNHCR officials said a 10-lorry convoy bound for the Moslem enclave of Cerska, eastern Bosnia, would be ordered to return to Belgrade. Serb forces blocked the convoy again yesterday for the fourth day, as well as holding up a convoy heading for besieged Moslems in Gorazde, south of Cerska. Mrs Ogata said blocked convoys would be moved back to their bases and all relief activities in Serbian-controlled Bosnia suspended immediately. All UNHCR activities in Sarajevo would be suspended and all staff withdrawn, leaving only a skeleton UNHCR presence. Land convoys and the airlift to Sarajevo would also be suspended. Relief operations in areas of Bosnia where UNHCR could still operate would be maintained at a reduced level. Mrs Ogata said Serb and Bosnian leaders would have to signal a clear commitment to giving the UN access before aid could be resumed. Backing her up, the Security Council condemned the blocking of relief supplies. It said this was endangering the lives of aid workers and putting the civilian population at risk. It demanded that all parties in the Bosnia conflict give Mrs Ogata the guarantees she is seeking to allow a full-scale aid programme to resume immediately. Mr Yuli Vorontsov, the Russian ambassador to the UN, described Mrs Ogata's move as 'a rather unexpected decision'. Lord Owen, the EC peace mediator on the former Yugoslavia, said he understood the 'frustration and anger' that led to Mrs Ogata's move, but said aid must be restored as soon as possible. Lord Owen and his co-mediator, Mr Cyrus Vance, will today meet the newly appointed US and Russian envoys to the peace talks, with the optimistic aim of reaching agreement with the warring factions by the end of the month. British troops in Bosnia returned fire twice last night after coming under attack in a disputed village. Army headquarters at the Croatian port of Split said there were no casualties among the British forces.</p>

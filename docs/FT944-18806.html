			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Protecting your rights when a scheme closes This week's European Court decision on equal pensions will trigger 'a tidal wave of scheme wind-ups', according to Richard Whitelam, a partner with consulting actuary Bacon &amp; Woodrow. Most of these schemes will belong to companies that became insolvent after May 1990 - the date of the Barber case  -and have been waiting for this latest judgment to find out how to share the funds among members. The judgment means that if the scheme rules allowed women to claim a full pension from a lower age than males, then the men should be able to boost their benefits by claiming the same rights for the period between May 1990 and the date of insolvency - up to four years, in some cases. Whitelam warns, however: 'Problems will arise where there is not enough money in the pension fund to cover its liabilities. In these cases, the men's new rights must be taken into account before all the pensions are scaled down.' Equal pension rights apart, winding up a pension scheme is a lengthy and complex procedure and it is important to know your rights. Whatever the circumstances, your pension benefits should be safe because the law states that a pension fund must be held in a trust that is separate legally from the company's own funds. On wind-up, a well-run scheme should have adequate funds to cover present and future pensions. Unfortunately, the wind-up can reveal a shortfall, as happened at ship-builder Swan Hunter where the actuaries under-estimated the cost of buying out the scheme's liabilities and had to reduce the benefits of members who had not yet retired by up to 40 per cent. Even where there is no reason to suspect foul play, there can be endless delays that cause anxiety during wind-up, as Tony Bevan discovered (see 'Caught in the log-jam'). *** It is important to keep in touch with the scheme's trustees; they are there to look after your rights and tell you about any changes that are taking place. But remember that you cannot always rely on trustees if, for example, they include members of the work force who were made redundant before a take-over or privatisation. A trade union contact can prove helpful in these circumstances. The way a scheme is wound up depends on its trust deed and rules - the legal foundation on which schemes are based. The trustees should consult a legal adviser and, in the case of insolvency, appoint an independent trustee - a professional whose job is to protect members' benefits. It is worth asking this trustee how long it will take to wind up the scheme, since this can drag on for up to five years depending on the complexity of the case, how the fund is invested, and how many government departments are involved. This can lead to a period of delays during which you might not be able to transfer your benefits to a new scheme or, in the case of retired members, be paid a full pension. If, when the process is complete, there is a fund shortfall, your benefits may be reduced. If, on the other hand, there is a surplus, you might receive a better pension than expected. Whatever the circumstances you should stay put until your position is clear. *** On wind-up, the Inland Revenue insists that your pension money is invested in another scheme or plan until retirement. In most cases, the trustees will arrange a 'bulk purchase annuity' with a life office; this guarantees the same or similar benefits to members as those offered by the original scheme. You could also have the option of transferring your former company benefits into a new company scheme or a personal pension plan. Expert help is essential here to make sure you are getting good value for money. Bear in mind that most company schemes provide lump sum death insurance and pensions for dependants. Check that your new arrangement covers these family protection benefits. Who can help The Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (Opas) publishes a technical guide, Winding Up of Pension Schemes on Company Insolvency, which is available from Opas at 11 Belgrave Road, London SW1V IRB (tel: 071-233 8080). The guide is written for trustees but will be of interest to scheme members. If you want Opas to investigate a specific case, contact the organisation via your local Citizens Advice Bureau. Help from Opas is free but, if you are prepared to pay for expert legal aid, contact the Association of Pensions Lawyers, c/o Paul Stannard, 10 Snow Hill, London EC1A 2AL.</p>

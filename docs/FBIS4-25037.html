			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chan Wai-fong and Daniel Kwan] </F>   [Text] When followers of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support  of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China assemble in  Victoria Park tomorrow night for the annual June 4th  candle-light vigil, they will not just be there to mourn those  killed five years ago at Tiananmen Square.    They might also be witnessing the closing chapters of the  story of the Alliance.    Tough-talking by Beijing officials and last week's scuffles  between Alliance members and Hong Kong police outside the Xinhua  headquarters in Happy Valley have left people with little doubt  that the Alliance, already branded "subversive" by Beijing, will  not be allowed to survive after 1997.    Formed in 1989 at the height of the democracy movement, the  Alliance -- an umbrella organisation with 222 member subgroups  -- is the largest political organisation in Hong Kong dedicated  to the promotion of democracy in China.    In the past five years, it has consistently condemned  political prosecution and called for the release of political  prisoners in China. Every year, its schedule is filled with  events to remind forgetful people in Hong Kong of those sad days  in 1989 and of mainland activists in jail for taking part in the  movement. At an information centre set up by the Alliance, news  clippings, books, journals 'and video tapes are freely available  to anyone interested in learning more about the democracy  movement.    Apart from all these activities the Alliance has been acting  discreetly behind the scenes. Dozens of mainland dissidents  have been smuggled out of China with its assistance. Many have  been granted asylum and have settled in the West. It also  maintains an extensive communications network with dissidents in  the mainland who have been forced underground by the authorities.    But when the soldiers from the People's Liberation Army  march  across the Shenzhen River at midnight on June 30, 1997, all  these contacts may come to an end.    Although they won't admit it in public, many of the Alliance  leaders are prepared -- at least psychologically -- for the  grand finale. Its financial reserve which stood at about HK$5.7  million [Hong Kong dollars] by last April can be depleted by  1997.    "We have paid the price for doing all these things," said  liberal legislator Cheung Man-kwong, who is a member of the  Alliance's standing committee. "(Those in the Legislative  Council) will have to step down in 1997...It is our conviction  that the crackdown will one day be rehabilitated."    At present, seven of the 20 standing committee members of  the  Alliance are Legislative Councillors. Since there will be no  "through-train" for the council in 1997, their membership of the  Alliance will not affect their chances of serving beyond the  handover. It will, ironically, probably help boost their image  to help them win seats in the 1995 elections.    While it is obvious that the days of the Alliance are  numbered, there is little indication of what its leaders are  preparing to do in the final count-down.    Veteran activist Lau Shan-ching, who spent 10 years in a  Chinese jail for his political views, believes the Alliance  might have to shut down its underground operation and act  strictly according to the law.    "I think the Alliance may have to stop activities like  smuggling dissidents out of China that can be considered illegal  after 1997," said Mr Lau who is also a member of the standing  committee. "Although we will stand firm on our principles, we  can't afford to give them an excuse to disband us."    The activist, often criticised for his radical political  views, warned that the 1997 deadline could prove more  unpredictable than most people expect if the future Special  Administrative Region government handles it poorly.    "There will be demonstrations on July 1, 1997...but I don't  expect the Alliance will play a leading role.    Its (the Alliance's) leadership is kind of conservative," Mr  Lau said.    He also feared that if the Alliance was disbanded by the  future SAR government its followers would be driven into forming  "radical political groups" resulting in chaos in the streets.    "They (the SAR government) will have to go to court if they  are to disband us. If that happens, I am not sure that they  will win," he said.    His biggest criticism of the Alliance was that it has failed  to offer its followers a clear political direction on China and  has done very little in counteracting the psychological warfare  launched by Beijing after the 1989 crackdown.    While he acknowledged the Alliance had promoted concepts  such  as press freedom and right of assembly among its followers, it  had failed to "educate" them about "falsehoods" propagated by  the communist party.    "I think it is not enough just to call for the  rehabilitation  of June 4 The Alliance has to point out more forcibly that all  these problems China is facing today are in one way or another  because of the crackdown. People are beginning to agree with  them [communists] that the crackdown was justified as the  economy is booming and the situation in China is stable. But  that's not true, he said.    "We must point out that the Communist Party has lost its  ideology. It is bound to fall apart after Deng Xiaoping dies.  That's what the Alliance has failed to do.    "Without a clear message, we will lose our support."    Mr Cheung dismissed the suggestion that public support for  the Alliance was fading although less people were taking part in  its organised activities.    "Who still goes to Xinhua to protest these days? The heat  has died down. We cannot attract the media any more. News of  our activities has been placed far down the page in newspapers.  But it's exactly because of these things that there is a need  to go shouting against these abuses. It's easy to forget. Once  people forget the pressure (on the Chinese Government) would  also be reduced," he said.    Looking forward, Mr Cheung said with many dissidents now  either in hiding or exile, the Alliance would concentrate on  lesser-known activists in prison, like Shanghai dissident Yang  Zhou.    "We will fight till the last minute. Even though it's the  last minute should we not fight then?" Mr Cheung said.    "Don't underestimate the silence at the moment. A large  number of the people who have witnessed the bloody crackdown  still live. And no one could forget the Nanjing massacre," a  reference to the 1937 massacre by the invading Japanese army.    If the Alliance survives after 1997, Mr Lau said, it would  be  the first group of political activists to organise memorial  activities on June 4 in land ruled by China.</p>

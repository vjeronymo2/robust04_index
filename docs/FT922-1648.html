			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Gilts It looks as if overseas investors have been more grudging in funding Mr John Major than the gilt market originally thought. This week's provisional money supply figures suggest foreign purchases of gilts were only about Pounds 500m in May after Pounds 464m in April. That left domestic investors responsible for absorbing the vast proportion of gilts sold since the election, despite anecdotal evidence to the contrary. The statistics may fail to capture the true picture. Some domestic buying may actually be for overseas accounts. Even allowing for that, however, the Bank's figures suggest that foreign buyers actively supporting the market before the election have become less interested since. Admittedly, domestic institutions have sufficient cash to cover the entire PSBR, but only at the expense of investment in equities. The apparent lack of foreign interest in April and May suggests the yield margin between gilts and German government bonds became too narrow after the election. Presumably domestic buyers were motivated less by the convergence theory on European interest rates and more by the belief that a new Tory government would sacrifice growth in the fight against inflation. The margin over German paper will have to rise above its current 135 basis points to entice foreign investors back in a sizeable way. Even if only modest inflows are required, it cannot go much lower. The Irish vote on Maastricht went the market's way, but nervousness will remain until September's French referendum.</p>

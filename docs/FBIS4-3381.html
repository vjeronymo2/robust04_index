			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 16 (CNA) -- Negotiators from Taiwan  and the United States will meet in Washington next month to  discuss tariff and non-tariff trade issues related to Taiwan's  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) membership  application, a Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) official said  Saturday [16 April].    "The second round of informal Taiwan-U.S. trade  consultations  under the GATT framework will begin May 9 and we hope the talks  will produce concrete results," said Tsai Lien-sheng, a BOFT  department director.    Major topics will include tariff reductions and the removal  of non-tariff trade barriers, including liberalization of  agricultural imports, government procurement and aircraft  purchases, Tsai noted.    During the first round of talks held in Taipei in late  February, American delegates were dissatisfied with  Taiwan-proposed tariff cuts on a range of industrial and  agricultural products.    Tsai said the U.S. wants Taiwan to make greater tariff  reductions in accordance with the GATT Uruguay Round accord and  allow free imports of farm products.    Tsai said the government will seek a 10-year adjustment  period for local rice farmers. Taiwan will only allow imports  of 1 to 4 percent of its annual rice consumption for the first  10 years after joining GATT. After the adjustment period,  Taiwan's market will become fully open to foreign rice imports,  he explained.    Tsai said Taiwan may agree to sign a GATT agreement on  government procurement to facilitate its GATT entry.    BOFT Deputy Director-General Lin Yi-fu will head the Taiwan  delegation to the May talks, Tsai added.</p>

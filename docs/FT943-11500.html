			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Sumitomo Chemical cuts losses Sumitomo Chemical of Japan has substantially reduced its first-half losses as a result of cost savings, cheaper raw materials and a lower interest bill, but has not yet decided whether to reinstate its dividend. The pre-tax loss for the six months to June was down to Y402m (Dollars 4.1m) from Y2.93bn, in spite of a 4.2 per cent dip in sales to Y273.84bn. It said yesterday that sales of basic chemicals were down 1.7 per cent and fine chemicals 2.7 per cent, with a sharper fall of 8 per cent in petrochemicals and plastics. Agrichemicals showed the smallest decline, of 0.5 per cent, amid demand for feed additives. Exports grew 1.6 per cent overall, to Y38.81bn. The company has also been expanding its overseas interests, with projects in Singapore and the US. Net losses were down to Y1.94bn from Y5.44bn, and it expects to reach break-even for the full year, on sales down 1 per cent to Y540bn. It is paying no interim dividend and indicated that the 1994 payout could be anything between nil and Y3 a share.</p>

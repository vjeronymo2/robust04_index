			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Transport - plan on basis of sustainable development, or reverse development (2) Sir, Your editorial on the findings of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution is founded on two fallacies. First, while matching total revenue raised from any particular group of road users with the total costs caused by that group may well relate to questions of fairness and, thus, to selling certain policies to the public, it has nothing to do with overall economic efficiency. For any policy to be efficient it should set the right incentives. Consequently, only margins are to be taken into account. As long as the private costs of driving one additional mile fall short of the corresponding social costs, society suffers as a whole. Second, since the American economist, Anthony Downs, published his findings on congestion on US freeways in 1962, there has been ample evidence - though largely ignored by road planners and transport ministers - that new roads increase road traffic. Again, the reason is a matter of incentives. By relieving congestion in the short run the private costs of motoring as experienced by the marginal driver are reduced on other roads as well and, thus, more drivers are wrongly induced to use the roads. In the worst scenario this may even lead to an increase in overall congestion. Instead of proceeding with the current road building programme, the government would be better advised to introduce road pricing and significantly to increase fuel taxes. By pricing marginal drivers off the roads, much of today's 'demand' for new roads would become obsolete. The financial consequences of this could easily be cushioned by, for example, scrapping vehicle taxes or reducing income tax or National Health Service contributions. Taken as a whole, this could even leave public revenue unchanged. Every day both the countryside and tens of thousands of commuters all over the UK continue to suffer from disastrous repercussions of Dr Beeching's recommendations of three decades ago. The royal commission's report presents a unique and possibly final chance to halt and, at least partially, reverse this development. It should not be wasted.

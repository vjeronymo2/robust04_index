			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher will arrive in Damascus today to start a new tour  designed to give a boost to the peace process. Undoubtedly,  Secretary Christopher will find in Damascus what he found in  previous tours, that is, a frank Syrian position on the peace  process, a definite commitment to UN Security Council  Resolutions 242 and 338, a comprehensive view of the just peace,  and a sincere will to establish peace in a region that has seen  all kinds of aggression and expansionist policies. He will  sense an infinite seriousness in dealing with the ideas and  proposals aiming to implement the UN resolutions and to  implement, seriously and practically, the bases of the Madrid  peace conference.    It is also expected that when he moves to Israel, Secretary  Christopher will find there the same position he found in  previous tours, that is, an ambiguous Israeli concept of the  peace process; an evasion of, or even contempt for, UN Security  Council Resolutions 242 and 338; negligence of the spirit of the  U.S. initiative; an incomplete view of peace; and a sincere will  to squander available opportunities, waste time and drain the  Madrid conference of its content and the peace process of its  objectives in order to impose the peace Israel wants, tailored  according to the expansionist schemes and aggressive intentions  known throughout the entire world.    The question that comes to mind in the light of this fact  is:  How can the U.S. position, in other words the position of the  U.S. sponsor, be reconciled with the policy of procrastination  and obstruction Israel is pursuing? How can this dilemma be  escaped; a dilemma Israel wants to be a dilemma for the U.S.  Administration itself? If Israel succeeds in making this a  dilemma for the United States, it will be able to subdue the  U.S. initiative and the mediator's role. This would serve its  own interests in the peace deal it wants, without taking into  account the credibility of the U.S. position or U.S. interests  in a region, which is required to enjoy peace.    As it receives Secretary Christopher today, Syria is  stressing that its position supports the just and comprehensive  peace which can achieve complete Israeli withdrawal from the  occupied Arab territories, on top of which is the occupied Golan  Heights; which can return rights to their rightful owners; and  which can establish objective conditions for a genuine stability  that would be accepted and even defended by the people, and for  a peace based on international legitimacy and its resolutions as  the terms of reference. These must be adopted in order to  fortify the awaited peace and entrench the desired justice.    Syria believes any distortion of this concept or twisting of  these facts, which are known to the entire world, means a  departure from the right course and the start of a journey down  intricate roads that will lead the region to anywhere but peace.</p>

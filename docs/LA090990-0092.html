			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> POPCORN USED TO SIMULATE OIL SPILL IN DRILL OFF MAINE  </P> <P> Popcorn substituted for spilled oil as cleanup crews practiced along Maine's  coast.  </P> <P> Sea gulls also pitched in.  </P> <P> The lightship Nantucket played the role of a fictitious tanker called the  "Petroloss" for the simulated 500,000-gallon spill in Searsport Harbor.  </P> <P> Four hundred pounds of popcorn was substituted for oil in Thursday's drill.  </P> <P> "It's not going to take too much to pick up 400 pounds of popcorn. But 500,000  gallons of oil, on the other hand, would be an ecological disaster," said Coast  Guart Lt. Cmdr. John Butler.  </P></p>

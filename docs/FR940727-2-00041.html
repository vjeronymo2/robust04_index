			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The order accepted for public comment contains provisions requiring the divestiture by Healthtrust of the Holy Cross Hospital and related assets, including interests in five clinics, in Salt Lake City, Utah. The purpose of the divestiture is to ensure the continuation of Holy Cross Hospital as an ongoing, viable acute care hospital independent of Healthtrust, and to remedy the lessening of competition in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area hospital markets resulting from the acquisition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed order requires Healthtrust to obtain the approval of the Commission for the divestiture of Holy Cross Hospital. Under the terms of the order, the required divestiture must be completed within six months of the date the order becomes final. If the required divestiture were not completed within the six-month period, Healthtrust would consent to the appointment of a trustee, who would have twelve additional months to effect the divestiture. The hold separate agreement executed as part of the consent order requires Healthtrust, until the completion of the divestiture or as otherwise specified, to hold separate and preserve all of the assets and businesses of Holy Cross Hospital. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed order provides that approval by the Commission of the divestiture shall be conditioned upon the agreement by the acquirer that, for ten years from the date of the divestiture, it will not sell, without the prior approval of the Commission, Holy Cross Hospital to another person operating (or in the process of acquiring) any other acute care hospital in the Three-County Area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The order would prohibit Healthtrust from acquiring any acute care hospital in the Three-County Area without the prior approval of the Federal Trade Commission. It would also prohibit Healthtrust from transferring, without prior Commission approval, any acute care hospital it operates in the Three-County Area to another person operating (or in the process of acquiring) an acute care hospital in the area. These provisions, in combination, would give the Commission authority to prohibit any substantial combination of the acute care hospital operations of Healthtrust with those of any other acute care hospital in the Three-County Area, unless Healthtrust convinced the Commission that a particular transaction would not endanger competition in the Salt Lake City area or the Three-County Area. The provisions would not apply to acquisitions or sales where the value of the transferred assets is $1 million or less, and the provisions would expire ten years after the order becomes final. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For ten years, the order would prohibit Healthtrust from transferring all or any substantial part of any hospital in the Three-County Area to another party without first filing with the Commission an agreement by the transferee to be bound by the order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this analysis is to invite public comment concerning the proposed order, to assist the Commission in its determination whether to make the order final. This analysis is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and order or to modify their terms in any way. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by Healthtrust that its proposed acquisition would have violated the law, as alleged in the Commission's complaint. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donald S.

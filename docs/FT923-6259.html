			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: DC Cook Pounds 121,000 in the black DC Cook Holdings, the USM-quoted operator of car dealerships and petrol stations, returned to the black in the year to April 30 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 121,000 compared with losses of Pounds 1.48m. There were profits of Pounds 107,000 at the halfway stage. The result was achieved on turnover of Pounds 108m (Pounds 123m) and was after an exceptional Pounds 70,000 (Pounds 607,000) charge and interest payments of Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 3.02m). Mr Derek Cook, chairman, said the UK property division produced 'particularly disappointing' results while the motor division exceeded expectations with a substantial increase in operating profits. The performance of Norfolk Espana, the group's Spanish roadside property development company, was better than expected and contributed Pounds 865,000 to operating prof-its. Earnings per share emerged at 1.08p (0.43p losses) basic and 1.11p (0.15p) fully diluted. A final dividend of 0.3p is proposed for a total of 0.5p (1p).</p>

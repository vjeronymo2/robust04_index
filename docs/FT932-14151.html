			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early market surge runs out of steam A PROMISING start to the new three-week trading account in London, triggered mainly by Wall Street's surge to an all-time peak on Friday and hopes that this week could bring lower German interest rates, was largely eroded as the Footsie future retreated after a disappointing opening on Wall Street yesterday. Earlier, London dealers were surprised at the level of early buying interest in the equity market. Wall Street's move to a closing record level last Friday was said to have prompted a flurry of early buying interest in London, driving the FT-SE 100 Index up from an initially easier opening of 2,822.8 to the day's high point of 2,844.2, a net rise of almost 20 points, just before midday. A large number of stocks going ex-dividend accounted for 4.6 points off the index. Dealers said the early buying was triggered by a number of broking houses adopting a more optimistic attitude on UK recovery trends, leading to a series of earnings upgrades in the leading stocks. An easing in French interest rates was also seen as another bullish angle for London, with markets across Europe still hopeful that the French move could be followed by a reduction in German rates after the Bundesbank meeting this Thursday. After reaching the day's peak, however, the market began to drift, with activity slowing appreciably in the run-up to Wall Street's opening, which saw the Dow Industrial Average down more than 16 points as London closed. The disappointing showing by New York quickly impacted on London, where the FT-SE 100 gradually came off to finish a net 5.6 up at 2,830.0. The 100 index just managed to maintain its recent outperformance of the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which closed a net 2.1 ahead at 3,074.4, having moved in a narrow range throughout a generally quiet session. Dealers said turnover in the market was disappointing, with 463m shares traded, made up of 185m of Footsie stocks and 278m non-Footsie stocks. Dealers continued to take heart, however, from the consistently high level of customer business in the market. Last Friday, the final day of the three-week Easter account and a session badly affected by the nation-wide railway strike, attracted customer business worth Pounds 1.19bn. So far this year there have been only a handful of trading sessions during which the value of retail, or customer, business has fallen below Pounds 1bn. Senior marketmakers, worried by last week's bad news on inflation, were relieved at the market's performance yesterday. A trader commented: 'The market still feels very jittery but has been helped by perceptions that European rates could come down.' Around the various sectors, the banks stood out with good gains as one of the leading US investment banks voiced its enthusiasm on National Westminster shares. Leading retailers were generally well supported, notably Boots, but the oil majors looked to have run out of steam as some US analysts were said to have decided that BP and Shell had risen far enough. ICI received a choppy ride in the market, with some industry analysts taking the view that the hiving off of the Zeneca drugs business may prove more disappointing than previously thought. Bid rumours, however, continued to surround Lucas Industries.</p>

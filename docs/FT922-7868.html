			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Arts: The Seagull There are two schools of British Chekhov criticism. The former, and larger, school says that there is too much Chekhov about in Britain, that the British seldom get Chekhov 'right', and that the Russians are right to say Chekhov is much funnier than the British know. The other school says that the existence of a long British tradition of Chekhov proves a real local sympathy for this author, that this tradition has been responsible for numerous classic stagings of Chekhov's few plays over the years, that the British may actually be no further from Chekhov than the post-1917 Russians, and that Chekhov is tonic and stimulus to British actors. I belong, you have rightly discerned, to the latter school. Theatre Clwyd's production of The Seagull is the farewell staging there by the theatre's artistic director Toby Robertson (who departs after seven years' service). It has the interest of having Arkadina and her son Konstantin played by Dorothy Tutin and her son Nick Waring; and Trigorin is Ian Hogg. The drama is alive, with a nice sense of Chekhov's serio-comic fluctuations. Jeremy Brooks's English version, based on a translation by Susanna Hamnett, is lively. Arkadina admits 'Well, of course, I do have some money. But I'm an artiste. My make-up alone practically ruins me.' Tutin, with her strange chestnuts-and-cream voice and delicate near-French enunciation, hints lightly at the streaks in Arkadina that in other hands have become egomania and rampant affectation. She is light even in absurd extremes - even when she pushes Trigorin onto the floor and makes long, verbal love to him: 'You have freshness] simplicity] healthy humour]' Earlier, she tells him, metaphorically, 'You must sober up]' and then takes a swig of alcohol herself. Hogg, however, makes Trigorin too blatantly a charlatan. It becomes impossible to see what Nina idealises in him. Waring, however, makes a good impression from the first as Konstantin and gets better as the play proceeds, though I would like to see him the play the role again in five years' time when he has more vocal presence. He epitomises the major virtues of the production - and the slight weaknesses that would drive the Brits-out Chekhovians crazy. On the one hand, he has pacing, variety, feeling, sincerity; the way he keeps shifting the mood in every speech and dialogue is admirable. On the other, we don't sense Konsantin's underlying temperament forcefully enough. As Sorin, Ronald Fraser looks like Verdi in extreme old age, drawls his vowels and mushes his consonants; 'tragedy' is pronounced 'chrairshedeh.' Both he and Lucinda Curtis as Polina are too predictable, too fond of turning their roles into stock types. Nina and Masha are much more interestingly conceived by Catherine Cusack and Lucy Scott as contrasting examples of young womanhood, but neither interpretation has quite settled into focus yet. The most perfectly judged interpretation of all is Bernard Lloyd as Doctor Dorin, elegant and ironic. He finds time, as no one else onstage does, just to take in atmosphere; and we feel life itself passing by. The staging works beautifully on its own delicate terms. Other stagings have more drive, more neurosis and, above all, more sense of the accidental details of life passing in the background. If there is a single fault I would find, however, it is that too many speeches are made bang in the centre of the stage. The fascination of Chekhov lies in asymmetry.

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Redland/Steetley It is not often that a Spanish mayor becomes embroiled in a UK takeover battle, as seems to have happened in the row over Steetley's Spanish assets. Redland may have missed the target this time, but has points on the scoreboard after challenging the value of Steetley's French aggregates business, Gobitta. It looks like Steetley's final chance today.</p>

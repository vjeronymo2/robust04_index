			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Scotland wins battle for Pounds 530m NEC chip plant: Semiconductor project expected to create 430 jobs NEC, the Japanese electronics giant, yesterday announced that it intended to spend Y80bn (Pounds 530m) to build a semiconductor manufacturing plant in Livingston near Edinburgh in Scotland. The factory, an addition to NEC's existing Livingston facilities, is expected to create 430 jobs on top of the existing 940. Scotland won the decision in competition with NEC's largest semiconductor plant in Roseville, California. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said the plant was the largest single inward investment project attracted to Scotland and one of the largest secured by the UK. He said that development grants to NEC for the project were small compared with the overall investment. However, less than half the funds are likely to be spent in the UK. NEC says Y20bn will be spent on construction while Y60bn will go on manufacturing equipment. The Japanese company will be working at the limits of semiconductor technology and the equipment to make this possible is not available from UK or continental European manufacturers. Mr Andrew Norwood, a semiconductor specialist with the technology consultancy Dataquest, said Japanese companies such as Nikon and Canon were the likeliest candidates. NEC intends to manufacture at Livingston the latest generation of memory chips and eventually microprocessors and special circuits. It is expanding capacity because of a worldwide shortfall in memory chip production, now estimated at 20 per cent. Construction of the plant will start next April and production is expected to begin in October 1996. The decision may lead to further extensive investment in NEC's plant at Ballivor in the Irish Republic which already tests and assembles semiconductors from Livingston. NEC has invested Pounds 230m on chip manufacture at Livingston since 1987 and spent Pounds 28m to increase production capacity a few months ago. Mr Toshio Nakamura, managing director of NEC's UK semiconductor operations, said: 'Production is currently running at full capacity but we are unable to meet the needs of our European customers and so must expand.' With global production last year valued at Dollars 8.1bn, NEC is Japan's largest semiconductor manufacturer and second worldwide only to Intel of the US. It chose Scotland for several reasons: it balanced its production operations in the US and Japan; NEC in the UK is its most productive plant; European demand is high; the workforce is well educated and there are ample supplies of water.

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Sweden's PM pledges more jobs if voters back EU entry Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Swedish prime minister, yesterday stepped up his hard-pressed campaign to win approval for Swedish membership of the European Union in Sunday's referendum, promising an urgent government programme to increase employment if there is a Yes vote. 'Immediately after a Yes in the referendum, the government will formulate a programme to promote more sustainable employment in industry . . . This work will be done in constructive co-operation with the labour market partners,' he said in a newspaper article. Meanwhile, Mr Carlsson and his fellow Social Democratic leaders in Denmark, Finland and Norway issued a joint declaration on Tuesday night asserting that if Denmark's Nordic neighbours joined it in the EU, social democrats would strengthen their influence inside the Union. The Danish, Norwegian and Swedish governments are led by social democrats and the Finnish Social Democratic party is expected to win a general election next March. Finland has already voted to join the EU and Norway will hold a referendum on November 28. Pro-EU campaigners have this week urged Mr Carlsson - who celebrated his 60th birthday yesterday - to work harder to win over the many Euro-sceptics in his own deeply-split party to help overcome a strong Swedish anti-EU campaign in Sunday's vote. The left-dominated No side, which some recent polls have suggested is in the lead, has argued that anti-inflation policies steered by right-of-centre governments in the leading EU countries have been responsible for high unemployment within member states. The No campaign claimed yesterday that entering the EU could cost as many as 340,000 jobs in Sweden, on top of the 575,000 - more than 13 per cent of the workforce - already unemployed. It said the financial cost of Swedish membership, coupled with the effect of bringing down value-added tax to EU levels, would eventually force the country into deep public sector cuts. In his article in Dagens Nyheter, Mr Carlsson countered that the EU was committed in its policy document of last year to working towards lower unemployment. Joining the EU would give Sweden financial stability and encourage investment. 'These are the conditions - reasonable interest rates and a more secure investment climate - that create new possibilities to fight against unemployment. It is these conditions that I quickly want to take advantage of after a positive result in the referendum,' he wrote.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Observer: Ossie influence Has Paul Keating set off a process he can't control? The Labor government's unexpected election victory three weeks ago has prompted a rash of support for the Australian prime minister's republican views. Polls suggest that they are now shared by up to 70 per cent of voters. But Western Australian Liberal MPs Ross Lightfoot and Phillip Pendal see the proposed constitutional change as an opportunity to revive the old west coast dream of separation from the eastern states - where most Australians live. In a neat reversal of the situation in Germany where Wessies resent the dependence of the newly liberated Ossies, many western Australians are unhappy about what they see as the malign influence of Canberra. Pendal, who opposes a republic, says he would prefer a stronger hand for the western states. But if the government refuses that, which is highly likely, he sees secession as a viable second choice. The idea is not as crazy as it sounds. WA covers about a third of the continent, and its mining industry provides a large part of Australia's export earnings. The state actually tried to secede in 1933, but gave up after strong opposition from both Canberra and Britain, which then had residual rights to legislate for its former Australian colonies.</p>

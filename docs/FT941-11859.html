MSBP means drawing attention to yourself by lying about or harming the people you look after. The notorious case of the nurse, Beverley Alitt, who killed or attempted to kill, the babies in her care has been followed by further diagnoses. Are they accurate? (9.00 C4). In Middlemarch on BBC2 the widowed Dorothea is now free to carry on with hunky chunky Ladislaw, provided she is willing to forfeit the property she would have inherited from nasty scheming Casaubon (9.30). When Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) made its 'Wishing Well Appeal' in 1987 it was so successful that it blighted other charities, some of which claimed that GOSH raisedmore than it really needed.

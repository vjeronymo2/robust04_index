In this  way, he indicated the SDPJ will make its official view on the  issue clear early next week. He also stressed: "The SDPJ is  the sole Japanese political party that has maintained a  relationship with the Workers' Party of Korea in North Korea and  the relationship has a long history. As one of the coalition  partners, however, the SDPJ is in the position of shoring up the  coalition government." He also suggested the SDPJ, in its  official view, will press North Korea to accept all nuclear  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>

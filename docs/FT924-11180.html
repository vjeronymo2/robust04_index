			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Tokyo's stores lament loss of big spenders - The older, luxury shops have been hit particularly hard THREE times a day, a gaggle of mostly elderly people gather at the heart of Mitsukoshi's flagship store in the historic heart of Tokyo's Nihombashi district to listen to a recital on the shop's mighty 800-pipe organ. The same man has played the organ for the past 40 years. His audience's loyalty is a symbol of the enduring role Mitsukoshi plays in Japanese retailing. Mitsukoshi originated the idea of the Japanese department store in the late 17th century as a place where shoppers could buy almost anything. A store is meant to provide all-round entertainment - music, restaurants, cinemas, at Mitsukoshi a theatre and at Seibu a children's playground - in order to attract shoppers. The trouble is that since last spring people have been pouring through the stores in their millions but have been buying less and less. Sales at Tokyo department stores fell 8.7 per cent last month compared with last year, the seventh consecutive monthly fall and the sharpest yearly fall since statistics began to be collected in 1965, apart from the drop in April 1989 induced by the introduction of a consumption tax. The drop in demand comes after five years of unprecedented growth that encouraged many, including Mitsukoshi into costly expansions that will take much longer than expected to pay off. Mitsukoshi has invested about Y200bn (Dollars 1.64bn) in the past five years, while Tobu spent Y100bn on its main store in Ikebukuro on the outskirts of central Tokyo. Sales as Mitsukoshi's newest store in the Shinjuku area of central Tokyo are 30 per cent down on plans. Few executives in the industry expect the downturn to end soon. Mr Isao Kubokawa, Tobu's managing director, explained: 'This recession could be more serious and last longer than other recessions. One reason is that this recession involves banks and real estate companies which have never been in recession before, as well as the car and electronics industries which have not usually suffered.' The sales decline started last year with luxury goods - art and jewellery - which were fashionable in the years of the Japanese bubble economy. This has hit particularly the older luxury stores such as Takashimaya and Mitsukoshi, where the top-floor luxury goods department is deserted, the calm rarely ruffled by customers. It is a ghostly reminder of the hey-day of the bubble economy. By this spring, overall sales started to fall because consumers cut back on more everyday purchases, particularly clothes. Throughout the retail sector people are trading down to buy cheaper goods. Mr Kubokawa said: 'They would have bought four shirts, now they are buying only one, and they are looking for cheaper shirts.' An executive of Isetan, the most fashionable of the stores, says that younger consumers are buying casual clothes rather than the expensive designer brands which were fashionable in the late 1980s. In August, the decline started to affect staples such as the food sold in the expansive basements below the stores as people turned to cheaper supermarkets. The fall in sales is having an alarming impact on department store finances. For example, Isetan expects sales this year to be below last year, the first annual decline in its 106-year history. It expects profits to fall for the second year running, the worst results since the recessions of the mid-1970s. Tobu expects its investment in Ikebukuro will now take up to six years to pay off compared with the original two years. As yet the stores have taken only tentative steps to cut costs. At Tobu, which has a wealthy parent in the form of the private Tobu railway, Mr Kubokawa said: 'We have to be patient. Costs will be cut through natural wastage over the next three years.' Mitsukoshi, which is more financially vulnerable, is cutting management jobs by 30 per cent and severely reducing executive bonuses. With costs being cut at a much slower rate than sales are falling, it is inevitable that department store profits will continue to fall this year and possibly next year as well. What might distinguish the younger more dynamic stores such as Tobu, Seibu and Isetan is their determination to respond by more aggressive marketing. They are all stress value for money, where two years ago they were selling designer chic. Tobu has introduced an own-label brand of cheaper products to catch consumers as they trade down to cheaper goods. Isetan's energetic management is implementing a medium-term plan to stress profit growth rather than sales growth. The heart of Tokyo has long since shifted away from Mitsukoshi's home - the conservative, traditional low city of Nihombashi - towards the the neon wonderlands in the outlying consumer-commuter conurbations of Shibuya and Shinjuku in the high city, on the hills at the edge of Tokyo. This recession will hasten a similar shift in the department store industry as leadership shifts from the older, slower moving famous names to the young pretenders in search of their crowns.</p>

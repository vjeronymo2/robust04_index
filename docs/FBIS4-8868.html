			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski by </F> correspondent E.K.; place and date not given: "A Historic Step  Forward"]    [Text] [E.K.] You headed the Macedonian [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] delegation at the  negotiations in New York last year, from the end of February  until 8 April as the acting foreign minister, and you  participated in the final activities before the admission of our  country to the United Nations. What was the greatest  characteristic of that period, I would say, of important  meetings and discussions?    [Crvenkovski] The main characteristic of the days preceding  the admission of the Republic of Macedonia to the United Nations  was the attempt of Greece to prevent it at the last minute.  That was the reason for the prolongation in handing their  letter. All possible manipulations were used in order to  prevent our admission at the last minute. Greece is handing,  Greece is not handing the letter, it is handing it with a  signature, without.... After that the Athens Government made  attempts to postpone the procedure as long as possible with the  UN General Assembly, now that it could not prevent the  admission. They insisted that the General Assembly review the  admission of Macedonia at a regular session.    The main activity of the Macedonian delegation in New York  those last 10 days was to "get" the UN General Assembly, and to  fulfill the admission to the United Nations as soon as possible,  that is immediately, which was finally carried out. The  attempted postponement was, as a matter of fact, due to the fact  that the Greek side became aware that, with the admission of  Macedonia to the United Nations, the whole situation had  drastically changed. They hoped time would help them and they  hoped the whole situation could be essentially changed. Because  if Macedonia had not become a member of the United Nations, it  would be likewise in other international institutions within the  UN system, without which it is impossible for a state to  function. These are institutions, like telecommunications,  transport, financial transactions, registration of vehicles,  registration of aircraft, a whole complex of relations which  make possible the communication of a state in the world by  becoming a member of those organizations. If there is not a  normal communication in the world, then there comes a total  economic collapse in a country, with all the relevant  consequences.    That was the basis on which Greece constructed its strategy.  They wanted either to prevent or postpone it as much as  possible, and our vital interest was to regulate our membership  as soon as possible, in order to make possible all the aspects  of a normal international living, and to make the state function.    [E.K.] Which were the states that helped us most in those  activities, negotiations, and persuasions for easing the  pressures of Greece before the membership of our country in the  world community, and who were the diplomats you had the most  frequent contacts with?    [Crvenkovski] Well, the most profound influence was  certainly of the three countries which proposed the resolution  on the admission of our state to the United Nations, three  countries of the European Community, which are Great Britain,  France, and Spain, which was then also one of the 15 members of  the Security Council. It is true that nothing would have been  accomplished without the help of the five permanent members of  the Security Council.    [E.K.] What was the situation like with the so-called  sponsors of the resolution on the admission of Macedonia to the  United Nations?    [Crvenkovski] If I am not mistaken, Macedonia formally had  only 67 sponsors. What was of extreme importance was the great  number of the members. It was also important that this number  was reached in practically 24 hours. Normally, the period  required for providing sponsors for a resolution on admission of  a country to the United Nations lasts 15, 30, or 60 days. The  ambassadors of these countries were practically standing in line  for 24 hours to sign the resolution on our sponsorship. I here  have to point out that we had the great support of the Slovenian  mission to the United Nations, which was the main sponsor, and  which did almost all the technical job in gathering other  members.    [E.K.] The importance of the admission of Macedonia to the  United Nations is apparent. What happened and what has changed  in the international life of Macedonia a year later?    [Crvenkovski] As a direct consequence of the membership in  the United Nations, we became members of all its specialized  agencies. There are 26 such agencies, and each one of them is of  vital importance for the functioning of a state. We have  accomplished a full membership in 26 agencies, and what is left  is only to regulate relations with GATT. There we have observer  status, and we still have not regulated our membership because  the negotiations with GATT need a long process of difficult  negotiations, step by step, on all forms of non-customs measures  of protection, something that cannot normally be expected to be  solved in less than a year of negotiation. The problem is not  of a political, but of a technical nature.    Just after our membership in the United Nations there  followed a process of membership to many state organizations,  institutions, cultural, sports, and scientific international  associations. It was all urged after the admission of Macedonia  to the United Nations. In the meantime the process of bilateral  recognition was carried out with a great number of countries, as  well as of establishing diplomatic relations. The Republic of  Macedonia has established full diplomatic relations with 30  countries, and 30 to 40 more countries have formally recognized  our Republic. Our passports have been accepted by almost the  whole world, with the exception of two neighboring countries.  This is evidently a situation totally different from what we  had before the admission of our country to the United Nations.    [E.K.] What does the admission of Macedonia to the world  organization mean for the political and security plan in  relation to the Bucharest agreement of 1913?    [Crvenkovski] The very act of admission to the United  Nations is a de facto confirmation of the independence of the  relevant state. After that moment the state becomes a full  subject in international relations. It bears all the other  international legal consequences following the act of  recognition.    Until then, until Macedonia entered the United Nations,  almost all speculations concerning its future were possible.  The moment we became an equal UN member the speculations  stopped. Beside the practical aspects that I have here noted,  membership in the specialized agencies of the world organization  represents a significant moment when the sovereignty of a state  is really completed.    [E.K.] The problem in the relations with Greece existed even  before the Macedonian membership in the United Nations, and it  is still there. What are the essential changes in the  negotiating status for overcoming the disputed issues between  the two countries?    [Crvenkovski] First of all, I would like to call not upon  our assessment, but upon the assessment of the Greek side.  During the recent discussions in the Greek parliament, Greek  Prime Minister Papandreou evaluated the admission of Macedonia  to the United Nations as one of the biggest errors of Greek  diplomacy. I do not know how truly it is an error of the Greek  diplomacy, speaking in long terms, but the claim proves that the  other side is totally aware of the enormous importance of that  act. First of all because since 8 April last year there has  existed a relationship of equal partners in the negotiations.  In spite of the fact that the other side is making desperate  attempts and various problems, including the embargo against us,  and in spite of all the hot statements, it is a fact that the  other side, by starting the process of negotiations,  demonstrated it negotiated with a sovereign country. After our  admission to the United Nations, it became an equal process  between two states in dispute. Until the moment of entering the  United Nations, there was the problem of a state that proclaimed  independence, not yet realized. After our membership in the  United Nations that question was canceled from the agenda, and  if you review the whole development of the total relationship of  the international organizations toward the Republic of Macedonia  during the past 12 months, as well as the bilateral relationship  of a number of countries, and the relationship of the world's  public, you will see that after the admission the whole  treatment has radically changed. The disposition of the world's  opinion, of all the leading world's magazines and dailies, as  well as television stations, is evident, expressed in the  interest of the public for the maintenance of the integrity of  an independent state, a member of the world organization.  Before that, that was not the case. Normally, there were  various interests, although there was a certain level of support  with the world's public, though of a totally different quality.</p>

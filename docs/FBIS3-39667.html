			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Birger Hilstrom: "Help for Albania Must Wait"] </F>   [Text] Enormous sums for lifting Albania's shockingly  deficient health care system out of its miserable condition have  been given over the past three years, but 1.5 billion Danish  kroner [DKr] from the EU [European Union] Commission is being  blocked because of Albania's inability to contribute some  matching funds and because of a bureaucratic conflict between  the Commission and the Albanian Ministry of Health.    "We want funds to set up a food inspection system, but the  EU  Commission doesn't want to use funds for this purpose, and so  all payments to our public health sector have been halted," says  Dr. Tritan Shehu, Albania's health minister. The EU Commission  has earmarked DKr48 million, which has simply not been touched.  In addition, another DKr160 million for renovating hospitals is  untouched, because the Commission is requiring Albanian economic  participation.    Altogether over the past three years, Albania has been  granted DKr1.2 billion for EU programs, and the two largest  grants totaling DKr560 million were outright gifts for this poor  country.    EU Parliament member Freddy Blak, who has investigated the  catastrophic conditions in Albanian institutions, is meeting  today with Commission officials to ask for help.</p>

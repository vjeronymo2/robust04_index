			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Anatoliy Golovnev, chief of </F> the Main Directorate for Combat Training and deputy commander in  chief of the Ground Forces, by Colonel Gennadiy Miranovich; date  and place not given: "A State's Might Is Also Measured by the  Level of Its Army Training"]    [Text] From KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's files: Anatoliy Andreyevich  Golovnev. Born Smolensk Oblast 1942. Graduated from the Moscow  Higher Combined Arms Command College (1963), and the M.V. Frunze  (1973) and General Staff (1980) Military Academies. He has  served in various command and staff positions. In August 1992  he moved from his job as first deputy commander of Moscow  Military District to be appointed chief of the Main Directorate  for Combat Training and deputy commander in chief of the Ground  Forces.    [Miranovich] Anatoliy Andreyevich, the Main Directorate for  Combat Training is, it seems to me, the "lawmaker" when it comes  to training specialists on various types of weapons. At least  that was the case in the Soviet Army. Or are things different  now?    [Golovnev] Fortunately, the procedure of disparaging our  Soviet past (something which some of the mass media have had  some success at) has left Armed Forces combat training --  clearly, a little-known area to the writing fraternity --  virtually untouched.    As before, we are elaborating draft field manuals and  general  military regulations along with a program for training officers  and noncommissioned officers from various combat arms, and we  are cooperating closely with combat training organs in the Navy,  Air Defense Forces, the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]  troops, and the Border Guards.... In short, the Main  Directorate for Combat Training is a kind of coordination center  for scientific and methodological ideas and developments in the  combat training sphere. Services from the Russian Ministry for  Emergency Situations, various scientific research institutes,  and military academies -- including the General Staff Academy --  actively cooperate with us. Training in the Commonwealth  countries' armies is virtually based on our developments.    Such a role for our directorate is dictated by life itself.  The organizational development of a new army, the changing of  doctrinal views of the nature of modern warfare, the creation of  force and troop groupings to meet that challenge, and the new  priorities in military-technical policy all require a  reinterpretation of certain canons of combat training.    For instance, we have never before faced the problem of  training units for peacekeeping forces. Naturally, we had  neither the relevant training programs nor the training base.  Now, as you are aware, we are fully tackling this issue. And  not without success.    [Miranovich] Which is something, regrettably, that cannot be  said of the Ground Forces as a whole, most of whose combined and  other units posted only satisfactory results in the last  training year. And other branches of the Armed Forces have not  turned in a brilliant performance, but put it bluntly.    [Golovnev] You are right there. But, given that this is no  worse than in 1992, when Russia announced the creation of its  own Armed Forces, and that the process of the decline in the  standard of combat training has nonetheless been halted,  then.... Incidentally, for me to predict some kind of  breakthrough in this area in the very near future would be, at  the very least, unprofessional.    [Miranovich] As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's mailbag shows, many people  see one of the reasons for what we could call the ailing state  of combat training in our Army as being that it is by no means  looked upon as a priority everywhere. Yet the regulations of  the Russian Federation Armed Forces' Internal Service -- in  whose elaboration you participated, incidentally -- stated that  combat training "is the main component of the everyday activity  of servicemen in peacetime." It also stipulates that  proceedings will be instituted against commanders (chiefs)  guilty of taking personnel away from exercises. What can you  say about this?    [Golovnev] Do you think that officers just take personnel  away from exercises at their own discretion? Yes, there are  cases when personal interests hamper some people in the  performance of their duties. And they receive a principled  assessment -- as provided for by the regulations. I can name a  number of officers who have paid a high price for this.    But let's call a spade a spade -- the reason why personnel  are taken out of planned combat training is primarily due to  manpower levels, which compel commanders to divert considerable  amounts of forces and resources to ensure the everyday activity  of combined and other units. The destruction of existing  economic ties has sharply complicated the organization of  material provision for the training process. The quality of  training is suffering owing to the untimely elaboration and  delivery by the Ministry of the Defense Industry of simulators  for new types of weapons and equipment. And the cost of  training has been rising considerably, since we have been forced  to use equipment already in service.    How soon will the situation change for the better? That  depends on how soon we all agree that a state's might is also  measured by the level of its Army training.    [Miranovich] Would anyone really take issue with that?    [Golovnev] It is hard to take issue with it. Consequently,  we have no shortage of statesmen who have been campaigning --  like Vladimir Shumeyko, speaker of the Federal Assembly's upper  house, has been doing in your newspaper (the 5 April issue --  G.M.) -- for the "Army to have everything as a priority."    But stating the truth is not enough. Army training and,  consequently, the might of the fatherland will not improve  because of that. The situation will change depending on how  soon the state can bring the Armed Forces up to full strength.  We need to be talking today not simply about replenishing the  thinning Army ranks with illiterate workers and peasants or  "ignoramuses" who had never studied or worked anywhere before  being drafted. It is a question of the need to revive the  intellectual level of the barracks, which is now lower in this  country than in the United States and some other NATO countries.  And that, you understand, will take more than just one draft  intake. And not only the draft intake....    A great deal will depend on how soon we introduce a viable  organizational and staffing structure for combined and other  units. On how soon our financing stops being dependent on all  kinds of chance circumstances. On how soon viable logistical  subunits appear in the forces. And so on and so forth.    In no way does this mean that we, the military, are beyond  reproach. We also need to look at how responsible and  conscientiously we approach the task in hand, how enterprising  we are, and so forth. Incidentally, commanders have now been  given a free hand, they are being allowed to plan the training  process with an eye to local conditions.    It is time to seriously deal with the problems of combat  training within the framework of moral and psychological backup  for Armed Forces activity.    [Miranovich] Incidentally, this was intensively discussed at  the scientific and theoretical conference held recently at the  General Staff Academy.    [Golovnev] Yes, we need questing in this area. For  well-known reasons we currently, as before, have no powerful  ideological backup for combat training. At the same time, we  need to somehow highlight such philosophical and moral values as  the conviction of the need for a strong Russian state, and the  understanding that military men cannot make such a clear impact  anywhere in peacetime as they can in combat training.    [Miranovich] Perhaps we should learn from the West? After  all, many armies have already been through what we are currently  experiencing.    [Golovnev] A great deal has changed in our relationships  with  Western armies, including NATO armies. We have more contact.  For instance, last year students from the United States and  France visited the Moscow Combined Arms College. Students from  the St. Petersburg Higher Combined Arms Command College hosted  their counterparts from Belgium, and are now getting ready to  travel there themselves on an exchange. Officers from Sweden  are studying in a number of our academies. There are also  direct contacts with the troops. The most vivid example is  probably the exercises due in June between the headquarters of  our 27th Motorized Rifle Division and the U.S. 3d Infantry  Division -- preparations for which are now actively in hand.    What does this experience show? It can be said that the  general trend in Armed Forces combat training in the leading  states is now to reduce (the figures are cited -- G.M.) the  number of large-scale exercises and maneuvers involving actual  forces.    We are striving to do the same thing. For instance, we now  plan no more than two exercises a year with companies and  battalions. One of those will be a live-fire exercise.  Regimental and divisional exercises are not held annually, as  used to be the case, but biennially. But....    Whereas, so to speak, we have been forced into this, the  NATO  Joint Armed Forces command has different motives. It prefers to  resolve many traditional training tasks and to study the  questions of training and warfare under new geostrategic  conditions using automated battlefield modeling systems. How  effective are they? Judge for yourselves -- the use of automated  battlefield modeling terminals at fixed-site and field command  and control centers and during the U.S. "Certain Caravan"  exercises in Europe made it possible to carry out large-scale  military operations involving around 200,000 servicemen and more  than 25,000 units of armored equipment.    [Miranovich] Do we have nothing similar?    [Golovnev] What is annoying is that we do [to-to i obidno,  chto yest]. Our laser firing and engagement simulators  [lazernyye imitatory strelby i porazheniya] have proved their  worth superbly. They make it possible to simulate fire from  tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and small arms, and to record  "kills" on both sides in two-sided field training exercises.  But for all this to work and for the reduction in the number of  very costly live-fire exercises (figures for 1991 cited -- G.M.)  not to be to the detriment of troop training, we need a  comprehensively automated tactical training system.    The Americans use such a system at their specialized  training  centers. We also have one in the pipeline, so to speak. With  its help the training process could be made immeasurably  cheaper. But, once again, it all depends on money.    [Miranovich] Anatoliy Andreyevich, the retargeting of the  Armed Forces -- if I can put it that way -- to focus on  resolving the new tasks stemming from the new  military-political, geostrategic, and other realities will  require, apart from anything else, a corresponding theoretical  basis for their training. For instance, special tactical  leadership had to be developed for the joint command-post  exercise between Russian and U.S. peacekeeping forces to which  you referred. And what about our field manuals, which are also  probably obsolete, and other documents regulating troop  training? After all, different types of training are clearly  needed for men in ordinary divisions and peacekeeping divisions,  for new recruits and experienced specialists, for men entering  service under contract, and for women....    [Golovnev] Yes, our current field manuals have been in  operation since 1989. But I would not say that they were  hopelessly outdated. After all, changes in tactics are, as is  well known, the result of certain breakthroughs in technical  development, and are a kind of reaction to certain innovations  in armed combat systems. If we proceed on this basis, then the  current manuals can still be used for training -- which is,  indeed, what practice shows. At the same time, directives have  been issued making certain clarifications connected with Armed  Forces reform and the change of normative acts on defense issues  -- specifically to Part 1 (divisions, brigades, regiments) of  the Ground Forces Field Manual. The chapters entitled  "Foundations of the Soviet Military Doctrine" and "Political  Work" have been removed from the manual. A chapter entitled  "Moral and Psychological Backup" has been brought in, along with  clarifications connected with certain aspects of provision. The  place and role of new Ground Force formations -- motorized rifle  and tank brigades -- in combined-arms combat have been defined.  Normative indicators have been set for them. Moreover, it has  been decided to rework formal documents containing regulations  in 1994-1995 -- something that a special commission is currently  at work on.    As for the features of training different categories of  servicemen, here we proceed on the basis of a single ultimate  goal -- the readiness of subunits to fulfill their combat  mission in all types of combat irrespective of the manpower  acquisition principle used. Individual training has been  introduced for those serving under contract. One or two days a  month are given over to it. It is worth noting that the  planning for individual training also takes account of the level  of subunits' training, questions on which further work should be  done, and...requests from the contract servicemen themselves.  Individual training exercises mainly employ drills, group  exercises, and practical work.    As to women.... There is nothing special about their  training. They train according to their speciality within a  subunit or training group. In other words, however  heterogeneous the military may be, the aim of training remains  unchanged -- to teach people what they need in warfare.  <H5>  Comparative Description of Intensity of Exercises Staged </H5> Under NATO Joint Armed Forces Plans in 1989-1993    Venue           1989        1990        1991        1992        1993   Northern        56          41          35          31          20  European  Theater   Central         58          70          58          46          38  European  Theater   Southern        52          47          35          42          42  European  Theater   Total in        166         158         128         119         100  European  Theater    <H5>  Comparative Cost of Tactical Exercises (in Thousands of </H5> Rubles)    Description of Exercise                      1991   Battalion-level tactical exercise            134.3  involving a motorized-rifle battalion and  a tank company (live-fire)   Regimental tactical exercise involving a     1,231  tank division tank regiment (live-fire)   Divisional tactical exercise involving a     5,926  motorized-rifle division (live fire by  motorized-rifle and tank regiments)      Note: In subsequent years the cost of the exercises rises in  line with the price increases for fuel, lubricants, and  ammunition.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Dealings in Cabra suspended at 2p SHARES IN Cabra Estates, the property company that owns two London football grounds, were yesterday suspended at 2p, pending clarification of its financial position. The move, likely to lead to the appointment of receivers, followed demands by two of Cabra's banks on Monday for repayment of their loans. The decision added further confusion to long-running negotiations about the grounds used by Chelsea and Fulham football clubs. Cabra had been hopeful it would soon conclude talks to sell the grounds. Chelsea said yesterday's announcement would have no impact on its negotiations for the acquisition of the grounds. 'We have been kept closely informed of the situation between Cabra and its bankers,' the club said. Negotiations were expected to 'be satisfactorily concluded in the near future,' it added. Fulham Football Club, which is due to move next May when its lease expires on the Craven Cottage site, said its position would not necessarily be improved if Cabra went into receivership. The future of Craven Cottage was up to its eventual owner, the club said. Cabra said it was surprised by its banks' decision to demand repayment of their loans. At an extraordinary meeting last Friday, Cabra said it hoped talks on debt restructuring and sale of the football grounds would soon be resolved. 'These demands (for repayment of debt) were totally unexpected,' said Mr Gordon Young, chairman of Cabra. 'As constructive negotiations had continued up to the EGM on Friday and no indication had been received of this precipitative action,' Demand notices for debt repayment were issued by Midland Bank and The Royal Bank of Scotland, which has a charge over the football grounds. They have been in debt restructuring talks for 10 months. In the year to March, Cabra incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 22.1m. Its net assets fell to less than half the called-up share capital of Pounds 24m.</p>

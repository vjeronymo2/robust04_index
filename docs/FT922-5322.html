			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / International Company News: Banesto, BP may resolve stake dispute AN ATTACK by British Petroleum on the accounts of one of Spain's biggest banks, Banesto, failed to materialise at a shareholders meeting in Madrid on Saturday, leading to speculation that a row between the two would soon be resolved. The differences between the two companies, leading to several sharp exchanges, centre on a 2.6 per cent stake in Banesto held by BP which the UK oil group claims Banesto should repurchase. BP has had the stock since it bought Banesto's oil refiner, Petromed, last year. At the time Petromed held the 2.6 per cent of its parent and BP thought it was understood Banesto would buy this stake back. But Banesto, due to falling profits at the Corporacion, has been loathe to do so, especially as BP has been trying to ensure it paid something similar to the price the stock was worth when the Petromed sale was completed. Since then, Banesto stock has fallen about 30 per cent. Mr Conde announced consolidated group net profits - including the Corporacion - of Pta52.3bn for 1991 (Dollars 523m) , a 7.29 per cent fall on 1990. This was largely due to the Corporacion profits falling from Pta18.9bn to just Pta3.8bn. At Banesto bank, 1991 net profits rose 14.3 per cent to Pta45.6bn and its financial group (Banesto and affiliated banks) where pre-tax profits increased 25.7 per cent to Pta74.8bn.</p>

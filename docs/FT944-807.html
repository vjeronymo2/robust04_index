			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Thorn EMI sells Defence Group to Thomson-CSF Thorn EMI, the music and rentals company, is to sell Defence Group, part of its electronics division, to Thomson-CSF of France for Pounds 15m cash. The sale, which is subject to regulatory and other approvals, marks an important step towards Thorn's goal of ending losses in its electronics division. The disposal is expected to be completed at the end of February and to result in a pre-tax exceptional gain of Pounds 3m. Thorn's shares closed up 6p at Pounds 10.19. Defence Group's turnover is about Pounds 80m - roughly 40 per cent of Thorn EMI Electronics - and its main activities are manufacturing fuses for missiles and shells and electro-optics. It has about 970 employees. Thomson-CSF is expected to continue to operate the missile and ordnance fusing business from the existing plant at Blyth Road, Hayes, Middlesex under the name of Thomson Thorn Missile Electronics. The electro-optical business will become part of Pilkington Optronics, a joint venture between Thomson-CSF and Pilkington and will operate under the Pilkington Thorn Optronics banner. Thorn's defence sensor activities, which are based at Crawley, West Sussex, and Wells, Somerset, and the microwave devices business at Hayes are not included in the agreement with Thomson. Last month, Thorn EMI announced that it was in talks with Racal Electronics over the sale of the defence sensors business which employs 1,140 people and had turnover of about Pounds 75m last year. Thorn has also sold its electronic security business. The sale of both the defence and sensors businesses will end losses in the electronics division which totalled Pounds 13.5m last year. Once the sales are completed, Thorn will only be left with its transaction ticketing operation outside its declared core areas. Preliminary talks on the ticketing business are also taking place. Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, has said that the company will concentrate on its music production, music retailing and rental operations.</p>

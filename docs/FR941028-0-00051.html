			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The above approach balances the concerns of the commenters. A blanket presumption of abatement for all NOV's_including those whose abatement period has expired_is inappropriate. It is entirely possible that there are NOV's with expired abatement periods for which cessation orders have not yet been written. To presume that such NOV's are abated is unjustified. At the same time, today's final rule recognizes that, until the abatement period has expired, diligent operators should have the opportunity to correct their NOV's in a timely manner without being subjected to permit denial during the period of abatement if they certify that such violations are in the process of abatement. State regulatory authorities can conserve limited resources by having the benefit of a reasonable presumption of NOV abatement which applies to those NOV's which are in a true state of uncertainty with respect to abatement. In considering whether a particular NOV should be the basis for permit denial, State regulatory authorities will also have the comfort of certification by the applicant and the protection of conditional issuance to assure that any representations made with respect to NOV abatement are actually fulfilled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM recognizes that some large companies may not be aware of all NOV's whose abatement periods have not expired where such NOV's are cited against one or more of their many subsidiaries. Nevertheless, OSM expects that companies will make a good faith effort to track their NOV's and report such NOV's as part of permit applications. Where a company has developed a good faith NOV tracking procedure and, in the diligent exercise of such procedure, has inadvertently failed to report an NOV whose abatement period has not yet expired, such failure would not constitute willful nondisclosure by the company. On the other hand, where a company fails to set up a tracking procedure or where a company sets up a tracking procedure or corporate structure designed or intended to shield it from knowledge of NOV's or the ability to track NOV's this will not excuse a company's failure to accurately report NOV's in permit applications. Further, OSM expects that any certifications of ongoing correction provided with respect to NOV's be based upon truthful information and be submitted in good faith. To the extent that a company asserts that it cannot certify because it is not certain whether all violations have been identified, the presumption of NOV abatement would not apply. OSM recognizes that companies may assert this argument, but OSM considers the certification necessary to assure that violations are in the process of being corrected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated above, the second issue in the proposed rule which generated significant comments was the proposed safe harbor for the owners or controllers of delinquent civil penalties for violations issued prior to October 3, 1988. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters from the coal industry and the States criticized the safe harbor proposal because it required, as a condition precedent for safe harbor treatment, that reclamation be completed within 120 days after the effective date of the rule. These commenters asserted that this proposed condition limiting the availability of safe harbor protection was inadequate and insufficiently flexible. They argued that the proposal did not take into account the time required to perform reclamation and the potential for reclamation to be effected by changing events and environmental conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, commenters representing the environmental community also criticized the safe harbor provision. These commenters criticized the proposed $750 settlement amount as arbitrarily and artificially low. Commenters representing the State regulatory authorities asserted that the proposed penalty amount provided insufficient flexibility and that a State regulatory authority should be able to demand a greater penalty if the circumstances warrant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the industry and the States focused upon the limited window of time available to perform abatement and the environmentalists and the States questioned the limited penalty amount, all of these commenters seemed to share the view, subject to their particular and differing perspectives, that the proposed safe harbor provision was artificial and unnecessarily rigid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon consideration of the comments, OSM agrees that the proposal was unnecessarily rigid and has, therefore, not finalized the safe harbor proposal. Accordingly, regulatory authorities will have the discretion to review the totality of the facts on a case by case basis to determine whether a person who is linked, through ownership or control, to delinquent civil penalties may avoid permit block through payment of a portion of such penalties. OSM will review the adequacy of such settlements within the context of OSM's routine oversight of the State regulatory authorities under 30 CFR parts 732 and 733 and of case specific complaints and investigations under 30 CFR part 842. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kevin Barrington] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh, April 14 (AFP) -- A spokesman for the  radical Khmer Rouge in the Cambodian capital denied Thursday  reports that the guerrillas had retaken their former  headquarters at Pailin in northwest Cambodia.    "Pailin has not yet fallen into our hands, but it has  received heavy shelling from [words indistinct] artillery," the  Khmer Rouge spokesman, who requested anonymity, told AFP.    "Our troops are continuously moving towards Pailin," the  spokesman said from the radical faction's compound adjacent to  the capital's royal palace.    A police general in Battambang told AFP by telephone  Wednesday that the guerrillas were shelling Pailin, but added  that they were only firing two or three rounds a day to try and  "disturb our helicopters from landing."    The Khmer Rouge spokesman said the guerrillas rejected an  appeal from co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen for  a cease-fire so that both sides could enjoy the current Khmer  New Year festivities.    "How can we accept a cease-fire when they [words indistinct]  our necks and force our tongues out of our mouths and destroy  all our belongings in Pailin?" he said. "This is not the time  for celebrations."    Meanwhile, Prince Ranariddh denied Khmer Rouge claims that  guerrillas destroyed two government tanks in fighting around  Pailin.    "The Khmer Rouge did not destroy two government tanks," the  prince told reporters at a reception to welcome the new year  late Wednesday. "We destroyed two Khmer Rouge tanks that they  received from China a long time ago."    The tanks were destroyed near O'Lak, some 20 kilometers (12  miles) north of Pailin. The prince questioned the motivation of  those who claimed Pailin had fallen from the government's hands.    THE BANGKOK POST had quoted Thai army sources as saying that  the Khmer Rouge recaptured their former "capital" late Tuesday.    A Western diplomat, pointing to the recent heated exchanges  between Phnom Penh and Bangkok over Cambodia's allegations of  Thai military support for the Khmer Rouge, speculated that Thai  officers may have deliberately leaked the news to the press to  try to embarrass the government here.    General Nhoek Bun Chhai, deputy chief of the general staff,  said the Khmer Rouge, backed by four tanks attacked government  border police at O'Lak on Monday. "They came from Thailand and  they pushed our forces back one kilometer," he said. [Words  indistinct] were not yet known as the police retreated into the  jungle with a group of 17 fleeing into Thailand to seek refuge,  he said. The prince said the guerrillas attacked because they  thought O'Lak was an easy target.    "They knew that we thought that place was stable and they  knew there was just police based there. So they fought us," he  said.    Although the prince did not mention Thailand by name, he  backed the general's accusation when he said Wednesday that the  tanks attacked from somewhere "not inside Cambodian territory."    The prince acknowledged that the repeated accusations of  Thai  assistance to the Khmer Rouge were causing aggravation in  Bangkok. "Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said his  patience was limited" the prince said, adding: "But [words  indistinct] is also limited."    The prince, however, said he wanted to have good relations  with Thailand and that fellow co-premier Hun Sen would soon  visit Bangkok to resolve "border problems." "His Excellency Hun  Sen, on behalf of the Royal Government will try again to let our  Thai friends know their duty according to the peace agreement,"  the prince said, referring to the 1991 Paris peace agreement  which brought a formal end to the Cambodian conflict and paved  the way for UN-organised elections in May last year.    "The agreement mentioned [words indistinct] that Cambodia's  three neighbouring countries must protect the sovereignty,  integrity and security of the country," he said.</p>

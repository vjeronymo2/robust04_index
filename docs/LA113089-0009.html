			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSEQUENCES OF PORNOGRAPHY  </P> <P> The commentary "The Consequences of Pornography Are Too Extensive to Ignore"  (Op-Ed Page, Nov. 12) is a blatant piece of misinformation. The authors managed  to link "child pornography" to "hard-core pornography" every time the latter  was mentioned. This was a simplistic attempt at guilt by association.  </P> <P> Cardinal Joseph Bernardin and the Rev. Eileen Lindner would have us believe  that the adult film industry produces mostly movies about child molestation,  rape, torture and murder. This is not true.  </P> <P> The vile films mentioned cater to a small underground of deranged consumers of  decadence and child abuse that dates back far beyond the Marquis de Sade. The  majority of adult films are produced for average men and women. These consumers  may be oversexed, sexually repressed or suffer from any one of scores of minor  sexual hang-ups, but they are not murderers, rapists or child molesters.  </P> <P> Of the two national commissions on pornography in the past 20 years, one found  absolutely no link between violence and pornography. The other was so biased by  right-wing pseudo-moralists that almost half the commission rejected the  findings of the final report.  </P> <P> Bernardin and Lindner note that the Supreme Court has ruled that obscenity is  not protected by the First Amendment. They didn't mention that the vast  majority of adult films are not obscene, by the court's definition.  </P> <P> Hopefully, religious leaders will concentrate their energies on real dangers to  society -- poverty, war and unchecked capitalism -- and stay out of our  bedrooms.  </P> <P> RICHARD CHAPLIN  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

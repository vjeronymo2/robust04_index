			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Victor Manuel Rebolledo, the minister secretary  of government designate, yesterday pointed out that U.S.  authorities are favorably disposed toward incorporating Chile  into NAFTA.    "The time is ripe for the Clinton administration to propose  that Chile join NAFTA and for the U.S. Congress to put the  approval of such a proposal on the `fast track' [preceding two  words in English]," he stressed.    Rebolledo explained that pursuant to U.S. domestic  regulations, the executive branch must submit for Congress'  approval the names of the countries with which the United States  intends to sign a free trade agreement.    He moreover stated that both nations might initiate  negotiations on this issue during the second half of this year.    In any case, the minister-designate -- a PPD [Party for  Democracy] deputy at present -- asserted that Chile is deemed  the "natural candidate to sign a free trade agreement with the  United States."    Rebolledo reported that this was one of the main  achievements  of the recent trip he made to the United States at the  invitation of the U.S.-Chilean Chamber of Commerce.    Besides his scheduled activities with U.S. businessmen  having  an interest in Chile, Rebolledo took advantage of his stay in  the United States to meet with government officials. [passage  omitted]    Upon being asked about a possible visit to the United States  by Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle once he assumes office as president,  Rebolledo noted that in order for the new president to do so, he  needs to be officially invited by the U.S. Government first.    Notwithstanding this, he said that in view of what he  noticed  during his contacts with U.S. Government officials, the Clinton  administration might "be planning to have the president visit  the United States during the course of this year." [passage  omitted]    Rebolledo further stated that U.S. Vice President Al Gore  has  proposed holding a hemispheric summit meeting during the second  half of this year which would be attended by all the heads of  state from the Americas.    He remarked that he hopes that Chile will be able to play an  important role both in the arrangement and the development of  this summmit.</p>

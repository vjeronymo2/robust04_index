			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Arts: The Seven Streams of the River Ota - Edinburgh Festival Nietzsche famously compared Wagner's music with the heartbeat of a slug. The comparison occurs throughout Robert Lepage's production of The Seven Streams of the River Ota in its world premiere production at Edinburgh's Meadowbank Sports Centre. Teething troubles in rehearsal and changes up to the last minute suggest that tightening and sharpening are still possibilities. Certainly this ambitious triptych represents slender substance monumentally swamped by style. Slowness is less a matter of pace than focus and rhythm, both of which are as yet lacking. Though the piece's conception is attributed to the largely French-Canadian company, Lepage is both director and designer, so must take responsibility for the priorities (visual over narrative) that deaden the theatrical impact. This is all the more tantalising when one remembers his production of the the opera double-bill, Erwartung and Bluebeard's Castle, that was rightly the hit of last year's Edinburgh Festival. But then a musical score imposes its own time limits and emotional climaxes. Seven Streams opens with young Pierre arriving in Hiroshima to study calligraphy. He finds lodgings with the laconic Jana, misses his girl-friend, meets Jana's operatic soprano acquaintance (and possibly lover), and tumbles to the fact that Walter from the Canadian consulate is a philandering lecher. The dialogue is less spare than stilted, thanks to the cast's variable command of English; and the puppet prologue that recounts the accidental discovery of gunpowder by herbalists seeking an aphrodisiac for an aged emperor strikes the production's keynote of exquisite portentousness. The central act focuses on Jana: Czech, Jewish, at the age of 11 she is in Theresienstadt - Terezin, that transit camp that the Nazis made a showcase for writers, artists and performers for the benefit of the Red Cross and the world's newsreels. She befriends an opera singer who hangs herself after heavily hinting at parallels with Madam Butterfly. Escaping the death camps, the adult Jana finds herself in Bohemian squalor in a brave new transatlantic world. After dabbling in pornography and drugs she meets, by an amazing coincidence, the daughter of the dead opera-singer, herself a soprano. The play's third section returns to the present. The attempt to tie up loose ends overlooks the fact that the ends themselves are not attached to anything. The sudden switch to backstage bitchiness (Pierre's actress girlfriend arrives on tour) and French bedroom farce (coupling on the rebound) leaves us cold since nothing in the previous three and a half hours has made us like or believe in these lifelessly manipulated pawns. Attempts to add depth and resonance - the present-day action is set in Hiroshima, 'city of catastrophe and survival'; the visiting theatre company performs a great chunk of Mishima's Madame de Sade - further clog the work's texture; and Lepage's preoccupation with cultural cross-fertilisation diffuses rather than concentrates. There remains the visual element: Japanese sliding walls, film projections, layered mirrors that send their images into infinity - none notably remedying the lack of urgency and tenuous dramatic thread. The programme lists the company without allocating roles. Interesting to see Rebecca Blankenship, the soprano from last year's Erwartung, bring a Jerry Hall elegance to both singers, squally in Dvorak and propulsive in Puccini. The younger Jana (Marie Brassard) is touching, the older one stalks dumpily around in dark glasses like Bette Davis OD-ing on carbo-hydrates. Sponsorship by Beck's suggests consolation in the two intervals.</p>

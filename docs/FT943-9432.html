			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Ratifying EU agreements The European Union is in a mess over ratification of its international agreements. This week the European Court of Justice has ruled that an antitrust agreement between the European Commission and the US government is void. More seriously, there is disagreement over how to ratify the Uruguay Round. The EU must find a way of resolving these disputes in ways that allow it to play its role on the global stage. Underlying both controversies are the vexed issues of EU-versus-member-state competence, and member-state suspicion of the Commission's ambitions. Nobody doubts the need to ratify the Uruguay Round agreement. The question rather is how. But if it is not answered sufficiently swiftly, ratification may be delayed until next year. In that case, the EU might not be a founder member of the World Trade Organisation. Worse, delay on this side of the Atlantic might encourage delay on the other, increasing the risk that the whole process will go awry. The Commission argues that it should be possible to ratify the Uruguay agreement under article 228 of the Maastricht treaty. Parliament will then have powers, similar to those of the US Congress, to vote yea or nay on the package. Parliament's new role, however distasteful to some, has not been challenged by member states. Nor do they seem to have a basis for doing so. It is also agreed between the Commission and member states that, whatever the technical requirements, ratification should be unanimous. In some cases, this will require consent by national parliaments. Divisive issue The divisive issue is what other treaty articles should provide the basis for ratification. The Commission argues for Article 113 alone, which gives it sole negotiating power under the common commercial policy. But member states insist that the Uruguay Round covers articles in the treaty where competence is divided between the EU and member states. Those other articles relate, in particular, to services, transport and intellectual property. As yet, the member states have reached no consensus on which legal basis to adopt. But the Commission has already asked the Court of Justice for a ruling on the question, arguing that this is vital not so much for ratification, as for the EU's subsequent role within the WTO. If there were no assignment of competence to the EU, argues the Commission, it would be unable to negotiate effectively. This would create disorder within the WTO and frustration among the EU's trading partners. Against this, member states insist that the EU lacks not just the exclusive competence claimed by the Commission, but still more such competence in new areas on the WTO agenda, like labour standards and the environment. Divided competence is inescapable. The solution is to make it possible for the EU to negotiate effectively, without the member states conceding powers it lacks. Compromise required A compromise is required, not least because the Court is unlikely to reach its decision before November. Member states are proposing a code of conduct that would govern negotiations in areas of divided competence. The code would grant the Commission its role as sole negotiator on matters covered by the WTO. Such a code of conduct could be agreed as early as September. Thereupon, the Commission should withdraw its application to the Court. The question of the legal allocation of competence in controversial areas should then be left to member states at the inter-governmental conference due in 1996. The Commission cannot claim sole EU competence for all matters that might fall under the WTO. What it can - indeed must - insist upon is the power to negotiate effectively. Member states now blame the Commission for the delay in ratification. This is somewhat unfair, since the issue of competence is important. But it must not be resolved legalistically. The powers granted to the Commission under Article 113 are sweeping, while the areas covered by the WTO are sensitive. To insist that all of the latter already fall under the former is bound to exacerbate suspicion of the Commission. What is needed is an operationally effective compromise - and early ratification of the Uruguay Round. The German presidency should do everything it can to achieve both.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Paris, Bonn discuss EU strategy: Plans for two presidencies Leaders of Germany and France will meet today to move their traditional European partnership into even higher gear to co-ordinate their successive presidencies of the European Union over the next year. At their two-day meeting in the Alsatian border town of Mulhouse, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and President Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of France will plan their joint approach to next month's EU summit in Corfu and to Germany's presidency in the second half of this year and France's in the following six months. Mr Kohl and Mr Mitterrand were reported over the weekend by the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper to have already decided that at Corfu they will back Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as European Commission president. In Paris an official would only comment that 'from our praise of Belgium's performance in the presidency' in the second half of last year 'you can see where our heart lies'. In Bonn, rumours that the Delors succession might be deliberately kept open for Mr Kohl to fill if he lost his October election were discounted, partly because this would leave the European Parliament insufficient time to use its Maastricht rights to endorse the new commissioners. According to the Elysee spokesman, the two countries are to set up a high-level working party to ensure 'perfect co-ordination' of EU business between July 1 this year and June 30 next year. Among other things, this will involve: France falling in with Germany's desire for the EU to open more to the east, in return for Germany's backing for French initiatives towards North Africa, and particularly Algeria, whose official debt is expected to be rescheduled in Paris next week. Germany would like Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk to come to Corfu to sign EU co-operation treaties with Russia and Ukraine, a wish that French complaints about Russia 'dumping' enriched uranium on its market had looked like thwarting. But Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, used his recent trip to Russia to get a restraint agreement that still needs endorsement by his EU partners. France and Germany have also been negotiating with Mr Kravchuk a plan for western aid to stop further work, and radiation leaks, at Chernobyl nuclear plant and to fund completion of less dangerous Ukraine reactors. An attempted compromise on economic growth and trade issues. Both governments seem agreed that the eastward expansion of high-speed rail should figure in the list of EU-backed infrastructure projects being prepared for Corfu, though Germany remains more sceptical than France of the Commission 'behaving like a bank' in financing these. In advance of the G7 summit in July, France wants German support for the new World Trade Organisation to debate minimum labour standards. Improvements to the EU post-Maastricht. To France, this chiefly means better foreign policy co-ordination, and possibly a Western European Union arms agency; progress on an initial, bilateral Franco-German weapons procurement agency will be reviewed at Mulhouse. Germany, currently president of the Schengen organisation to reduce border controls, is keener on faster progress on common immigration and crime policies.</p>

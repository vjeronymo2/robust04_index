			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Qu Yingpu: "Both Freight and Passenger Transportation </F> Dipping"]    [Text] Transportation kept losing ground in November with  freight volume dipping again after a short revival the previous  month, according to the latest statistics from the State  Statistics Bureau.    Freight transport volume in the first 11 months of 1993  dropped by 0.1 percent over the corresponding 1992 period, a  decrease from the 0.1 percent rise in the first 10 months of the  year. However, the dip is smaller than the 0.2-percent drop in  the first three quarters and a 0.3-percent shrink in the first  eight months, a report from the bureau said.    Passenger transportation in the period, however, dropped by  11 percent, representing a bigger decrease compared with the  10.9- percent dip in the first 10 months and the 10-percent drop  in the first nine months, the report said.    Freight transport volume stood at 2.515 billion tons in the  first 11 months.    Of the total, rail freight inched up 2.2 percent to 1.43  billion tons, while truck freight fell 8.4 percent to 505  million tons.    Freight by boat climbed by 2.5 percent to 579 million tons,  while air freight soared 21.6 percent to 633,000 tons.    Freight turnover in the January to November period--an  important indicator in monitoring unit labour productivity and  economic efficiency--witnessed a limited increase of 2.3 percent  to 2.3 trillion ton-kilometres (One ton-kilometre is one ton of  cargo transported one kilometre.) Of the total, railways  reported a 2.9- percent rise to 1.08 trillion ton-kilometres,  while truck freight turnover fell 16 percent to 27.766 billion  ton-kilometres.    Air freight turnover generated 1.569 billion ton-kilometres,  up 20.2 percent, and boat freight turnover climbed 2.1 percent  to 1.2 trillion ton-kilometres.    Total passenger volume stood at 4.576 billion in the first  11  months, the report said.    Volume breakdown shows 962 million people travelled by rail,  up 6.1 percent, while 3.422 billion travelled by buses, down  15.2 percent.    Some 161 million people travelled by boat, down 8.1 percent,  while 31.2 million people flew, up 17.6 percent.    The passenger turnover in the first 11 months reported a  0.8-  percent growth to 511.421 billion person-kilometres.    Of the total, passenger turnover by rail went up 11 percent  to 320.888 billion person-kilometres, while bus travel turnover  dived by 13.6 percent to 174.021 billion person-kilometres.    Boat travel turnover slid 2.5 percent to 16.508 billion  person- kilometres with air travel chalking up 20.2 percent to  42.981 billion person-kilometres.    In November alone, China's railways transported 125 million  tons of freight and 84 million passengers.</p>

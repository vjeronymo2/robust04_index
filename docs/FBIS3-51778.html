			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Vargas] </F>   [Text] The Authentic Liberal Party [PLA] yesterday  nominated Mireya Moscoso de Gruber for president, Arnulfo  Escalona for first vice president, and Jose Teran Sitton for  second vice president during the party's fourth national  convention in Chitre, Herrera Province.    Only six delegates, including Legislator Hernan Gnaeggi and  Luis Ramon Fabrega, abstained from voting in favor of the  presidential ticket proposed by convention leader Joaquin  Fernando Franco, who chaired the PLA meeting.    A total of 221 out of 257 delegates attended the convention,  which proceeded slowly after starting three hours late due to a  blackout. Franco said the process was slow "because we took the  utmost care to avoid having to face another challenge."    The convention delegates amended two articles of the party's  statutes and elected the National Executive Authority with  chairman Arnulfo Escalona, the members of the National Political  Authority, and the members of the Honor Court.</p>

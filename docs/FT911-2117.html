			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / A responsible remedy for UK decline In his Economic Viewpoint (this page, April 18) Samuel Brittan claimed that Labour's new programme is a return to the policies of the 1960s, was contemptuous even of the idea of policies for industry, and, astonishingly, attacked the importance Labour attaches to the best training qualifications for young people. 'Can you imagine Isambard Kingdom Brunel bothering to acquire an NVQ (national vocational qualification)? Would he have passed if he had tried?' he asked. First Brittan on Brunel: far from being a self-made man Brunel enjoyed the most thorough of educations. He was sent to a carefully selected school in Normandy; then to the Lycee Henri IV in Paris (the foremost mathematical college of its day); then on to an apprenticeship with a leading designer of scientific instruments. Of course a hands-off-everything enthusiast for liberal economics would have preferred him to have sat up late at home with borrowed books, tinkering in the garden shed and then blossoming to genius without access to the market-distorting influences of a national institution of higher technical learning, but the facts are all against this view. Just as Mr Brittan is wrong about the importance of education to Brunel, he is wrong too - unlike industry itself and our competitors - about the importance of education and training to the economy. The NCVQ - which unifies a disparate and confusing jumble of qualifications - may not succeed in discovering a hundred future Brunels in Brixton and Birmingham. But it offers young people all over the UK a better chance than ever before of reaching a nationally recognised level of training comparable to the education they might - in many cases ought to - have received if they had stayed at school. Labour's argument is that in the late 20th century, when education and training are even more important to industry than in the early 19th, Britain is slipping dangerously behind its competitors. Inventions can be bought across frontiers: only rarely can skills. Where the wealth of nations, and their competitive advantages, used to depend on raw materials, and on the inventions of a few, it now depends more and more on the skills, adaptability and collective effort of the many and it is by the application of technology through a skilled workforce that countries will succeed. To trust the market simply as a matter of ideology and to imply that there is no skills gap that industry, left to itself and the working of the invisible hand, cannot solve on its own, is quite wrong. The evidence of our deficiencies in training are there for all to see. Yet despite all the experience of more successful economies we still hear the argument that government does best when government does nothing: likewise that there is no technological challenge the free market cannot normally solve on its own; no long-term investment gap that needs any action by government; and of course no long-term problem of regional imbalance that cannot be settled by waiting until free market neglect begets free market opportunity. Yet, as the recent economic achievements of Germany, Japan and France demonstrate, the facts are otherwise. The view that government should do nothing is as obsolete as its opposite, that the government can and should do everything. Nineteenth-century theories of competition have a diminishing relevance to the 21st century search for competitiveness. For there is clearly a national interest in working to achieve the best technology and training - something which goes beyond the particular interest of one employer and which cannot be left solely to the hazards of the market on its own. Mr Brittan accuses Labour of being trapped in the past; it is in fact Mr Brittan who has failed to break out of the past, unwilling to recognise that the starting point of Labour's approach is that neither the tired ideology of crude free market dogma nor that of the command economy has any residual relevance. So when Mr Brittan argues that 'it is not possible for a market economist to support Labour with a straight face', he fails to appreciate that the difference between the Labour and Conservative parties is not over the importance of markets but in Labour's recognition of their limitations and governments' corresponding responsibilities. Mr Brittan fails to mention the significance our new policy programme accords to stability in macroeconomic policy - a far cry from the stop-go economics which have bedevilled our country with two deep recessions despite the opportunities of North Sea oil; nor the importance we attach to membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Within these disciplines the job of government is not to replace decision-making in industry but to work with industry to meet common objectives - the specific tasks of improving our skills, upgrading our technological capabilities, encouraging long-term investment and ensuring regionally balanced economic growth. Our document is quite specific in rejecting 'indiscriminate subsidies or second-guessing industry'. Indeed the public interest is not in politicians trying to make decisions that companies must make - as in our encouragement of technology trusts, universities and industry, and of a national training strategy locally delivered - but in ensuring that specific tasks vital to our long-term economic effort are accomplished. Mr Brittan's examination of our document has been so cursory that he misnames the National Investment Bank as a Board and misunderstands its role, which is to bring together the public and private sectors with a view to encouraging new infrastructure investment. Our Manufacturing Investment Initiative is not simply designed to end what many agree has been discrimination against manufacturing through 12 years of neglect; it recognises that a modern industrial economy, and the vitality of the service sector within it, requires modern manufacturing strength. Britain has lost more manufacturing capacity than any other western European country in the last 12 years, falling near the bottom of the manufacturing growth league. To affirm manufacturing's importance is not to yearn irrationally for a bygone industrial age but to recognise what our competitors understand: that it is the principal trading part of the economy. Services and manufacturing are not starkly exclusive alternatives: they complement each other and feed on each other's success. If Labour is so wrong, Mr Brittan must explain why so many overseas governments of all complexions have pursued similar policies with success and now regard what we say as commonplace and non-controversial. And if he agrees with the policies of his one-time co-author, the current industry secretary, he must also explain why at the end of 12 years of Conservative government we have had the worst series of trade deficits in our history, a contraction of industrial capacity as Britain slips further behind, and now the fastest-rising unemployment in western Europe. The author is Labour's shadow trade and industry secretary</p>

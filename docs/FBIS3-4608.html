Korea  was initially scheduled to submit its country schedule to GATT  on February 15 but has since been delaying its submission as the  United States and Japan locked horns over the issue of  abolishing tariffs on some products.    While delaying the submission of its country schedule, Korea  has come under strong pressure from opposition political parties  and the general public to reopen negotiations on the concluded  Uruguay Round trade accord. On the surface, the government  rules out the possibility of reopening GATT talks, saying the  U.S. and Japan will submit their country schedules shortly after  resolving the tariff problem.    Government officials say the latest trade friction between  Washington and Tokyo won't escalate into such a point where last  December's GATT accord will be nullified. The trade friction  between the two countries emerged as Japan backed down from its  earlier promises in the Uruguay Round of trade talks by  proposing withdrawing tariff concessions in its country schedule.    After Japan committed itself to withdrawing its earlier  tariff concessions on imported wood products, the U.S. made a  similar action by revoking its promise to abolish tariffs on  some imported electronic products including semiconductors.    As the two countries are locked in a battle over the tariff  problem, Korea is now withholding submitting its country  schedule, keeping a close watch on how the U.S. and Japan act.  But the government's "cautious action" has aroused public  opinion urging the government to consider reopening talks on  last December's GATT accord.    A call for reopening GATT talks is gaining strong momentum  as  last December's accord is accepted as unsatisfactory, especially  in the field of farm trade in which Korea was obligated to open  its rice market to imported goods for the first time in its  history.    Reopening GATT talks has emerged as a political issue after  Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang hinted at the possibility of  reopening GATT talks at the ongoing extraordinary session of the  National Assembly only on the condition that the world's  economic powers withdraw their already-promised concessions.  But officials at the Economic Planning Board [EPB] are  skeptical about the possibility that the entire textbook of last  December's GATT accord will be nullified.    "The latest trade battle between Washington and Tokyo is  nothing but a tempest in a teacup and won't put the whole GATT  accord at jeopardy," an EPB official said. The official said  Korea will take similar action to what the other economic powers  do.    "If the U.S. and Japan withdraw their tariff concessions,  Korea will also revoke its earlier promise to abolish tariffs on  imported semiconductors and copper," he said. But most  government officials say it will be all but impossible to  rewrite the textbook on world farm trade, an issue in which  Koreans have keen interest.    "Only when other countries try to revise the farm trade  accord, will we consider taking similar action, but at the  moment no one is trying to do so," the EPB said.</p>

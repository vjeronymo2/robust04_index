			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Cutting coal IN ARGUING for the privatisation of British Coal ministers are at their most convincing when they say the state is ill-equipped to run the industry. The dead hand of the centre has rarely been more debilitating than now, as British Coal prepares to move within 18 months to the private sector. The problems stem from the white paper that the government was forced to publish in March in response to the public outcry last year over its proposed pit closure programme. This provided a reprieve for 12 of the 31 condemned pits, but did nothing effective to create the market on which their survival depended. The long-term future of the 12 was always doubtful. Miners at two of them have already voted for closure, and hope has all but evaporated for the remaining 10. Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, admitted as much last week and again yesterday. Also at risk, although he did not say it, are at least another four of British Coal's 19 'core pits'. So what is keeping them all open? Officially British Coal is still conducting the 'market testing' exercise designed to see if it can sell more coal to the electricity generators and other potential buyers. The reality is that after six months the exercise has resulted in no extra sales and is unlikely to do so on anything like the scale required to save the 12 pits. The delay in closure announcements owes more to government concern over the political reaction than to market uncertainty. This is no longer acceptable. After more than a year of doubt, the 20,000 remaining miners and managers deserve to know if they have a future in the industry. Of course they want jobs, but they also want to know if they must now plan an alternative future. The gloom caused by the uncertainty is spreading even to the pits that are highly unlikely to close and affecting morale (though commendably, it seems, not yet productivity). The industry is producing nearly 1m tonnes a month more than it can sell; putting it on stockpiles merely increases the government's difficulties in finding a buyer to run the mines in the private sector. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade secretary, is back at his desk this week after his summer illness. He faces many difficult decisions, several of them in energy. His first should be to sanction the closure of the doomed pits.</p>

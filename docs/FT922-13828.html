			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Capital expenditure by chemical industry CAPITAL expenditure by the chemical industry fell 13 per cent in 1991 and will fall a further 10 per cent this year. The 1992 fall, predicted today by the Chemical Industry Association, is in spite of record sums being spent by the chemicals sector on environmental protection, and substantial amounts invested by the pharmaceuticals groups on research and development. The association warned that 1992 was going to be another tough year for the UK's chemical industry. Since January, little had happened to improve prospects of an economic recovery either internationally or domestically, it said. Moreover, high levels of debt, shortage of capital and the likelihood of continuing high levels of interest rates would mean that the projected recovery would be much slower than that after the recession between 1980 and 1981.</p>

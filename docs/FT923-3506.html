			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: James Beattie shows decline of 26% James Beattie, the Wolverhampton-based stores group, suffered a 26 per cent fall in profits, from Pounds 2.37m to Pounds 1.76m pre-tax, for the six months to July 31. The company blamed difficult trading conditions and a lack of customer spending. 'The continuing and obstinate refusal of the economy to shake off the inertia of the last two years remains an abiding frustration,' directors said. Turnover, excluding VAT, rose to Pounds 35.5m (Pounds 33m) reflecting increased selling space, but investment income fell to Pounds 1.04m (Pounds 1.38m). Earnings were 2.51p (3.4p) per share. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.4p.</p>

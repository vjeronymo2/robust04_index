			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Loans hope The prospect of more, and cheaper, fixed rate mortgage loans was held out this week by Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, as he announced changes to the way building societies can operate. But societies themselves were rather more doubtful that the rise in the ceiling on the amount of funds they can raise on the wholesale money markets would have that effect, at least in the short term. They did say, however, that the new powers which are planned - including the right to full ownership of a general insurance company - would enable them to compete more effectively. This suggests some benefits to customers in terms of pricing and services. Direct Line's entry into the mortgage market - albeit just as a pilot scheme at the moment - might also have a downward effect on pricing. In the Treasury's review of building societies' legislation, the other side of the coin from greater flexibility is greater accountability to members. Societies will soon have to give their members more information in the annual report and accounts. This will include such areas as payments to directors. Later, when the government finds time to legislate, the boards of societies will have to tell members at the next general meeting of any non-confidential take-over offers from organisations other than societies. Nelson also said that a government consultation paper to be issued in the autumn would look at other ways of making societies more accountable, such as reserving certain seats on boards for members' representatives.</p>

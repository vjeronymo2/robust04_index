			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Delors warns against 'germ' of nationalism THE European Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors, said yesterday that nationalism was a germ which could tear Europe apart again as it stood on the threshold of unity, Reuter reports from Aachen. 'One-sided nationalist policies are today a luxury nobody can afford, either politically or economically,' he said after receiving one of Germany's highest political awards, the Charlemagne Prize, for promoting European unity. He warned politicians against giving in to nationalist opportunism, which he said was rooted in fear of the future and would only destabilise Europe again if given free rein.</p>

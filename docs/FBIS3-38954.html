			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Asked what Greece would do if the permanent NATO  members today decided to use force in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said: We will not  allow the NATO base in Aktion to be used, we will withdraw the  Greek crew members from the AWACS [Airborne Warning And Control  System], and demand that no Balkan country participates in  military operations in the former Yugoslavia. Venizelos  stressed that this is the unanimous view of all political party  leaders; it was expressed at a meeting under President  Konstandinos Karamanlis on 10 May 1993.    Venizelos added: These positions are firm and our permanent  representative Ambassador Zafiropoulos will convey them to NATO.  We hope that a diplomatic solution to end this bloody war will  be found, that is, an immediate and viable solution.    Answering another question, Venizelos said Greece is not  willing to veto a decision on military operations because, as he  explained, the international common view would see Greece as  part of the Yugoslav crisis. The spokesman concluded: On the  contrary, the international community should realize that our  country is a factor of stability in the Balkans.</p>

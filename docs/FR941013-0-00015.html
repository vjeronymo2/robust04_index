			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter states that adopting separate rules for separate groupings of PW JT8D engine models in Docket Nos. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;72 and 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;83 is not justified since both address the same safety concern. In addition, separating into two separate rules also avoids a major rule classification and thereby reduces the economic impact of each separate action. The FAA does not concur. The FAA issues airworthiness directives based on product type design, not based on a failure mode, the result of a failure mode, or the description of a safety concern. Therefore, it is quite possible, as in this case, that more than one AD will address the same or very similar issues as they apply to more than one type design or more than one variant of a type design. In addition, in this case, each AD docket number cited by the commenter proposed to supersede an existing AD. Therefore, the AD's need to remain separate to maintain consistency with the superseded AD's in order to simplify the tracking of compliance by PW JT8D operators. Further, the economic impact of both rules combined would amount to approximately $51,000,000, which is far below the threshold for declaring a combined AD a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12886 or a significant rule under existing DOT regulatory policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA received several comments that state that the FAA should evaluate PW JT8D engine models separately to determine if all models require the proposed actions to be accomplished, or if some models can be exempted from compliance due to differences in design or demonstrated operational safety. The FAA does not concur. Design differences between the various PW JT8D engine models were evaluated and no significant differences, other than low pressure rotor speed in the higher rated engines, were revealed that could impact containment capability. The increased low pressure rotor speeds are protected for in the design of the higher rated engines with the addition of a turbine shield, and the historical event data does not indicate that these higher low pressure rotor speeds result in a greater number of uncontained failures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter states that an alternative to the compliance end date of December 31, 1998, should be expressed in hours and cycles, with performance required as whichever occur later, to accommodate low utilization operators. The FAA concurs. The FAA performed a risk analysis to determine the inspection interval requirements and hourly and cyclic equivalents to the compliance end date were derived from that risk analysis. The FAA has added the hourly and cyclic equivalents to the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA received several comments that state that the compliance requirements should be revised to minimize economic impact due to major engine disassembly. Specifically, modification of the LPT vane cluster assemblies and installation of the No. 6 bearing scavenge pump bracket bushing could entail major engine disassembly depending on the scope of work performed at the next shop visit occurring after the effective date of the AD. The FAA concurs in part. The FAA has determined that the modification of the LPT vane cluster assemblies can be accomplished at the next part access and still meet safety objectives. However, the compliance requirements for the installation of the No. 6 bearing scavenge pump bracket bushing is still required at the next shop visit to achieve the desired level of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

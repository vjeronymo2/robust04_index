			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Simplicity pays off for Alliance - John Authers reports on the strategy behind a Scottish success story / Investment Trusts A COMPANY set up to lend money to sugar planters on the Sandwich Islands does not sound like a prudent home for a small investor's money. Neither, in the present economic climate, does a fund to invest in the debt of American railway companies. But the Alliance and Second Alliance trusts, based in Dundee, Scotland, sprang from these origins and have in recent years provided exactly the kind of investment performance that most small shareholders crave. As their name implies, both were amalgamations of several land and mortgage trusts and they now follow an almost identical investment strategy. Alliance and Second Alliance also share the same offices and the same board. There is no overall management company to control marketing and administration, as both tasks are undertaken by the trusts themselves. With Dundonian frugality, this means costs take up only 0.2 per cent of total assets - the lowest of all investment trusts. Alliance and Second Alliance also have a simple capital structure and a conservative approach towards gearing. This does not appear to have affected performance. According to Micropal, Alliance has grown by 395 per cent over the 10 years to the beginning of this month, and Second Alliance by 412 per cent. This places them ninth and fifth respectively in the International General sector. Over five years Alliance is third, with growth of 137 per cent, and Second Alliance fourth on 131 per cent. They did this with a reassuringly broad geographical spread of investments. According to Lyndon Bolton, managing director of both trusts, the present asset allocation of Alliance includes 56 per cent in the UK, 9 per cent in the rest of Europe, 31 per cent in North America, only 1 per cent in Japan and 4 per cent elsewhere in the Far East. The cash holding, almost all in foreign currencies, is low at 4 per cent. This is a high weighting in the UK by historic standards but the trust, true to its origins, also has a strong exposure to North America. The emphasis of the company remains rooted in stock-picking and value investing, with broader asset allocation given lower prominence. The top 10 investments of Alliance, when last recorded, were split equally between the UK and the US. They were: Shell Transport &amp; Trading, Glaxo Holdings, Wal-Mart Stores (an American retailer), Philip Morris, Rentokil Group, Johnson &amp; Johnson, British Telecom, PepsiCo, British Gas and Merck. Second Alliance's top 10 are similar, the only differences being that BAT Industries and General Electric substitute for PepsiCo and Merck. Bolton makes no apologies for establishing long-term relationships with companies and making close contacts with their managements. He says: 'The people who can do the best job for the shareholders in a general trust or fund are the managers of very good companies. It's our job to try to get some added advantage by using changes in share valuation to add value.' Both trusts remain rooted in Dundee's business community. The weekly board meeting takes place in the company's offices there and all the board members live locally. Many of the private shareholders also live in the Dundee area. Alliance had 22,000 at last count, excluding those who invested only through nominees, via Peps or savings plans. This figure has increased substantially in recent years, mainly due to the trust's strong showing in performance tables. Bolton, who joined Alliance in 1964, became joint manager in 1978 and sole managing director in 1987. He says Dundee differs from London as an investment centre only in its slower pace of life. As far as he is concerned, the rest of the investment community moved south - Robert Fleming, who was to give his name to London's largest investment trust group, was a Dundee man on the board of one of the companies which merged to become Second Alliance. The Alliance companies remain true to the guiding principles of investment trusts and have achieved strong investment performance in a range of world markets. Key Facts. On February 9, Alliance had net assets of Pounds 931m and market capitalisation of Pounds 850m. Net asset value per share was 1847.6p and the share price was 1687p, making a discount of 8.6 per cent. Second Alliance had a discount of 8.5 per cent. The yield was 3.4 per cent. Board. Both trusts have the same boards. The executive directors are Bolton (also a director of the TSB Group, General Accident and Scottish Financial Enterprise); Gavin Suggett, an accountant who is deputy managing director; and Alan Young. Sir Robert Smith, the chairman since 1981, is a director of several large Scottish companies including Bank of Scotland, Edinburgh Investment Trust and Standard Life. The other directors are Christopher Blake, chairman of the Glenrothes Development Corporation; Sir Douglas Hardie, chairman of Grampian Television and a director of Clydesdale Bank, among other companies; Andrew Thomson, a director of DC Thomson; and Bruce Johnston, a director of companies including Mid Wynd International investment trust. Savings Scheme and Pep details. A savings scheme allows a minimum monthly purchase of Pounds 50. Charges are Pounds 1 a month for the normal purchase, plus broker's commission of 0.15 per cent and stamp duty of 0.5 per cent. Thanks to their high non-European content, neither trust qualifies for the full Pounds 6,000 annual Pep allowance - maximum investment per year is, therefore, only Pounds 1,500. The Alliance Pep allows investors to hold other individual equities as well, but fees for investing in the trust element are the same as for the savings scheme.</p>

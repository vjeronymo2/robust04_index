			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Still hot, but with dull patches - Jurek Martin in Washington forecasts some tighter games The World Cup is now 10 days old, and still it beguiles. In fact it beguiles so much that it is only right and proper to make the case that it is far too good to last. The beginning of the downhill slide appeared to have come last Thursday night when, after 16 matches, a goal-less draw finally took place. The fact that it was between South Korea and Bolivia, loved only by their mothers, and that there has not been one since, might seem to suggest an aberration, but there are other bits and pieces of evidence, m'lud. The earlier game that day - Italy vs Norway - was pretty dour stuff, too, obscured by the fact that the Azzurri eked out a 1-0 win while playing three-quarters of the game with only 10 men and without Roberto Baggio, withdrawn from the field in either the bravest or dumbest coaching decision of the World Cup. Norway's lack of imagination was conspicuous. A day later, Mexico (two) and Ireland (one) managed to double the goals (three) previously scored in Group E. But, allowing for the unquenchable enthusiasm of Irish and Mexican fans in the Florida heat, there was simply not enough in the match to dissuade the neutral observer from going for a beer or checking out Wimbledon on the cable channel. (Brazil, on present form, would never drive anyone to drink - except Champagne). The battle of the European flatlands - Belgium vs Holland - on Saturday only produced one goal. As such games go it was pretty good, but you could sense that the two sides would probably have settled for neutralising each other if they had not been neighbours in competition for the next presidency of the European Union. The first-round matches, when one loss does not necessarily mean elimination, have enabled some sides, especially those with everything to gain by holding nothing back, to play out of their socks. The prime example has been Switzerland, with a World Cup history as memorable as its national political system (favourite trivia question: name any Swiss politician). But several other teams, including the US and Saudi Arabia, have exceeded all reasonable expectations. As the tournament progresses, however, playing to entertain may take second place to playing not to lose or to win by the necessary minimum, especially if the heat does not abate. Germany have already done this twice while Argentina, looking better all the time, came out for the second half against Nigeria determined mostly to sit on a one-goal lead. Admittedly, the number of red and yellow cards handed out so far - an average of 3.8 per game for a mere felony, plus seven capital offences, and almost all to defenders - ought to give offensive teams an edge, which was doubtless the intention of Fifa, soccer's governing body, in its instructions to referees. But most of the 22-man squads are loaded with interchangeable midfield and defensive parts, which is why Baggio was considered expendable when his team fell a man short. Nor has the World Cup yet produced great contrasts in styles. Most teams now play a similar sort of game, chasing everything, mixing long and short balls, trying to get out wide for the cross, bringing up tall defenders for corners and free kicks. Even Brazil's methodology conforms to type, though they play it better, while Nigeria's variation is only that, when allowed, they counter-attack at warp speed. Virtually no tactical innovation has been unveiled here. Even Maradona's dead-ball artistry, especially with the quickly-taken free kick, has been seen before, though perhaps not in Greece or Nigeria. This may mean that, as the competition gets tighter and as teams lose the capacity to surprise that comes with unfamiliarity, conservatism will prevail. And that implies duller matches. After all, at this level, soccer is a game played by professionals who are not in the business of being embarrassed or outwitted. The same applies to US sports. Baseball regularly introduces young phenoms who start out blasting home runs or striking out batters by the dozens. But the old pros sooner or later sort most of them out, discovering their weaknesses: that they cannot hit breaking balls or that they fall into a predictable pitch pattern. There are enough good soccer brains around to apply similar lessons, as the Swiss did to Gheorghe Hagi of Romania, for example, simply denying him the ball in forward positions in the second half. Exceptional performers can rise above all this, and it may help if a player or three imposes himself on the tournament - as Moore and Charlton, Pele, Beckenbauer and Maradona have in the past. Romario, Bebeto, Dunga, Rai and Leonardo have all shown this ability to transcend but unfortunately, for all except Brazilians, they play for the same team. Even the poor Russians solved most of the problems posed by Romario by clutching his shorts, shirt, neck and ankles and assuming the wall would be enough to block the subsequent free kick. It may not have been edifying but only twice, when Romario escaped to score himself and when he was fouled inside the penalty area, did the tactic fail. So, unpopular as the proposition may be, m'lud, it could be that the World Cup has passed its high-water mark. The US team might not progress much further, thus diminishing domestic interest, as might not the Irish, thus lessening brewers' interest. The fans could start getting antsy, too, as they did in Los Angeles after Mexico-Ireland (luckily the game was played in Florida). And here is an heretical thought: the World Cup has been great so far in mostly awful hot weather, but relatively cooler fronts are rolling in. What if it turns out that soccer is only played at its best in extreme heat? The prosecution rests.</p>

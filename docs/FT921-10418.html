			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Turnover at Euroclear and Cedel increases ANNUAL results from Euroclear and Cedel, the two clearing systems for the international bond market, show a strong increase in trading volumes last year. Euroclear turnover increased 40 per cent to Dollars 5,700bn equivalent, while Cedel saw a 37 per cent increase to Dollars 3.336bn. The overall increase in trading volume in both systems reflects the buoyancy of bond markets last year and the high volume of new issues. Both systems have increased their coverage of domestic bond markets. Euroclear increased turnover of domestic bonds by 88 per cent, Cedel by 38.6 per cent. The breakdown of turnover by currency underlines the decreasing importance of US dollar denominated securities and the growth of the Ecu bond market as a liquid sector.</p>

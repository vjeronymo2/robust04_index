			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / People: Jecks leaves KB to return to Lloyds Keith Jecks, 37, who was responsible for marketing Kleinwort Benson's private banking business, is quitting following a reorganisation of group marketing strategy. Jecks, managing director, London, of Kleinwort Benson Private Bank, will, in October, return to Lloyds Bank's fund management arm to the new post of chief operating officer of Lloyds Investment Managers which has Pounds 10bn under management. Jecks, an actuary, joined Lloyds in August 1986 to head the marketing of its investment management business. Three years later he moved to Kleinwort Benson Investment Management as business development director and was later posted to New York. George Alford, head of Kleinwort's private banking division, says Jecks is not being replaced directly. However, Steven Taylor, 45, takes over responsibility for marketing the private banking division and Jecks' other sales force responsibilities will be shared among other executives. Jecks' departure is one of a number of changes at Kleinwort Benson Private Bank. Nicholas Haynes, 43, general manager of Banque Kleinwort Benson SA in Geneva is returning to London as head of private client portfolio management. He will work in tandem with William Steel, 59, until he retires in a year's time. Haynes has been replaced in Geneva by Michael Allen, 54, who has been responsible for KB's north American financing business.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (3): Investors may be attracted as target looks set to be beaten - The country's privatisation programme FOR MANY international banks and investment funds, the acquisition by a French subsidiary of the Swiss Holderbank group of a 51 per cent stake in the CIOR state cement company last July marked a watershed in Morocco's ambitious privatisation programme. Privatisation this year has so far brought USDollars 250m worth of foreign investment into the country. By the end of the year, the authorities are confident that they will have overshot their initial target by 40 per cent. Last year, external financing in the form of direct investment covered the whole of the Dollars 500m current account deficit, whereas foreign investment financed only 50 per cent and 23 per cent of the deficit respectively in 1992 and 1991. The privatisation programme is on target and, if successfully pursued - 112 companies worth an estimated Dollars 2bn are expected to be privatised by the end of 1995 - will play a key role in furthering the liberalisation of the Moroccan economy, modernising the country's industrial sector and strengthening the country's balance of trade. Its success so far is a tribute to Mr Moulay Zine Zahidi, the minister of industry, and Mr Hassan Amrani, his very energetic director of privatisation. The full backing of King Hassan, an essential precondition for any successful venture in Morocco, is assured. Citibank, which recently signed the first international commercial loan in 10 years for a Moroccan company - USDollars 30m for the private ONA Group - pointed out in a recent analysis of the Moroccan economy that it felt 'comfortable with the country's low level of commercial debt (19 per cent of total external debt), relatively high level of foreign reserves and the Moroccan administration's stated goals to pursue market orientated policies and to re-establish normal relationships with external creditors.' The loan for ONA comes 10 years after Morocco was forced to reschedule its foreign debt. A price tag of Dh1.2bn was put on CIOR whose sale dwarfed the privatisation of CTM, an international bus company which was valued at Dh320m and successfully privatised last June. Ten per cent of the shares were sold to the regional authorities in Oujda and Fez in north-eastern Morocco where the company's two plants are located. A further 30,000 shares were earmarked for employees. Some 40 per cent of CTM shares were issued on the stock exchange last June and the offer was oversubscribed. The shares are currently trading at a 34 per cent premium to issue price. The most interesting feature of that sale was the keen interest shown by Moroccans living abroad who picked up one-third of the shares on offer. This interest underlines the importance of the Dollars 2bn that Moroccan immigrants remit home every year and which could prove a significant source of capital for the privatisation programme. The bourse has, since its creation by the former French colonial ruler, played a very limited role in the economic life of the country. Apart from an odd flurry of activity in French times, the bourse has been effectively moribund by international standards for all its 65 years. Moroccan savers traditionally invest in real estate or put their money on deposit. Businessmen go to their banks or tap private sources of finance, usually within the extended network of family companies and banks. Recently, treasury bills with a yield of 13 per cent tax free have been a magnet for individual investment. The lethargy of the bourse today does not, however, reflect a lack of demand but rather a combination of chronic shortage of supply, high cost of transaction and inadequate disclosure of company accounts. The privatisation process is thus expected to provide an impetus to the bourse and an opening to foreign institutional investors, for two reasons. One is that it will result in a large increase in liquidity. The second is that the Moroccan government has learnt from other countries' experience and knows that selling off a string of companies to multinational corporations may be the easy way out but it is a method which is both short-sighted and fraught with political risks. To ensure a privatisation programme is acceptable politically, shares in major companies must be widely distributed and a diversified body of domestic shareholders created. As a report by Blakeney Management, the investment adviser, notes: 'Neither of these goals can be achieved without an efficient and liquid bourse as a medium of exchange.' Today, there are still only 69 stocks listed on the bourse. Many of these never trade. Many stocks go for weeks without trading and the last price may not reflect current market conditions. Twenty institutional investors, essentially banks and insurance companies constitute a comfortable and rather cosy club. Three factors however are conspiring to bring changes. First of all the law passed last July on capital markets and mutual funds which will reduce transaction costs and encourage greater demand as the wealthier middle class bank depositors switch some of their funds. The second is the new-found interest in acquiring some Moroccan shares shown by institutional investors such as the US money management fund Templeton. Salomon Brothers and the ONA Group are setting up a Dollars 200m private equity fund. Barings has recently underwriting 400,000 ONA shares for its institutional clients. Privatisation is encouraging the emergence of investment funds such as Casablanca Finance, which is backed Banque Commerciale du Maroc. The country's leading private bank, its aim is to develop corporate and investment banking. Maroc Privatisation is backed by the Mutuelles du Mans insurance group and the Societe Marseillaise de Credit. Two much larger funds are the Dollars 24m Interfina fund, jointly owned by three Moroccan banks, the International Finance Corporation Spain's Banco Exterior, Credit Lyonnais Investissement and Proparco, the French equivalent of IFC. IFC, together with Siparex, a Lyon based venture capital group and the Moroccan commercial Wafa Bank, is in the process of setting up a Dollars 40m venture capital fund to help bring equity capital to medium-sized Moroccan companies. Other interesting developments include the setting up by three young Moroccans of the Upline group, which aims to provide foreigners interested in Morocco with risk assessment studies and investment advisory services. L'Economiste, the first reliable economic and financial weekly, was launched two years ago, edited by the much respected Nadia Salah. Owned by a small group of private investors, it sells 17,000 to 20,000 copies every week. Its senior editorial and management staff hold 44 per cent of the capital and its publication marks a break with the traditional type of Moroccan newspaper, which is highly politicised and usually sensational in style in a country where the hand of the censor remains heavy. A further development should help boost Casablanca as a city of international trade and finance. The ONA Group is soon to start building a world trade centre whose facilities, it is hoped, will bring many Moroccan companies into closer touch with what is going on abroad. The two towers, whose architects are Ricardo Bofill and Elie Mouyal, should help embellish the sky line of a city which over the years has grown in rather disorderly fashion. For the privatisation process to run smoothly and the opening of the Moroccan economy to be confirmed, one factor is still missing: transparency in business. As a recent World Bank summary on 'Developing Private Industry in Morocco' underlines, a weak judicial process which is slow, opaque and unpredictable in enforcing rules and resolving disputes is, in the view of foreign companies 'an important obstacle to investment.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PRIVATISATION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company name               Sector            Status  Type  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Societe des derives  du sucre                  sugar &amp; yeast      done     sealed tender bid                            prod Compagnie marocaine de  gestion des exploitations  agricoles                 agriculture        done     lease Societe Chellah  confections               textiles           done     private placement Compagnie de Transports  du Maroc                  transportation     done     public offering* Hotel Tarik Tangier        tourism            done     sealed tender bid Hotel les Amandiers        tourism            done     sealed tender bid Cimenterie de l'Oriental   cement manuf       done     public offering* Societe petroles du  Maghreb                   gas distribution   done     sealed tender bid Hotel Basma Casablanca     tourism            done     sealed tender bid Societe nationale  d'electrolyse et de  petrochimie               petrochemicals     done     sealed tender bid Compagnie Marocaine des  Hydrocarbures             gas distribution   ongoing  sealed tender bid Hotel Toubkai, Marrakesh   tourism            ongoing  sealed tender bid Hotel Volubilis, Fez       tourism            ongoing  sealed tender bid Hotel des iles, Essaouira  tourism            ongoing  sealed tender bid Sococharbo                 coal distribution  ongoing  sealed tender bid Sofac Credit               credit &amp; leasing   ongoing  public offering*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company name                       Amount        Buyer  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Societe des derives du sucre       Dh18.49m      Lesaffre Compagnie marocaine de  gestion des exploitations         Dh20m a year  several farmers Societe Chellah confections        Dh10m         Courtaulds Compagnie de Transports du Maroc   Dh110.57      Moroccan companies** Hotel Tarik Tangier                Dh15.5m       Union Moroccan Hotels Hotel les Amandiers                Dh5m          Floride Cimenterie de l'Oriental           Dh612m        Holderbank Societe petroles du Maghreb        Dh122.4m      Bouaida Gp Hotel Basma Casablanca             Dh50m         Moroccan-Libyan                                                   consortium Societe nationale d'electrolyse  et de petrochimie                 Dh364m        Group Chaabi Compagnie Marocaine des  Hydrocarbures                     Dh100m Hotel Toubkai, Marrakesh           Dh35m Hotel Volubilis, Fez               Dh30m Hotel des iles, Essaouira          Dh20m Sococharbo                         Dh46.81m Sofac Credit                       Dh87.5m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Also sealed tender bid. ** Banque Centrale Populaire, Interfina, Bank al Amal, Al Amane, Asma invest., CIMR.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Upline Research, Casablanca  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

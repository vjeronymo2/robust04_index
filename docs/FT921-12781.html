			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Western nations rally to rescue their former foe: Why the conference on aid to the former Soviet Union has been a useful first step THE Washington conference on co-ordinating emergency humanitarian aid to the former Soviet Union proved more useful than its many critics first suspected. At the end of the two-day meeting yesterday, most leading participants said the conference marked an important first step in mobilising international public support for aid to the one-time superpower. 'A process has been started,' said Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister who has long argued for large-scale western aid to pre- and post-communist Russia as a catalyst for reform. The big question, of course, is how far this global effort will go; at what point will the west, notably the US, be called upon to put up money to support the risky and immensely costly macro-economic reform in the former Soviet republics. The Bush administration pre-empted this debate last month by calling for a conference on humanitarian aid alone. Some 47 countries and five international financial organisations, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, accepted the invitation. The US demarche upset European sensibilities, but President Bush defused criticism during generous opening remarks at the opening of the meeting in which he tried to reassure allies that the US intends to pay its way in future Soviet aid. Mr Bush lavished praise on the European Community and Germany for their own aid effort; he announced he was seeking Dollars 645m in fresh technical and humanitarian aid from Congress; and he agreed to a follow-up conference in Lisbon, sponsored by the European Community and to be attended by the republics. This week's focus among the working groups was short-term disaster relief: how best to ship and distribute food and medicine to cities where the worst shortages are located; and how to avoid the corruption and bureaucratic snarl-ups which have plagued the relief effort. The aid pledged so far will not be enough to feed the Soviet people, but the conference participants felt enough food was in the pipeline to avoid starvation this winter. Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, observed that the relief effort remains crucial 'at the margin' - unblocking bottlenecks and seeking out the most vulnerable areas. The US announcement that it is starting military airlifts on February 10 should be taken in the same spirit of solidarity. In volume terms, the proposed 54 C-5 Galaxy transport flights are not impressive; the broader aim is to show the Soviet and American people that the Cold War is over and the west is prepared to help its old adversary. This education of ordinary Americans is easily underestimated. Having been brought up on a diet of anti-communism for more than 40 years, Americans need to be persuaded of the wisdom of sending direct financial aid to the former Soviet Union, particularly during a recession which has highlighted the country's own domestic problems. The military airlifts may be a headline-grabbing gimmick, but they also help prepare the political case for financial aid which - in Mr Hurd's words - lies just over the horizon. Indeed, British officials stressed this week that humanitarian aid is merely a short-term remedy, not a long-term solution. In order to avoid a 'dependent culture' growing up in the Soviet republics, the reformers must be pushed into another leap toward a free market - with the clear prospect of international support, a British official said. This coincides with the German view. During a long news conference at the Watergate hotel, Mr Genscher mixed his lengthy description of the German relief effort over the years with one newsworthy remark: that the issue of financial aid to the former Soviet Union was certain to be discussed at the Group of Seven industrialised nations meeting in Munich in July of this year. The G7 conference will be chaired by Germany; and unlike the previous conferences held in Houston and London, this meeting will be discussing large-scale aid not for a reformist communist Soviet leadership led by Mr Gorbachev but 11 republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States. European diplomats said this week they were leaning hard on the IMF to speed up membership for Russia and other republics. This would allow them to borrow to support a stabilisation fund for currencies and, perhaps, a payments union to ease trading problems between the republics. The World Bank stands ready to commit money, too, beyond the current technical aid. This is the point where the tough decisions on financial aid will have to be taken in Washington. For all the heady rhetoric about the 'global coalition' for freedom heard at the State Department this week, the moment of reckoning is approaching fast. FORMER Soviet republics like Ukraine, which have yet to sign the western-inspired memorandum of understanding on repaying the debts of the former Soviet Union, could be refused membership of the International Monetary Fund, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. Germany will press at the G7 meeting to block membership for those not prepared to honour Soviet debts, not with the aim of excluding them, but rather in the hope of forcing them into line. Ukraine is by far the most important of the four which have so far refused to accept responsibility. The others are Azerbaijan, Georgia and Uzbekistan. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940, have rejected responsibility for a share of the Soviet debt apart from that related to projects in the Baltic states.</p>

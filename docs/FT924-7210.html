			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Vosper gains 17% on strong order book VOSPER Thornycroft, the warship designer and builder, reported a 17 per cent increase in pre-tax profit for the half year to September 27 on the back of more than Pounds 700m of orders, mainly for export. The Southampton-based group increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.1m to Pounds 8.3m on increased turnover of Pounds 90.5m (Pounds 74.8m). Profits were boosted by an increase in interest income to Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 2.2m). Cash rose temporarily to Pounds 111m but is expected to fall to about Pounds 60m at the year-end as payments are made to equipment suppliers. Funding delays on the fourth Saudi Arabian minehunter, coupled with last year's deferral of an order for more Sandown class minehunters for the Royal Navy has led to 50 more lost jobs. Losses this year were 150 against earlier predictions of 350. Mr Peter Usher, chairman, said there would be no more redundancies and hoped to be recruiting by the end of next year. The recent devaluation of the pound was 'tremendous news' and boosted the group's position in the Middle East versus mainly French and German competitors. The group believes prospects for further orders for ships remain good given unrest and uncertainty in many areas of the world since the end of the cold war. Non-defence orders were Pounds 11m, compared with Pounds 3.5m in the first half last year and Pounds 13.6m in the year to March 1992. The group plans a number of selective non-defence acquisitions in the next year. Earnings per share were 17.8p (15.5p) and the interim dividend is 4.7p (4.1p). COMMENT Vosper has ameliorated the normal risk associated with defence-related companies by ensuring that exports account for more than 95 per cent of its orders. The government's options for change may have resulted in the deferral of a follow-up order for Royal Navy minehunters but that is hardly a significant setback given that MoD orders account for just 3.5 per cent of sales. The group is more concerned about receiving funding for further Saudi Arabian minehunters which is why it wants to by-pass the lead contractor, British Aerospace, and deal directly with Saudi Arabia. With forecast full year pre-tax profits of Pounds 19m and earnings of 40p the shares look cheap on a prospective multiple of a little more than 10, representing a 33 per cent discount to the market.</p>

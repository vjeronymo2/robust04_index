			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Czechs and balances - Two views prevail on the role of chambers of commerce Should chambers of commerce be voluntary organisations - as they are in the UK - or should they be official bodies with compulsory membership of the entire business community? As the chambers in eastern Europe slough off their communist past they are faced with a choice between the British and the continental European models. Their decisions could have an important impact on the effectiveness of the small business sector, which will play a crucial part in the regeneration of their economies. In the former Czechoslovakia, ironically, the business community is now pressing for compulsory membership of a proposed new Economic Chamber while the government is keen on a voluntary body. The row reflects the growing importance of the private sector in the economy and its outcome is likely to influence its role in the continued drive to a market economy. The chamber is designed to replace the old Czechoslovak Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which has existed in one form or another for 150 years. Legislation designed to transform it into a new, modern body based on the German model was passed by the federal parliament last May. It stipulated compulsory membership for businesses, an elected governing body and a federal structure with 17 regional divisions. Since the elections last June which led to the break-up of Czechoslovakia, the Czech Republic government, led by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, has reviewed the legislation and is now seeking to pass an amendment allowing for voluntary membership. From the chamber's point of view, this fundamental change in its constitution means abandoning the German model, whose central feature is compulsory membership, in favour of the British system, where membership is voluntary. Antonin Smid, the chamber's executive director, points out that only compulsory membership with different rates of entry fees, depending on the size and efficiency of the business, could give the new chamber the financial resources needed to provide the private sector with the support and influence it needs. Czechoslovakia's entrepreneurs have been lobbying unofficially to ensure that compulsory membership is retained. Jan Mazacek, general secretary of the Association of Czech Entrepreneurs, insists it is essential to police the private sector, which currently operates in an almost completely unregulated environment. He says the amendment is dictated by the government's fear of the power which would be wielded by a body representing the entire business community, from the largest industrial group to the most humble sole trader. Both the chamber and the association estimate that there are 1m potential members, which would give it significant negotiating power with the government. The association, which has 150,000 members, is the largest of several such organisations. It is a signatory to the social contract drawn up among unions, employers and the federal government as part of the transition to a market economy. 'The point of the dispute is that the new government realised our potential strength and is afraid of it,' Mazacek says. The government wants entrepreneurs to decide for themselves whether they wish to incur the costs of joining the Economic Chamber. Mazacek believes a compromise can be agreed, allowing compulsory membership for a period of three to five years. 'That would enable us to achieve a smooth transition to the market and see the private sector firmly established,' he says. 'Maybe then we could revert to voluntary membership but that is as far as we will go.'</p>

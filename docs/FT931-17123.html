			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Hidden role in Cuban crisis MR HAROLD Macmillan, the prime minister 30 years ago, felt the Cuban missile crisis strengthened the country's special relationship with the US. This was in spite of the British government's serious doubts about the legality of US actions. The prime minister's papers record daily phone calls between him and US President John Kennedy. Mr Macmillan later told the cabinet that the UK had played a more active role in the resolution of the crisis than was widely believed. He hesitated to publicise the fact for fear of embarrassing President Kennedy and further antagonising Britain's European allies. At one stage Mr Macmillan wrote to President Kennedy offering to immobilise the UK's 60 Thor nuclear missiles as a face-saving gesture for Mr Khrushchev, the Soviet leader. The crisis was resolved the following day without such action being necessary. Documents that have been removed indefinitely from the files made public yesterday may hide evidence of whether a secret deal was responsible for the sudden resolution of the situation. Close co-operation with Washington did nothing to help British relations with Europe when the UK was trying to join the European Economic Community, but Mr Macmillan did not appear to consider this a problem. He wrote in a memo: 'I am glad to feel that the crisis leaves us with strengthened ties to the administration . . . I do not feel so inhibited by our European negotiations because I am now beginning to feel that we shall have a fight with de Gaulle (of France) and Adenauer (of West Germany) anyway.' A flurry of memos between senior members of the government reveals serious doubts about whether the US blockade of Cuba was justifiable under international law. The consensus appeared to be that it was not. The government was particularly concerned about the possibility of setting a precedent in international law for ships of a third-party nation to be stopped and searched at sea.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Patten to hold key meeting in November MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, will fly to London early next month for a ministerial meeting which is expected to decide whether Britain will 'go it alone' on the introduction of limited democracy in the colony. Mr Patten will be in London between November 8 and 11 and ministers have pencilled in November 11 - when the full Cabinet meets - for the critical meeting. Since late April Britain and China have conducted 12 rounds of negotiations in an attempt to reach agreement on how to conduct elections in 1995 for the colony's Legislative Council (LegCo), its lawmaking body. But the sides remain divided, with Britain arguing for a broad franchise and China for a limited one. British officials said that if, by the November meeting, there were no prospects of agreement Mr Patten would recommend to ministers that he push ahead with plans for limited democracy. It has not been decided if Mr Patten would re-submit his original plans to LegCo, or the compromise plan the UK has already made to China. Between now and November there should be three more rounds of Anglo-Chinese talks, raising the possibility that China might offer a compromise. But few are hopeful. According to one British official: 'The only way to get agreement is to do as China wants. They want a rigged election and we cannot agree to it. We couldn't defend it in London and we couldn't defend it in Hong Kong.' Officials said a meeting in New York last Friday between Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, and Mr Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, produced little sign that Beijing would respond to the UK's compromise. In TV interviews Mr Qian restated China's intention to recover Hong Kong before 1997 if there were 'disturbances' in the colony.</p>

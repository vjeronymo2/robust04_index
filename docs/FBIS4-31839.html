			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hamiz Deronjic and Nihad Salihovic] </F>   [Text] The Serbian aggressor stepped up provocative  attacks on the Brcko front last night. At about 2000 last  night, in addition to strong small arms fire, the enemy also  targeted the Vranovaca-Bodariste area with 60 mm mortars.  During this period, the chetniks were also observed to be  amassing forces on that part of the front. In addition to  firing Browings and machine guns from Lipovac, the enemy also  fired over 20 grenades on the central part of the defense line.    At about 0130 this morning, the chetniks again fired on the  central part of the front with Browings and portable mortars.  The activities of the enemy's reconnaissance units also  intensified on the Brcko front overnight, especially around  Djukici and (?Pekici). Members of the 108th Motorized and the  108th Infantry Brigades, as well as the support units from the  2nd Corps, were not involved in any combat last night.</p>

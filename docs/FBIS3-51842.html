Fraser said the new group will  have to sell itself hard to the electorate, since Prime Minister  James Mitchell's New Democratic Party would exploit some of the  questions about itself that the alliance has not answered.    He told CANA the alliance "raises more questions than it  provides answers because one hopes that it has come about  because of dissatisfaction with the state of things." He asked:  "Have they been looking beyond the election?"    On Monday, the St. Vincent and the Grenadines Labour Party,  led by lawyer Stanley John, and Dr. Ralph Gonsalves' Movement  for National Unity announced that they had formed an alliance.  The two parties will campaign on a common platform and share a  single manifesto, but retain their individual identities.    Prime Minister Mitchell, whose party won all fifteen seats  in the last general election, remains confident about a third  straight win. He told CANA: "No last-minute strategy of an  alliance of convenience by the opposition parties can prevent us  from securing a third consecutive mandate from the people of St.  Vincent and the Grenadines."</p>

Stefanov, GosNIIAS (expansion not given), Moscow; UDC  621.396]    [Abstract] A suboptimal procedure for detecting moving  images against a conditionally stationary background in the form  of a sequence of time-separated fragments of images of a  slightly changing scene was considered. The proposed procedure,  which is suboptimal from the standpoint of the criterion of the  maximum a posteriori probability, was synthesized under the  assumption of the presence in the image being analyzed of random  geometric distortions caused by a change in the observation  point and additive gaussian noise. The procedure is based on  optimal linear filtration of the difference between uniform  fragments of adjacent frames that were previously combined by a  correlation technique and on an operation separating statistical  hypotheses applied to the filter output. The generally accepted  model of an image was used along with a newly developed method  of determining the new procedure's main statistical  characteristics in the case of simple detection. A number of  particular cases typical for aircraft location information  systems were considered, and the range of the parameters of the  backgrounds, moving images, and noise was calculated.  Mathematical expectation and mean square deviation were  specified relative to the maximum value of image brightness, and  a correlation constant was specified in relation to the  characteristic size of the moving image. The following ranges of  parameters were calculated for the background: mathematical  expectation, 0.240-0.400; mean square error, 0.036-0.265; and  correlation constant, 0.523-2.013. The following ranges of  parameters were calculated for the image: mathematical  expectation, 0.320-0.550; mean square error, 0.042-0.200; and  correlation constant, 1.043-5.996. The following ranges of  parameters were calculated for the noise: mathematical  expectation, 0.000; mean square error, 0.014-0.044; and  correlation constant, 25.56-31.12. The following values were  calculated for the total error of a one-frame detector in the  various seasons: winter, 0.932 x 10[.sup]-4[/]; autumn, 0.747  x 10[.sup]-3[/]; and summer, 0.961 x 10[.sup]-3[/]. It was  concluded that interframe processing is justified if the errors  of a suboptimal detector are less than those of a single-frame  detector. Specifically, it was determined that the use of  interframe processing is justified if the background's movement  is limited to 20-40 percent of the characteristic size of the  moving image. Changing the value of the interframe movement from  zero to the limiting value was found to result in an increase in  total error by a factor of 7 to 20. A test of the new  procedure's validity conducted by way of the example of digital  processing of a pair of images of a typical scene confirmed that  the proposed procedure yields an absolutely correct result.

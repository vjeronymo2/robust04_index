			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Daniel Santoro; copyrighted by CLARIN] </F>   [Text] After systematically refusing to sign the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (TNP) for 25 years, Argentina will  finally do so in 1994. This announcement was made, quite  unexpectedly, by Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella.    This announcement constitutes a turnabout by the Peronist  government in yet another traditional stance of Argentina's  foreign policy, namely the reluctance to sign this treaty  because it entailed a legal and political "inequality" between  nuclear countries and nonnuclear ones.    During an end-of-the-year toast with journalists, Di Tella  tried to dampen the effects his announcement will trigger. "In  our capacity as TNP members we will seek, in 1995, that nuclear  powers disarm," he said in a matter-of-fact way. He thus  produced an argument that goes against the historical stance of  Argentine diplomacy, which had rejected the treaty on the  grounds it was "the disarmament of those countries that have no  [nuclear] weapons," according to what was officially reported.    Taking stock of the results of the country's foreign policy  this year, the foreign minister elaborated on "the new security  policy."    "We have implemented a security policy particularly based on  the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, be they  nuclear, chemical, or missile," he underscored following an  aide-memoire that he himself had written to deliver the  end-of-the-year speech, which nobody expected.    He then enumerated some of the measures taken to abandon the  Foreign Ministry's traditional positions in this area:    -- "Our vocation for peace has led us to be totally open  about the Argentine nuclear program by signing an  all-encompassing agreement on safeguards with the International  Atomic Energy Agency and furthering a joint nuclear policy with  Brazil." Until democracy was reinstated in our country in 1983,  the United States and other industrial countries suspected that  our country had a secret nuclear program to develop the atomic  bomb.    -- "We have promoted agreements on the banning of chemical  weapons, first at the regional level (the so-called Mendoza  Declaration) and then at international level under the aegis of  the United Nations." By virtue of the aforementioned  declaration, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile committed themselves  to renouncing chemical, bacteriological, or biological weapons.  It has for time immemorial been surmised that Chile had  developed chemical weapons in a clandestine way, but it has been  denied by the current democratic Chilean Government.    -- "Furthermore, we proposed amendments to the Tlatelolco  Treaty together with Brazil and Chile." Congress ratified this  treaty on 11 November -- after waiting 25 years -- despite the  Radical Party's opposition. The Tlatelolco Treaty establishes a  nuclear-free zone in Latin America. The amendments Di Tella  refers to have to do with the interest Argentina has in  preserving its industrial secrets, like the method for  processing enriched uranium developed by the National Commission  for Atomic Energy (CNEA) at the Pilcaniyeu plant in Neuquen  Province.    -- "We also have discontinued the Condor-2 missile project  and established the National Commission for Space Activities,  which is in charge of retrofitting the Falda del Carmen plant  (where the missile was developed) and developing satellites."  Following infighting in its own party and a dispute with the  Radicals, this administration dismantled the missile in 1991 and  sent its components to the United States this year. It has not  yet honored its promise to recycle the aforementioned plant into  a technological research center for peaceful uses.  <H5>  Contradiction </H5>   The unexpected announcement by Di Tella on 29 December  contradicts his own remarks to CLARIN on 8 March 1982, when he  announced that the government had decided to promote in Congress  the Tlatelolco Treaty's ratification, but denied the country  would sign the TNP.    Argentina had signed the Tlatelolco Treaty, though its  ratification by Congress still was pending until November,  whereas it always refused to sign the TNP. Now the government  will request signing the agreement and then will have to submit  it to Congress for ratification so the treaty can take effect.  What remains to be seen is the UCR's [Radical Civic Union]  stance on this new and bold step taken by the government.</p>

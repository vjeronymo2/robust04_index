			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Smaller companies do not consider environmental issues significant SMALLER companies do not consider environmental issues significant, according to a survey published this month by the consultancy arm of accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, writes Bronwen Maddox. In KPMG's annual survey on UK business opinion, two thirds of the 324 companies interviewed said that environmental issues were not a trading issue last year, and 59 per cent said the environment would not be an issue for the forthcoming year. However 44 per cent of manufacturing companies in the survey said they had been affected by green rules, compared to 26 per cent in services. Martin Houldin of KPMG commented that small companies were mainly affected by local authority rules rather than by national or EC environmental regulation. 'The environment has been pushed down the agenda of many private companies by other factors such as the recession and exchange rates.' Although 12 per cent reported that sales revenue had risen, 39 per cent said that profit margins were squeezed by interest charges and other cost increases. However the companies surveyed ranked the environment above the liberalisation of eastern Europe in importance for their trading.</p>

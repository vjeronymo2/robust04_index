			<p>BFN     [Text] Indonesia is postponing indefinitely the second  round of peace talks between the Philippine Government and the  Moro National Liberation Front [MNLF] representatives scheduled  to start today until 23 May in Jakarta. Former Ambassador  Manuel Yan, presidential peace adviser, confirmed the delay  which is the second since the peace talks were first scheduled  last mid-April.    According to Yan, Indonesia postponed the meeting due to a  number of international commitments. Ambassador Yan denied  speculations that the postponement was in reaction to the  Philippines' hosting of a human rights conference here on East  Timor which Indonesia views with disfavor.</p>

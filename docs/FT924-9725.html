			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / People: Leighfield retiring from AT&amp;T Istel John Leighfield is retiring as executive chairman of AT&amp;T Istel, provoking a game of musical bucket-seats at the US-owned company which was once the computing arm of British Leyland. The new man at the top will be Peter Teague (right), 38, currently the company's director of finance and corporate services. The present group chief executive, Chris Chiles, 48, is moving to the US as marketing vice-president in AT&amp;T's Business Communications Services Business Unit, where he will have special responsibilities for Europe. John Leighfield, still only 55, is both well known and highly respected in Europe's computing services community. Formerly with Ford and Plessey, he joined Leyland in 1972 to pioneer the establishment of a separate IT services company, BL Systems. He played a leading role in the negotiations which led to a majority stake in the company being sold to its management in 1987, and its subsequent sale to AT&amp;T in 1989. He will remain a non-exec-utive director of AT&amp;T Istel, thus leaving more time for his hobby of cartography and his role as a professor at Warwick University. Peter Teague, a mathemat-ician and chartered accountant, was formerly a financial adviser with Arthur Young where he was involved in Istel's management buy-out. He joined the company in 1987.</p>

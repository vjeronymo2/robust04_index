			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Banco Popular climbs to Pta54bn BANCO POPULAR, the Spanish commercial bank 47 per owned by non-Spanish institutional investors, yesterday reported net profits of Pta54.4bn (Dollars 468m) for last year, a rise of 9.6 per cent on 1991, writes Tom Burns. Popular improved its return on average assets last year to 2.12 per cent from 2.01 in 1991 and will pay a dividend of Pta730 per share, a 10.6 per cent rise on last year's payout. Anticipating what is likely to be a sharp drop in profit margins among Spanish banks, Popular's results were down on last year's when it reported a 15 per cent increase in net income against 1990. Non-performing loans on Popular's 1992 balance sheet rose by 28 per cent to Pta40.4bn and allowances for credit losses were up by 31.8 per cent to Pta33.3bn, a figure which represented 110.1 per cent of the mandatory bad debt coverage requirement.</p>

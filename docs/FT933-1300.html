			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Wembley doubles to Pounds 2.89m - Profit from disposal of investments behind advance WEMBLEY, owner of the north London stadium complex and greyhound tracks, more than doubled first-half profits to Pounds 2.89m, but only after the sale of investments. Profits from continuing operations fell from Pounds 8.02m to Pounds 6.11m with the main stadium and the smaller Arena both hosting fewer events and US greyhound operating profits falling 63 per cent. Group pre-tax profits, including the Pounds 5.6m surplus from the sale of shares in the Ticketing Group and Autotote, rose from Pounds 1.07m to Pounds 2.89m after an interest bill of Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 7.9m). Sales were marginally higher at Pounds 78m. Earnings per share were 0.58p compared with losses of 0.43p, but the interim dividend is passed. The group made disposals of Pounds 15m in the first half and Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman, said he expected at least the same in the second half. But net debt fell by only Pounds 5m to Pounds 139m, leaving gearing at 78 per cent. Wembley reiterated that in line with an agreement with its banks last year it will cut Pounds 40m from its borrowings by March 31 1994 and Pounds 50m by the end of that year. The Wembley complex made an operating profit of Pounds 4.4m, down from Pounds 4.49m in the same period last year. Sir Brian said the performance was commendable given that there were no main stadium pop concerts in the first half, compared with seven in the same period last year, and that the number of events in the Arena fell by 13 to 53. Profits from UK greyhound operations, which are for sale, fell 11 per cent to Pounds 1.24m, hit by evening opening of betting shops. In the US, the greyhound operating profit fell from Pounds 1.55m to Pounds 580,000 because the Lincoln, Rhode Island, track met stiff competition from a casino based in Connecticut. Sir Brian said Lincoln was fighting back and that the Colorado operations had not been affected. COMMENT The boardroom coup against Sir Brian Wolfson may not have materialised. But the chronically optimistic Wembley chairman is not off the rocks. Asset sales have trimmed only Pounds 5m from the debt mountain; operating profits remain uncomfortably dependent on world music stars choosing to tour, something the recession has persuaded many not to do; and profits at the US greyhound operation have collapsed just as it was being groomed for sale. Shareholders can therefore expect more rough water before their shares find any buoyancy. Nor can they rely on someone providing the finance to back a hostile bid by disaffected former directors. Though Sir Brian plotted the course and was at the helm when the group went aground, he can probably count on support of shareholders representing 25 per cent of the company.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / French Elections: Right aims for Louis XVI presidency YOU would have to go back into early 19th century French history to find a comparable conservative majority, if France's centre-right parties were to achieve in next Sunday's run-off elections for the National Assembly the maximum projected for them as a result of last Sunday's first ballot. The top limit of the range of seats predicted for the neo-Gaullist Republican Rally (RPR) and centre-right Union for French Democracy (UDF) is 480 seats out of the 577 total. That, said one commentator yesterday, would leave President Francois Mitterrand with 'as much authority as Louis XVI' after he was brought back to revolutionary Paris from Varennes. But second rounds in French elections are a chance for second thoughts. This is why most pollsters put the bottom range of the RPR/UDR eventual score in seats at around 440, with the outside possibility that the Socialists - having failed to gain a single seat in the first ballot - might pick up as many as 80, admittedly far short of the 262 seats which they and their allies held in the last parliament. There are two reasons why the pendulum might swing back slightly from the right. One is that more people might vote next Sunday than did last Sunday, when 31.07 per cent of the electorate stayed away from the polling booths. This abstention rate is high compared to the last cohabitation election in 1986 when the RPR/UDF first entered government under the Mitterrand presidency. Socialist appeals for a common front against the right might bring out more left-wing voters in six days' time. The second factor is known as desistement, in which second-round candidates of the left desist in favour of the one among them best placed to beat the right, with the same tactics happening on the right. The way in which such desistement can affect the outcome is well illustrated by Sunday's outcome in Gardanne, near Marseilles, which Mr Bernard Tapie, the businessman, is trying to keep for the Socialists. He scored 25.6 per cent, his RPR challenger 24.28 per cent, the Communist 19.31 per cent, and the extreme-right National Front 18.97 per cent. All four are in a run-off race of unusual symmetry between left and right. Adding to the Socialists' weakness is the fact that in this election the party has no electoral pacts with others, though it has at least a history of striking bargains with the Communists. There is no such track record of co-operation with Les Verts and Generation Ecologie. Indeed, the Socialists have really messed up their relations with this green alliance. They waited until last week, when the greens were beginning to slump in the polls, to suggest a tactical voting pact. Had they proposed this when the environmentalists were riding high in the polls (at one point ahead of the Socialists, at 20 per cent), the Socialists could have given the greens, and in the end themselves, a real fillip. Now that the ecologists have crashed to a total 7.6 per cent vote in the first round, they are not much good to the Socialists. With Mr Brice Lalonde, the GE leader, and Mr Antoine Waechter, the leader of Les Verts, knocked out in the first round, most greens feel too sore with Socialist opportunism to want to co-operate now. By contrast, the RPR and UDF are solid, at least on paper. In more than 500 constituencies they fielded a single candidate in the first round, and 78 of them gained an outright victory (42 for the RPR, 36 for the UDF). In 52 of the 70 seats where the RPR and UDF ran a kind of US-style primary election against each other, the RPR candidate did better than the UDF one. Where, therefore, both candidates did well enough to appear in the run-off, it would seem to be up to the UDF in most cases to give way. That is indeed what opposition leaders decided in their 'code of good conduct'. But the centrist, particularly the Christian Democrat, wing of the UDF thinks otherwise. With some reason, they argue that they are naturally better placed than hardline Gaullists to pick loose votes in the centre. And they got backing from Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing. The UDF president said that, while he 'would take no risk' of letting a Socialist get back in, 'when the choice is just between opposition candidates, it will be the electors who will decide.' The reason for this jostling between the partners in France's future coalition government is that each wants to provide the prime minister nominated by President Mitterrand next week. If, as now seems likely, the RPR wins most seats, that job will go to one of its men, probably Mr Edouard Balladur. But desperately keen to shake its image of being the RPR's little brother, the UDF is conceding nothing until the polling booths close, again, at 8 pm next Sunday.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FIRST ROUND RESULTS                 ASSEMBLEE NATIONALE, ELECTIONS '93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total number of seats: 577 Electorate: 37.5m Candidates winning 50% or more of vote in their constituencies are   elected Candidates winning less than 50% but more than 12.5% can go on to   second and final round, next Sunday (March 28)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE RIGHT                                       % PARTY                     NATIONAL VOTE         SEATS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RPR: Rassemblement pour la Republique (Gaullists)                       20.39            42 UDF: Union pour la Democratie Francaise (Centre-Right)                    19.08            36 Other Right                        4.71             2                                 -----------------------                                   44.18            80                                 ----------------------- National Front                    12.41             0 Other Extreme Right                0.27             0                                 -----------------------                                   12.68             0                                 -----------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE LEFT AND OTHERS                                       % PARTY                     NATIONAL VOTE         SEATS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Socialists                        17.59             0 Communists                         9.18             0 Extreme Left                       1.77             0 Left Radicals                      0.89             0 Other Left                         1.79             0                                 -----------------------                                   31.22             0                                 ----------------------- Les Verts                          4.01             0 Generation Ecologie                3.62             0                                 -----------------------                                    7.63             0                                 ----------------------- Regionalists                       0.45             0 Miscellaneous                      3.76             0                                 -----------------------                                    4.21             0                                 -----------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Reuters  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Management: Time for a check-up - Perks / Rising medical costs mean companies are taking a second look at private health insurance. Continuing a series, Alan Pike looks at how policies are changing Bupa can benefit almost every body in business, declares a newspaper advertisement currently being run by Britain's largest private health care group. It depicts employees of a restaurant, publisher and construction, transport, marine engineering and computer companies whose employers provide private health benefits. All look in excellent health. This must be a terrific relief to Bupa, because Britain's medical insurers are struggling to control claims. Rising private medical costs are a problem not only for health insurers but, of course, for the customers who feel the effects in higher premiums. Often these customers are not individuals but companies; many began offering private medical insurance as a benefit to employees in far better business circumstances than they now find themselves. Insurers, aware that cost pressures in the recession are inevitably leading to companies reconsidering every item of non-essential expenditure, are stepping up efforts to project private health provision as an important ingredient in all-round business efficiency, rather than a fringe perk. The Bupa advertising campaign stresses this, declaring that healthier and better-motivated staff equate to 'fewer days lost through illness, easier work scheduling and increased profitability'. Laing &amp; Buisson, the healthcare publisher and research organisation, produced figures last month showing that there were 3.2m subscribers to medical insurance in December 1991, in schemes covering 6.5m people or 11.4 per cent of the population. This was a drop of 0.6 per cent on the previous year - a tiny fall but the first-ever since the 1970s. The number of these subscribers in company schemes - 1.9m at December 1991 - fell by 3 per cent over the same period. In view of the extent of the recession, however, this drop is again a modest one and can be explained by redundancies and company closures, rather than a more widespread abandonment of health provision by employers. The figures give the private health sector grounds for hoping that, if cost containment can be improved, it may not lose too many corporate subscribers as a result of the recession. Company-provided schemes - some completely funded by employers, others with a contribution from staff - were the fastest growing sector of private medical insurance throughout the 1980s. They are also the most competitive sector of the market - companies are more likely than private subscribers to shop around and change insurers, a process being increased by a rising number of brokers and other specialists entering the market. The conventional image of health insurance as a benefit for senior staff remains broadly accurate. Although some companies offer cover to all employees, surveys show that private health insurance subscribers are still overwhelmingly in the professional and managerial categories. The tendency for companies to shop around and change insurers has kept the corporate sector of health insurance more price competitive than the individual one. Managers are also taking far more interest in what they get for their money. One effect of this can be to trade down to more restrictive policies. Another - which is being encouraged by the insurers - is for corporate clients to become involved in managed care arrangements. Private Patients Plan (PPP), the second-biggest insurer, has pioneered this approach with Pilkington, in its medical insurance scheme for 1,600 managers and their families. Under managed care schemes, treatment takes place whenever possible at a preferred-provider hospital - in the Pilkington case the Fairfield in St Helens. This guarantees the hospital a substantial volume of work, and gives the insurer managing the scheme greater bargaining power over arrangements and charges. It can, for example, ensure that, whenever possible, treatment is carried out by cost-effective day surgery techniques rather than involving unnecessary in-patient stays. 'The key to managed care is that we receive pre-notification that a patient requires treatment,' says Wendy Brewer, manager of PPP's managed care programmes. 'This means we are able to plan in advance to ensure that treatment is provided in the most efficient way. It is the reverse of a conventional insurance claim, where we have to start complaining after the patient has left hospital if we are unhappy.' Brewer says costs have gone down in each of the two years that the Pilkington scheme, introduced in 1990, has operated. But a similar number of cases have been treated and the company's managers are covered for the same list of conditions as before. Private medical fees are currently under investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Brewer says the attitude of doctors at St Helen's towards managed care has moved from one of initial suspicion to describing the arrangements as 'not unreasonable'. With the need to control costs the most important issue facing the private medical sector, schemes of this sort are likely to grow. A consequence is that managers in companies will need to take an increasingly active interest in the precise health cover they provide, choosing from a growing range of options. Insurance is not, however, the only health provision that a company can make for its employees. Some offer a range of occupational health and monitoring facilities: workplace health promotion campaigns are likely to become a more familiar feature with the introduction of the government's Health of the Nation strategy to raise national health standards. The Coronary Prevention Group is this month launching a big Heart and Workplace Health Programme for 10,000 London Underground employees at all levels of seniority. They will undergo a 45-minute series of tests, leading to individual counselling and advice on healthy eating, smoking, exercise and coping with stress. Employers introducing this type of programme are undoubtedly serving the national interest - Britain, with one of the world's worst coronary heart attack death rates, lost more than 51m working days through heart disease last year. Health promotion specialists say such schemes can also serve companies' interests. While medical insurance offers cover that many employees never use, high-profile health promotion exercises involving an entire workforce have immediate, visible impact and can bring swift benefits in goodwill and improved morale.</p>

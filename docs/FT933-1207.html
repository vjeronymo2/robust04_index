			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (16): When crystal balls cloud over - International forecasting / Stephanie Flanders examines the accuracy of economic predictions and finds that although accuracy has improved, the record since 1991 is patchy IT IS a fact of life for international macroeconomists that one of their least successful product lines is the one which interests the customer most: economic forecasts. Non-economists generally judge the profession to be worse than useless at predicting what economies will do next. They often go on to ask: what on earth is the point of analysing the world economy if not to help us to do just that? As it turns out, the most prestigious international economic forecasts are generally a good deal better than nothing, and improving over time. In any given year, however, they are indeed likely to be wrong, and to that extent the popular perception is warranted. Some of the errors are avoidable, but given the number that are not, the organisations concerned might do well to downgrade the importance of forecasts altogether. Of all economic predictions, those of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and International Monetary Fund are undoubtedly the most influential. Both institutions have an unparalleled access to the workings of a large proportion of the global economy. As a result, their considered judgment on the future path of output and inflation carry the force of first-hand experience. Not to mention, at least where the combined international forecasts are concerned, the advantage of having something of a monopoly. The OECD assessed the accuracy of its economic predictions for the seven big industrialised economies in the June issue of its Economic Outlook, and compared the OECD's record with that of the IMF. The authors of the study concluded that since 1971, the OECD's forecasts have, on average, been more accurate than 'a random-walk projection' - simply assuming that inflation and economic growth next year will be exactly the same as this year. Moreover, the accuracy has generally improved over time: from an average error of - 0.5 per cent for year-ahead growth forecasts 1971-82 to 0.3 per cent 1983-91. The IMF's forecasts began rather better, and are made earlier in the year, but show a similar pattern of improvement. Nevertheless, their recent record is still patchy. Projections may now be, on average, more accurate. But in 1991, for example, both the OECD and the IMF were further off in their predictions for economic growth than they had been since 1982. The OECD predicted 2 per cent real GDP growth for the seven biggest economies in 1991, while the IMF plumped for 2.4 per cent. But actual growth turned out to be only 0.7 per cent. So what went wrong? Both organisations claim that the mistakes of 1991 were only a particular example of a common forecaster's elephant trap: predicting turning points in the economic cycle. As the OECD's recent article explained, there are two reasons why large errors occur. First, the forecasters may not have been using all the information available to them at the time, something which could presumably be avoided in future. But a second explanation could be that, in the OECD's words, 'all information is used, but its predictive power declines sharply close to cyclical turning points'. A plausible reason why economic data becomes less useful at these critical moments could relate to delays in gathering statistics. National economic data is usually several months behind reality, and it is reasonable to believe that the lead time becomes more crucial if the real economy is just beginning to turn itself around. Unfortunately, the record since 1991 has not been much better. Real GNP growth of the seven countries in 1992 was 1.6 per cent, 0.6 percentage points less than either the OECD or the IMF had predicted the preceding year. And in recent publications, both organisations have been forced yet again to lower their predictions for 1993. Repeated over-estimates such as these would seem to indicate a second - more fundamental - problem is involved: namely a turning point, not merely in the economic variables themselves, but in the long term relationship between them. A change in underlying economic relations is much more serious for forecasting models, all of which rely on the assumption that past statistical links are stable enough to be a guide to the future. It may be, as the IMF suggested in its April 1992 World Economic Outlook, that economic forecasts did better in the 1980s, not just because economic modelling became more sophisticated, but in large part because the world economy itself followed a simpler and more stable path during the 1980s than it had in the turbulent 1970s. If this is the case, then the ability of IMF, OECD and other forecasting bodies to overcome their recent setbacks could rely more on the behaviour of the world economy than on the depth and sophistication of their models of it. The OECD and the IMF are at pains to explain this in their economic reports. In June, for example, the OECD described the past and future uncertainties which have recently hung over their world output projections. Broadly speaking, the unpleasant surprise for the OECD's forecasters was the private sector behaviour in many of the member states. Personal and corporate balance sheet adjustment has continued far longer than most thought possible. The biggest question marks hanging over the current forecasts, the OECD argued, related more to public sector agents: above all, on when and how a number of governments felt able to tackle the state of their own balance sheets. In the face of such imponderables, some say that the detailed health warnings attached to current forecasts, and regular post-mortems of past mistakes, only serve to bring home the futility of the exercise. Ultimately, argue the critics, the current method of forecasting will never quite be a match for the complex and unpredictable workings of the world economy. As a result, both producers and users of forecasts should have a fresher, more realistic approach to them. To respond fully to these arguments, the OECD and the IMF would have to extend their current practice of providing forecasts under a number of alternative scenarios, to the point of refusing to offer any 'bottom line' forecast for economic growth and inflation. But their readers would also have to stop asking for one: something which they show very little sign of doing.</p>

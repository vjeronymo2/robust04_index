			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Croatia and Serbia propose Bosnia deal CROATIA and Serbia have agreed to make a joint Bosnian peace proposal which would divide the country into three ethnic states with a federal or confederal constitution, President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia said in Geneva last night. Mr Tudjman's announcement followed a three-hour meeting with his Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin opposite numbers, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Mr Alija Izetbegovic and Mr Momir Bulatovic - the first time the leaders of the former Yugoslav states had met since their short-lived Athens agreement on the Vance-Owen plan last month. Mr Milosevic said: 'My strong belief is that we have made a substantial step towards peace.' Though Mr Izetbegovic left the meeting early, claiming he could not continue to negotiate while the Moslem town of Gorazde was being shelled by the Bosnian Serbs, Mr Tudjman claimed that the Moslem president, too, had agreed in principle to 'certain modifications' to the Vance-Owen plan. However, Mr Izetbegovic, who was due to meet Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn today, had made it clear that he would first have to consult the other members of the Bosnian presidency. It was not clear how Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators who presided over the meeting, viewed the proposals. The mediators have said they would accept any modifications to their plan agreed by all parties. However, the Serb and Croat proposals amount to much more than the 'modifications' of the Vance-Owen map referred to by President Tudjman. They would virtually sound the death knell of the plan, under which Bosnia-Hercegovina was to have been divided into 10 semi-autonomous provinces but would have remained a unitary state. The Serbs and Croats would each submit proposals within the next few days, but they would try to harmonise their views, Mr Tudjman said. It was already clear that the Bosnian Moslem unit would be composed of two geographically separated areas: the central Bosnian region around Sarajevo, the capital, and the north-west region of Bihac. The Serbs and Croats had also agreed to make new proposals for the constitutional principles on which the new confederal Bosnian state would be based, thus changing one of the few sections of the Vance-Owen plan which had been agreed by all parties. Mr Tudjman said that he had offered the Bosnian Moslem state access to the sea via the Adriatic port of Ploce, which would be turned into a free port. It was not immediately clear whether the proposed Bosnian Serb and Croatian states would suffer from the same geographical division as the Moslem entity, but the impression given by Mr Tudjman was that this would not be the case. There have been reports that the Croatian president, Mr Milosevic and Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, have already explored the possibility of territorial swaps.</p>

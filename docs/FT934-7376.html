			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): 'Big Three' Frankfurt chemicals underperform BOURSES responded to the falls on Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT, back from a day's holiday, effectively matched Wednesday's gains in other continental markets as the DAX index rose 13.62 to 2,085.34; but it lost most of that rise after hours. Turnover fell from DM11.1bn to DM9bn. Among blue chips, there were falls against the trend of 30 pfg in both BASF and Hoechst, to DM274.20 and DM279.20 respectively, with Bayer only 80pfg higher at DM328.50. Hoechst revealed disappointing third quarter results nine days ago, and BASF and Bayer produce their figures next week. Commerzbank jumped DM4.90 to DM362.40, hoping for news of a higher dividend next week, and Porsche put on DM30, or 4 per cent to DM785 in a generally firm automotive sector, up on the higher dollar, said Ms Heidemarie Hoppner at B Metzler in Frankfurt. PARIS lost early gains as the session progressed. The CAC-40 index closed up 1.68 at 2,149.67 after a day's high of 2,171.93. Turnover was some FFr4.4bn. Roussel-Uclaf advanced FFr24 to FFr721 with some reports suggesting that investors were switching out of other drug stocks. LVMH rose FFr126 to FFr3,770 on news that it was selling its skin care products company to Johnson &amp; Johnson of the US. However, suggestions that it was to sell its Pommery champagne division were denied by the group. AMSTERDAM lost a little momentum towards the close of business, but the CBS Tendency index remained in positive territory, showing a gain of 0.5 to 137.5. Heineken broke through the Fl 200 level for the first time in a week, Fl 3.10 higher at Fl 200.70 as it reported that its Spanish unit was to sell a brewery to Coors of the US. Hoogovens was worried by fears that a deal on European steel subsidies might not reach agreement, the shares ending down Fl 2.40 at Fl 45.70. MILAN maintained an interest in telecoms as Stet announced that it had approved a restructuring plan, and was hopeful of an improvement in earnings over the next three years. Its shares rose L125 to L3,769, and those of Sip, the domestic operator, by L74 to L3,195. The Comit index closed 10.69 higher at 548.05. In a note on the telecoms sector, James Capel came out on balance in favour of Sip as standing to reap the greater benefit from the proposed reforms, and suggested that there was a case for switching out of Stet into the domestic utility. Among the banks Credito Italiano advanced L31 to L2,479, and BCI L88 to L4,466. ZURICH got back on the upgrade after pausing earlier this week for the outcome of the US Nafta vote. The SMI index closed 16.0 better at 2,727.1 after profit-taking eroded a day's high of 2,735.0. UBS enlivened a staid banking sector, rising SFr12 to SFr1,307 after a confident look at 1994, and Brown Boveri gained SFr16 to SFr1,045 ahead of next week's figures from the Swedish-Swiss operating group, Asea Brown Boveri. BRUSSELS broke through the 1,400 level to record its second consecutive record high, the Bel-20 index advancing another 11.07 to 1,408.83. Turnover was down from Wednesday's BFr4bn, when the market was excited by the day's combination of interest rate cuts and government agreement on economic reform, but it was still healthy at BFr2.8bn. Banks and other financials were strong on expectations that more interest rate cuts could be on the way and, in retailing, GIB put on BFr18 to BFr1,376 in exceptional volume of 293,600 shares as analysts said that institutionals had seen it as undervalued. STOCKHOLM was disappointed when the Riksbank left Swedish interest rates unchanged and when Ericsson, the high flying telecommunications group, managed to disappoint the market with a forecast that 1993 profits would be 'somewhat more than doubled'. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 3.10 to 1,396.60, Ericsson was unchanged on the day at SKr413, down from an intraday high of SKr426, and Volvo's turnround from a loss to profits substantially higher than expected left the carmaker only SKr3 higher at SKr422. WARSAW plunged under selling pressure from small investors trying to raise cash to buy shares of Bank Slaski in Poland's biggest ever public offering. The WIG index fell 537, or 5.9 per cent to 8,609.8 and turnover was a very active 1,600bn zloty as investors placed 47,823 orders, an all-time record.

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Doctors warn on community care plans MANY FAMILY doctors lack confidence that adequate resources will be available when new arrangements for community care come into force on April 1, a British Medical Association survey shows. It says 64 per cent of general practitioners are not confident that local community care plans will be in place by April. More than 90 per cent of GPs said they had not been consulted on arrangements for discharging people in need of care from hospital to the community, and the survey reflected general concern that the reforms would be underfunded. Local authorities will become responsible for assessing and co-ordinating care for elderly and handicapped people. The intention is to provide care in the community where possible, rather than in institutions. Dr Ian Bogle, chairman of the BMA's general medical services committee, said that unless local authorities contacted individual GP practices to arrange plans, family doctors would end up rescuing patients not getting the services they needed. Mr Tim Yeo, junior health minister responsible for community care, said the government had written to all GPs about their role in the reforms. Health authorities and local authorities should make sure GPs knew about changes in their areas.</p>

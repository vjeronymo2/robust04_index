			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Susanne Rydell report: "Swedish Aid to Sarajevo To Cease"] </F>   [Text] The Swedish aid flights to Sarajevo will end on 20  April. Sweden has said "no" to a request from the UNHCR that it  continue to fly in food and medicine.    Swedish Hercules aircraft have been taking part in the  airlift to Bosnia since the end of January. Two or three times  a day a Swedish plane with much needed supplies has landed in  Sarajevo.    According to the original agreement with the UNHCR, Swedish  aid deliveries would continue for three months, up to 20 April.  The UNHCR's request for an extension of a further three months  has been turned down after consultations between Aid Minister  Alf Svensson and Defense Minister Anders Bjorck.    For primarily technical and not political reasons the  Defense  Ministry is unable to agree to an extension of the agreement,  Foreign Ministry assistant under secretary Lars Schmidt  announced.    "Among other reasons the Hercules aircraft are much the  worse  for wear. One of the aircraft is flying practically nonstop,"  he said.    Only two of the Air Force's eight Hercules aircraft are  being  used for the flights to Sarajevo. The reason is that these two  are the only ones which have special defenses against attack by  heat-seeking missiles.    According to Aid Minister Alf Svensson, one of the reasons  why Sweden has said "no" is that the UNHCR's request came too  late. "We have to be able to plan for things like this. And,  from the beginning, there was talk of only three months."    Alf Svensson said that he has no objections to the way the  Defense Ministry views the matter. "I cannot insist on Swedish  aid flights to Bosnia if both Swedish personnel and the Swedish  aircraft are run down."    The decision to end aid flights was not reached for economic  reasons, according to the aid minister. He stressed that Sweden  is prepared to resume aid flights again at a later date.    For the time being at least the Defense Ministry has also  said "no" to Swedish aid flights to Tuzla. "The security  question has not been resolved yet. The necessary preconditions  for an airlift do not exist in Tuzla," Lars Schmidt said.    According to Ingemar Cederberg, assistant under secretary at  the Foreign Ministry and responsible for the coordination of  disaster aid, the question of aid flights to Tuzla has been  partially resolved because Norway has responded positively to a  request that it undertake such flights, if they are possible  from the safety and security viewpoint.    The airlift to Sarajevo has been suspended since Monday as a  result of the escalation of the conflict.</p>

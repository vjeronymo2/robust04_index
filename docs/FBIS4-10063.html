			<p>BFN     [Text] Members of the legislative branch reacted with  rejection, condemnation, uncertainty, and doubt upon learning of  the plot against President Carlos Roberto Reina. Although many  refused to comment, others expressed surprised at the report  because they had met with the president that morning and he did  not say anything to them. Congressmen also referred to  criticism by several Hondurans who are accusing the government  of using the situation as a smokescreen to cover up the economic  measures, noting that if that were the case, it would be very  irresponsible.    Rafael Pineda Ponce, National Congress first vice president,  called the act condemnable "because no one has the right to take  the life of any citizen, much less the president." In his  opinion, the state security organizations should conduct the  investigation because their constitutional mission is to  guarantee the Hondurans' lives and property. If the idea was to  distract people to stop them from criticizing the rising fuel  and milk prices, that would be really irresponsible because the  country is ready to make a social pact among all political,  social, and economic forces. "The country does not belong to  the Reina administration or anyone in particular. It belongs to  everyone, from the most arrogant and haughty to the humblest  citizens," he added.    Liberal Alberto Orellana said he was surprised by the report  and deplores the incident. "Whether we like it or not, Reina is  the democratically elected president and we must condemn such a  situation," he said. He did not rule out the possibility that  the thwarted attack was a result of the people's desperation  over spiraling costs and dire poverty. "We can think of so many  things, things that someone starving might do, but hopefully it  is nothing like that, only a false alarm," he added.    Roberto Micheletti, secretary general [of the Liberal Party  Central Executive Council], said he was surprised by the report  and termed the situation loathsome. "If it is confirmed, I hope  the responsible parties will be turned over to the courts and  sentenced to the full extent of the law because this country  elected its leaders democratically and we want to live in  peace," he stated.    When asked about accusations that the incident could be a  smokescreen, he said "if that were the case, it is wrong and  undignified. To show such disrespect for the president's life,  to cover up a situation that we Hondurans are experiencing, is  wrong and reproachable," he said.    Liberal wing head Santiago David Amador condemned any attack  against the life of a human being, in this case the president of  the Republic. He said he is waiting for a report from the Armed  Forces and asked God "to enlighten the minds and attitudes that  bring disgrace to the people." He stated he is satisfied with  the intelligence service reports and ruled out the possibility  that the report was made to hide the country's real situation.  "No way, one thing cannot be compared to another. One is an  economic issue, and the other is a human life," he said.    Nationalist Jorge Zelaya termed the report dubious because  "it is strange military intelligence did not issue it, just as  they did not issue the report when there was an attack against  former President Roberto Suazo Cordova. Strangely enough, the  report comes from the Government Ministry when it happens that  economic decisions have been made and measures taken at the same  time," he said.    Cesar Castellanos, chief of the nationalist wing, said there  is some doubt because Honduran and Nicaraguan military  authorities have been at odds over the reports they have given.  "I would like to wait a little longer and learn about the  investigations because I have found a series of contradictions  and facts that are disconcerting. It has been 15 days and  nobody has been arrested and there is no specific  investigation," he noted. He added that the statements being  made clearly show the military authorities were not properly  informed and now they are trying to say that they knew about  something when they really did not.</p>

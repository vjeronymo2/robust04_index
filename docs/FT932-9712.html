			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Survey of North American Free Trade (9): Conflicting objectives - Extending the Treaty MEXICO City is not the only Latin American capital closely following the Nafta debate in Washington. For some countries, notably some smaller economies in central America and the Caribbean, the concern is that Nafta will divert trade away from them towards Mexico. That concern has been intensified by criticism from the Clinton administration of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which offers special treatment for the region's goods in the US market. Some other governments are seeking clues about whether the pact can be extended southwards. The Clinton administration has professed itself open to the extension of the agreement to the rest of the region, citing Chile as the next candidate. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, has also spoken of Argentina and Venezuela joining the pact. But if Nafta falls in the US Congress - or is delayed so long that the Mexican government decides the political cost of the agreement is too high - this possibility becomes remote indeed. 'The rejection of Nafta at this stage would gut the core of future hemisphere-wide trade arrangements,' said the InterAmerican Dialogue in a report published in December. 'If the 600lb gorilla doesn't have the political weight in Washington to secure a free trade agreement,' says Mr Mark Falcoff of the American Enterprise Institute speaking of Mexico, 'what chances do the others have?' The idea of a western hemisphere free-trade agreement, mooted by President George Bush as part of his Enterprise for Americas Initiative in June 1990, was greeted enthusiastically by most Latin governments. This was despite differences over the trade benefits of such agreements. A study published early last year by Mr Refik Erzan and Mr Alexander Yeats, two World Bank economists, suggested the trade gains of free trade arrangements with the US would be limited for most Latin American countries. This was mainly because most Latin countries - in contrast with some Asian economies - already faced a relatively open market anyway in the US under the Generalised System of Preferences. Only Mexico and Brazil - the latter a likely loser from Nafta because its mix of exports is, of all Latin countries, most similar to Mexico's - stood to make significant trade gains from free trade with the US. This conclusion is not universally accepted. However, there is much wider agreement that the benefits of free trade accords with the US are not limited to export gains. The bigger benefits may come in enhanced investment flows: market size is an important factor in the decisions of companies making foreign direct investment decisions. Furthermore, the signing of an international treaty offers additional protection for investors by locking in policies that provide some assurance that investments will not be expropriated by future governments. Such accords improve the prospects for economic co-ordination among regional partners. Importantly, at a time when the future of the world trading system is being questioned, they offer some insurance against a more restrictive world trading environment. Yet there is little doubt that, at least in some quarters of the US administration, the view of the benefits of free trade agreements with Latin America is different from that of the Bush administration. Mr Kantor has spoken of the importance of Nafta in 'harmonising upwards workers' standards.' The Clinton administration's overall thrust for Latin policy, inasmuch as any guidance has been given in public statements, lays more emphasis on such social and environmental concerns than the Bush administration. If this suggests free trade agreements being used as levers to obtain improved social and working conditions in Latin countries, it contrasts with the Bush administration philosophy which implicitly assumed - at least until its final year in office - that encouraging growth would take care of other problems. The implications of this for the sovereignty of Latin governments are potentially substantial. Some of those administrations with less to gain than Mexico from an agreement - in other words, most of the continent - may thus be less disposed to free trade with the Clinton administration than they would have been with a Bush administration. There are other complications. There is no doubting that, in contrast with the past, regional economic integration is now a practical possibility because of the openness of most Latin economies. There is no doubting either the political weight behind regional integration. However, what has developed is a patchwork of regional groupings with sometimes potentially conflicting objectives. One example, but by no means the only one, provides an illustration. Argentina is committed to Mercosur, the proposed customs union which groups it with Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay. Brazil's economic instability threatens to destabilise the Mercosur timetable. But not only that: Argentina's recent good economic record makes it a potential candidate for Nafta, as Mr Kantor has noted. Brazil, on the other hand, is economically a long way from the point at it which it could conceive of joining Nafta and the political interest in the topic in Braslia is - unlike in Argentina - currently lukewarm. Yet Argentina and Brazil are committed to negotiate together in Mercosur their trade arrangements with third parties such as the US. Something will have to give.  -----------------------------------------------     PERCENTAGE OF TRADE WITH THE US (1991)  ----------------------------------------------- Country              Exports       Imports  ----------------------------------------------- Argentina              9.7           28.2 Brazil                20.3           23.6 Chile                 17.7           23.7 Colombia              40.5           37.7 Mexico                78.5           70.8 Peru                  25.0           24.9 Venezuela             50.7           49.4  ----------------------------------------------- Source: IMF Direction of Trade Statistics  -----------------------------------------------</p>

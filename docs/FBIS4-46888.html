			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V.M. Usoskin, doctor of economic sciences, </F> professor, and sector head of the Institute of World Economics  and International Relations of the Russian Academy of Sciences  (IMEMO RAN): "Should We `Introduce' a Federal Reserve System?"]    [Text] The idea of the need to reform the Central Bank of  Russia (CBR) on the model of the United States Federal Reserve  System [FRS] has been more and more often expressed in the press  recently. The latest evidence of this is an article in  FINANSOVYE IZVESTIYA (No. 13, 31 March-6 April 1994), entitled  "The Central Bank Is Ready To Establish a Federal Reserve  System". Alluding to an interview with the responsible  representative of the CBR, the article says that "there is no  basic difference between an FRS and the CBR," that "they fulfill  identical functions," that "the CBR is ready to start conversion  to an FRS and the consolidation of regional administrations,  reducing their number from 80 to 20," etc. If one compares these  statements with other publications on this subject, it is  essentially a question of "dispersing the power" of the CBR and  turning over to the regional level the solutions to a number of  important problems of credit policy and other functions.    The details of the plan being developed so far have not  become public property and one can speak only of the general  idea. It is a fact that the CBR in its present form has found  itself little adaptable to fulfilling the role of coordinator  and regulator of the processes in the monetary-credit sphere,  under the conditions of the difficult transition of the  country's economy to the market rails. With the departure from  the planned-administrative model, control over monetary  circulation and the movement of credit flows was serious  weakened. No reliable and integral mechanism of financial  management has been created yet, although individual elements of  it are already springing up. Reform of the CBR is necessary and  inevitable.    Quite a different matter is--how and in what forms to carry  out the reform of the CBR. Should we take "as the basis" the  structure and functioning mechanism of a "strong" foreign  central bank, such as, for example, the United States FRS, or  should we attempt, on the basis of a careful study of world  experience, to create our own model of a CBR, oriented toward  our potentials, economic conditions and the degree of  development of the financial infrastructure and market  relations? The second path is naturally preferable, although it  requires more time and a large amount of preparatory work. The  readiness with which our officials, without sufficiently  thorough study of the problem and broad public discussion of it,  are inclined toward the first variant is therefore puzzling.    Incidentally, this is not the only attempt to blindly  "introduce" the FRS model on Russian soil, on the basis of  superficial analogies. As far back as the period of preparing  the Law on the USSR State Bank in 1990, the idea of a transition  to a federal structure for the CBR (with the republic offices of  Gosbank converted to "central banks of the republics") was  discussed by the developers as some sort of a stunt to preserve  the Union's unified banking system. This approach, stimulated by  current political considerations and not based on a realistic  model of the functioning of the institutions being created, is  not very effective and fraught with serious losses. For example,  the "Western" methods of credit regulation transferred from the  1990 USSR law to Russian banking legislation were not  efficiently activated because the appropriate conditions were  lacking.    They say that "conversion to an FRS" can be accomplished  rapidly and painlessly, that the functions of central banks  throughout the world are identical. In reality, central banks  everywhere control the emission of money, make monetary  settlements on a nationwide scale, grant loans to commercial  banks, fulfill the role of financial agent for the Treasury,  etc. Here the analogy ends, however, for all central banks solve  the problems facing them in a different way. The relations of  these banks with the government and Ministry of Finance are  different, the set of administrative and market methods of  regulation when following a credit policy are different, and the  scale and forms of refinancing for commercial banks are  different, and this is true not only for the CBR of Russia and  the FRS of the United States, but also for the FRS, on the one  hand, and the central banks of France, Japan, Germany and Great  Britain, on the other.    Our legislators are primarily attracted to the FRS by its  external facade--a decentralized structure that at first glance  resembles Russia with its vast territory, existence of large  regions with organized national economic complexes, and  difficulty in central administration under the conditions of  abolishing the iron discipline inherent in the  administrative-bureaucratic model. Hence the natural impulse to  copy the already prepared form.    One must, however, take into consideration the fact that the  external decentralization of the central bank structure of the  United States is the result of the long historical development  of the banking sector in that country and the complex  interweaving of political and socioeconomic factors. In the  course of many years, a situation of conflict formed around the  creation of the central bank in the United States. Small banks  saw in the central bank an instrument of the dictates of the  large banking associations. Industrialists wanted to establish a  bank independent of government pressure and to ensure the  stability of the monetary unit. Agrarians, however, defended the  idea of decentralizing functions and inexpensive loans.    The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 is the model for the  political commission. Its authors idea was that the  "decentralizing principle" of the FRS was ensured by  establishing 12 regional federal banks (one in each of the  districts created for this purpose). These banks, in the  aggregate, formed something like a "collective" central bank;  their capital belonged to the member-banks of the FRS of the  given district, and they represented local interests when a  credit policy was formed. Centralization was achieved through  the head agency of the system--the Federal Reserve  Administration (subsequently--the FRS Board of Governors) in  Washington. The members of the Board are appointed by the  President of the United States with congressional approval. The  law specifies a number of measures here to lessen FRS dependence  on the executive power (the members of the Board are appointed  for long terms--up to 14 years, the FRS has independent sources  of income, etc.).    In the years that followed, the system underwent  considerable  evolution, the main result of which consisted of the narrowing  of the autonomy of the federal banks and the establishment of a  centralizing principle. Externally, however, the system  preserved the features of a decentralized institution and its  basic principles, incorporated in the Federal Reserve Act, were  not changed.    The FRS differs considerably from other Western central  banks, not only in its unique "three-stage" structure (Board of  Governors-Federal Reserve Banks-FRS member-banks), but also in  many functional features. It retains greater independence from  the Treasury than many West European central banks, which are  often directly subordinate to the force of edicts from the  Ministry of Finance. The basic specific characteristic, however,  is related to the system of regulating the monetary mass and  interest rates. In contrast to the countries of Western Europe,  where administrative (selective) methods of control, in the form  of credit quotas and limits for individual sectors, groups of  banks and major credit institutions are quite widespread, the  FRS relies on the "classic triad" of common methods of credit  regulation and rarely resorts to selective control. In this  case, operations on the open market--buying and selling of state  securities by the central bank--serve as the main means of  operational regulation of the money market situation.    The basis of controlling credit flows is the system of  minimum compulsory reserves, to which the FRS is bound by its  title and which arose long before a central bank was established  in the United States. As far back as the 1830's, legislation  introduced a compulsory metal reserve that was to guarantee the  bank notes being issued at that time by commercial banks. Later  on, a multistage system of reserve guarantee of liability for  deposits was formed, in which the provincial banks kept reserves  for accounts in municipal banks, and these in turn--in banks of  the main financial centers. This system led to a concentration  of the demand for payment funds in large credit institutions,  which in turn exacerbated the course of the financial crises.    With the formation of the FRS, the function of  reserve-keeping was transferred to the regional federal banks,  but in this case the guarantee-insurance role of the reserves  moved to the background. Minimum reserves became the basis of  the mechanism of centralized regulation of the credit market.    It should be particularly emphasized that, in contrast to  other countries, the reserve accounts of the banks in the FRS  are not a "depository" of money taken out of economic  circulation; for these accounts the turnover passes through  interbank transactions connected with the collection of checks  and other payment documents through FRS, interbank loans,  securities operations, etc. These are "live," actively  functioning accounts, in which some banks temporarily accumulate  excess funds, and others incur a deficit (as compared with the  compulsory norm). The banks are constantly forced to correct  their reserve position, and the FRS, through the reserves, can  affect the volume and structure of banking operations and,  consequently, the credit market situation. The actual process of  correction is very complicated, and it is hard to predict its  ultimate outcome. The FRS does not try to determine how the  credit infusions into the economy will be used. It tries to  influence the general financial climate in the country, at the  level of interest rates.    Of the three "classic" instruments--the normative of  compulsory reserves, the rediscount rate, operations on the open  market--the latter, as was stated above, becomes the basic  support. The norms for compulsory reserves in the United States  have rarely and very carefully been changed in the last few  years (for example, with respect to time and Eurodollar  deposits, the last change was in December 1990, and for  transaction accounts--in December 1992). It is felt that this is  too drastic a means and is unsuitable for everyday corrections.    As for the crediting of the central banks at the rediscount  rate, the federal reserve banks carry out these operations  selectively and in minimal amounts, acting as a "creditor in the  last instance." In May 1993, unpaid FRS loans to commercial  banks constituted $128 million, that is, a little over  three-hundredths of a percent of the total sum of the FRS assets  on this date.    On the other hand, the FRS carries out operations in buying  and selling large consignments of state securities regularly,  sometimes daily. The FRS management regards them as a means,  more suited to American credit market conditions, of influencing  business conditions--soft, easily dispensed and quickly  producing an effect. The New York Federal Reserve Bank conducts  operations on the open market through authorized dealers. The  total of the operations varies within a range of from $1 million  to $1 billion and more per day. The Federal Open Market  Committee, which includes all seven managing members of the  Board and the presidents of five federal banks (the latter  periodically rotated), gives the instructions for carrying out  the operations. It is also the main body for operative control  of the credit policy.    Even a very fragmentary and incomplete survey of the special  features of the FRS shows that it is a central bank system that  does not conform to Russian conditions. The system of regulating  monetary circulation and credit is based on an "active"  mechanism of reserve coverage. At the same time, refinancing of  commercial banks at the central bank rate is reduced to the  minimum, and the main role is given to operations with state  bonds, which in turn are based on the ramified secondary market  of these bonds and a powerful dealer network. Such a market does  not and will not exist in Russia in the foreseeable future, and  the refinancing mechanism, in the form of a system of  centralized loans, occupies the leading place in the CBR arsenal  for the time being.    "Conversion to an FRS" would entail a lot of large and small  problems, which are sometimes difficult to foresee. Let us take  an apparently technical question such as the arrangement of  federal districts and determination of their size. In the United  States, this question had an underlying political factor, since  the goal in creating the FRS was to prevent a concentration of  economic power in any financial grouping. The size of the  district territory and the number of banks on this territory  were regarded as the "balancing" factor. In the northeast, where  the most powerful banks were located, several small reserve  districts were created. For example, the New York Federal  District includes the state of New York and part of the state of  New Jersey. At the same time, the Federal Reserve Bank of New  York accounts for 25 percent of all the FRS assets. In the  midwest and western United States, where there were no large  banking associations, the federal reserve districts cover vast  territories. Let us now picture Russia's "federal reserve  system." What principle of federal division should be chosen, if  one takes into consideration the tremendous differences in the  development of the banking structures, the plurality of  Federation constituents, the "war of sovereignties," etc.?    Consequently, when selecting a model for the CBR in Russia,  we must make use of the wealth of experience accumulated by the  world banking fellowship. At the same time, however, there must  be thorough and painstaking preliminary work, a comparison of  the experience of different countries and a selection of the  forms that are promising under the specific conditions of the  transitional period. In any case, when solving such a crucial  problem, we must not be guided by superficial analogies and the  political considerations of the moment.</p>

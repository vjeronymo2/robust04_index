			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] An extended round of talks was held today  between the brother leader of the revolution [al-Qadhdhafi] and  Egyptian President Husni Mubarak. The meeting was attended by  brothers secretary for the General People's Committee, the  secretary for the People's Bureau for Foreign Liaison and  International Cooperation, and the ministerial delegation  accompanying President Mubarak.    The talks dealt with bilateral cooperation between the two  brotherly countries, and Arab and international issues of mutual  interest. [passage omitted]    Egyptian President Husni Mubarak later left Surt today at  the  end of this visit to the Great Jamahiriyah. The brother leader  of the revolution was at the head of those saying farewell to  President Husni Mubarak at Khalij Surt's civilian airport.  [passage omitted]    President Mubarak made a statement to JANA's correspondent  before departure. He said: My visits to the Great Jamahiriyah  are continuous and have a positive effect on the Arab people in  Egypt and Libya. Our meeting as brothers gives us the  opportunity to exchange views in Arab, international, and  bilateral issues.    He indicated that all these topics were discussed during the  meeting.    Concerning the Great Jamahiriyah's absence from a meeting of  Mediterranean basin countries due to be held in Cairo next week,  President Husni Mubarak said that a restricted preparatory  committee meeting will be held, and not all Mediterranean basin  countries will participate. It will prepare a conference, draw  up an agenda, and specify topics for discussion and when and who  will take part.</p>

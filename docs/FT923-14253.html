			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Barter trade to grow with CIS states despite big risks COMPENSATION trade, a sophisticated form of barter, will grow in importance with the financially-pressed states of the former Soviet Union, according to Mr Hans-Joachim Skrobanek, a specialist in this field who heads Finance by Trade (FTB), a subsidiary of Berliner Bank. The risks involved are considerable and grow with the number of official approvals needed before Russian and Ukrainian products, for example, can get from the producer to the western buyer. 'Each one of the official links can fail to keep a promise or simply break it,' he said. Nevertheless, compensation trade, or buy-back as it is also known, was likely to make up a significant proportion of German trade with CIS republics and some eastern European countries for some time to come. One reason was that the German government was unlikely to expand its Hermes export credit guarantees for CIS beyond the DM10bn (Dollars 6.5bn) promised by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Mr Skrobanek estimated that in 1990, 25 per cent of west German exports to the Soviet Union were based on compensation trade and variations of it. The percentage rose sharply in 1991 when many Russian companies carried out non-approved barter deals with the west. FTB, which does nearly DM150m (Dollars 98.6m) in business with the east  - mainly Russia - is the only compensation trade company owned by a German bank. Nearly half its customers are east German companies whose trade with the CIS has declined greatly. There has been a recent fall, however, in barter-type transactions with the CIS as deals need to be individually approved by the Russian government. This has been a reaction to an estimated outflow in 1990/91 of DM12bn-DM15bn which was deposited by Russian companies in western bank accounts after the old approval mechanism broke down, Mr Skrobanek said. The companies are now forced to pay nearly half of the hard currency they earn to the state and receive roubles in return. The Russian government's refusal to allow Russian companies to deposit their earnings from barter trade in western banks has made barter deals more risky for western exporters. Oil, precious metals and chemicals remain the products most commonly bartered by the Russians but even these run up against logistical problems. Heating oil and metal ore are partly shipped via Baltic ports but the newly-independent Baltic republics frequently restrict the amounts, and the ports of Leningrad and Kaliningrad cannot cope with any increase. Romania and Bulgaria, whose market economies are rudimentary, have the greatest need for barter trade in eastern Europe. By contrast, only 5 per cent of the trade with Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary - all of which have internal convertibility of their currencies - is based on barter deals.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Our correspondent Yevgeniy Kuznetsov has reported  from Syktyvkar that today the federal government of Russia set  20 billion rubles aside for the Republic of Komi to enable  essential freight to reach the north of the republic.    What was also achieved is that the money, bypassing the  banks, will be paid directly into the accounts of administrative  bodies of the towns and villages concerned.</p>

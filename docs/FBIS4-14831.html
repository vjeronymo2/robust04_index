			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raimonda Rameliene: "Litas' Exchange Rate Will </F> Be Set by Lobbyists"]    [Text] Following a longer break, V. Landsbergis, leader of  the right-wing opposition, held a press conference at the Seimas  [parliament] yesterday. He spoke not about politics but about  economic and financial issues which, in his opinion, were almost  forgotten by journalists who became fascinated with the recent  sensations. The speaker commented on two new laws adopted by  the Seimas -- on the litas' viability and land which were  "accompanied" by statements from the Homeland Union (Lithuanian  Conservatives).    According to the professor, the news that international  organizations and banks are suspending credits for Lithuania  could mean that "the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP]  has run into a deadlock." Thus, the perspective, certainly, if  it is not changed by some political decisions, looks quite  somber: Being deprived of Western credits, the LDDP may resolve  to borrow from Moscow. Incidentally, "Russia has indirectly  sucked in the large part of all loans received by Lithuania  until now, because credits have been extended for enterprises  which produce goods for the Russian market and sell them at  lower prices." This way, Russia has received additional  assistance from the West through Lithuania. "Later on, Russia  will probably buy Lithuania for Western credits."    Since the litas' exchange rate will be determined by the  government from now on, the gate for corruption will become even  wider. The conservatives' statement reads that "seeing the  corrupt goals of the LDDP government, such a monetary policy  when LDDP leaders will be able to agree on the litas' exchange  rate in advance will develop into hard currency speculations  among a "group of comrades" by profiting from other businessmen  and bankers who are not "comrades" and who will have no access  to the party money market or will have to yield to the monopoly  of LDDP banks despite their wishes." V. Landsbergis specified  that the "litas exchange rate will be set by lobbyists who have  access to the president." He also reported that the opposition  was planning to appeal the law on land to the Constitutional  Court. It would even request to review this issue as a priority  (certainly, after the president's decision).    Asked whether the Homeland Union would support the  nationalists' proposal to hold elections to the Seimas and  self-governments in fall, V. Landsbergis replied: "Homeland  Union's definite position is that the Seimas elections should be  held simultaneously with the elections to self-governments.  There may be different ways to achieve this. Thus far,  preparations for a possible referendum have been under way." He  also added that in a normal democratic state, such a bankrupt  government as the Lithuanian one would itself express the desire  for early elections and announce them.    Asked about his expectations concerning the meeting of the  three presidents in Palanga, the professor replied that he  wished A. Brazauskas would warn the Latvian and Estonian  presidents against engaging in any discussions on occupation and  annexation, which Russia wants to impose as an issue worthy of  attention. "We have Russia's recognition and the condemnation  of that annexation. The Lithuanian president has a good chance  to remind his colleagues that they could follow Lithuania's  agreement with Russia because the situation is absolutely  identical," said V. Landsbergis.</p>

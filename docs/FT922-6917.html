			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson rumour lifts BP THE MARKET was set alight in early trading with rumours that Hanson had moved to buy the Kuwait Investment Office's 9.8 per cent stake in British Petroleum - provoking speculation that the conglomerate was setting its sights on the troubled oil company. No basis could be found for the story, although the repercussions acted on both companies' shares all day, with BP up 10 at one stage before retreating to close at 261p, a gain of 5 on the day. After an initial rise, Hanson slipped back to close 3 off at 228 1/2 p. A bulky 22m shares were traded in BP. Most analysts were sceptical that Hanson would consider BP, either as an investment or a bid, because of the illogical fit with its present strategy and portfolio - although a trader said yesterday's story was the third in recent weeks linking the two groups. Argyll retreats Food retailer Argyll Group was one of the worst performers among the FT-SE 100 constituents as its results failed to excite and a large line of stock looking for a home held down the share price. The full-year figures were within market expectations, but after last week's sparkling results from rival J. Sainsbury, the lack of surprises yesterday dulled the response. The stock was further undermined by a securities house having some problems placing 3.5m Argyll shares. However, turnover of 10m shares by the close, more than twice the usual volume in the stock, suggested that the house was finally successful. While the increased dividend helped sentiment, Argyll's current trading was below some forecasts. One analyst also complained that the group concentrated too much at its presentation on plans for the Lo-Cost supermarket operations rather than on the upmarket Presto chain. The shares declined 10 to 357p. Composite insurer Commercial Union, which reported first-quarter results yesterday, and launched a preference share issue, retreated 6 to 504p as word went round the market that Sun Alliance was about to place its stake in CU of around 14.5 per cent. Among those to discount the talk was Mr Steven Bird, of Smith New Court, who said the stake was 'unlikely to be placed at the moment'. The market was, however, pleased by the trading performance at CU, which revealed losses 20 per cent lower at Pounds 19.2m, and at the same time launched a Pounds 100m preference share issue, to be placed through Hoare Govett and Cazenove, to finance expansion. BZW said it remains a seller of the shares 'because we believe they are over-distributed on the dividend front and are trading above net asset value'. On the bull side, Smith said: 'The company has got a superior underwriting record. Unlike others in the sector, it is looking to make substantial profits in two years time.' Profit-taking weakened Sun Alliance, which finished 3 lower at 321p in spite of an upbeat annual meeting. Well-received results from Land Securities lifted the stock and other leading property shares, although there was little news to cheer those looking for a revival in the sector. Mr Graham Stanley at County NatWest said: 'There were glimmers of hope in the retail market outside of the south-east, but these were cancelled out by the depressing picture elsewhere, particularly in the central London office market.' He has reduced his profits forecast for next year to Pounds 233m from Pounds 239m, citing the cost of the group's move away from offices and more into retail. The shares rose 9 to 440p. Some investors looked to switch out of Land Securities, preferring instead British Land, up 11 at 214p, MEPC, 9 ahead at 346p, and Slough Estates, also 9 to the good at 196p. In spite of figures below expectations, Ranks Hovis McDougall moved ahead as spurious bid talk was again heard. Analysts were particularly disturbed by the downbeat theme adopted by the company on present trading conditions, plus the 62 per cent fall in milling and breadmaking revenue. Smith New Court pared its current year profits forecast by Pounds 7m to Pounds 98m, while Nomura reduced its estimate by Pounds 12m to the same amount. Next year, they forecast Pounds 105m and Pounds 109m respectively. The shares put on 5 to 234p. Brewer Bass turned in positive interim results, the shares advancing 11 to 631p. County NatWest is looking for Pounds 528m for the full year and Pounds 638m in 1993. Talk of a price war in the food retail market led to weakness in the sector. J. Sainsbury slipped 2 1/2 to 465p, Tesco 8 to 280p and Kwik Save 5 to 625p. Asda, however, continued to benefit from bid talk, edging 1 1/2 higher to 33 1/4 p in volume of 28m. The creeping pace of recovery in the hotel market was behind two forecast downgrades in Forte, which dipped 4 to 245p. Kleinwort Benson cut its current year estimate by Pounds 10m to Pounds 115m, while another house was reported to have come down to Pounds 125m. Turnover in Pilkington rose to 11m and the shares firmed 2 to 161p, after two blocks of 7.7m and 2.7m respectively went through the market. The bulk of the volume was said to have arisen from BZW selling the remainder of the 31m shares bought from BTR earlier this month. The reiteration of a buy recommendation by Kleinwort Benson on Inchcape boosted the stock, which climbed 12 to 513p on turnover of 1.8m. Bowater rose 12 to 850p. The shares are favoured by BZW, which has issued a weighty document on the stock that is due to land on investors' desks today. The broker lifted its current year forecast by Pounds 3m to Pounds 155m and the following year's by Pounds 12m to Pounds 188m. Fears that bankers to Eurotunnel could withdraw funding unless the company settles a dispute with the tunnel's contractor TML by August hurt the shares, which shed 8 to 380p. British Airways continued to bask in the glow of its spectacular results aired on Tuesday. The shares added 13 at 380p on some 10m traded. A badly handled order in NFC caused the shares to lose part of an earlier gain. They ended 9 up at 282p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (300).

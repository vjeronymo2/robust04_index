			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILKEN'S SENTENCE  </P> <P> There is a sad connection between the fall of Milken and the legal profession.  He either failed to obtain proper legal advice or refused to heed such advice  before and during his commission of felonies.  </P> <P> With an army of lawyers at his side during the design, planning and execution  of his deals, one would think that one or two brave counselors would have  risked losing a client or rise above the "billable time" complex to warn Milken  that money is no excuse to ignore the law. Perhaps his brother Lowell was or  should have been such a counselor.  </P> <P> As to being lenient because of charitable work, the law should not distinguish  between white- and blue-collar crime. The ordinary criminal may be just as  charitable to his family and friends as the man who has too much money to keep  it all.  </P> <P> KENNETH Z. LAUTMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- The Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) said Tuesday [24 May] it  has launched a new task force to expand Japan's role in  enforcing new trade rules under the planned World Trade  Organization (WTO).    Comprising such people as scholars, business leaders and  journalists, the MITI panel is designed to coordinate Japan's  views on a wide range of trade issues that may emerge under the  WTO system, MITI said.    Specifically, the panel will study how to enforce WTO trade  rules on the domestic front and clarify Japan's stance on  proposed admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  by China and Taiwan, MITI said.    Newly emerging trade-related issues under the WTO, such as  competition, the environment, labor problems and investment,  will also be on the task force's agenda, which holds regular  consultations twice a year, MITI said.    Recommendations by the panel could be consulted, for  example,  when Japan becomes a target of retaliatory trade tactics such as  the United States' Super 301, a MITI official said.</p>

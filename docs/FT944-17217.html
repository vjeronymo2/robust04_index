			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Rise in interest rates hits public optimism Last month's rise in interest rates sharply reversed a rise in public optimism about employment prospects and the economy, says the latest FT/MFS Mood of the Nation index. The index has fallen from 91 in early August to 83 at the end of September, the lowest figure since the spring. Professor Robert Worcester, chairman of MORI Financial Services, the index compiler, said: 'What is worse for the government, the beneficiaries of the interest rate rise do not register any increase in approval, while those who are hit by it register strong disapproval.' The 24 per cent of householders who own their homes outright, and who are more likely to be net savers, registered an index figure for their mood of 125, the same as in August. Mortgage holders, who make up 44 per cent of householders, registered a decline from 86 to 80, and council tenants, who make up 22 per cent of householders, from 80 to 71. The mood - judged by three questions on well-being and employment security - started at 100 in April 1993. It fell sharply until March, since when it recovered to a peak of 91 at the beginning of August. The most recent fall in optimism is much stronger among women than men and is much stronger in the 25 to 34 age group than among the old. Like other surveys, the Mood of the Nation index suggests that fear of redundancy remains high in spite of the fall in registered unemployment. The unemployment index remained at 7 per cent, as it has in the past 12 months.</p>

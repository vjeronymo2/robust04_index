			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Member of Parliament Boris Kakubava, leader </F> of the Union for the Liberation of Abkhazia, by Eteri Kakabadze;  place and date not given: "`I Even Know This Man'"]    [Text]The mass media are currently disseminating statements  from the newly formed Abkhazian movement "For a Peaceful  Abkhazia" in which there are calls for more radical efforts to  settle the conflict in Abkhazia and bring about the return of  refugees to their native homes.    It is clearly stated in them that, if politicians are unable  to agree, the healthy part of the Abkhazian nation will deal  with Ardzinba's hateful regime by force of arms for all the  suffering caused and the tears and blood shed by its people.  Unfortunately, there is, as yet, no reliable information  regarding the authors of these statements and to what extent  they represent an influential force. In any case, Vice Prime  Minister Tamaz Nadareishvili said, in his response to these  statements, that he pins great hopes on the new movement,  believing that a serious opposition to Ardzinba and his henchmen  has appeared. Member of Parliament Boris Kakubava, leader of  the Union for the Liberation of Abkhazia, holds a different view.    In an exclusive interview to our paper, he stated that, in  actual fact, no movement exists and, at best, it is represented  by one person and he even knows who this is. Boris Kakubava  called the movement "For a Peaceful Abkhazia" a one-man show run  by someone preoccupied with immediate interests.    [Kakubava] One can hardly find a dozen Abkhazians today who  do not feel intense hostility toward Georgians and Georgia.  This hatred has been nurtured in them for decades and,  moreover, not without help from the policies being conducted by  Shevardnadze. From where could such an entire movement appear?  I believe this movement was not created in Sukhumi, but here in  Tbilisi with the aim of misleading the people and passing off  desire for reality. It is possible this has been done with good  intentions in order to pacify the hundreds of thousands of  refugees: According to him, a split has already been noticed in  Abkhazia and, along with this, the chance has appeared for the  refugees to return to their native villages. I believe that the  return of Georgians to Abkhazia is in the hands of the Union for  the Liberation of Abkhazia, that is to say in our hands. No  other forces will help us in this.    [Kakabadze] Do you think that the Geneva negotiations hold  any prospects or have they already lost their meaning?    [Kakubava] All Georgia already knows my views regarding  these negotiations. I still believe that the series of talks  that has already taken place will harm Georgia's interests. It  has come about that the peaceful community has learnt that there  is an enslaved Georgian country called Abkhazia and that 1  percent of its population has won a war against the remaining 99  percent. We are so impotent that we ourselves cannot stand up  for the integrity of our state and are asking anyone for help.  We need neither UN troops nor the help of the world community,  especially Russia, to get Abkhazia back. We need the world  community and the United Nations for one thing only -- to  protect us from Russia's interference in our internal affairs.  This is our main problem; the rest we can do ourselves.</p>

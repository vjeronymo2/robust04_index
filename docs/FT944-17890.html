			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Leadership faces defeat on defence Mr Tony Blair is today expected to face his first defeat at the Labour conference - on a renewed demand for the scrapping of the Trident missile system. Advocates of nuclear disarmament disregarded an appeal by Mr Neil Kinnock, in his final speech as a member of the party's national executive committee, to reject the resolution. They demanded a card vote. The resolution, which also calls for Britain's defence spending to be cut to the level of other countries in western Europe, is likely to be approved. Ironically, Mr Kinnock's emotional speech was accorded a standing ovation. In it he expressed his gratitude for having been given a 'mandate' when he was Labour leader to change the party's unilateralist policy on nuclear disarmament. Delegates laughed and cheered when Mr Kinnock told them: 'Our relationship has not, on all occasions, been marked by peace, and light and mutual admiration.' Mr Kinnock, who will soon take up his post as a European commissioner in Brussels, said he would regret to his dying day his failure to lead the party to victory. Labour's defeat in the 1992 general election had been a tragedy for the country 'because it extended the years of injustice, waste and lost opportunities'. Now the party had a new opportunity and, after Mr Blair's first conference speech as party leader, the country knew that he could be trusted with the power of government. Urging the conference to reject the demand to scrap Trident, Mr Kinnock underlined the need to keep the trust of the people. He warned that the weakening of Britain's ability to defend itself would also jeopardise the chance of further action to achieve mutual and balanced reductions of all armaments.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CURTAIN RISES: EASTERN EUROPE, 1989;  </P> <P> VOICES;  </P> <P> 'THIS CAN'T HAPPEN, THIS CAN'T REALLY BE TRUE'  </P> <P> Sigrid -- she declined to give her last name -- a coach from Bernau, says of  East Germany: "If I weren't a single mother, I'd be out of here and in the West  in a second. But I have a daughter who's 9 and a 15-year-old son. Once my son  finishes school this June, we're leaving.  </P> <P> "I was in Dresden for a performance the night they opened the Wall. My friends  and I saw it on TV and jumped in the car.  </P> <P> "You just can't grasp what it's like to live your life with someone telling you  where you can or can't go -- what it's like not to have the simple freedom to  do what you want, when you want, to go wherever you want.  </P> <P> "I'm 37 years old, and I grew up knowing nothing but East Germany and knowing I  would never know anything else of the world.  </P> <P> "When I stood in front of the Wall that night, I cried like a baby. I couldn't  stop.  </P> <P> "My dream, my real fantasy, is to go to America. I want to water ski in  Florida."  </P></p>

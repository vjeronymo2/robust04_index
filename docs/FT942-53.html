			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Luoyang Glass HK listing only just subscribed Luoyang Glass, China's biggest manufacturer of float glass and the first of the second wave of Chinese companies to list in Hong Kong, has had its HKDollars 912.5m issue subscribed just 1.02 times. The company is the 10th China enterprise (H share) to come to the Hong Kong stock market. Like Tianjin Bohai, a HKDollars 408m offering which was barely subscribed last month, it has suffered from a general souring of investor sentiment towards China. On top of this, the scarcity value which ensured that earlier H share issues were heavily oversubscribed no longer applies, prompting potential applicants to pay closer attention to investment fundamentals. 'Luoyang is just a victim of sentiment. This year will be very critical to China because of the macro-economic situation. There are many uncertainties, and so people are downgrading H shares and giving bigger discounts,' said one analyst. In an effort to counter poor demand, advisers to H share companies in the second batch are pricing the shares at a sharp discount to their predecessors. Luoyang's shares were sold at a price-earnings ratio of 10.5 times 1994 earnings, compared with ratios of around 13 times and upwards for the bulk of H shares listed last year. Tsingtao Brewery, which became the first ever H share when it listed last July, was offered on a p/e of 17.9 times 1993 earnings. The company, benefiting from China frenzy, brand recognition and rarity value, saw its issue more than 110 times subscribed. Ms Dora Hung, analyst with Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, says price and fundamentals will be crucial for those coming in the wake of Luoyang Glass. 'The trend going forward will be lower prices. There was a lot of scarcity value attached to Tsingtao's initial public offer, but now the supply has become more balanced,' she says. Based on prevailing market evaluations, she reckons those launching their IPOs in the wake of Luoyang will aim for p/e ratios of between 10 and 13 times, depending upon the industry sector. For those making basic materials and chemicals, margins are expected to be volatile as the Chinese government seeks to control prices as a means of curbing inflation. However, certain stocks - of which Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway is likely to be one - may achieve higher pricing. Luoyang had also scaled back its issue, offering 250m shares against earlier plans for 300m. It is believed the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the mainland securities watchdog, may have had a hand in this decision. In all, 22 companies have been selected this year for an overseas listing and at least five of those are aiming for New York. Shanghai Haixing Shipping is likely to be among the next to list, while Shandong Huaneng Power Development Company is now leading the race to secure a New York listing.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURATEUR DOESN'T WANT 2ND HELPINGS;  </P> <P> BUSINESS: JOHN LEONUDAKIS GOT WHAT MANY CONSIDER A SWEET DEAL TO RUN A POSH  CITY-OWNED RESTAURANT IN IRWINDALE. BUT NOW HE WANTS TO GIVE UP HIS LEASE.  </P> <P> Three years and nearly half a million meals after opening the city's fanciest  restaurant, John Leonudakis wants out.  </P> <P> Since July, the Reno, Nev., businessman has been trying to sell back his lease  on the swank Rapscallion Seafood House and Bar to the city, which owns it.  Leonudakis is frustrated with the Irwindale City Council, said John Ekizian,  Rapscallion's manager and Leonudakis' second in command at the restaurant.  </P> <P> City officials claim that Leonudakis is unsuccessfully trying to run the  restaurant from his headquarters in Reno and has reported losing $250,000 a  year even though the restaurant serves 2,000 meals a week.  </P> <P> Either way, talks are under way between Leonudakis and the city, which may buy  back the lease for an estimated $350,000, in hopes of negotiating a more  lucrative agreement with another operator.  </P> <P> If such a settlement is reached, it will close a brief and novel chapter in  Irwindale's ongoing effort to get the city a nice place to eat.  </P> <P> Located next to an abandoned gravel pit on Irwindale Avenue, Rapscallion is  acknowledged as the city's most posh restaurant. Surrounded by shrubbery and a  plush lawn, it sits in contrast to the otherwise bleak Irwindale landscape  north of the 210 Freeway.  </P> <P> The gravel pit once was intended to become a stadium for the Los Angeles  Raiders, and Rapscallion stood to become the fans' No. 1 watering hole. But the  deal to lure the Raiders to Irwindale fell apart last year. Neither party in  the current Rapscallion lease negotiations cites the Raiders as a factor.  </P> <P> The city built the restaurant in 1986 for $2.4 million after efforts to woo an  outside restaurant to Irwindale failed.  </P> <P> City officials said it was a matter of pride and practicality. To be taken  seriously as a business center, Irwindale had to have a serious restaurant.  </P> <P> "We needed a nice place for our local businessmen to take the people they do  business with," City Manager Fred Herrera said. Other restaurants have since  opened in Irwindale, but at the time, Pudgy's, a taco and hamburger stand, was  about the only place to eat.  </P> <P> Persuading a restaurant chain like Velvet Turtle or Charlie Brown's to open a  branch in Irwindale -- population 1,100 -- proved impossible, Herrera said, so  the city chose to build its own facility and asked Leonudakis to run it for  them.  </P> <P> Leonudakis, who did not return numerous phone calls seeking comment, told The  Times in a 1987 interview that he was initially hesitant about running a  restaurant in Irwindale.  </P> <P> "It didn't make any sense," Leonudakis said. "I looked at the emptiness of this  area and I asked myself: 'Where am I going to get the people to work for me?  Where am I going to get the customers?' "  </P> <P> But the city's offer to lease the restaurant to Leonudakis at an extremely  favorable price persuaded him to take the chance. In March, 1987, Rapscallion  opened for business.  </P> <P> Almost immediately, Leonudakis and the City Council clashed.  </P> <P> The city had originally budgeted $2 million to build, furnish and equip the  restaurant. When the final figures were in, however, costs totaled $2.4  million.  </P> <P> The city placed much of the blame for the cost overrun on the lavish  furnishings Leonudakis had used to decorate the restaurant, including a 20-foot  handmade mahogany bar, mahogany tables and cabinets, stained-glass panels and a  large beveled-glass mirror for the bar.  </P> <P> Abe Dedios, Irwindale's finance director, said Leonudakis took responsibility  for part of the cost overruns but said the city should pay the rest.  </P> <P> Although the dispute was eventually settled out of court, with Leonudakis  agreeing to pay the city $300,000 over five years, it set the tone for the  relationship.  </P> <P> When he agreed to run Rapscallion, for example, Leonudakis also wanted to  develop an adjacent one-acre parcel of land into an office complex to provide a  close source of customers for the restaurant, Ekizian said.  </P> <P> Bureaucratic red tape delayed the project, Ekizian claimed, and it was only  this year that Leonudakis got the go-ahead to start development.  </P> <P> "The city kind of prolonged the developing process of the parcel" to the  detriment of the restaurant, Ekizian said.  </P> <P> City officials deny delaying the project and say Leonudakis could have  purchased the land at any point in the last three years but waited until this  year to do so.  </P> <P> Finally, Ekizian said, in May the city failed to notify the restaurant when it  began repair work on Irwindale Avenue near Rapscallion. The work went on for  several weeks and made customers' access to the restaurant difficult and on at  least one occasion impossible, he said.  </P> <P> City officials counter that they had no choice but to fix the road.  </P> <P> Although Rapscallion does a healthy business, serving about 2,000 meals a week,  "there have been a lot of little things that the city has been uncooperative  on," Ekizian said, and it is this "constant harassment" that is causing  Leonudakis to try get out of the 17 years remaining on his lease.  </P> <P> "There's bad blood somewhere along the line," he said.  </P> <P> City Atty. Charles Martin, however, denied that Leonudakis' decision to sell  was based on conflicts with the city.  </P> <P> "I'm not aware of any bad taste in his mouth," he said. "As far as I'm  concerned it's been a very pleasant relationship."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Martin and other city officials said they are not fighting  Leonudakis. In fact, for financial reasons, they say they would welcome the  chance to bring in another operator.  </P> <P> Under the 20-year lease Leonudakis signed in 1987, he would pay the city  $80,000 a year for the first three years and $180,000 a year for the next 17  years. He could also opt to buy the restaurant at any point for the same amount  it cost the city to build, plus $300,000.  </P> <P> A lease so favorable to the renter is rare in the restaurant industry, said  Gerald Breitbart, a consultant on business issues and local government  regulation for the Restaurant Assn. of California.  </P> <P> A fully equipped restaurant like Rapscallion would normally rent each year for  about 10% of its worth, or $240,000 in the case of Rapscallion, Breitbart said.  </P> <P> City officials acknowledge that the lease is lopsided.  </P> <P> "We could have made a better deal," said financial consultant Rudy Silva, who  is negotiating the Rapscallion buyout for the city. "I think we can do better  with a different operator in terms of return to the city on their investment."  </P> <P> But finding another operator may be difficult.  </P> <P> Silva said the city will again try to get a restaurant chain like Velvet Turtle  to open a branch on the Rapscallion site.  </P> <P> David Orcutt, finance director for Velvet Turtle Restaurants, said Irwindale  does not appear to be a likely spot for one of the upscale chain restaurants  because of its small population and median income of less than $30,000.  </P> <P> "It doesn't seem like a likely place for anyone to come into right now," Orcutt  said.  </P> <P> But city officials insist that an elegant restaurant can be profitable in  Irwindale if properly managed.  </P> <P> Martin said Leonudakis reports more than $2 million in gross sales annually but  claims to have lost $250,000 each year the restaurant has been open.  </P> <P> "Something's not right," said Councilman Sal Hernandez, who speculated that  Leonudakis cannot run the restaurant effectively from another state.  </P> <P> Ekizian said he is unfamiliar with specifics of the restaurant's finances but  maintains that it is well run and does a healthy business.  </P> <P> Hernandez opposes the buyout and says the city is letting itself be used.  </P> <P> "I can't see us bailing them out," Hernandez said. "We took a loss from the  beginning, and we're taking another loss now (in the buyout). . . . Let him go  under."  </P> <P> Others think the buyout will in the long run make money for the city. By buying  the lease and then renting the restaurant to another operator at a higher rate,  the city will profit, Silva said.  </P> <P> "I'm not looking at it as we're doing a favor for Leonudakis," Silva said. "I'm  looking at it as a good deal for us."  </P></p>

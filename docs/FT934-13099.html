			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Rowland calls haltto long-running feud with Fayeds: Harrods handshake ends House of Fraser row MR TINY ROWLAND and Mr Mohamed Fayed made peace yesterday. Their surprise settlement ended nearly a decade of feuding, during which Mr Rowland branded Mr Fayed 'the hero from zero' and Mr Rowland, in turn, found his own name given to a stuffed shark in Harrods food hall. Lonrho, the trading company where Mr Rowland has been the guiding light for 30 years, and the Fayed brothers, announced they were abandoning their long-run ning legal battle over the Fayeds' 1985 takeover of House of Fraser, owner of Harrods and other UK department stores. Mr Fayed and Mr Rowland said their 'long-standing relationship' of almost 20 years provided a stronger basis for a 'constructive future' than disagreement. Mr Rowland said the peace deal had been brokered by Mr Hassan Yassim, a Saudi businessman who is related to the Fayeds by marriage. Mr Yassim suggested a settlement earlier this week at a lunch at Lonrho's City headquarters. Also at the lunch were Mr Adnan Kashoggi, the Saudi arms dealer, and Mr Abu Sharif, number two to Mr Yassir Arafat in the Palestine Liberation Organisation. On Thursday, when he met Mr Fayed for the first time in years, all the bitterness melted away, said Mr Rowland. 'We are now in partnership and we will easily make up the costs we have spent on this dispute.' After several years of a ferocious legal and propaganda campaign against the Fayeds, Mr Rowland last night drank champagne with them at Harrods. Afterwards, the brothers removed the stuffed shark which they had christened 'Tiny'. Mr Rowland first bought a stake in House of Fraser in 1977 and made a takeover bid for the company in 1981, which was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. He was furious in 1985 when the Department of Trade and Industry put no obstacles in the way of the Fayeds' Pounds 615m bid for the company. Since then, he has spent tens of millions of pounds trying to wrest control of House of Fraser from the Fayeds and obtain compensation for Lonrho. Mr Rowland said that he alone negotiated the peace on behalf of Lonrho. 'None of my colleagues knew, and were surprised when it was signed.' On Wednesday Mr Yassim had been brought to lunch at Lonrho's headquarters by Mr Kashoggi. At this lunch, Mr Yassim had said to him: 'If Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat can make peace, surely you can end your war with the Fayeds.' On Thursday, Mr Rowland met the Fayeds at Mr Yassim's apartment in Kensington. That evening they returned to their homes and drafted a statement announcing the peace treaty. 'Faxes were whizzing between our houses till one in the morning,' Mr Rowland said. 'We kept the lawyers out of it,' he added. 'Between us we must have spent Pounds 40m or Pounds 50m on the dispute and we had been advised that the legal battle would last another 2 1/2 years.' Yesterday, both Mr Rowland and Mr Fayed signed the statement which was released to the press in the afternoon. Mr Rowland has now instructed his solicitors to end all legal proceedings. The main court action was Lonrho's case alleging fraudulent misrepresentation and conspiracy to injure Lonrho by theFayeds and their former financial advisers, the merchant bank Kleinwort Benson. Lonrho is also dropping its legal action against Kleinwort and Mr John MacArthur, a former Kleinwort director who now has his own financial advisory business. An action against Lord Tebbit, trade and industry secretary at the time of the bid, is also being dropped. Mr Dieter Bock, who acquired an 18.8 per cent stake in Lonrho and then became joint chief executive with Mr Rowland, has been working hard to end the dispute. A DTI inspectors' report into the takeover, published in 1990, said that, in the course of their estly misrepresented their origins, their wealth, their business interests and their resources to the secretary of state, the Office of Fair Trading, the press, the House of Fraser board and House of Fraser share holders, and their own advisers'. The two companies yesterday said the time had come to 'recognise that there is nothing to be gained by prolonging a costly battle'. Tiny decides to put away the blunderbuss, Page 6</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AGASSI TO SKIP $6-MILLION ITF TOURNEY  </P> <P> Andre Agassi today joined Boris Becker and John McEnroe in snubbing the  $6-million Grand Slam Cup, the richest tournament in tennis history.  </P> <P> The Grand Slam Cup, scheduled for Dec. 11-16 in Munich, has raised controversy  by offering record prize money.  </P> <P> The winner in the 16-man field will earn $2 million.  </P> <P> Agassi, ranked fourth in the world, originally signed to play in the inaugural  event but gave no reason for skipping the tournament.  </P> <P> "After careful consideration, I have decided that I will not compete in the  Grand Slam Cup," he said in a one-sentence statement distributed to reporters.  </P> <P> Agassi is in Frankfurt competing at the ATP Tour World Championships, which  includes the eight top-ranked players in the world. The ATP Tour has opposed  the Grand Slam Cup, which it sees as a rival to its season-ending tournament.  </P> <P> The Grand Slam Cup is being organized by the International Tennis Federation  and the directors of the four Grand Slam tournaments.  </P> <P> Agassi's withdrawal leaves six of the top 10 players still signed up.  </P> <P> Pete Sampras, the U.S. Open champion who is ranked fifth, said Wednesday that  he is not certain if he will play in Munich. Sampras said his participation  depends on how his shin splints feel.  </P></p>

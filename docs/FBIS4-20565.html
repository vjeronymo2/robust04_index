Kuriyama, Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd.] </F>   [Text] In this paper, we present existing and potential  applications of CFD in designing automobiles by supercomputers,  and outline the necessary CFD methodology. In recent years, CFD  has been used to better understand internal and external  aerodynamic flows, the intake and exhaust flows of engines, and  air circulation within cars. In this paper, we also discuss what  the requirements are for designing automobiles with CFD, and  finally, say something about future trends and outlooks.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   In 1986, the automobile industry in Japan started using  supercomputers to assist in doing structural analysis and  collision analysis. In the last few years, a lot of companies  have started using CFD (computational fluid dynamics) in areas  where large memories are involved. The reason for this we  believe is that collision/safety analysis has reached more or  less the same level in companies, so companies are now turning  their attention to the use of CFD in R&amp;D on aerodynamics,  engine  combustion, and air-circulation analysis in order to achieve  better fuel consumption, lower exhaust emissions, and better  driving comfort, thus, CFD is steadily being used more and more  in the design stages of automobiles.    In this paper, we discuss the role of CFD in designing  automobiles, and at the same time describe how supercomputers  have been used over the past few years in CFD-based R&amp;D and  design.  <H5>  2. CFD Applications and Characteristics </H5>   As we can see from Figure 1 [figure not reproduced], there  are a lot of important areas in which CFD applications can  directly affect the performance of a car. In the last few years  especially, companies are turning to CFD as a design tool for  achieving lower fuel consumption, lower exhaust emissions, and  better driving comfort, and are now using it to a greater degree  in design departments for doing R&amp;D.    The cycle in which car models change has shown a tendency to  grow from five to six years, but it is also important that new  models be put out quickly that meet the needs of users,  therefore, we find that there are more demands now then ever  before to shorten design and development time. One of the ways  suggested to deal with shorter turnaround times is to use CFD in  design to shorten development time, reduce prototype cost, and  improve performance.    When developing a new automobile, we also want to have an  analysis method that we can easily use to do routine analysis  work that is unrelated to designing automobiles, so even in  computational flow dynamics, standard analysis techniques must  be developed that enable comparative studies to be done in areas  such as complex mixed flow analysis.  <H5>  3. Role of CFD in Design </H5>   If we were going to use CFD in design in its present state,  it would be inadequate in terms of reliability, accuracy,  cost-performance, and ease of use. The main problems are as  follows:    (1) It has no computational ability to accurately capture  mixed flows.    (2) It cannot produce a mesh of complex shape very easily.    (3) It takes a long time to do calculations and requires a  large memory.    Below, we list the roles that CFD could play:    (1) It could be used to analyze complex flows with a simple  generalized computation method.    (2) It could be used to do inexpensive high-speed output  even  in a large analysis.    (3) It could be used as necessary to establish reliable  calculations and evaluation methods.    The problem areas and possibilities described above tend to  run counter to each other, therefore, it is essential that an  ample study of approaches and methods be taken in CFD R&amp;D.    With that in mind, we at Daihatsu Motors have adopted the  following methods/approaches to make CFD analysis more practical:    (1) Use a k-_e_ mixed flow model    (2) Reduce computing time to less than 20 hours with one  CRAY  computer    (3) Show a sizable reduction in analysis error to less than  10 percent    In order to create a balance between three elements, namely,  producing computation meshes, doing fluid computations, and  visualizing flow, we purchased some high-quality market software  and put together a supercomputing network (cf. Figure 2 [figure  not reproduced]). At present, we are using a Cray supercomputer  at the rate of about 500 hours per month for CFD analysis. In  Figures 3 and 4 [figures not reproduced], we show supercomputer  applications by analysis field and use.  <H5>  4. Different Types of Analysis and Design Output </H5> <H5>  4.1 Aerodynamic Analysis </H5>   At Daihatsu, we have adopted two different approaches to  analysis in the design stage. The first is aerodynamic analysis  of the vehicle periphery using the SCRYU code[.sup](1)[/] in  a BFC coordinate system as shown in Figure 5 [figure not  reproduced]. The aim of this approach is to produce a Cray model  having no unevenness in the air flow to the engine compartment,  the door mirror, and the floor. In approximately 20 hours of  computing time, we were able to analyze the resistance  coefficient and lift coefficient to a less than 5 percent margin  of error, and have been using this approach in developing body  designs having little resistance and dynamic lift.    The other method is heat flow analysis within the engine  compartment using the STREAM code in a Cartesian coordinate  system[.sup](2)[/] as shown in Figure 6 [figure not  reproduced]. Investigating the effect of the fan, we were able  to analyze the average rate of flow through the radiator in two  hours of computing time to within a 10 percent margin of error,  and at the same time, find the temperature distribution within  the engine compartment. There has been a tendency over the past  few years toward higher engine compartment temperatures due to  new freon substitutes and the engine undercover used to reduce  external noise, so this approach has been used a lot as an  analysis tool to study design openings and engine compartment  layouts in the design and planning stage.  <H5>  4.2 Engine Flow Analysis </H5>   As we can see from Figure 7 [figure not reproduced], we have  been using CFD in a three-dimensional analysis[.sup](3)[/] of  flows within the engine cylinder using a special engine analysis  code (AVL-FIRE) that is able to use both the BFC coordinate  system and a non-structural mesh coordinate system. The  calculations we do from the dead points on the intake to the  dead points in the compression at every 0.25 crank angle  take approximately 15 hours of computation time. With this  analysis, we have been working on the shifting boundary problems  in the valves and pistons and the rezoning of the mesh within  the cylinder. Engine flow analysis has proved useful in  optimizing swirls, tumbles, mixed energy flows, and intake  resistance, etc. that largely influence the shape of the  scavenger port, and it has also proved useful in developing  engines with high output and low fuel consumption. It is  particularly challenging, indeed, to use it in analyzing flows  within the engine cylinder even experimentally, so in that  sense, CFD can help to optimize the shape of the engine in the  design stage, and after prototyping, can be useful in doing  detailed analysis by experimentation.  <H5>  4.3 Air-Conditioning Analysis </H5>   As is shown in Figure 8 [figure not reproduced], we are  using  the STAR-CD code in a non-structural mesh system to analyze  window defrosting by a defroster nozzle.[.sup](4)[/] There is  a strong correlation between window defrosting and surface  velocity, so if we can predict the surface velocity on the glass  based on the output flow from the defroster nozzle, we will be  able to estimate window defrosting. Used with an EWS, this code  enables high-speed computations in 20 hours time. Moreover,  taking a view toward ergonomics, we are also analyzing interior  air flows to get an idea of the velocities near the heads of  passengers in hopes of developing an optimum air-conditioning  system.  <H5>  5. Conclusion </H5>   In order to further improve the effectiveness of CFD in  design, the following problems need to be tackled:    (1) Standardizing analyses by an auto-mesh system    (2) Achieving more accurate computation by an improved mixed  flow theory    (3) Achieving inexpensive high-speed computations using a  super high-speed parallel computer    In the foregoing sections, we described the present  situation  at Daihatsu Motors in which we are actively promoting the use of  computational flow dynamics in R&amp;D and design using  supercomputers. There are a lot of areas where CFD is an  unknown, so we can expect to see it play a larger role in the  future. We believe the time is coming when software will undergo  the same kind of technical revolution as hardware, and that  there is a good possibility that we will see codes then that are  unthinkable now.

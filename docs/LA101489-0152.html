			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WESTMINSTER HOLDS ON TO EDGE MARINA, 9-7, FOR FIRST VICTORY  </P> <P> Momentum did an about-face Friday night at Westminster High School.  </P> <P> Westminster, which had staggered to an 0-5 nonleague record, built a 9-0 lead  at halftime, then held on to beat Marina, 9-7, in the Sunset League opener for  both teams. Marina had won its previous two games.  </P> <P> But Westminster might still be winless if not for two first-half boots:  </P> <P>  -- The first came courtesy of Marina's Christin McLemore, who fumbled a punt  at his own one-yard line in the first quarter. Westminster's Bruce Tran  recovered, and halfback Vance Senteno pounded across from there to give the  Lions a 6-0 lead.  </P> <P>  -- The second boot came from Westminster kicker Ken Scott, whose towering  35-yard field goal in the second quarter proved to be the difference in the  game.  </P> <P> Marina (2-4, 0-1) came back in the third quarter, driving 74 yards on its first  possession of the half. Tailback Chris Evenson punched across right tackle from  the four to cut Westminster's lead to two.  </P> <P> On its next possession, Marina drove to the Westminster 18, but on third down,  defensive end Vince Tauanuu nailed Marina quarterback David Schultz with a  blind-side sack for a seven-yard loss. Eric Mifflin's 42-yard field goal  attempt fell short. STUART MATTHEWS  </P></p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / AEU chief raises spectre of Clause 4 THE ISSUE of the Labour party's largely symbolic commitment to public ownership has been thrown into the current leadership debate by Mr Bill Jordan, leader of the AEU engineering union. He called yesterday for the scrapping of Clause 4 of the party's constitution, which pledges the party to supporting 'common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange'. His call came as the TGWU general union decided not to ballot its 1m members before deciding who to support in the leadership contest. Britain's biggest union had appeared to shift in favour of holding a ballot, but decided at the last moment to revert to its original plan of consulting members through its 8,000 branches. In the most radical contribution to date from a union leader to the debate about Labour's future, Mr Jordan told his union conference in Eastbourne that Labour must become a party for managers and wealth creators and added his voice to those demanding a substantial withdrawal of union involvement in the Labour party. He cautiously welcomed the appointments of Mrs Gillian Shephard to the Employment Department and Mr Michael Heseltine to the Trade and Industry Department as signs that the new government might be seeking more consensus in industry. Mr Jordan believes that the formal abolition of what has long since, in practice, been superseded, would improve Labour's image. 'Clause 4 has outlived its usefulness now,' he said. 'Labour have said they have no desire for the common ownership of the means of production, but we need an unambiguous statement about what Labour's position is.' He said: 'While membership of the party is so public-sector top-heavy, people will continue to say they are mainly a public-sector pressure group - the party must work to correct this constituency imbalance.'</p>

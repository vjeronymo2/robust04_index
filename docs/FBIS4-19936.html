			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn/Siegen (DPA) -- The defense experts of the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU]  Bundestag group and Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (CDU) have  largely settled their controversy over the future size and  structure of the Bundeswehr. After a three-hour talk behind  closed doors in Siegen CDU/CSU Defense Policy spokesman Paul  Breuer told DPA on Sunday [24 April] evening that the reduction  to 340,000 men, which Ruehe has proposed, has been basically  approved. The precondition is, however, that the necessary  structures are preserved so that in case of emergency the  maximum number of 370,000 can be reached quickly again.    In the "crisis reaction forces," which are primarily  intended  for international missions, conscripts are to be given the  opportunity to volunteer, Breuer said. Service is to last 12  months in this case. In the "  Main Defense Forces, on the other hand, which are to be  responsible for national defense, 10 months of service are to be  sufficient if service is "shaped compactly."    Breuer spoke of a "businesslike climate" of the talks with  Ruehe, which have led to a real compromise. The results must  now be discussed in the Bundestag groups. This Tuesday the  coalition representatives and the Cabinet intend to discuss  Ruehe's plans.</p>

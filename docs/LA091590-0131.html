			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MISDEMEANOR CHARGES AHEAD IN MOOSE RAID;  </P> <P> GAMBLING: A DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY REJECTS FELONY COUNTS IN THE SEIZURE OF  SLOT AND POKER MACHINES AT A HUNTINGTON BEACH LODGE.  </P> <P> At least four people will be charged with misdemeanor gambling offenses  stemming from a two-year investigation of a Moose lodge in Huntington Beach,  prosecutors said Friday.  </P> <P> Officers at the Loyal Order of the Moose Lodge No. 1832 will be among those  charged, Deputy Dist. Atty. Nina Rose Brice said.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach police seized slot machines, poker machines, bookmaking  documents and lottery records in a Sept. 7 raid. Officers said they also found  $7,000 in cash and gambling receipts.  </P> <P> Brice said Friday that police had gathered evidence against eight people and  that felony charges had been discussed. But Brice said that after reviewing the  evidence, she decided to file misdemeanor charges against four or possibly five  people.  </P> <P> She declined to name them until charges are filed, which will probably not be  until Monday.  </P> <P> "Some people were so minimally involved that it doesn't seem appropriate to me  for a filing," Brice said.  </P> <P> On the other hand, she said, some of those charged were "not only active  participants but in a position to permit others to engage in this type of  activity."  </P> <P> Brice said she ruled out felony charges because "they were not out taking the  public's money, and they were not being deceptive about the purposes -- there  was never any suggestion that the money raised would be given to charity."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Brice said, "a lot of money passed hands over these games," which  she said also included Super Bowl pools.  </P> <P> "This is many, many, many thousands of dollars and many, many games, and they  seemed to be going on all the time," Brice said. "It's like walking into a  little casino."  </P> <P> Moose officials have said the organization raises money for such charities as  the Blind Children's Learning Institute and sponsors the Special Olympics.  </P> <P> Police have said the investigation was prompted by citizen complaints against  the lodge on Lorge Circle.  </P></p>

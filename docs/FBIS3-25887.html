			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special feature" by reporter He Chong (6320 0394): "China </F> and France Renew Friendly and Cooperative Relations"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 26 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--On the  eve of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-French  diplomatic ties, a French government delegation flew to Beijing  to take part in ceremonious activities marking the occasion.  The delegation's visit, which was designed to bring bilateral  relations closer, followed the joint communique issued by the  two countries to affirm the need to "renew their traditional  friendly and cooperative relations" and "the agreement to hold  regular consultations between foreign ministers of the two  countries" reached when Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier and  foreign minister, visited France. All these have served to  clear away the haze shrouding the relations between the two  countries over the last three years.    As disclosed by newspapers in Paris recently, a debate broke  out in the ruling coalition after German Chancellor Kohl's visit  to China in November last year, and especially after the  Sino-U.S. summit, because the visit and the summit had enabled  the French public to see clearly that the two major countries in  Europe and America respectively had adjusted their policies  toward China and directed their attention to China's huge market  in their efforts to expand trade and economic relations with  China. The right-wing faction, represented by the Foreign  Ministry and those standing for the interests of major  industrial and commercial enterprises, stressed the need to  stake heavily on the mainland market, while the other faction,  represented by the defense ministry and those standing for the  defense industry, were more interested in the Taiwan market.    In consequence, the former faction won a major victory. Just  as French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said in his interview  with a reporter from ECHO magazine: "Should we bet heavily on  the side which has a population of 20 million or on the side  which has a population of 1.2 billion and which is likely to  become the third-biggest economic power? In fact the choice is  very easy to make. We hope to reestablish relations based on  mutual trust with China."    According to estimates by industrial and commercial circles,  the sale of warships and fighters worth $8 billion to Taiwan  might keep relevant French military enterprises busy for several  years, but for that France would lose a huge market in mainland  China for a long time. Such business is not worth doing, they  said. In 1993 alone, France lost contracts and orders from  China for Guangzhou's underground railway project, electronic  telecommunications equipment, airbuses, and agricultural  products worth 6 billion francs. If Sino-French relations were  not improved in the future, in the next few years France would  lose contracts for nuclear power equipment, telecommunications  equipment, aircraft, automobiles, and equipment for the  petrochemical industry, which would be worth 30 to 40 billion  francs. What is more, following the example of Germany in  formulating a "policy toward the East" and the example of the  United States in shifting the stress to Asia in its economic and  diplomatic drive, France is drafting an "overall plan for  opening up markets in Asia" (under the plan, France will try to  increase its market share in Asia from 1 to 3.5 percent).  Without support from China, the plan would inevitably go down  the drain. So the proud French had to mend their ways and  President Mitterrand finally took a firm stand and decided that  giving top priority to mainland China is a correct and practical  diplomatic policy.    After French Foreign Minister Juppe openly expressed  repentance on two occasions for the former government's selling  weapons to Taiwan, the Chinese Government gave a favorable  response by granting two interviews to Fuliman [fu li man 1715  6849 2581], adviser to Balladur, prime minister of the  right-wing ruling coalition, to discuss problems concerning  renewal of bilateral relations. Taking into account the French  side's difficulty in tearing up the contract for the arms deal  (according to the contract, France must pay high compensation to  Taiwan for failure to fulfill the contract), the Chinese side  made an important concession, agreeing to bury the hatchet if  the French Government made a "written promise" that it "would  never sell arms to Taiwan in the future."    Undoubtedly France is mainly to blame for Sino-French  relations turning sour in the past. After a sharp change took  place in Eastern Europe in 1991 and the disintegration of the  former Soviet Union, France, following the example of the United  States, agreed in turn to sell 16 cruisers [xun fang jian 1559  7089 5324] and 60 Mirage 200 fighter planes (Guangzhou is within  their flight radius) to Taiwan to help the latter threaten the  security of the mainland in an attempt to "destroy the last  bastion of communism." China decided to order the closure of  the French Consulate in Guangzhou in early March 1993 and  suspended and reduced its trade with France after its repeated  warnings against the arms deal proved ineffective. But facts  show that China values its friendship with France. Though  fighting back on just grounds, to its advantage, and with  restraint, it still left ample room for maneuver. When France,  which knew that it was in the wrong, sent a message on its own  initiative seeking a rapprochement, China agreed to make a  corresponding concession so as to renew friendly and cooperative  relations between the two countries.    French Prime Minister Balladur is scheduled to visit China  in  March. This will herald a new stage of friendly and cooperative  Sino-French relations.</p>

			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRIVER TRIED TO AVOID WOMAN, EXPERT SAYS  </P> <P> An analysis of a videotape shows it was physically impossible for driver Danny  David Ornelas to have intentionally hit a Newport Beach woman last Sept. 1, an  expert witness testified Monday.  </P> <P> Ted A. Mitchell, an automotive engineer with 18 years' experience analyzing and  reconstructing automobile accidents, also told jurors at Ornelas' murder trial  that he believes that the woman, Debbie Killelea, 37, herself contributed to  her death by stepping into the path of the car.  </P> <P> "I think she was the primary cause of it," Mitchell said of Killelea's death.  That statement produced gasps from spectators in Orange County Superior Court  in Westminster.  </P> <P> Mitchell was the first defense witness to testify in the second-degree murder  trial of Ornelas, 19, of Huntington Park. Ornelas is accused of having  deliberately run down Killelea as she stood in an alley with her two sons  behind their Balboa Peninsula home.  </P> <P> A videotape of the seconds in the alley before Killelea was hit was made  accidentally by a passenger in the car Ornelas was driving. Deputy Dist. Atty.  Thomas Goethals has argued that the tape shows that Ornelas deliberately  swerved to the right to hit Killelea as she tried to flee.  </P> <P> Mitchell testified that he believes that Ornelas only had time to react to  Killelea's first movement, which was to the center of the alley. Mitchell  testified that the videotape shows that as the car approached, Killelea tried  to run to the wall where her two young sons were standing but that by then, the  car had already turned and she was running into its path.  </P> <P> A frame-by-frame analysis of the critical 2.67-second segment of the videotape  shows that Ornelas veered right because the woman was moving toward the  driver's left, Mitchell said. "The best decision for him (Ornelas) to make at  that point is to move to the right," he told jurors. "That is what I would have  done."  </P> <P> Mitchell noted that the videotape shows Killelea walking to the center of the  20-foot-wide alley as Ornelas' car approached, putting her hands on her hips  and facing the car in apparent disapproval of its speed in the alley. The final  milliseconds of the tape show Killelea running back in the direction she came  from.  </P> <P> On a chart he showed to the jury, Mitchell said the sequence indicates that  Killelea "jumped" into the center of the alley, that the driver saw her moving  to his left, and that the driver therefore made a decision to veer to the  right.  </P> <P> Mitchell said the average reaction time for drivers in the United States is 1.5  seconds. Mitchell said Ornelas had time to react only to Killelea's first  action and that he was "prudent" in veering to the right as Killelea walked to  his left. Mitchell added that Ornelas could not have known that Killelea would  try to run back in the direction she came from.  </P> <P> In a lengthy cross-examination, Goethals assailed Mitchell's testimony as being  only a "hypothesis," and adding that Mitchell's statements tended to make  Ornelas' actions in the alley sound "heroic."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Technique of Reconstruction  </P> <P> Mitchell responded that he was only giving an expert opinion on what the  videotape shows. "It's very obvious what his (Ornelas') intent was at the time  he did so, and he could not have intended to have swerved at that woman,"  Mitchell said. "I mean, he would have had to be able to see into the future."  </P> <P> Mitchell said he was able to link exact time and actions because the videotape  has 30 frames per second. Using the individual frames as portions of a second,  Mitchell said, he could pinpoint when Killelea walked to the center of the  alley and when Ornelas' car veered.  </P> <P> Mitchell also testified that his calculations of the time and distance shown in  the videotape indicate that Ornelas was driving about 40 m.p.h. through the  alley and that he apparently braked just before he hit Killea and slowed to  about 32 m.p.h. on impact.  </P> <P> Mitchell is a forensic automotive engineer based in Upland. He said he has a  bachelor's degree in engineering from the General Motors Institute of  Technology in Michigan and that he once held "the land speed record at the  Bonneville (Utah) salt flats."  </P> <P> Under questioning by Goethals, Mitchell said his hourly fee is $250 and that he  will earn about $5,000 overall for his work for Ornelas' attorney, Ralph  Bencangey of Beverly Hills.  </P></p>

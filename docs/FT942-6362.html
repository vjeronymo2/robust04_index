			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Permission to proceed - Local planning officials can be potential allies Next month South Tyneside councillors in the north of England will try to resolve a nine-year planning wrangle. They will consider an application by Mayflower Glass, a local company that has twice won the Queen's Award for Export for its decorative glassware, for retrospective planning permission for its storage warehouse and ancillary buildings, part of a former Ministry of Defence depot on green belt land bought in 1985. Mayflower Glass says the controversy has left it in limbo. Its expansion plans are blocked, and 100 jobs are threatened should it be forced to vacate the warehouse and use part of its nearby factory, outside the green belt, for storage. The problem, which has already caused two public inquiries, is a headache for the company and the council. But, says Jed Griffiths, president elect of the Royal Town Planning Institute, time-consuming dogfights can be avoided if businesses treat the planners as potential allies. 'I see planning as a positive force, maintaining a balance between local interests, environmental concerns and the need to regenerate the economy,' he says. This, he admits, is not how many businesspeople view it. 'There is still a lot of suspicion and mistrust of planners.' Griffiths, formerly chief strategic planner with East Sussex County Council, concedes some planners may be too 'finicky'. But he believes current changes in the planning regime in England, described by the Department of the Environment as a move to a 'plan-led system', should make it easier for companies to understand the planning context in which they are operating and avoid pitfalls. By 1996, all local planning authorities must have in place district-wide local plans, looking at least five years ahead. 'The new system puts the development plan at the centre of things - it's the framework,' says Griffiths. Many of these plans, called Unitary Development Plans in metropolitan areas, are currently undergoing public consultation. Companies should take an interest, says Griffiths, as this could affect what they will be able to do at their existing premises. For those seeking sites, now or in the future, his motto is simple: be positive and consult the planning authorities first. At the very least, this can save wasted time in fruitless applications. And, with local authorities increasingly active in economic development, companies may find a warmer welcome than they expected. Important information arising from these discussions is worth getting in writing, just in case. 'Too many conversations take place in the rugby club,' observes Griffiths. Nor should companies forget that the democratic process involves councillors as well as planners. Kenneth and Jill Wheeler, who run a pet crematorium near Langley Park, County Durham, discovered this to their cost when they decided to combine an expansion of their small business with an improvement of their facilities to meet new environmental legislation. Derwentside district planners recommended the go-ahead for the Wheelers' plans: the councillors, lobbied by locals worried about the issue of incineration, rejected the application. The Wheelers won their case at a public inquiry, but it cost them anxiety, wasted time and Pounds 20,000 in solicitors' and consultants' fees. In the case of Mayflower Glass, a proposed modification in the currently very restrictive national green belt guidelines may come to the rescue. The government has proposed that the re-use of existing, redundant buildings in the green belt should not be refused without 'specific and convincing' reasons, a change intended to tackle the problem of sites like MoD depots and psychiatric hospitals. A final decision on this modification is expected in the autumn but Griffiths' basic dictum still holds true. 'Land use planning is all about being in the right place.'</p>

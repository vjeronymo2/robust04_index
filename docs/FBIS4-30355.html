			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Takashi Yonezawa, chairman of the ruling </F> Democratic Socialist Party, by unidentified NHK reporter at  Democratic Socialist Party headquarters in Tokyo -- live via  satellite hookup; from the "NHK News" program]    [Text] [NHK] I will interview Chairman Yonezawa of the  Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]. Mr. Chairman, what do you  think of Prime Minister Hata's decision on the general  resignation of his cabinet?    [Yonezawa] The opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]  submited a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet shortly  after the fiscal 1994 budget bill was enacted in the Diet.  Meanwhile, the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] has demanded that the Hata cabinet resign en masse. Prime  Minister Hata has chosen the path of resigning with his cabinet  en masse in a bid to overcome a difficult political situation. I  would like to highly praise Prime Minister Hata's decision. To  overcome the difficult political situation, the prime minister  had only two options -- the dissolution of the House of  Representatives or the general resignation of his cabinet. If  the House of Representatives is dissolved, a political vacuum  would be created under this difficult political situation and  political reform would be left halfdone. I believe the prime  minister made a last-minute choice, taking into account all  those things. I would like to express my respect for Mr. Hata's  decision and highly rate his decision.    [NHK] How do you think the next government will be formed?    [Yonezawa] The Hata cabinet will resign en masse. The prime  minister decided on the general resignation of his cabinet in  response to the LDP which has claimed the Hata cabinet deserves  to be voted out in the Diet, and the SDPJ that has demanded that  the Hata cabinet resign en masse. I believe that a situation  will be created wherein all political parties discuss how to  form a new government. I also believe that debates will be held  on the formation of a new government and the choice of prime  minister. Our party will watch how the political situation will  develop in the future.    [NHK] Does the DSP plan to make immediate moves toward  forming a new government?    [Yonezawa] Our party was subject to the no-confidence motion  and, as a partner of the Hata government, it was asked to resign  en masse. The Hata cabinet has just resigned en masse. Our  party, therefore, will not make any immediate moves. We will  watch how the political situation develops in the future.</p>

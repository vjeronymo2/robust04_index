			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Albanian President Sali] Berisha provokes  Greece almost daily with his treatment of the Greeks of Albania;  the answer to this is that there are political and diplomatic  measures that our country can take, and will take, if the  provocations continue. This statement was made by Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou during an interview with a private  television station. The interview was on national issues, for  which Papandreou said there is a direction. He clarified: I  think our positions and stance reflect the needs of our times.  The prime minister also said that Greece's policy toward  Albania is a policy of open doors, and clarified that we want to  have good relations with Albania--on condition, of course, that  the rights of the Greeks in Albania not be violated. He  stressed that we plan to be very strict in this regard. The  prime minister also clarified that representations have been  made while the ambassadors of the European Union countries as  well as Security Council members, especially Russia and the  United States, were informed. The prime minister concluded: We  are ready to proceed with other measures if Berisha insists on  his unreasonable tactics.    Responding to a question on the issue of Skopje's [The  Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] name, Papandreou  clarified once again that our country will not recognize this  ministate if its name includes the term Macedonia or any its  derivatives. This is very clear, he said, adding: We have not  budged from our positions. Papandreou concluded by saying that  the negotiations and dialogue with UN Special Envoy Cyrus Vance  continue. [passage omitted]    Responding to another question by the interviewer on whether  he plans to succeed President Konstandinos Karamanlis in the  presidency, Papandreou said: I am in active politics. That is  what I know; and in my intentions and plans, active politics  always come first. This is my answer: I have not changed.    Finally, referring to the issue of his succession at PASOK  [Panhellenic Socialist Movement], the prime minister said that  he will not personally choose his successor. The party is  organized, it has a constitution, a congress and it will make  the decision, he said. I may express my views, he concluded,  but I will not choose my successor.</p>

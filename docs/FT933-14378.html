			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Roche takes Zurich to a high for 1993 FRANKFURT quietened a little, more in share price than in turnover terms, but there were pockets of good performance elsewhere, writes Our Markets Staff. ZURICH rose again on a good progress report from Roche, and further strength in banks. The SMI index rose 10.1 to 2,419.0, a new closing high for the year. Roche's 8 per cent rise in first half sales took in 14 per cent local currency growth in pharmaceuticals and a strong performance in diagnostics, said Mr Mark Tracey at Goldman Sachs, which has revised its earnings forecasts from SFr273 to SFr284 a share for 1993, and from SFr324 to SFr346 for 1994. The certificates rose SFr40 to SFr5,170. In banks, UBS bearers added SFr22 to SFr1,185, and CS Holding SFr40 to SFr2,895. AMSTERDAM slipped back a little at the close as some profits were locked in and the dollar weakened. The CBS Tendency index slipped 0.4 to 116.9, after an earlier high of 117.6. Cyclical stocks continued to attract interest, although most fell back from their intraday peaks. Hoogovens, which crossed the Fl 41 barrier at one stage, closed down 10 cents at Fl 39.20, and DSM, up to Fl 101.20 during the session, retreated Fl 1.50 to Fl 97.80 at the close. Goldman Sachs has recently recommended taking an overweight position in Dutch cyclicals, generating interest particularly from US and UK investors. However, Amsterdam brokers, Pierson, believe that it is still too earlier to take a position in cyclicals, given forecasts of economic recovery no sooner that the end of 1994. The brokers also comment that the recent gains in DSM have been overdone, as it does not expect the chemicals group to pay a dividend when it announces results later this month. KLM rose Fl 1.20 or 4 per cent to Fl 30.70 helped by a good recent performance in Lufthansa and expectations of progress in its cooperation talks with other European operators. Unilever lost Fl 3.70 to Fl 197.50 on news that competitor Proctor &amp; Gamble was expected to cut the price on some of its products. PARIS fell back towards the close. Uncertainty prevailed as to whether the Bundesbank would cut interest rates this week. The CAC-40 index ended down 1.07 at 1,991.15, having breached the 2,000 level during the session. Turnover was FFr3bn. The French market is closed today for Bastille Day. Most analysts expect the franc to weather the current crisis in the currency markets, and there was less pressure seen on the currency yesterday. Valeo was one of the day's strongest performers in high volume on rumours of a possible financial restructuring, the shares adding FFr35 or 4 per cent to FFr884. Its holding company, Cerus, gained FFr3.60 to FFr88.20. Casino improved FFr4.00 to FFr146.90 on reports that it might be about to sell a US division. FRANKFURT fell on profit taking, but its losses were relatively light at blue chip level and the DAX index stayed above 1,800 at the close, ending 11.01 lower at 1,807.16. Turnover eased from DM10.6bn to DM9.7bn. There was no obvious pressure on cyclicals, a recent support for the market. Indeed, Daimler only fell DM2 to DM664 after Monday's DM16 gain and, in steels, Thyssen actually rose DM1.30 to DM206.80. However, there were pockets of punishment, mostly lower down the size scale where illiquidity has persisted. In chemicals, for example, Rutgerswerke dropped DM23, or 7.2 per cent to DM296. Meanwhile, the German depression was reflected in a warning of worsening business from Linotype, the printing technology company; its shareholders paid, too, with a fall of DM40, or 8.3 per cent to DM440. MILAN was largely dominated by technical trading as options expired. The market is expected to remain subdued aheads of tomorrow's close of the monthly account. The Comit index eased 0.27 to 545.73. Stet put on L16 to L3,646 at the fix, and moved on to L3,790 on the kerb as foreign interest in the telecommunications sector continued to develop. There are rumours that Stet is planning a L600bn bond issue, convertible into Sip savings shares. Sip was L14 higher at L2,704 and L2,725 in after hours trading. BRUSSELS ended at a record high for the third consecutive day Tuesday, the Bel-20 index climbing 10.21 to 1,328.54. STOCKHOLM's rally accelerated with the Affarsvarlden index gaining 7.0 to 1,134.6. Turnover advanced to SKr947m from SKr755m. Demand for Ericsson B shares continued, rising SKr1 to SKr353. Telecommunications also featured in HELSINKI where Nokia put on FM6 to FM213 and the HEX index gained 11.7 to 1,257.2. TEL AVIV rebounded after a week of losses on a Bank of Israel interest rate cut, the blue chip index rising 5.23, or 2.8 per cent to 191.84.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices July 13 THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1234.15  1233.10   1232.97  1235.27 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1277.12  1278.05   1277.69  1279.51                         13.00    14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1236.10  1236.22   1236.12  1235.91 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1280.83  1280.64   1279.95  1279.32  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jul 12     Jul 9     Jul 8     Jul 7     Jul 6 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1232.90   1230.56   1225.73   1211.33   1203.04 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1274.63   1274.12   1270.80   1260.04   1257.80  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1236.72; 200 - 1283.22 Low/day: 100 - 1232.61 200 - 1275.76.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

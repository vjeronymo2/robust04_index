			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Roads 'fail to boost growth' Building new trunk roads does nothing to improve the economic performance of towns and cities, says a report published today by Greenpeace, the environmental group. The report, by Mr John Whitelegg of environmental consultants Eco-Logica, analysed the number of jobs created in 34 towns and cities in England and Wales between 1985 and 1992. It says there is no relationship between job opportunities in these areas and their distance from trunk roads. Doncaster, less than 20 minutes from the M1 motorway, experienced a fraction of the rise in job opportunities of Grimsby, 70 minutes from the M1, the report says.</p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Italian Christian Democrats find a new identity After more than a year agonising over their future identity Italy's long-ruling Christian Democrats will this week transform themselves into the Popular party, a new centrist Catholic grouping. The move follows the dissolution of parliament and the fixing of early general elections on March 27. The change of identity is an attempt to find a new appeal in the centre-ground of Italian politics - the traditional core of their electorate - after the damage done by the country's corruption scandals. The name is designed to evoke the party founded in 1919 by Mr Luigi Sturzo, which is regarded as the forerunner of the Christian Democrats, themselves founded in 1942. The Socialists are also due to change their name, as is the neo-fascist MSI. The first party to transform itself was the former Communist party which became the Party of the Democratic Left in 1991, with a rump founding a party called Reconstructed Communism. The statutes of the new party are to be finalised today and an inaugural congress is due at the weekend. However, the party, headed for the past 18 months by the sepulchral but canny Mr Mino Martinazzoli, remains divided. New electoral laws have meant that parties must form alliances if they wish to govern, but the nascent party has not yet decided who it should go into alliance with. Mr Martinazzoli is considering three centre groupings - the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi, the newly formed Pact for Italy of Mr Mario Segni, the referendum leader, and supporters of media magnate, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, who is anxious to form a party. However, any one of these alliances risks reshaping the identity of the new Popular party without necessarily assuring electoral success. Much also depends upon whether Mr Berlusconi, who has delayed an announcement for more than six weeks, decides to enter the fray in person. Also, an important minority among the Christian Democrats sees its future in alliance with the left.</p>

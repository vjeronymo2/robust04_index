			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Branson calls for BA chiefs to resign THE bitter battle between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic flared up again yesterday with Mr Richard Branson, the Virgin chairman, challenging the highest level of BA management to resign after renewed allegations in a television documentary that top BA directors were aware of their airline's 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin. Granada's World in Action claimed Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, and Mr Robert Ayling, managing director, knew about the campaign against Virgin. 'They should either test the programme in court or they should consider their position,' Mr Branson said, warning that he intended to issue new writs against BA within the next two weeks. Mr Branson said Sir Colin and Mr Ayling had consistently denied involvement in any 'dirty tricks' campaign but the television programme had suggested the opposite. He said: 'Either some senior people in BA are lying or they should sue.' Mr Branson also urged BA's non-executive directors to step in to prevent costly new court action. BA yesterday declined to comment on Mr Branson's remarks. After the television programme on Monday night, BA said it had no comment to make, adding that 'if sued, we shall deal with these matters in court'.</p>

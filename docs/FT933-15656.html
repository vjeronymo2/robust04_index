			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Triumphant Milosevic heaps scorn on west THE French president's wife, Mrs Danielle Mitterrand, this week became the latest international figure to founder on the rock of Serbian intransigence. She returned to Paris yesterday after failing to persuade President Slobodan Milosevic to free Mr Vuk Draskovic, the opposition leader beaten by police during demonstrations in Belgrade last month. 'It would not be the truth to say I am not disappointed. . . . Perhaps we overestimated our powers of conviction. But I don't believe it was a failure,' Mrs Mitterrand told reporters. But snubbing the west and its envoys is a skill which Mr Milosevic exercises with increasing relish. In a cynical move this week, his cabinet even went so far as to wish Mrs Mitterrand a 'pleasant stay in Belgrade', at the same time as ignoring her pleas for Mr Draskovic's release. With Greater Serbia within his reach, a triumphant Mr Milosevic appears convinced that the time has come to erase any remnants of opposition to his rule. The west's refusal to take action against Serbian forces in Bosnia was a signal to Mr Milosevic that there would be no international resistance if he snuffed out the remaining Serbian opposition and independent media. His earlier promises that Serbia would never bow to western pressure have been fulfilled. Flexing his muscles, Mr Milosevic has refused to release Mr Draskovic, jailed since June 1. He has ignored international appeals on behalf of Mr Draskovic, including personal letters from Mr John Major, UK prime minister, and President Francois Mitterrand. The imprisonment and subsequent beating of the opposition leader and his wife Danica are an act of personal vengeance by the Serbian president, who is unwilling to tolerate any challenge to his hold over Serbia. Last month, he cemented his grip on the remains of Yugoslavia, now comprising Serbia and its tiny ally Montenegro, when he replaced the federal president, Mr Dobrica Cosic, with a faithful party apparatchik. Mr Milosevic now has unlimited power in Serbia. His cronies have been installed at the head of state institutions and enterprises. The open and brutal treatment while in police custody of the opposition leader has sent a clear message to any would-be opponents of the government, as well as ordinary Serbs, of what might will happen to them if they dare resist the government. Belgrade journalists fear Mr Milosevic will soon carry out a purge of the media which opposed his grip on power. The editor-in-chief of Borba, the independent Belgrade daily, is likely to be ousted this week. Mr Milosevic reportedly has a police force of 80,000 available to crush any protest and to sow the seeds of fear prior to possible social unrest as the Serbian economy collapses under the weight of war and 14 months of UN sanctions. There is no doubt sanctions are taking their toll, but they have had no effect on moderating Serbia's hardline stance towards the UN and other international organisations. Serbia over the past month has ordered the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to close its Belgrade offices which monitored human and minority rights. The government also declared as 'unwelcome' the UN special envoy on human rights and war crimes. In addition, Serbia has refused to participate in the Geneva conference on succession in the former Yugoslavia. The unrecognised Yugoslav federation is also delaying or refusing to issue new visas for incoming western diplomats and journalists. Mr Milosevic last week said sanctions would 'not be lifted by pleading or concessions' to the international community. So far his arrogant resistance has paid off. By refusing to bend, he appears to have gained the respect of the west as the main power broker in the Balkans. But for all his present power the Serbian president knows he is in a race against time. This winter could find most inhabitants of Belgrade facing severe heating and food shortages if sanctions continue to be enforced strictly. Then, even 80,000 police could have trouble containing their anger.</p>

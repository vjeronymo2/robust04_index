			<p>920824 FT  24 AUG 92 / Letter: Spat over a 10-gallon hat Sir, Jurek Martin and Matthew Kaminsky suggest in their report on the Republican convention ('Houston in a whirl as the party hurricane hits', August 18) that 'it is the constitutional right of every Texan, and most of the south, to drink and drive'. Now Texans are good-natured people who enjoy poking fun at their own often colourful attitudes. But this characterisation, though undoubtedly intended in jest, is in bad taste. It also misrepresents the views held by most Americans. Lane Hughston, Hurricane Creek Ranch, Route One, Anna, Texas 75248</p>

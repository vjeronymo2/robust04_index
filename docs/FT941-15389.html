			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Venezuelan authorities try to save Banco Latino Venezuelan president Ramon Velasquez was meeting the country's monetary authorities yesterday in an effort to save Banco Latino, the country's second largest commercial bank, which closed its doors after the disclosure that it was suffering serious financial problems. National Guardsmen were posted outside Banco Latino's headquarters in Caracas yesterday and the bank, which has branches nationwide, was closed. There was no indication as to when it might re-open. The government is seen by financial experts as trying to avoid direct intervention - which could prove to be expensive. It has urged other banks to provide assistance to Banco Latino. Its board said it had suffered 'a criminal rumour campaign' over the past three months that caused the loss of over Dollars 500m (Pounds 337m) in deposits. The Venezuelan financial system was relatively calm yesterday. However, the price of Venezuelan government bonds in the international markets fell as much as 4 per cent yesterday before recovering slightly. The minister of finance, Mr Carlos Rafael Silva, said that the authorities must determine whether Banco Latino's problem is 'illiquidity or insolvency'. Banco Latino, which over the past year has offered among the country's highest interest rates on savings and term deposits, began suffering from a severe liquidity crunch last month, and received large sums in rediscounts and advances from the Central Bank. The situation was not stabilised, however, and on January 12 the bank could not meet its obligations in the national cheque clearing system. While the true causes of Banco Latino's problems are not yet clear, this troubled financial institution and some other domestic banks have been hit hard by a recession that began last year and that affected their loan portfolios. Ironically, a new banking law stipulating stricter government supervision and control of banks, plus more stringent capital requirements, went into effect on January 1. At a meeting in the Central Bank on Thursday, representatives of Banco Latino reportedly agreed to raise capital by Dollars 18.6m and seek to strengthen the board by adding new domestic and foreign investors.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. EPISCOPAL BISHOP TO BE CHAIRMAN;  </P> <P> BORSCH HELPS SET UP PUBLISHING HOUSE  </P> <P> Fearing a continuing decline in works of "serious theology," the scholarly new  Episcopal bishop of Los Angeles has spearheaded the formation of a publishing  house linked with SCM Press Ltd., Britain's leading theological publisher.  </P> <P> Bishop Frederick Borsch, a New Testament scholar who has written or edited 12  books, will serve as the chairman of Trinity Press International, which was  given a start by a $1.5-million matching grant from Trinity Episcopal Church in  New York.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 50 Books a Year  </P> <P> Initial plans call for 50 books per year, beginning with a list of 21 titles to  be published in the fall by the British publisher.  </P> <P> Announcement of the venture was only recently made, but the project was  organized by Borsch last year during the time between his January election as  bishop of the Los Angeles Episcopal Diocese and his June installation.  </P> <P> "It was a crazy thing for me to do," said Borsch, citing the complications of  moving from Princeton University to Los Angeles and preparing to lead the  diocese of 152 churches in six counties.  </P> <P> An accumulation of events spurred him to act anyway, he said. Borsch said he  was "very upset" when the Episcopal Church sold its publishing house, Seabury,  in 1983.  </P> <P> Since then, some houses were reorganized as a result of denominational mergers.  Westminster and John Knox -- Presbyterian houses -- are being combined, as are  the Augsburg and Fortress presses within the Evangelical Lutheran Church in  America.  </P> <P> Fortress Press, formerly based in Philadelphia and linked with the relatively  liberal Lutheran Church in America, moved to Minneapolis early this year to  consolidate with Augsburg, whose works are mostly designed for church  curriculums.  </P> <P> Harold Rast resigned late last year as senior editor of Fortress to become  publisher and director of Trinity Press International's U.S. offices in  Philadelphia. Rast claimed in an interview with The Lutheran magazine that  scholarly books "do not have a favored status" in the consolidated publishing  house in Minneapolis. A spokesman for Augsburg Fortress replied that no one  line of books should have a favored position.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Testament Scholars  </P> <P> Trinity Press plans to publish works by New Testament scholars E. P. Sanders  and Helmut Koester, Jewish history specialist Marc Saperstine, German  theologian Jurgen Moltmann and Anglican theologian John Macquarrie.  </P> <P> SCM has an impressive backlist of authors such as Karl Barth, Rudolf Bultmann,  Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Edward Schillebeeckx and Karl Rahner. The house has also  published the once-controversial best-sellers "Honest to God" by John A. T.  Robinson and "The Myth of God Incarnate," edited by John Hick.  </P> <P> Although begun with Episcopal and Anglican church help, Borsch described the  new press as "free of ecclesiastical control yet sympathetic and supportive of  denominational theology and character."  </P> <P> Borsch said publishers with direct denominational ties tend to publish fewer  provocative religious books or biblical studies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Provocative Book Dropped  </P> <P> Indeed, in the face of internal criticism, the United Methodist-related  Abingdon Press dropped a provocative book, "Living in Sin?" by liberal  Episcopal Bishop John Spong. However, amid heightened public attention to the  book, Harper &amp; Row quickly picked it up and published in last May.  </P> <P> If Spong were to write a book debunking the fundamentalist view of the Bible as  error-free (the purpose of a committee he recently convened in his Diocese of  Newark), would Trinity Press International consider publishing it?  </P> <P> "We might not be radical enough for him, but, yes, we might," Borsch said.  </P> <P> Although Borsch said he has a couple more books he would like to write, he does  not know yet when he will find time to do them.  </P></p>

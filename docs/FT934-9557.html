			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Talking about Hong Kong HONG KONG'S has been among the most successful economies of the postwar era. With its combination of free markets, open trading, rule of law and small but socially responsible government, its prosperity is the clearest advertisement for enlightened capitalism. Income per head will, by the time of its transfer to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, exceed that of Britain, its present guardian. British ministers who meet today to map out policy on Hong Kong are discussing a valuable jewel. It is pointless to dwell at this stage on the fact that Britain's approach to Hong Kong has been inconsistent and that the attempts of Mr Chris Patten, its governor, to broaden democracy came far too late. Mr Patten staked out a principled position a year ago of modest expansion of the electoral franchise. Britain must consider the best way to pursue this goal, which appears to command majority support in Hong Kong. Mr Patten is right to insist that Hong Kong's economic success will be undermined unless, in line with China's 'one country, two systems' principle, it has robust and independent institutions. If it does not, the legal system and press freedom will quickly be poisoned. These are worth fighting for, however belatedly. Action plan The British negotiators who have sat through 15 rounds of talks with intransigent Chinese officials may feel that there is little to be gained from further discussion. But on the point of their departure to put this view in London, they have had, in the words of a senior Hong Kong official, their 'cloak tweaked'. The hint of an offer from Beijing to agree on the easy parts of Mr Patten's proposals may be nothing more than an attempt to prolong talks with no actual intention of concluding them. It may prevent a clear-cut decision today, but it does not stop ministers from planning future courses of action based on Beijing producing, or failing to produce, further evidence of willingness to negotiate. Britain has three options: to carry on talking, to cause the talks to be broken off, or to try to pursue a course in between. Each carries risks. A clear intention to keep talking whatever happened would reduce whatever leverage Britain held over China virtually to nothing. The Chinese, knowing that their principal objective of sovereignty has been achieved, could happily filibuster away Mr Patten's proposals until they could not practically be put into effect. China's objections may in any case be so fundamental that no agreement is possible, particularly if its real intention is to keep some of Hong Kong's more vocal democrats out of post-1997 politics. However, while talks continue, it remains possible that China will decide that they should be brought to a successful conclusion. Middle course China's latest suggestion opens the possibility of a middle course which has short-term attractions: to put some of the Patten proposals into law with China's acquiescence while still negotiating on the most difficult points. It may win a little time, but carries the same risks of endless talks. The dangers of the third option, a rupture of talks, are greater. China insists that it will simply dismantle whatever electoral arrangements are made without its agreement. It may take other reprisals. Hong Kong would go through a damaging period of uncertainty. One cause of such uncertainty would be the attitude of LegCo, which must legislate electoral arrangements. It may well opt not to upset China. Allowing LegCo to decide how far to go would, however, allow a measure of choice within Hong Kong about its future. If China then tore up what it had decided, people in Hong Kong would at least know where they stood and could plan their futures accordingly. The point at which London should pull out of talks has not yet been reached. But the option must be retained - and it may have to be exercised soon. It remains in China's strong interest to secure a smooth transfer of Hong Kong. China is itself the biggest investor in the territory. It knows that its actions in Hong Kong will be closely watched in Taiwan, upon which it will next set its sights. China agreed to hold talks on Mr Patten's proposals. It should show that its continued participation means something.</p>

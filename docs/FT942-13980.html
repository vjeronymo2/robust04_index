			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Council tax rules to be changed The government is to alter rules that threatened thousands of householders with backdated demands for higher council tax. Increasing activity in the housing market has uncovered mistakes in valuing homes for council-tax purposes, leading to demands for the higher tax backdated to April 1993. Changes to the council tax regulations announced last night mean that the higher tax will apply only from the date of revaluation. However, where the value of a property is decreased, the householder will still be able to claim back the extra tax paid since April 1993.</p>

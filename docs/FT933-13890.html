			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Japan's property loans increase JAPAN'S leading banks increased their lending to the property sector during the year ended March on the back of strong demand for emergency loans from stricken property companies. According to Tokyo Shoko Research, a private credit research company, outstanding loans by the top 101 banks to real estate companies totalled Y55,850bn (Dollars 520.26bn), an increase of 6.9 per cent from the previous year. The figure exceeded the 2.3 per cent rise in the banks' overall lending. While the rise in property related lending in the late 1980s was prompted by speculative investments, Tokyo Shoko said the latest loan growth reflected the continuing difficulty in the country's property business. An increase in advance purchases for public works projects, following the implementation of the government's emergency economic stimulus packages, also contributed to the rise. The 11 city, or commercial, banks were the most prominent in lending to property companies, increasing loans by 8.7 per cent to Y26,083bn. The seven trust banks increased lending by 6.6 per cent, the three long term credit banks by 3.5 per cent, and the regional banks by 5.8 per cent. Among leading city banks, Sanwa Bank had the largest year-on-year rise in property loans, increasing its lending by 14.4 per cent to Y3,261.8bn, followed by Asahi Bank, up 13.3 per cent to Y2,119.9bn. Mitsubishi Trust and Banking led the trust banks, with an increase of 17.7 per cent to Y1,949.8bn. On the other hand, property lending decreased 2.5 per cent to Y1,801.6bn at Mitsui Trust and Banking. The percentage of property lending to total loans rose 0.49 percentage points to 11.54 per cent. Nippon Trust Bank led the list with property lending accounting for 26.7 per cent of total loans, followed by Nippon Credit Bank at 23.8 per cent. Sakura Bank topped the list of total outstanding loans to the property industry, with Y4,551.3bn. Sanwa was second with Y3,261.8bn followed by Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank with Y3,235.8bn.  ---------------------------------------        PROPERTY LOANS TO OVERALL          LENDING: TOP 10 BANKS  --------------------------------------- Nippon Trust Bank                26.7% Nippon Credit Bank               23.8% Fukutoku Bank                    18.3% Hanshin Bank                     17.9% Chiba Bank                       17.8% Taiheiyo Bank                    17.6% Chuo Trust                       17.3% Toyo Trust                       16.7% Tokuyo City Bank                 16.6% Mitsui Trust                     16.5%  --------------------------------------- Source: Tokyo Shoko Research  ---------------------------------------</p>

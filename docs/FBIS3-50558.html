			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marcela Gutierrez] </F>   [Text] Peasant organizations of the Permanent Agrarian  Congress [Congreso Agrario Permanente] rejected today the  outbreak of violence in Chiapas State but agreed in saying that  the armed struggle is the result of the poverty and neglect in  which the peasants from that region must live.    Jose Luis Gonzalez Aguilera, coordinator of the Permanent  Agrarian Congress, has said that the problems of the Indian  groups will not be resolved with weapons but admitted that the  violence that prevails in Chiapas is the product of increased  poverty and, often, the systematic repression that these social  groups have had to endure.    Gonzalez did not disregard the possibility of the Zapata  National Liberation Army being led by Guatemalan guerrillas.    Meanwhile, Jose Luis Hernandez, a peasant leader from the  Independent Central Organization of Agricultural Workers and  Peasants [CIOAC], has said that the problem can be resolved by  establishing a truce between the government and the armed group.    [Begin Hernandez recording] We completely reject an Army  intervention to give this matter any kind of military or police  treatment, because this is not what this is about. These people  are not criminals committing a crime; they are human beings  demanding justice. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Alvaro Lopez, a leader of the National Union of  Agricultural Workers [UNTA], and Ignacio Iris Salomon, of  (Coduc) [not further identified] has called on the parties to  resolve the armed conflict as soon as possible, because it  represents a threat to the country's social stability on the eve  of the August 1994 federal elections.</p>

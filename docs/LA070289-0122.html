			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE SOUTH BAY  </P> <P> "This is a beginning, something that's good, something you build on," sports  great turned businessman Willie D. Davis said Saturday as he became the first  person to take his place on Inglewood's fledgling Promenade of Prominence.  </P> <P> A granite marker bearing the name and likeness of Davis -- a pro football hall  of famer who spent most of his 12-year career with Vince Lombardi's Green Bay  Packers -- was unveiled on La Brea Avenue in front of KACE radio. It is  headquarters for Davis' five-station broadcasting company.  </P> <P> Councilman Daniel K. Tabor, who emceed the sunny sidewalk event that slowed  traffic and drew honks from passing motorists, said future markers will honor  others who have contributed to Inglewood.  </P> <P> "The idea is to show that Inglewood isn't a crime-ridden, decaying city, but  one where people are building things up and saying there is a positive side to  Inglewood," Tabor said.  </P> <P> The Promenade of Prominence concept was born last fall in Watts, when Dr. James  A. Mays -- a cardiologist practicing in Inglewood and Los Angeles -- borrowed  an idea from the Hollywood Walk of Fame and honored veteran Los Angeles County  Supervisor Kenneth Hahn in granite along the edge of Will Rogers County Park.  </P> <P> He said the new promenade in Inglewood is an expansion of that idea, aimed at  highlighting what he called the hopeful side of black America, which he also is  taking to Lynwood and Compton.  </P> <P> "We have a heart as a symbol, in contrast to a star," Mays said.  </P> <P> "The heart is the symbol of giving."

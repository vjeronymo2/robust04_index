			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Technology: Italy faces growing deficit in R&amp;D ITALIAN industry, in need of innovations to help it survive in competitive markets, is slipping behind in the technology race. As the country struggles to sort out its public finances, austerity measures are likely to further weaken the commitment of both government and industry to research and development. Italy has already fallen behind the other Group of Seven industrialised countries in R &amp; D spending. Between 1985 and 1989, it spent only 1.2 per cent of its Gross Domestic Product on R &amp; D, compared with 2.8 per cent in Germany, 2.3 per cent in France and the UK, and 2.9 per cent in the US and Japan. Italy's dependence on imports of technology is also much higher and its share of new patents is far smaller than that of other industrialised countries. In 1990, Italy accounted for 4 per cent of patents issued by the European Patent Office, compared with 9.4 per cent for France, 5.7 per cent for the UK, 20.5 per cent for Germany, 23.4 per cent for the US, and 25.1 per cent for Japan. Italy has its largest technological deficits with the main industrialised nations and the gaps are widest in the most advanced areas. It tends to have a positive balance with less developed countries. But in sectors where Italy has traditionally been strong, especially textiles, leather goods and furniture, there are signs that Italian companies are being undercut from the Far East and eastern Europe. Italy's apparent technological laziness stems partly from a growing tendency by companies to acquire producers of the goods they want or to buy the technology from abroad rather than invest in R &amp; D. This is in sharp contrast to the entrepreneurial spirit of the 1960s and 1970s. Also to blame is the lack of a coherent national industrial policy, as well as the habit of some big companies of asking for state hand-outs when they hit problems. But there are some areas where Italy is showing its innovative spirit - electronics, advanced transport systems and precision instruments. Aerospace accounted for 12 per cent of total R &amp; D spending by private companies in 1988 against 9 per cent in 1981. Spending on precision instruments and machine tools and on electricals and electronics also rose. Several state ministries have funds for R &amp; D. The ministry of scientific research aims to use its funds - amounting to L250bn (Pounds 114.7m) last year - on research programmes that will strengthen the position of Italian companies in export markets or enable them to catch up in high-tech areas. However, the ministry allocates most of its funds to larger companies which hinders the innovative potential of the country's smaller, more flexible, groups. The ministry is encouraging more private investment in its research programmes and is increasingly linking its own financing to results, in an attempt to lessen the dependence of big companies on state funding.</p>

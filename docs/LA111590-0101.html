			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HARVARD WATER POLO TEAM BLOWS CHANCES AND MATCH  </P> <P> Having a man advantage proved to be no advantage for the Harvard High water  polo team Wednesday in its Southern Section 3-A Division quarterfinal match  against La Serna.  </P> <P> Seven times La Serna was called for a penalty that left Harvard with a  six-on-five manpower edge, and seven times the host Saracens failed to  capitalize.  </P> <P> Coincidentally, Harvard lost by seven goals, 14-7.  </P> <P> Brian Pyle scored three goals for La Serna, despite suffering a cut in the  corner of his right eye in the first quarter. His final goal broke a 5-5  third-quarter tie and gave third-seeded La Serna (21-4) a lead it never  relinquished.  </P> <P> Pyle was taken to a hospital for stitches after the game.  </P> <P> "The kid is tough," said Harvard Coach Rich Corso, whose sixth-seeded Saracens  (22-7) struggled against a tough man-to-man defense. "He needs stitches in his  eye and tells his coaches, 'Don't take me out.' I respect his attitude. He was  the key."  </P> <P> Corso also pointed to his team's inability to score with an extra player as  another factor.  </P> <P> "We were tentative with the ball at six-on-five," Corso said. "You can't be  like that in championship play."  </P> <P> Said senior captain Brian Border: "Our six-on-five looked good in practice. If  we made a few of those, we would have done better."  </P> <P> Even with their problems with the extra man, the Saracens battled the Lancers  to a 4-4 halftime tie.  </P> <P> Harvard started the third period as the more aggressive team. Ryan Salceda put  in his own rebound to give Harvard a 5-4 lead. Shortly after that, three  Harvard players broke free toward the La Serna net, but an official stopped the  breakaway by calling a foul against La Serna.  </P> <P> La Serna shut down Harvard, then Ryan Loeff tied the score, 5-5.  </P> <P> "The momentum shifted after the call," La Serna Coach Tom Losonsky said. "When  we tied it, the momentum shifted all the way back to us."  </P> <P> La Serna scored the next five goals to clinch the match.  </P> <P> Rodney Serge scored five goals, four in the final period, for La Serna. Jim  Toring scored four goals for Harvard.  </P> <P> In another Southern Section 3-A quarterfinal water polo match:  </P> <P> Riverside Poly 8, Agoura 6 -- Kevin Driscoll and Terry Polapink each scored two  goals for ninth-seeded Agoura (18-6) in Riverside.  </P></p>

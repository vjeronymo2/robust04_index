			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant General Aleksandr Tymko, chief of the </F> Main Staff of the Russian Border Troops: "When Will There Be an  End to the Lack of Borders. Lieutenant General Aleksandr Tymko,  Chief of the Border Troops Main Staff, Presents the New Concept  for the Protection of the State Border"]    [Text] Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev, commander in  chief of the Russian Federation [RF] Border Troops, put the  Concept for the Border Troops' Protection of the State Border,  the RF Exclusive Economic Zone, and the CIS States' External  Borders into effect 25 January this year after submitting it to  the RF Government. This document is nothing new for the troops.  May 1991 saw the adoption of the first concept defining reform  of protection of the border and the USSR's economic zone.  However it was not put into practice. The processes of  disintegration made it necessary to considerably rework many of  its provisions. In December 1992 a new version appeared -- with  a purely Russian state "slant." But the fluidity of the  geopolitical situation on the territory of the former USSR had  an adverse effect on the previously established system of border  protection and the domestic political situation in Russia  changed so rapidly throughout 1993 that the second concept too  suffered the fate of its predecessor -- it was no longer  current. It became necessary to formulate a new concept to take  into consideration current realities. Which are as follows.    With the formation of the RF there have been radical changes  in the status, position, and conditions for the protection of  the State Border. Around 14,000 km of the over 60,000-km  Russian border (over 80 percent of the land border) is in new  positions that had not been prepared for service or formalized  in international law. The RF Border Troops have lost around 40  percent of their ground-, sea-, and air-based forces and  facilities along with prepared sites for their deployment and  for the basing of naval and air-based forces, engineering and  technical facilities, a well-oiled border infrastructure,  training facilities, command and communications posts, barracks  and housing, and virtually all the international communications  posts in the west and south of the country. The Border Troops'  combat capabilities have more than halved.    Russia currently has one-half or one-third the amount of  ships and launches as the United States and Japan per unit area  of its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone. Limited  use of ships owing to fuel shortages increases this gap still  further. And the troops' lack of icebreakers virtually reduces  to zero protection of the State Border and Russia's exclusive  economic zone in the Arctic. An extremely grave situation has  developed as regards troop manning, particularly in terms of  the draft contingent.    The troops lack a total of over 7,000 officers alone and  around 20,000 drafted servicemen. Negative trends have also  manifested themselves in the social sphere. To date over 10,000  officers and warrant officers in the Border Troops are without  apartments, and the question of housing for the families of  servicemen from the combined formations and units withdrawn from  the Baltic states and Azerbaijan, and also from the  newly-created checkpoints, is an acute one. In these conditions  there was an objective need for the phased creation of the  Russian Border Troops rather than for their reorganization -- a  need reflected in the new concept.    Revival could be said to be the main idea behind the new  concept for the protection of Russia's borders. Revival of the  Border Troops, revival of reliable protection of the Russian  State Border and the external borders of the CIS states, and  also revival of the actual prestige of border service. It was  on this that President Yeltsin focused his attention in his  speech 27 May this year during a meeting with the leadership of  the Federal Border Service of the Russian Border Troops Main  Command.    The fundamental difference between the new concept and the  previous ones is the fact that it allows for a change in the  conditions of border protection to an extent consonant with the  transitional period.    Presumably in the event of a change of emphasis in Russia's  domestic and foreign policy certain provisions of the latest  concept will not be put into effect. However it will by and  large remain effective.    The concept stipulates that its main objective is to revive  the Russian Border Troops and ensure the protection on the State  Border of the vital interests of the individual, society, and  the Russian state within the Commonwealth countries' overall  collective security system.    The concept is based on the principles of the peaceful  resolution of border issues and the development of cooperation  in guarding the borders of the Commonwealth states and the  suitability of combat personnel and the numerical strength of  the Border Troops with the tasks to be performed, current  legislation, and Russia's international commitments and economic  potential.    Provision is also made for ensuring the personal safety of  personnel and Border Troop formations, the centralization of  their leadership, and the principle of one-man command on a  legal basis.    The concept lays down the main areas of the RF Border  Troops'  activity with consideration for the special features of the  regions and the state's economic potential, along with their  role and position in guarding the Commonwealth's external  borders.    In two or three years it is planned to create in all regions  a Border Troop grouping disposed in depth, plus operational  reserves, and also to form a system of material and technical  support.    Moreover a considerable increase in the troops' potential as  regards the protection of the exclusive economic zone is  envisaged.    Combating intelligence and subversive activity by foreign  intelligence services and organizations and also illegal actions  by criminal communities on the State Border, and raising the  quality of border surveillance and standards at border  checkpoints to international norms and standards are priority  areas in the Border Troops' activity of guarding the State  Border. The "human factor" -- looking after troops and  providing servicemen with social protection -- has been singled  out as a priority area of activity.    The creation of the CIS and the Economic Union, and the  existence of "transparent" borders between the republics of the  former USSR have also created new political realities, primarily  a commitment by all Commonwealth states to ensuring a stable  situation on the external borders. However, by no means all the  newly formed states have an opportunity or the means to reliably  protect their borders, which compels them to seek ways of  pooling efforts to ensure their own security on their external  borders.    At present, in line with requests from the leadership of  Armenia, Georgia, Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], and Tajikistan, RF  Border Troops are stationed on the territory of these states  guarding their state borders with Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, and  China, which are at the same time Commonwealth external borders.  What is more, some Russian Border Troop officers and warrant  officers are protecting Turkmenistan's external state borders  with Afghanistan and Iran.    Questions of pooling or coordinating efforts in the  protection of external borders on the territory of the former  USSR are being resolved in one way or another with Belorussia  [Belarus], Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan with  consideration for the special features of each state's approach  to this matter.    The role of the Russian Border Troops in guarding the  Commonwealth's external borders is vividly manifested in  Tajikistan. The Russian Border Troops in collaboration with  troop contingents from other Commonwealth states are performing  the tasks of stopping armed groups, weapons, munitions, and  drugs penetrating the Tajik-Afghan border. This is having a  positive effect on the stabilization of the situation both in  Tajikistan itself and in other adjacent states.    Existing Border Troop groupings will guard the border with  consideration for special regional features in areas that  coincide with the former USSR border, while this task will be  performed by newly-formed Russian Border Troop groupings on  borders with the Baltic States (as with distant foreign  countries).    In the Caucasus it is planned to guard the border in two  positions: First -- on the CIS external borders (Georgia,  Armenia, and possibly Azerbaijan); the second border protection  line follows the Russian State Border, in view of the situation  on the border and in adjacent regions.    Our border with Belorussia will be guarded on the basis of a  treaty, focusing more on guarding the external CIS border in  this region. Our border guards will quite possibly guard this  section of the CIS border jointly with Belorussia's border  troops.    The Russian-Ukrainian border will be guarded in line with  the  situation prevailing there, eventually on a joint basis with  Ukrainian Border Troops.    Our border guards also guard the external borders of  Tajikistan and Kirghizia on the basis of a treaty.    By and large emphasis is placed on a sensible combination of  possibilities for safeguarding the state's security on its own  border and the external borders of the Commonwealth. Thus  memorandums have been signed on joint protection of the  Commonwealth states' external borders in the Central Asian and  Western regions. The question of signing a similar memorandum  with the states of the Transcaucasus is on the agenda.    The exclusive economic zone is guarded by formations of  naval  forces and aviation and coastal forces and facilities of the  Border Troops interacting with the forces and facilities of RF  ministries and departments. At the same time the main efforts  are concentrated on inhibiting and suppressing illegal activity  by Russian and foreign ships. The formulation and introduction  of a state system to monitor and track the situation and  identify ships by water area and by region is being organized.    Over the next year or two we will seek the optimum scenarios  for the protection of the State Border at sea by means of the  comprehensive use of sea- and air-based forces and facilities in  conjunction with land-based (coastal) components. Studies and  experiments will be conducted into the creation of special  sea-based formations of the Border Troops on a tactical and  operational level.    In the Arctic region protection of the border is being  reorganized with consideration for the opening of the Arctic  ship route to foreign ships in transit through Russian ports;  operational activity is being improved and the basis of a  unified system for monitoring the surface situation in  territorial waters and ports is being outlined, for which a  structurally complete Border Troop grouping is being created in  the Arctic.    Effective technologies are being introduced at RF State  Border checkpoints, and the provision of equipment for all  components of border control is being improved in order to  detect and avert illegal border crossing by individuals and  transport systems.    At present a considerable proportion of the RF Border Troop  grouping operates in areas of local wars and armed conflicts.  The concept stipulates for the first time that under these  conditions the State Border is guarded in collaboration with the  forces and facilities of the RF and CIS states' Armed Forces and  other troops, using forms and methods characteristic of border  service and systematic combat operations by the troops with  consideration for the special features of the prevailing  situation. In some areas the Border Troops are switching to the  defense and protection of Russia's State Border jointly with the  Armed Forces. Steps are being taken to ensure the personal  safety of the Border Troops.    Practice shows that any scientific or practical idea and the  most necessary and carefully conceived program will remain just  a good intention if it is not backed up by material-technical  and financial resources. The implementation of the concept  necessitates the adoption of certain urgent measures at federal  level to ensure the security of the RF on its borders and the  external borders of the Commonwealth states.    These measures could include the provision of amenities for  troops on the new borders, the creation of the requisite  infrastructure to ensure that troops are maintained on permanent  combat readiness and are capable of performing their tasks of  reliably guarding the border under varying conditions. The  concept itself also includes a mechanism for the implementation  of its main provisions. It envisages in particular the  submission to RF legislative bodies of draft laws on the  protection of the State Border, the exclusive economic zone, and  areas of Border Troop activity; the publication of departmental  statutory instruments by the commander in chief of the Border  Troops; and the formulation and adoption of annual plans for  organizational and other development of the Border Troops.    Thus the establishment and formalization in international  law  of the RF State Border, the formation and provision of amenities  for the troops on the new borders, their strengthening and  development, manning, the intensification of their social  protection, and also comprehensive material and technical  support are the priority tasks in 1994.    This year provision is being made for the formation of  additional troop and operational groups, operational-troop  departments, border detachments, individual border subunits  [komendatury], a border control detachment and individual  checkpoints, naval units and subunits, individual air squadrons,  tactical reserves, and other units. By the end of the year the  RF Border Troop grouping may have increased by 20,000-30,000 men.    A considerable part of the concept is devoted to developing  a  system of legal and social protection for servicemen and other  citizens involved in the protection of the State Border. Draft  legislative acts designed to provide legal protection, establish  guarantees and compensation, boost the standard of living of the  servicemen, primarily those serving in subunits directly  guarding the border and the exclusive economic zone, and develop  a system of benefits with consideration for  physical-geographical and other regional features have been  outlined and formulated. Agreements are being drafted with  Commonwealth states on matters pertaining to the legal status,  material and financial support, benefits and compensation,  housing, medical, pension, everyday-service and trade, and other  kinds of support for RF Border Troop servicemen involved in  guarding the State Border on their territories.    The wide-ranging tasks envisaged by the concept can only be  resolved if the troops are manned by professionally trained  cadres.    The phased transition to a mixed system of manning,  including  citizens from the CIS states coming to serve in the Russian  Border Troops on contract, is a priority in manning and training  of cadres and personnel for the Russian Border Troops. This is  only possible once amendments have been made to current  legislation.    It is also necessary to formulate and introduce systems for  the professional recruitment and assessment of the quality of  cadres' activity, their transfer and promotion, and the  provision of incentives for officer cadres'  military-professional activity; to develop regional centers for  the training of warrant officers (ensigns); and to improve the  system of training for border guard officers. The formation of  a Border Troops Military Academy will undoubtedly help resolve  the problem of providing the troops with trained officer cadres.    The question of creating a Border Troop Polytechnical  Institute is being studied.    Questions pertaining to the scientific study of problems of  the theory and practice of guarding the State Border hold a  special place in the concept.    In its current state scientific support cannot be improved  by  cosmetic means. It must first be shaped into an integral system  whereby any scientific idea that is of benefit to the troops  finds someone to implement it and a customer. We have formed a  complete system of scientific support which makes it possible to  provide a comprehensive solution to all the troops' important  problems based on in-depth scientific studies. The Center for  Operational-Border Studies and the Border Troops Research  Technical Center is intended to be an important component of the  system of scientific support for the troops' activity that is  being developed.    In view of the fact that it is hard to predict the duration  of the transitional period, it has been decided to implement the  concept by formulating and adopting annual plans for the  organizational and other development of the Border Troops.    I would like to hope that the new document will be a real  basis for our work of strengthening Russian statehood and  defending the vital national interests of the RF and the  Commonwealth states.</p>

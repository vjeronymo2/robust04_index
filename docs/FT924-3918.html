			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: Top German banks report strong advance in profits TWO OF Germany's biggest banks yesterday reported a strong rise in profits for the first 10 months of the year. Commerzbank, Germany's third-biggest bank after Dresdner Bank and Deutsche Bank, raised total operating profits 13.3 per cent to DM1.67bn (Dollars 1.06bn) in the first 10 months and predicted full-year profits would exceed DM2bn, against DM1.83bn last year. Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel-Bank, a large Bavaria-based bank, reported operating profits up 13.2 per cent to DM1.29bn for the 10 months and said partial operating profits - which exclude trading income - increased by 23.2 per cent to DM1.27bn. However, the banks warned of a worsening risk environment, and analysts said the banks' figures for the current year would be the peak of the sector's profitability. The reason for the sharp increases in profits is that lending growth has continued to climb in spite of the economic slowdown, and the banks have held back costs. The economic downturn has not yet led to an increase in bad debts, although bankers warn that credit risk has increased sharply. At Commerzbank, total lending for the group rose 2.4 per cent to DM161.6bn, while net interest income climbed 10.3 per cent to DM3.69bn. Commission income rose 2 per cent to DM1.1bn, reflecting poor stock market conditions. Total earnings rose 8.7 per cent, while expenses rose 6.3 per cent. At Hypo-Bank, net interest income rose 17.3 per cent to DM2.7bn, while lending climbed 10.6 per cent overall to DM167bn. Commission income was 14 per cent up at DM472.5m. Mr Martin Kohlhaussen and Mr Eberhard Martini, chief executives of Commerzbank and Hypo-Bank respectively, said the lending climate had deteriorated sharply. Mr Martini said the deterioration had not yet fed through to the 10-month figures, but had been reflected in the number of refused applications for credit.</p>

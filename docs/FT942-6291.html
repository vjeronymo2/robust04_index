			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei sets another year's high Strong foreign buying of heavy industrial shares lifted equities to another new high for the year, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average gained a net 61.81 at 20,838.97, having hit a high for the day of 20,932.19 after a strong opening. Selling by domestic institutions through much of the day was absorbed and overwhelmed by heavy buying by overseas investors and securities dealers, but the index registered a low of 20,817.16 in the process. The Topix index of all first section stocks added 7.57 at 1,678.33. Rises led falls by 585 to 432, with 166 issues unchanged. Some arbitrageurs unwound Topix-linked positions, thereby dampening the market's upward momentum. The Nikkei 300 put on 1.43 at 307.18. Volume was high for a Monday, reaching an estimated 600m shares on all first section stocks, against Friday's 523m. However, many traders viewed the recent market gains with caution, citing a weight of sell orders overhanging the market at the 21,000 level. Shipbuilders gained from speculation that China's economic growth and increasing demand for foreign oil would spur demand for oil tankers. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries advanced Y19 to Y768 and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Y32 to Y475. Electrical and communications stocks performed strongly and Hitachi moved ahead Y20 to Y1,070 and Toshiba Y17 to Y838. Fuji Photo climbed Y110 to Y2,310 after the company said it had started clinical tests in the US of a chemical compound that could help develop an anti-cancer drug. In Osaka, the OSE average reached 23,058.32, a gain on the day of 177.13. Volume amounted to 35.9m shares, well ahead of Friday's 26.8m. Roundup The region's markets put in varying performances yesterday. Pakistan was closed for a holiday. HONG KONG retreated from a midsession high of 9,577.67 as profit-taking took hold, but the Hang Seng index nevertheless ended the day up 53.50 at 9,523.63. Turnover dropped to HKDollars 3.4bn, well short of Friday's HKDollars 5.7bn. Equities were also pressured by futures, with the Hang Seng May index futures down 40 at 9,490 and the June contract off 55 at 9,505. China H shares were popular after their recent underperformance: Tsingtao advanced 20 cents to HKDollars 7.05, Shanghai Petro 2.50 cents to HKDollars 2.15 and Guangzhou Shipyard 7.50 cents to HKDollars 2.925. TAIPEI recovered most of Friday's losses on a strong performance from the electronics sector. The weighted index moved forward 62.80, or 1.1 per cent, to 5,934.50 in turnover of TDollars 48.2bn. United Microelectronics and Tatung, an electrical appliance maker, both rose by the daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 102.50 and TDollars 67 respectively. SINGAPORE eased as the banking sector was affected by fears of a further tightening in US monetary policy. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 18.06 at 2,305.89, while volume was a low 66.4m shares. Singapore Airlines foreign stock went against the trend, rising 30 cents to SDollars 13.30. MANILA saw foreign buying of Manila Electric, up 6 per cent, and San Miguel, 4 per cent higher, together with expectations of strong first-quarter GDP figures to be released soon. The composite index added 44.39 at 2,951.39. BOMBAY was moderately firmer on selective buying but volume remained low. The BSE 30-share index closed 36.39 up at 3,824.90. Some brokers commented that large institutions remained inactive because of the continuing ban by the Securities and Exchange Board of India on badla, or the carry forward system of trading. SYDNEY fell back as sentiment was undermined by slightly worse than expected current account data. The All Ordinaries index dipped 10.4 to 2,091.8 in thin turnover of ADollars 263m. Among active stocks, the building materials and sugar group CSR, which reported earnings much in line with expectations, shed 21 cents to ADollars 4.93. BHP finished 10 cents lower at ADollars 18.34 in volume of 2.03m shares and News Corp eased 6 cents to ADollars 9.10. WELLINGTON was softer in light volume, the NZSE-40 capital index slipping 6.16 to 2,142.43. Turnover was an unexceptional NZDollars 22.1m. Investors were not encouraged by Standard &amp; Poor's upgrading of brewers Lion Nathan and DB Group, the former losing 5 cents to NZDollars 3.55 and DB ending unchanged at 85 cents.</p>

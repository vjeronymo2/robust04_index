			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> My Darling Clementine (Channel 28 Sunday at 2 p.m.) is John Ford's memorable  1946 take on the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, starring Henry Fonda as Wyatt  Earp and Victor Mature as Doc Holliday.  </P> <P> Moonstruck (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.): One of the juiciest romantic comedies of the  '80s, this is the film that provided Cher the Oscar-winning role that let her  comic sensibilities out for a romp as a young widow whose dull life suddenly  shifts 180 degrees under the spell of an extraordinarily full moon.  </P> <P> Featuring Nicolas Cage, Danny Aiello and Olympia Dukakis.  </P> <P> Lady for a Day (AMC Thursday at noon) is the 1933 Frank Capra heart-tugger  based on a Damon Runyon story about an apple peddler (May Robson) turned into a  lady by a gangster (Warren William) to impress the daughter who never has known  her; Capra remade it in 1961 with Bette Davis as "A Pocketful of Miracles."  </P></p>

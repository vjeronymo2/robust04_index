			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / The Dollar in Decline: Strong US fundamentals overlooked - Michael Prowse on the sharp divergence between America and the other big industrial economies President Bill Clinton did the dollar a disservice at the Naples economic summit last weekend by signalling his apparent indifference to its short-term fate on foreign exchange markets. Yet the US administration's argument that traders are failing to pay sufficient attention to strong US economic fundamentals is not without merit. The main point that seems to be overlooked in financial markets is the extent of the cyclical divergence in the economic performance of the US, on the one hand, and Europe and Japan, on the other. While most industrial countries have languished in recession, the US is now in its fourth year of a vigorous upswing in the business cycle. Since the trough of the recession in early 1991, US gross domestic product has increased by nearly 10 per cent. Gross private investment is up by one third in real terms. Employment did not begin to recover until early 1992 but, since then, the US economy has generated about 5.3m new jobs - a percentage increase of almost 5 per cent. This powerful cyclical upturn, moreover, has been led by the private sector. Overall non-farm business productivity grew by more than 4.5 per cent in 1992 and 1993. Manufacturing productivity grew by an astounding 9.6 per cent, far faster than in previous upturns. Also, for the first time in recent history, the recovery was not artificially induced by fiscal expansion. After more than a decade of large deficits, the US Congress has co-operated with both the Bush and Clinton administrations in reducing the deficit. The deficit may fall below Dollars 190bn (Pounds 121bn) this fiscal year and to as little as Dollars 150bn in fiscal 1995 - or about 2 per cent of GDP, the lowest level since 1979. The strong upturn has led to higher prices of some commodities, but it has not yet put much upward pressure on broad indices of inflation. Yesterday, the US labour department reported a zero increase in producer prices in June, both relative to May and on an annual comparison. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the index fell 0.1 per cent last month and rose only 0.6 per cent from June last year. Consumer price figures are due today - the annual rate of increase has been running at 2.5 per cent or less in recent months. The Federal Reserve, moreover, has taken pre-emptive action to try to prevent inflation rising next year, raising short-term rates 1 1/4 percentage points to 4 1/4 per cent since early February. Financial markets tend to discount the good domestic economic news and focus instead on less encouraging trends in the US balance of payments. The US has run a current account deficit every year since 1982, thereby converting itself from a creditor to a debtor nation. During the 1980s, the current account deficit was readily financed by capital inflows - especially Japanese purchases of securities and direct foreign investment. The balance of payments strains have worsened recently for two reasons. First, the current account deficit has grown rapidly in the past 18 months, reflecting much faster growth in the US than elsewhere; it will reach about 2 per cent of GDP this year. Capital flows have also been adverse. US investors have sought to diversify their portfolios by increasing investment in Europe and 'emerging markets' in developing countries. At the same time, foreigners - especially the Japanese - have been less willing to invest in the US, following weakness of the share and bond markets. However, these pressures need to be seen in perspective. As the graphs show, the dollar is not particularly weak, except against the yen. In trade-weighted terms, the dollar has fallen by more than 5 per cent this year but remains in its trading range of the past few years. Excluding the yen, the dollar has strengthened in trade-weighted terms since last year. This partly reflects the dollar's strength against currencies such as the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso. The strains on the US balance of payments may now be at their worst. In his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to Congress later this month, Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, is likely to signal the need for further increases in US short-term interest rates, following recent confirmation that growth remains robust. Some economists expect short-term rates to reach 6 per cent by early next year. As US rates rise, capital inflows to the US are likely to recover. The US current account deficit is also set to improve in 1995 and 1996, as European and Japanese economies emerge from recession. There is little reason to suppose that the deterioration of the US trade account reflects a fundamental lack of competitiveness. US merchandise exports to countries not in recession, including many developing countries and much of Asia, have continued to grow vigorously, reflecting the quality and attractive prices of US products. Indeed, there are already signs of a recovery in overall US export growth: export volumes for the year to date are running about 7 per cent above last year's level, compared with about 2 per cent late last year. The volatility of the dollar on the foreign exchanges is a source of concern for the Clinton administration, but senior officials are justified in accusing the financial markets of myopia. The cyclical strains on the balance of payments are obscuring excellent underlying economic fundamentals in the US.</p>

Contrary to the U.S. expectations that Japan would eventually  back down, the summit meeting 10 days ago ended in failure --  the first occurrence in the history of such meetings between  Japan and the United States. But according to several Japanese  Government officials who participated in the negotiations, at  least where the areas of medical technology, telecommunications,  and insurance were concerned, they were supposed to be "close to  reaching agreements." The breakdown of the talks was due to  misunderstandings by both Japan and the United States on a  "phantom compromise proposal" suggested by the United States.  <H5>  Acceptable Plan </H5>   On the afternoon of 8 February, U.S. Trade Representative  [USTR] Mickey Kantor, who was exasperated by the stubborn  resistance of Japanese bureaucrats, announced a unilateral  suspension of negotiations, saying: "No progress can be expected  through further talks among the bureaucrats. We will wait for  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who leads the negotiations, to  arrive in the United States."    The following evening, on 9 February, when Koichiro  Matsuura,  deputy-vice minister for foreign affairs, was about to leave the  conference room after a day of talks, Bowman Cutter, deputy  assistant to the President, stopped him, and asked, "Does Japan  want to finalize these consultations?"    "Of course," Matsuura responded.    Saying "If that is the case," Cutter orally informed  Matsuura  of a U.S. compromise proposal. His words were: "Let us finalize  the talks on macroeconomic issues and government procurement and  insurance sectors without including numerical targets, and then  round up the talks on the automobiles and auto parts within one  month after the summit meeting is held."    Matsuura believed the compromise proposal had the final  approval of the U.S. Government, and thought, "that should be  acceptable." Subsequently, he notified Zosaburo Okamatsu, deputy  vice-minister of international trade and industry, and Kosuke  Nakahira, deputy vice-minister for financial affairs, that "the  United States has backed down."    For a moment, however, a puzzling thought entered Okamatsu's  mind -- this position seemed so different from the rigid stance  taken by the USTR.  <H5>  Clash in the Second Meeting </H5>   The first meeting of Hata and Kantor opened at 0730 on 10  February. Kantor said: "Let us aim for the goal of reaching  agreements." To this, Hata, who had been apprised of the  Matsuura-Cutter meeting, responded, "I understand what you mean.  (These things can be taken care of at the working-level talks.)  That is about it, right?"    Therein occurred a misunderstanding. Kantor interpreted  Hata's response as a concession by Japan. But what Hata really  meant was to aim for the goal of reaching agreements by allowing  working-level officials to resume their talks. He proposed  reopening working-level talks, and Kantor accepted.    This meeting [between Hata and Kantor] was attended by  Matsuura and Cutter as well. But Matsuura could not at all  detect in Kantor's remarks any sign that the United States was  making concessions, as suggested by Cutter's proposal. The  harried Matsuura contacted Deputy USTR Charlene Barshevsky, but  her reply was heartless: "the USTR's position has not changed."    In a meeting of the National Economic Council (NEC) on the  morning of 10 February, Kantor reported that there was a feeling  that "Japan is backing down." President Clinton instructed him  "to proceed with the negotiations according to the policy of the  past."    Later that afternoon, Matsuura, Okamatsu, and Nakahira  resumed vice-ministerial-level talks in their respective fields.  The compromise proposal received the day before was still in  the back of their minds. But the atmosphere of the meetings was  unusual. The United States once again came out pushing for  numerical targets.    At 1600 on 10 February, a second meeting between Hata and  Kantor began. Hata charged: "Discussions are on a completely  different track from our meeting this morning. Why has wrong  information been provided at the beginning of the  vice-ministerial-level talks?"    Kantor glared back at him, saying, "When I said we should  aim for the goal of reaching agreements, did you not say `I  understand'?" Hata did not yield, retorting, "I did not say  anything to the effect you imply."    Hata had an appointment with Treasury Secretary Lloyd  Bentsen  at 1700, but Kantor phoned the latter to have the appointment  cancelled. According to Kantor, "such a meeting was not  needed." Fierce arguments [between Hata and Kantor] went on for  more than two hours.    The United States did not bend from its rigid stance. The  Hata-Bentsen meeting eventually started at 1900, with Bentsen  assailing Japan's overall economic measures. He insisted that  the joint statement issued by the summit should include an  expression saying "macroeconomic measures [taken by Japan] are  inadequate." Hata rejected this, saying, "If that happens, the  cabinet will collapse." It was decided that no joint statement  would be issued.  <H3>  `I Am Tough, But...' </H3> A third meeting between Hata and Kantor was held at 0100 on 11  February. Hata spoke to reporters hopefully, saying, "I do not  see why we cannot reach a compromise," but Kantor remained  stiff. This did not mean that Hata thought there were chances  for a compromise. After the meeting, Kantor consoled Hata,  saying, "I am tough, but I cannot beat you." But overnight  talks did not bear fruit, and the failure of the economic  consultations became a certainty.    "The 10th [of February] was really a devil-haunted day. We  do not know who crushed the phantom compromise proposal. Maybe  the dovish group has been overridden by the hawkish group."  This was stated by a member of the Japanese negotiating team.  The best guess is that during the half day which elapsed from  the time Cutter offered the compromise proposal to the time the  Hata-Kantor conference began, there was a power struggle within  the U.S. Administration between Cutter and Kantor, with Clinton  choosing Kantor's approach.</p>

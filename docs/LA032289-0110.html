			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASTERN SHUTTLE SHOULD LURE SEVERAL SUITORS, ANALYSTS SAY  </P> <P> Eastern Airlines' lucrative shuttle service, for sale again, should attract a  number of bidders, including most of the nation's major air carriers, industry  analysts said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "Think of any of the majors and only Pan Am would be precluded from buying the  service because it already has its own shuttle," said Robert Decker of Duff  &amp; Phelps. "I would expect there will be plenty of bidders."  </P> <P> Eastern said it was seeking new buyers for the shuttle after real estate  developer Donald J. Trump said Monday that he would not pay the $365 million he  agreed to in October.  </P> <P> Trump said a massive strike at Eastern, which has shut down most of the  carrier, had made the shuttle, which links New York with Washington and Boston,  worth a third less. He said he wanted to cut the purchase price by $125 million  to $165 million.  </P> <P> The shuttle is one of the few Eastern services still flying after the March 4  strike of machinists, but it has seen a sharp fall in the number of passengers.  </P> <P> Analysts noted that the shuttle is an attractive operation for a takeover  because it functions essentially as an independent operation not dependent on  traffic from other flights for business.  </P> <P> "That means it could fit into almost anybody's system, although there are some  complications with unions and the like," said Louis Marckesano of Janney  Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Marckesano said carriers such as American Airlines, USAir, Trans World  Airlines, United, Northwest and Delta likely would find the shuttle attractive.  </P> <P> Decker said that, of those carriers, Delta and United have the lowest market  share in New York and therefore might be most interested in the shuttle.  </P> <P> Continental Airlines, Eastern's sister in Texas Air, could try to buy the  shuttle but might run into government opposition, Decker said.  </P> <P> Eastern's shuttle has been consistently profitable, Decker said, which enhances  its marketability.  </P> <P> "I don't know that capital constraints would be a consideration," he said.  </P> <P> But analysts also said the shuttle was not worth the $365 million in cash that  Trump had offered.  </P> <P> "Probably between $310 million and $330 million would be a good price,"  Marckesano said.  </P> <P> When Trump purchased the shuttle he seemed more interested in it as a way to  advance his name than earn a huge profit on his investment. He said he would  rename it the "Trump Shuttle" and would "run it like a jewel."  </P></p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Croat-Moslem truce hopes raised COMMANDERS of the Moslem-led Bosnian army and Croatian forces, who have been involved in a four-day battle in the south-western city of Mostar, have agreed to a ceasefire to take effect at noon today - but Bosnian radio said last night that fighting was continuing. As Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, appealed for the city to be declared a United Nations-protected 'safe area', radio reports said Mostar was in flames and that hand-to-hand skirmishes were being fought. The truce agreement confines rival soldiers to their barracks, and provides for the release of all civilian prisoners and the opening of all roads. It was signed by the Croat army's Commander Milivoj Petkovic and the Bosnian Moslem army chief, General Sefer Halilovic, in the presence of the UN's military commander, General Philippe Morillon in Medjugorje, south-west of Mostar. It could ease the plight of more than 1,300 Moslem civilians held by Croat troops in a military prison outside Mostar after being forced from their homes. Croat troops have been trying since Sunday to break a Moslem foothold on the west side of the Neretva River, which bisects Mostar and which Bosnian Croats want to mark as their eastern-most boundary. Meanwhile, Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, said he expected that the Bosnian Serbs would vote, in this weekend's referendum, against the peace plan to divide Bosnia into 10 provinces along ethnic lines. Bosnian Serbs have turned down a call by Belgrade to attend a joint session of an 'all Serbian' parliament to ratify the UN peace plan. They opted instead to go ahead with the referendum on the UN proposal. Serbia has imposed sanctions on the Bosnian Serbs for refusing to back the plan.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Spin-off boosts net income at Union Carbide UNION CARBIDE, the US chemicals company, recorded a 46 per cent rise in second-quarter net income, to Dollars 73m. The company was at pains, however, to separate its Dollars 37m second-quarter net earnings from continuing operations, against Dollars 18m a year ago. On June 30, Union Carbide completed the spin-off of Praxair, its former industrial gases subsidiary. This business produced Dollars 34m of net income in the second quarter, compared with Dollars 28m a year ago. Overall earnings per share in the second quarter were 51 cents, up from 35 cents a year ago. Earnings from continuing operations were 28 cents, against 13 cents. Total net sales for the Connecticut-based chemicals company were little changed at Dollars 1.26bn, against Dollars 1.21bn. Mr Robert Kennedy, chairman, said the results reflected continuing efforts to drive down fixed costs. He said polyethylene and ethylene glycol volumes were better than last year, but added that margins continued to be tight in these markets.</p>

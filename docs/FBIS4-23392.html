			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, June 5 (APF) - Two more former senators have  been arrested and a third is still wanted by the police in a  continued government crackdown on opposition leaders, one of the  detainees told AFP Sunday [5 June] from his detention room here.    "I came here yesterday (Saturday) to see former Senate  president Ameh Ebute who has been in detention here since last  Thursday. On getting here, I introduced myself to the security  agents who immediately detained me," Polycarp Nwite said  speaking on his cellular phone.    Former senator Okoroafor was also arrested Saturday in  Abeokuta, 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of here, while the  police are looking for Bola Tinubu, another outspoken member of  the senate who last week declared the rule of junta leader  General Sani Abacha "illegal,", their colleagues told AFP.    The arrests came after members of the dissolved house of  representatives called on Abacha to step down "not later than"  June 11, the eve of the first anniversary of the annulled  presidential election.    Tinubu is a founding member of the opposition National  Democratic Coalition which has called on Nigerians to take the  initiative in restoring democracy.    On Wednesday he attended a meeting of the dissolved senate  following which Ebute issued a statement calling for the  formation of a government of national unity and reconciliation  headed by the presumed winner of last year's annulled elections,  Chief Moshood Abiola.</p>

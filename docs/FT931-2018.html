			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (21): Suppliers hedge their bets - Network management: what is happening down the wire? NATIONAL POWER relies on two networks: the power grid it serves, with the other generating companies, and the computer network with which it controls its operations. Richard Hawkins has the job of managing the computer network. It is a job at the sharp end. The network links the whole of England, and provides business applications including electronic mail, office functions, spreadsheets, word processing, databases, and corporate applications including ledgers, purchasing and operational systems. It also handles performance statistics for the power stations. 'We rely on the grid to deliver our goods, and we rely on the network to manage our business works effectively,' says Mr Hawkins. 'It allows us to assess what our cost base is and do comparisons.' That, in turn keeps the company competitive with its rivals. Relying on a network has its risks. Downtime could cost the company dearly, so it must be kept running reliably. And as needs change, Mr Hawkins has to keep track of the growth and the costs incurred, as well as finding the most effective way of linking. He needs to know when one network section is overloaded with data traffic and due for expansion, and when another is hardly used, and redundant. He needs to be able to control parts of the network which may be the other side of the country. He needs network management, a solution which the IT industry is only just becoming able to deliver. Most network management solutions involve a computer workstation attached to the network, which probes and analyses the data traffic. Sections of the network have their own responding equipment, which flag up problems and keep the management system informed of activity. For tighter control, software is installed in each individual component of the network, to answer queries from the management station. The user can then pinpoint any problem, and even control the networked equipment, turning it off and on, and adjusting settings as required. But at this point, users hit trouble. Networks don't come from one supplier any more: the cable may be from one company, while the network software is from another. The computers attached may be from several more manufacturers, and so are the devices which link the sections together: hubs, routers, bridges and the like. As a network grows over the years, the core components can be bought from different vendors. And it is asking a lot for one management system to control them all. When suppliers provide their own software to monitor and control a component it is usually proprietary. Developed in isolation, it only works with that supplier's management products. And that leaves users with a dire choice: leave some sections of the network unmanaged, invest in several separate management systems, or pull back and limit the equipment on the network to one brand. The last option leaves the user 'locked-in' to one supplier, who may raise its prices, and may not even have all the equipment the user needs. To some extent, anyone with a large network is locked in at the moment: at the top of its networking hierarchy, National Power uses AT&amp;T's proprietary management products. But Richard Hawkins wants to break free from that. The way to do it is to follow a strategy. There are standards for network management, just as there are standards for connection, but they are still in dispute. Now an industry-wide group is promising to sort the mess out once and for all. The first step to network management is usually to ask for the simple network management protocol (SNMP), a standard from the Internet community. This means buying network components which can respond to an SNMP manager, and adding an SNMP-based management system. The set of information which each component can provide is well agreed, so the chances are that the manager won't be talking a foreign language to the rest of the network. Mr Hawkins standardised on SNMP as a first line of attack - 'we have a centralised network management system with voice and data integrated, currently based on SNMP,' he says. 'But we are developing a strategy for system-wide management of all the resources in the IT environment.' SNMP is not up to that job. The scheme is already showing its limitations. Mr Hawkins is unlikely to move from it in the short term, but he is not prepared to rely on it indefinitely, because of its lack of security - and because suppliers insist on adding their proprietary features to it. The alternative is from the international standards community, a more powerful system called CMIP (common management information protocol), developed with a more theoretical approach. The problem as with other official standards, is that there are few products. British Telecom, IBM, AT&amp;T and the other giants are all committed to CMIP, which is part of the OSI scheme. Although products are on their way, there is a 'chicken and egg problem.' The suppliers are waiting to be sure there is a real demand. And while they wait, the users are installing more and more SNMP, making the market look tougher for CMIP. This puts brakes on a market which could be one of the fastest growing in the industry. The answer may come from a group set up to promote management technology. The Network Management Forum (NMF) hopes to make the two protocols can work together with its Omnipoint programme, which also brings together the applications, combining the user interfaces which confront people using the software. The scheme has the backing of users and vendors, including all the big industry groupings and the UK government's IT adviser, the CCTA. Martin Kirk of the standards pressure group, X/Open, says: 'Two standards, we can live with - if there were ten, we'd have a problem.' 'We see Omnipoint as a way forward,' says Mr Hawkins. 'It gets away from the protocol wars: its real role is in dislodging proprietary systems at the top of the management hierarchy.' At the CeBIT exhibition in Hanover, NMF will show management applications working together. This follows a demonstration of the protocols themselves at the ComNet show in Washington in February, where systems from BT, Ascom Timeplex, Fujitsu, IBM and others were linked together. Despite this activity it does seem that the suppliers are still hedging their bets. BT, IBM and AT&amp;T also showed their products working with proprietary protocols. Users are also cautious, but it is still possible to take small steps, given the limitations one is working under. NM Financial Management in Portsmouth had a network from Digital Equipment, with 120 host computers and 400 terminals on three sites. The company had a medium-term plan to swap its whole network for one based on IBM protocols, and float the IT department off as a separate company. In the short term, however, it needed to get the best from what it had. Simon Bierne, then working in-house, went for a simple approach. He put in an SNMP system and four monitor probes. The system picked up enough information to pinpoint the network black spots, and helped plan a reorganisation which reduced the time for the weekly database copy by two thirds, to under two hours. For a busy services company, that kind of saving can justify the price tag of around Pounds 15,000 for a management station, and Pounds 2,000 for each probe.</p>

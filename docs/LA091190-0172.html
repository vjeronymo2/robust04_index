			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW SLIPS 2.97 AS OIL PRICES STEADY  </P> <P> Wall Street stocks closed with modest losses today, as a relatively calm day in  the oil markets provided a respite for stocks.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 2.97 points at 2,612.62. In the  broader market, declining issues led advancers by a 4-3 margin. Volume on the  New York Stock Exchange was a light 113.22 million shares against 119.73 the  previous session.  </P> <P> Traders said that with oil prices little changed, there were few factors to  affect the stock market. The benchmark U.S. grade of oil closed down 30 cents  at $31 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> The market continued to show some concern about higher oil prices, analysts  said. On Monday, the Dow closed 3.96 points lower after oil prices spurted  upward.  </P> <P> Investors also remain wary about interest rates, analysts say. Rumors over the  last few days have said the Federal Reserve was about to ease rates, but the  central bank failed to act.  </P> <P> An additional uncertainty in the market was the fate of budget negotiations in  Washington, said William R. Rothe, a managing director at Alex. Brown &amp;  Sons Inc. in Baltimore.  </P> <P> Rothe said there are "too many issues that remain unresolved" for investors to  commit money to stocks.  </P> <P> The market received no help from abroad. Stock prices closed lower in Japan and  London.  </P> <P> Among most-active blue chip issues on the NYSE, AT&amp;T was up 1/2 at 30 7/8,  Philip Morris rose 1/8 to 45 and IBM rose 3/8 to 106 1/4.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell 0.50 to 176.20.  At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index slipped 0.33 to 322.88.  </P> <P> Bond prices were little changed in early trading today as most players sat on  the sidelines waiting for some news that could move the market.  </P> <P> The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 3/32 point, or nearly 94 cents per  $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from  price, fell to 8.95% from 8.96% late Monday.  </P> <P> Analysts said trading was very light as investors waited for further news from  the Middle East.  </P> <P> They also were watching budget talks in Washington, where negotiators passed a  self-imposed Monday deadline for reaching agreement on $50 billion in spending  cuts.  </P> <P> Oil prices, which helped send the bond market lower Monday, were relatively  stable today. The near-term contract for light, sweet crude oil was off 15  cents to $31.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange in late morning.  </P></p>

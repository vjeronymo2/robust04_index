			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Li Peng's illness a boost for rival CONFIRMATION yesterday that Mr Li Peng, the ailing Chinese premier, would remain out of view for the moment has fuelled speculation about not only his physical recovery but also his political well-being. Mr Li's continued absence has boosted the stocks of his chief rival, Mr Zhu Rongji, the reformist vice-premier and former mayor of Shanghai. Mr Zhu this week is making a high-profile visit to Canada and to Latin America. China's foreign ministry may have inadvertently encouraged talk about Mr Li's future when it told reporters that the premier would not be meeting visiting dignitaries, including Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister. The 65-year-old Mr Li has not been seen in public since the last week of April. He was photographed playing tennis with Mr Goh Chok Tong, the visiting Singapore prime minister, on April 20. On April 26, Chinese officials announced that Mr Li would not be able to keep an appointment with Philippine President Fidel Ramos because he was suffering from a 'cold'. He was also obliged to cancel a 12-day visit to Central Asia. One month later, no photographs have appeared of a recuperating Mr Li, nor has the Chinese press revealed that his condition required hospitalisation. In light of persistent reports that Mr Li is suffering heart problems, Chinese officials have long since given up trying to pretend that he has been laid low by the flu. Mr Li's lingering health problems have now taken on a political dimension, in the view of Chinese and western observers. 'You've got to see Zhu Rongji as the big winner in all this,' said a long-serving Beijing diplomat. 'It certainly raises questions about Li Peng's political future.' 'Li had weathered so many political storms in the past that his survival skills were regarded as one of his assets,' the official added. 'But this illness has put a dent in the perception that he is indestructible.' Adding to Mr Li's political difficulties may be the fact that he is not particularly popular in any case, and therefore his colleagues may be less inclined to indulge health problems. Speculation that his 'illness' may indeed be political and not physical has also been revived; although evidence suggests otherwise. Mr Li was 're-elected' to a second five-year term as premier at the recent National People's Congress, but an unprecedented 10 per cent of the more than 2,000 delegates either voted against him or abstained. Mr Li, who is associated with leadership hardliners, is blamed by many Chinese for the bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen pro-democracy demonstrators in June 1989. Mr Li's continued absence has reinforced perceptions that Mr Zhu, also 65, who was confirmed as senior vice premier at the NPC, is the 'strong man' in the government in any case. Added to responsibilities for the day-to-day work of the administration have been the 'high profile' meeting and greeting functions normally reserved for the premier. Western officials who have seen Mr Zhu in action recently say that he has carried off his additional duties with conspicuous self-confidence. His performance at a meeting in Shanghai earlier this month at a meeting of former world leaders has been singled out for praise. Western officials say that it is somewhat ironic that attention has been focusing on the health of Mr Li, who is a mere stripling by the normal standards of China's gerontocratic leadership. He is 23 years younger than paramount leader, Mr Deng Xiaoping. Mr Jiang Zemin, China's Communist party boss, president, and chief of its Military Commission, may have also had his stocks boosted by the continued absence of Mr Li. An apparently vigorous Mr Jiang, 66, has also been much in evidence, receiving a whole range of visitors, including Mr Pierre Cardin, the fashion designer.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Agency Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Ohio program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, acknowledged the proposed amendment with no comment. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service (SCS), expressed concern with the requirement that copies of all records, reports, inspection materials, and other information be retained in SCS field offices. The SCS noted that this could involve a substantial amount of information in some counties with accelerated mining activity. However, the SCS was not against posting for public inspection a description of the information available for mailing and a procedure for obtaining such information upon request by any resident of the area where mining is occurring. Based on Ohio's letter dated September 23, 1994 (Administrative Record N. OH&hyph;2058), Ohio will make sure that any approach for filing documents or posting notices at SCS offices would be acceptable to the SCS. As discussed above, the Director has determined that Ohio's options for meeting the obligation to make permit, inspection, and enforcement documents available to the public in the county where the mining is occurring or proposed to occur are no less effective than the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No other comments were received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the EPA with respect to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) or the Clean Air Act (33 U.S.C. 1251  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). None of the revisions that Ohio proposed to make in this amendment pertain to air or water quality standards. Therefore, OSM did not request EPA's concurrence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;1993). The EPA responded on March 16, 1994, (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;1999) that Ohio should add language in its proposed amendment to cover both existing and proposed mining operations. The Director notes that Ohio's revised amendment at OAC section 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;05 (B)(2) and (B)(2)(b) covers both existing and proposed mining operations and therefore satisfies EPA's concerns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / S Korean group's break-up 'illegal' SOUTH KOREA'S constitutional court yesterday ruled as illegal the government's 1985 dissolution of the Kukje group, then the country's seventh largest conglomerate, writes John Burton in Seoul. The decision could have widespread implications for relations between Korean industry and the state. The forced dismantling of Kukje was part of an industrial restructuring programme in the mid-1980s by the government of President Chun Doo-hwan, the country's former military dictator. Almost 80 financially troubled private companies were merged, liquidated or sold by government order. The court ruling is likely to set the stage for extensive legal battles as Mr Yang Chung-mo, the Kukje founder, and other owners try to recover confiscated assets that were distributed to other industrial groups. The court, acting on an appeal filed by Mr Yang, declared that Mr Chun's actions were an arbitrary use of presidential powers. When Kukje encountered financial difficulties in late 1984, President Chun refused to allow Korea First Bank, the group's main bank, to provide new loans to rescue it. Instead, Kukje was declared bankrupt in February 1985 and divided up, with its 20 subsidiaries sold to other companies. The Chun government had said Kukje's problems resulted from over-expansion and poor management. Mr Yang said yesterday the ruling 'has paved the way for me to rise again as a businessman and I will rebuild the Kukje group.'</p>

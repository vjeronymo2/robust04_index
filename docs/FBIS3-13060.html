Replying to the debate in both houses of Parliament on the  motion of thanks to the president's address, he termed  Islamabad's raising of human rights issue in Kashmir in Geneva  as totally uncalled for. The prime minister has said that  Pakistan has no locus standi in the state other than that of an  aggressor. The motion was later adopted by both the houses  after rejecting all opposition amendments, including one by  division in Rajya Sabha. In his hour-long reply marked by  repeated thumping of desks by treasury benches, the prime  minister referred to the resolution on Kashmir passed by  Parliament and said it fully reflected the determination of the  nation on the Kashmir issue.    Referring to the U.S. pronouncements recently, the prime  minister said though there is improvement in Indo-U.S. relations  in the economic and other spheres, the understanding has to be  enhanced in certain areas. He said the home minister's  statement in Parliament makes the government's position clear.    The prime minister announced that India and China are likely  to achieve a breakthrough in resolving confrontation in areas  along the Line of Actual Control.    The prime minister rejected the idea of carving out new  states as it will open a Pandora's box. He, however, said  measures have to be taken to remove the interstate economic  disparities. Referring to the northeast, the prime minister said  peace has been restored in the region except Manipur, where  intratribal clashes have taken place. There also the situation  has improved after the imposition of president's rule, he said.    On the Dunkel proposal, the prime minister reiterated that  India has nothing to lose but much to gain as the farmers will  be able to sell their produce in the international market and  get more remunerative prices.    On Ayodhya, Mr. Rao said action will be initiated after the  Supreme Court gives its ruling. He promised to take the house  into confidence while taking action on this matter.    Expressing optimism on the country's economy, Mr. Rao  declared that the government will increase investment in rural  development by three folds. More than 1 lakh crore rupees will  be spent for rural uplift in the next seven years. Stressing  the need to increase the power supply, the prime minister said  massive investment is being made in the sector. Rejecting the  charges that foreign investment is coming only in the consumer  sector, the prime minister said about 90 percent of foreign  investment is in the core sector. He also reiterated the  government's resolve to earmark 6 percent of the national income  for education. He said the schemes announced by the government  for women and unemployed youth have gathered momentum.</p>

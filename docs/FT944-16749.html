			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Recruitment: Better to hire a squirrel than teach a turkey - Research into competence shows motivation can be as important as qualifications Cast your mind back a few years, maybe more years than you would care to count. Can you remember who you regarded as the best teacher in your school? What were the special qualities this teacher possessed that did not seem to be present in those who were no more than average? The chances are that the qualities you identified as something special had little to do with the usual measures of academic achievement. For example, I recall a teacher who was particularly good at relating what he taught to events in the outside world, making the subject appear to have much more relevance for his pupils. It was these kind of observations that spurred much of the research carried out by David McClelland, the Boston-based psychologist, whose behavioural studies have helped inspire a whole generation of experts working in management development. McClelland, chairman of McBer in the US, is 77 now, but still capable of challenging orthodox educational theory and practices in a way that has not always endeared him to whatever establishment he has been studying. His criticism of psychometric testing conflicts with the methods of many occupational psychologists. 'The trouble with psychometric tests is that they tell you what a person can do if asked to do it but they don't tell you what he does do,' he said. He remains convinced that the study of the way people do their work produces the best method of finding how they do it best. Hence his definitive work on the use of competencies in assessment of job performance. Competency has become a much over-used and confusing word in human resource management, perhaps because it has been redefined by psychologists and educationalists beyond its accepted dictionary definition. The confusion has been exacerbated because of two markedly different areas of work. One strand, which has been adopted by the British system of National Vocational Qualifications has its roots in the educational system and defines competencies as groupings of skills, knowledge and ability. McClelland's definition is more behaviour-oriented. He defines a competency as any characteristic of a person that differentiates levels of performance in a job. Others will define it differently again. It seems to have become an open market. McClelland is still able to recall how that word competency came into play among behavioural psychologists. Robert White, a fellow Harvard professor, chose to use it in a quite different connection when he was trying to write about competencies that small children acquired in the course of growing up  -such things as walking. 'I said that competencies seemed OK to me as a way of describing them and I began using the word in my own work on testing for competencies rather than intelligence,' said McClelland. Asked for a definition himself he ventured: 'A little bit higher than a skill, more of a motive and a trait, a human characteristic that differentiates outstanding from typical performance.' Today he says: 'The currency has become cheapened. People are using it all over the place." Driven to look at competencies from a state of confusion about what they actually were, I found that a short publication called Competency Assessment Methods, by Hay/McBer Research Press, drawn from a paper first presented in Boston three years ago, neatly summarised much of the work in competency assessment over the past 30 years. One of McClelland's approaches was to question the reliance on academic qualifications in selection. His conclusion was that, while knowledge and skills could be developed, it was much more difficult to develop the motives and traits behind the way people do things. His original work was in looking at small business people - what it was that made them successful. Most of all, he observed, it was the need for achievement. They wanted to improve constantly on what they were doing. He made these observations by asking top performers to write about particular pictures. No matter what the subject matter of the picture they would always come round to writing about someone trying to do a better job in one way or another. The same happened when they were asked to speak on a particular topic. A similar process, he found, could be used to sift out other qualities that distinguished superior performers in different fields. This led to the development of the behavioural event interview now used by Hay to build up a specific competency matrix for various jobs and organisations. These lengthy interviews are held with the best performers in whatever job is being studied and compared with those of average performers. Characteristics that mark out the good performers are then drawn from the comparisons. The result cannot necessarily be transplanted from one company into another company because of cultural differences. Chris Dyson, a director of Hay/McBer in the UK, explained: 'It is not aiming at cloning jobs. It differentiates between companies. In two fast-moving consumer goods companies we looked at, for example, an important competency in one company was to have a political awareness. You needed to know what you could and could not say to whom. The second company had an entirely different approach and insisted upon absolute honesty as a prerequisite.' While some of the competencies for each of these companies were compatible, by no means all of them were and the most important culturally-related competencies were poles apart. The competencies necessary for particular jobs are far from obvious. Dyson cites a high-class departmental store seeking to discover the key competencies of its merchandise buyers. The management believed that being a good negotiator would perhaps be most valuable in that it would enable the buyer to drive down the price paid to the supplier. Hay discovered that the cost of the goods to the store was less important than whether the shop could sell the merchandise with little left over at the end of the sales cycle. The most successful buyers, it found, were those who could empathise with the customers and understood what the customer was looking for. In another study McClelland looked at the most successful characteristics that marked out the best performers in the US State Department foreign service. The good ones were able to relate closely to the cultures of the host countries. When he looked at the service's selection methods he noticed that the elegant use of English was highly prized and thus reflected in the testing procedure. It was the sort of English fostered at Harvard, Princeton and Yale and tended to discriminate against minorities who might not have achieved the same educational standards. McClelland found that those minorities who had scraped into the service by some side route performed just as well as other officers. Such work has led to the observation in the Hay booklet that: "From a cost effectiveness standpoint, the rule is hire for core motivation and trait characteristics, and develop knowledge and skills. Most organisations do the reverse: they hire on the basis of educational credentials and assume that candidates come with or can be indoctrinated with the appropriate motives or traits." Dyson puts it another way, quoting a friend: 'You can teach a turkey to climb a tree but it's easier to hire a squirrel.' Competency Assessment Methods, history and state of the art, is published by Hay/Mcber Research Press. It can be obtained, price Pounds 5, from Hay in the UK.

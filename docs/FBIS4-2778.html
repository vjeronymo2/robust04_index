			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yonghong: "Cattle-Feed Revolution Beefs Up </F> Production"]    [Text] New strategies in cattle-raising have helped China  become one of the top beef-producing countries in the world, a  leading agriculture official announced.    "By the end of last year, China was ranked the world's  sixth-biggest country in beef output, compared with being in  only 12th place in 1978," Vice-Minister of Agriculture Zhang  Yanxi told a three-day national meeting on livestock development  that ends today.    Last year, China produced a total of 2.3 million tons of  beef, a 28.9 percent rise over the previous year, said Zhang.    The sustained growth in livestock production over the past  decade has raised annual per capita meat consumption to 32.3  kilograms, which is the world average.    Zhang attributed the success over the past 14 years  primarily  to a change in the type of cattle feed. Instead of using  precious grain for feed, cattle breeders are using fermented  plant stalks and other agricultural by-products.    Since 1992, 59 pilot rural counties have been given the  backing of the central government to use the stalks to raise  cattle. The farmers have been provided with urea and plastic  sheets, which are used to make the fermented feed.    Now about 2 million farmers use this method, according to  Zhang.    Although the demonstration counties represent only 2.7  percent of the total rural counties in the country, beef  production in those sites accounts for 15 percent of the  country's output, Zhang said.    Some of the counties' beef products are exported to Eastern  Europe, the Middle East, the Commonwealth of Independent States  and other regions.    The biggest beef-producers include Shandong, Henan, Hebei,  Anhui and Sichuan provinces.    At the meeting, authorized by the State Council, honours for  outstanding achievements in the livestock industry were handed  out to individuals and units in Shandong and Henan provinces,  Fuyang Prefecture in Anhui Province, Zhoukou Prefecture in Henan  Province and 10 other counties.    The utilization of plant stalks and agricultural by-products  not only has helped boost the livestock industry but has also  saved a large quantity of grain, which is usually used for feed.    China's success has garnered world-wide attention and  praise,  Zhang said.    "It is very significant at present to extend the technology  and to develop the low-grain-consuming livestock industry, since  the country's grain production in limited," Zhang noted.    In the past decade, beef production has increased 20 percent  annually.</p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Technology: Sizing up the human body - Worth Watching Rapidly-changing lifestyles - especially dietary habits - can have a big effect on human body measurements, and have implications for industries producing everything from clothing and furniture to cars. Conventional three-dimensional measuring instruments can size up a human body without touching it, but the process can be time-consuming and suffer from poor data accuracy. NKK of Japan says it has overcome many of these problems with its Voxelan system, which can take 187 three-dimensional measurements in 30 seconds. The speed is due to a combination of laser-slit light scanning and a specially developed image encoder. The system is being used to measure 50,000 Japanese men and women over the next two years in an industry-backed research project to investigate how measurements are changing. Other versions measure small and moving articles. NKK: Japan, 33 217 2138.</p>

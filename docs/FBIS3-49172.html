Our Prague correspondent, Daniela Galikova, attended the ensuing  news conference and filed the following report:    [Galikova] Replying to a question from Slovak radio, Czech  Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus confirmed the planned talks with  Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar as well as with the prime  ministers of Poland and Hungary, which will take place after the  talks with the U.S. President. On the evening of 12  January--that is, after the U.S. President departs--the Czech  president, prime minister, and foreign minister will give  dinners. According to Prime Minister Klaus, the presidents of  Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic will dine at  the Castle, the prime ministers of these countries will dine at  Prime Minister Klaus's invitation in Lichtenstein Palace, and  the foreign ministers will dine at the Czech Foreign Ministry.    Responding to another question concerning the summit, Prime  Minister Klaus stressed that, right from the beginning, as soon  as President Clinton's intention to visit Prague was announced,  the Czech Republic did not doubt that it would use the meeting  for holding talks with the representatives of the Visegrad Group  countries. At no time was it considered that only we would be  holding talks or that the talks would be held collectively, the  Czech prime minister stressed. He thus reacted to some reports  carried by both the domestic and foreign press that the Czech  Republic did not support the idea of joint talks between the  representatives of the Visegrad Group and the U.S. President.</p>

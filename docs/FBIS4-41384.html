The experts group is visiting Moldova  to examine the draft law on the special status for the districts  densely inhabited by the ethnic Gagauz. The experts pointed out  that "no one can deny that the Moldovan president and the  parliamentary commissions want to settle this problem according  to the human rights norms unanimously accepted." Koedzhikov  mentioned that he had spoken with people from these districts  and it is clear that they want to live in peace and  understanding with the natives and other minorities. According  to him, "there are no ethnic tensions in these regions." He  pointed out this as an important factor in achieving a final  agreement and adopting a law on this matter. President Snegur  mentioned that the experts' recommendations are welcome and that  they will give him additional credibility in the discussions  with the Gagauz side. He also pointed out that "Moldova  appreciates the efforts of the international organizations, and  in particular the Council of Europe and the CSCE, in achieving  political stability in Moldova." Snegur mentioned the necessity  of finding compromises that are not ends in themselves, but  rather a reality that should be taken into account. He said  that "it is essential that the Gagauz people want to live in a  united republic; this should be realized by the Comrat leaders,  too," states the communique.</p>

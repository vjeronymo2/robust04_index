			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Investment cap spurs trust launch - Frustrated Foreign &amp; Colonial acts over chancellor's refusal to change rules on international funds / Company aims to reassure investors THE PERSONAL equity plan rules which place a Pounds 1,500 limit on worldwide investment and unit trusts have always seemed silly - and even more so since the last Budget when Norman Lamont, the chancellor, raised the annual limit on unit and investment trust Pep holdings from Pounds 3,000 to the full Pounds 6,000 allowance for a general Pep. But he did not abolish the Pounds 1,500 restriction, with the result that Foreign &amp; Colonial's international general investment trust - the UK's largest, with total assets of more than Pounds 1bn and strong performance - remained limited to the Pounds 1,500 cap on funds with more than 50 per cent of their equity holdings outside the UK and Europe. Rather than tinker with the international trust, or wait any longer in the hope of a change to the rules, Foreign &amp; Colonial launched a new trust this week: the PEP investment trust (Pepit). Foreign &amp; Colonial has eschewed the recent trend of choosing a split capital structure. Instead, the trust has a simple capital structure, with investors being offered ordinary shares at 100p during the offer period which closes on October 23. The initial charge will be 2.5 per cent, which compares favourably with M&amp;G's Recovery and Income investment trusts, launched within the past 13 months, which are more than 5 per cent. The annual management charge is 0.4 per cent. Pepit will invest initially in a spread of 50-55 companies, with three-quarters of the portfolio held in FT-SE 100 stocks. There will be around 10 holdings in Europe in large companies such as Bayer, the German chemicals company, Siemens, the German computer group, and L'Oreal, the cosmetics company. The rest of the portfolio will be invested in non-FTSE stock such as Emap, the media group, and some of the smaller water companies. Foreign &amp; Colonial is hoping that nervous investors will be reassured by the dominance of FT-SE 100 stock. 'Companies of this stature are, in general, of the size and strength to withstand the current difficult economic situation,' says F&amp;C's Jeremy Tigue. But the 103-point drop in the FTSE index on Monday will have done little to entice those with worries about the market's volatility. The uncertain economic climate caused two investment trust launches - from Touche Remnant and Schroder Investment Management - to be postponed this week. Tigue. however, sees the weak market as the time to invest. 'The present turbulent conditions offer some excellent buying opportunities and value on a long-term view - and, indeed, Foreign &amp; Colonial's performance is based on our philosophy of buying steadily and cautiously into value into precisely such conditions.' The main attraction for most private clients is being able to put the full Pounds 6,000 into a broadly spread Foreign &amp; Colonial investment trust Pep. Only two of F&amp;C's eight investment trusts - the German and the European - qualified for the full allowance. But these are specialised markets unlikely to appeal to most private investors. When F&amp;C introduced its Pep last year, investors in the international trust could place only the Pounds 1,500. F&amp;C put the remaining Pounds 4,500 into a blue chip portfolio of five UK shares: BT, BTR, BAT, Lloyds Bank and Shell. These investors are being invited by F&amp;C to transfer their Pep into Pepit, and more than 40 per cent have said they will. The charges for Pepit follow the same flat fee structure as for the existing plan. These are an initial fee of Pounds 50 plus VAT - waived during the offer period - and Pounds 5 plus VAT per month for administration. If you invest only Pounds 2,000, the annual flat fee works out at an expensive 3.5 per cent. But the advantage of a flat fee over a percentage is that the proportion of your investment deducted in charges falls as you put in more money. So, should investors who do not have a general Pep for this year choose Pepit? Like other equity-based investment, those wanting returns should view the trust as a long-term commitment. On that basis, Peter Walls, investment trust analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, is enthusiastic. 'This is the ideal product for private investors, coming from a blue chip management group that has clearly demonstrated its ability in the investment trust sector. It is the sort of expansion of the sector that I welcome.' Those seeking a high income may be disappointed, though. F&amp;C says Pepit will be balanced between capital growth and income and the estimated yield, at 4.5 per cent, is below the present market average of around 5 per cent. But Walls points out that, in the present climate of dividend cuts, high income trusts are having to sacrifice capital growth and performance in order to pay out income. Investors in Pepit can choose to have income reinvested or to take the income twice a year tax free. Should investors subscribe to the trust during the offer period? The conventional problem for a company launching an investment trust is that shares in them often trade at a discount. F&amp;C says it expects Pepit to trade at a premium after the offer period because of high demand, but it has an interest in persuading people to invest now. Walls agrees that there should be a high level of demand for the trust because of a shortage of high-quality, broad-based investment trust Peps. He expects it to trade at or near its net asset value and, therefore, favours going in during the offer period to avoid paying 0.5 per cent stamp duty and broker's commission, as well as taking advantage of the initial Pep charge waiver. Some investors may wish to wait to and see how the fund performs. Although F&amp;C has proved itself as an international fund manager - with growth of 218 per cent in its international general trust in the seven years to October 1 according to Finstat - the UK is a relatively unproven area for F&amp;C's fund managers.</p>

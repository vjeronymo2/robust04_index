			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Raimundo Lopez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (PL) -- The majority of the  Conference on the Nation and Emigration guests will arrive on 21  April from Miami less than 24 hours before the start of the  meeting that seeks to normalize the country's relations with  Cubans residing abroad.    Organizing commission sources confirmed to PRENSA LATINA  that  more than 100 people will join about 50 others who are already  in the capital and have been receiving their credentials since  yesterday. It was reported that about 200 guests from more than  40 countries will participate in a personal capacity in the  meeting that will run from Friday to Sunday afternoon.    Official reports show that the common denominator of the  participants is their opposition to the U.S.-imposed blockade on  the island, although many of them do not share the ideology of  social justice developed here since 1959. The broad acceptance  of the conference among emigrants contrasts with an intimidation  campaign, launched mainly in Miami where most Cuban emigrants  live, against those who agreed to participate in the meeting.    Raymundo del Toro, one of the participants and chairman of  New Jersey's Cuban-American Committee for Peace, announced here  that he received death threats from the Alpha 66 terrorist  organization headquartered in Miami.    I am not afraid of them because they are a small group of  frustrated and old-fashioned people, del Toro told the local  media.    Meanwhile, Mari-Tere Vishop, propaganda secretary of an  organization called Cuban Committee for Democracy, headquartered  in the United States, said that things have changed within the  Cuban community in that nation.    Cuban emigrants are increasingly less afraid of the  aggressiveness displayed by quarters that oppose the  normalization of their relations with the island, she added  during an interview with PRENSA LATINA.    Del Toro and Vishop reaffirmed their rejection of the siege  imposed by successive U.S. administrations for over three  decades and condemned their attempt to suffocate the country.    Del Toro added that all Cubans who wish to do so can unite  to  struggle for the country and that he thinks that this is among  the main merits of the upcoming conference.    I feel optimistic because sectors that oppose this  normalization are losing ground, Vishop added.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Super shares demise lifts News Corp Shares in Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation closed up about 9 per cent at ADollars 10.90 on Wednesday after the group said it had withdrawn its plan to issue shares with super voting rights. It claimed that the lengthening timetable for necessary approvals for the shares had become commercially unrealistic. More than 4m News Corp shares changed hands on Wednesday and the announcement, together with a strong trend in metal prices, was thought responsible for a rise in the Australian stock market. The Australian Investment Managers' Group, which represents most fund management groups in the region, hailed News's backdown as a victory for the one share, one vote principle. In a letter to the Australian stock exchange (ASX), the media and film group's lawyers noted the earliest date on which the super shares could be issued - assuming permission was granted - was June 1994, eight months after the scheme was mooted. 'Unfortunately, the uncertainty and substantial lead times now involved . . . are not consistent with the needs faced by News Corp,' they said. Had the scheme gone ahead, News would probably have been invulnerable to takeover, and the share price increase reflected the restoration of this possibility. However, some analysts speculated that Mr Murdoch had deals or joint venture arrangements in the pipeline and had found an alternative way of structuring these, so that his 33 per cent family interest in News's equity would not be diluted. The super share plan, announced by Mr Murdoch at a News annual meeting in October, caused a storm of controversy in Australia where share structures involving differential voting rights are not permitted. It involved issuing the new shares with multiple voting rights to existing shareholders on a pro rata basis, which critics claimed would have allowed Mr Murdoch to establish an entrenched control position. He could, for example, have sold some of his ordinary shares, bought more super voters, and pushed his interest up from 33 per cent to over 40 per cent for no net outlay. News, however, always claimed the plan was devised to facilitate strategic deals, although no details were supplied. It had hoped for a provisional decision from the Australian stock exchange, over whether it would change its listing rules to accommodate the scheme, in November. According to the lawyers' letter, that date shifted to December, a timescale News continued to 'knit in with'. Last week, talks between the attorney-general and the ASX led to a much longer consultative process, and News faced six more months of uncertainty. As a result, its directors, meeting in London on Tuesday, decided to withdraw the scheme. Yesterday, the ASX expressed sympathy for News's predicament. 'The time frame was blowing out quite a bit, and that's something the exchange regrets,' said Mr Ray Schoer, head of the companies' division. In spite of News's withdrawal, the ASX said it would continue to assess the merits of differential voting rights, although its inquiry may proceed in a more leisurely fashion. The ASX said it had received comments from international exchanges - including London and New York - and felt there was good sense in establishing where different countries stood on this issue, before specific proposals were presented again. There had been fears that News would simply have moved its listing to New York had the ASX refused to moderate its listing rules - although the stance of the London and New York markets on differential voting rights is less than clear-cut.</p>

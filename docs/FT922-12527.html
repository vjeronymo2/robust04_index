			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Finding new routes to debt refunding: The way UK companies are refinancing cheap loans UK companies are now having to repay cheap debt finance raised from banks and the bond market in the late 1980s. Refinancing which has taken place so far suggests that corporate cash is likely to come from greater range of sources, but at a higher price this time around the economic cycle. Companies have strengthened their balance sheets over the past two years, repaying some debt either with fresh equity finance or out of cash flow. The corporate sector financial deficit, the net increase in liabilities, in 1990 was 5 per cent of gross domestic product, or Pounds 5.23bn. By the end of last year however, net company borrowing had been reduced to less than 2 per cent of GDP, or Pounds 2.48bn. Some restructuring was achieved through the equity market last year, as institutional investors moved money into shares ahead of an anticipated economic recovery. In all, UK companies raised Pounds 10bn from rights issues. Much of it was used to repay outstanding debt. However, many companies will still have to repay debts arranged in the late 1980s at very low rates. One source of cheap debt was the syndicated bank loans market. A favourite funding vehicle for company treasurers in the late 1980s was the five-year multi-option facility (MOF), a type of flexible loan package designed to provide the company with a core committed loan and an uncommitted facility in which a large number of banks competed to participate. Competition among banks to participate drove the price of debt funding down to extremely fine levels. For example, in May 1987 Booker, the food and distribution group, signed a Pounds 135m five-year multiple option facility with a group of banks led by Chase Investment Bank, at an interest rate of just 0.0625 percentage points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). This was not exceptional. Companies which signed five-year multi-option facilities in the same year included Bowater, BTR, Burton, Crest Nicholson, Dixons, Grand Metropolitan, Hillsdown Holdings, Queens Moat Houses, Rolls-Royce, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Tesco. All gained access to funding at an interest rate less than 0.15 percentage points over Libor. Another source of cheap finance was convertible bond issues. By offering conversion into equity at a time of rising share prices companies could raise debt at very low interest rates, often around 4 per cent. However, the share prices of many companies have performed badly since the convertible bonds were issued and are unlikely to reach the conversion price. Bond holders will not convert into equity. Instead, the debt will have to be repaid. Some companies have both MOFs and convertible bonds maturing. For example, Hillsdown Holdings must deal with a Pounds 150m convertible bond issue by December if its share price, which yesterday closed at 192p, does not reach 397p. The company also signed a Pounds 300m five-year MOF in December 1987, at a cost of 0.10 percentage points over Libor. It is clear that refinancing is not taking place through big syndicated banking facilities. Company treasurers insist that complex loans such as MOFs are dead. Instead, companies are arranging credit lines with individual banks, valuing committed funding from a smaller number of relationship banks. For example, Grand Metropolitan last year arranged a Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.41bn) loan with a group of 34 banks to refinance an existing loan from more than 60 banks. Like many other companies over the last year, Grand Met arranged the facility itself. 'We wanted to emphasise the relationship nature of the transaction by going to the banks one-by-one and choosing the participants,' commented Mr Simon Martin, assistant treasurer. It is clear that the cost of bank finance has increased sharply since the late 1980s. Grand Metropolitan raised new money last year at interest rates up to 0.50 percentage points over Libor. One reason for the increase in the cost of bank finance is the pull-back of Japanese banks from the UK market, due in part to the falls on the Tokyo stock market. Bankers estimate that Japanese banks accounted for 40 per cent of the UK corporate loans market in the late 1980s, but only about 10 per cent today. With this in mind, companies are also looking to raise debt finance from institutional investors, particularly in the US market. Bigger companies can raise debt overseas from public bond issues. For example, Grand Metropolitan last year raised Dollars 900m in the US public bond market. 'We are well aware of the capital constraints facing banks and were looking to diversify our sources of funding,' said Mr Martin. Smaller companies are placing debt securities privately with US institutional investors. Foreign issuers - many of them British - raised Dollars 22bn in the US private placement market last year. Hillsdown is an example of a highly-geared company which spent the past two years restructuring its balance sheet and lining up funding to repay cheap debt raised in the late 1980s. The company raised Pounds 285m from a rights issue in October last year; Pounds 100m was raised in July from debt placement with with US institutional investors; bilateral loan facilities have been put in place with relationship banks to cover maturing debt. The company is also considering a 'club' loan on the model followed by Grand Metropolitan last year, believing that better terms can be achieved from relationship banks than large syndicated loans. 'We have already addressed the issue of refinancing. We can now deal with the maturing MOF and the convertible bond issue within existing facilities,' said Mr Nick Mariscotti, treasurer.</p>

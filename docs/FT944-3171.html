			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Markets Report: French franc slips to 1994 low against D-Mark The French franc yesterday fell to a twelve month low against the D-Mark as political uncertainty continued to set the tone in currency markets, writes Philip Gawith. The franc closed in London at FFr3.447/DM, from FFr3.439. Political troubles also saw the Italian lira fall to a record low of L1,044 against the D-Mark, before closing at L1,042. The weakness of the franc and lira was accentuated in the interest rate futures markets, with both the March eurolira and PIBOR contracts losing over 30 basis points. Traders were careful to stress, however, that trading conditions, ahead of Christmas, were thin, and this could lead to exaggerated movements on small volumes. While both the lira and the franc had the potential to weaken further, analysts said market activity was not of the order to suggest either currency was in trouble. Elsewhere the dollar had a steady day, with producer inflation and retail sales data effectively cancelling each other out, depriving the market of fresh trading impetus. The dollar closed unchanged at DM1.5728, and at Y100.395, from Y99.875. In New Zealand, the six month monetary statement from the central bank gave the New Zealand dollar further upward impetus. It touched a five-year high of 64 US cents during Asian trading, before slipping back to a London close of 63.71 cents. The Swedish krone weakened slightly to SKr4.792 against the D-Mark, from SKr4.786, after the Riksbank raised the key repo rate to 7.6 per cent from 7.4 per cent. Sterling had a quiet day, with the trade weighted index finishing unchanged at 80.4. While political uncertainty was the catalyst for lira and franc weakness, the other key factor was generalised D-Mark strength, which has been obvious against most currencies except the dollar and sterling. Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg, said that while 'politics was the principal villain' when it came to franc weakness, this coincided with a gradual shift in perception about the outlook for German interest rates. He noted that the September 1995 and December 1995 euromark futures contracts had both moved about 30-40 basis points this week alone (towards discounting higher interest rates). 'The market seems to be moving to the conclusion that the next move in German rates will be up,' said Mr Magnus. With the franc effectively fixed to the D-Mark through the franc fort policy, Mr Magnus said political uncertainty was more likely to be reflected in the interest rate markets. He predicted, however, that the franc could yet weaken to FFr 3.45-3.50/DM. Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank in London, said that the current exchange rate of the lira appeared to price in most of the bad news. Although the lira was getting weaker, 'each individual piece of news is having less impact in the market.' Mr Brian Durrant, economist at brokers GNI, said that while the dust would settle in France, Italy's problems appeared to be continuing. Mr Durrant stressed that thin trading conditions were leading to exaggerated moves, and a general climate of market unease. 'There was no reason, for example, why short sterling should fall across the board today,' he said, but it did. Most contracts lost around four to seven basis points. The dollar's performance was cited by analysts as further evidence that it had decoupled from bonds. For much of 1994 the dollar and US treasury bonds tracked each other closely. With a low PPI figure offset by strong retail sales, the foreign exchange market 'was very happy to sit on its hands,' said Mr Cocker. 'Now it is waiting for a clear sign whether the Fed will tighten next week.' The open markets committee, which sets Federal Reserve policy, meets next Tuesday to discuss the outlook for interest rates. Mr Cocker said Tuesday was a key date for the dollar because the FOMC meeting coincided with the release of trade data. Monetary policy, and US-Japan trade tensions, have been two key factors explaining the dollar's poor performance in 1994. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 476m of assistance at established rates, and Pounds 430m of late assistance, after forecasting a Pounds 950m shortage.</p>

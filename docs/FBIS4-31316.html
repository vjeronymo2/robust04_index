			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Albanian political parties and other  institutions in the republic of Kosova continue to react against  fabrications regarding Albanian-Serb secret talks in Belgrade  and against the individuals who are promoting such fabrications.  Here is a report by Ramadan Mucolli from Prishtina:    [Mucolli] All the reactions of political parties and other  Albanian bodies in Kosova against the Serb fabrications on the  alleged secret talks between the Albanian and Serbian sides  stress that only the legitimate Kosova representatives, freely  elected by the people, have the mandate to hold such talks on  the question of Kosova.    It is reported that a meeting of the Kosova Democratic  Alliance [LDK] Branch Presidency in Gjakove stressed that the  membership of this party in this commune is aware of the fact  that only those who have the mandate of the people can talk  about Kosova's political status.    On this occasion, they stressed that the position of the LDK  and other Albanian political subjects on the solution of the  Kosova question rely on the political will of the people  expressed through a referendum and that the dialogue with  Belgrade can be developed only on this basis and with the  participation of international organizations.    The Kosova Liberal Party has also turned down offers by  several Serb politicians for some individuals to participate in  talks between Kosova and Serbia.    A public statement issued by this party states that Serbia  is  attempting to concoct a Serb-Albanian dialogue characteristic of  the communist regime and of a modified and perfidious  methodology. This party stresses that, by attempting to profess  to the world that it allegedly supports dialogue with the  Albanians, Serbia wants to select only the Albanians with whom  it can find a common language to continue the slavery of the  Albanian people in Kosova, but also to disqualify the legitimate  representatives of the Kosova people elected in the free  elections of 24 May 1992.    Regarding a solution on the question of Kosova, the Union of  the Independent Trade Unions of Kosova has stated that it  recognizes and supports only the legitimate representatives of  the Kosovar people, who have the mandate to fulfill the  determination of the people for Kosova as an independent and  sovereign state.    In a conversation with a Dutch delegation, Dr. Hajrullah  Gorani, chairman of these trade unions, stressed that the talks  of individuals who represent no one are not serious and cannot  solve any problem and, as such, they do not have the support of  the people or the trade unions.    Branches and sub-branches of political parties and other  Albanian associations in Kosova have also reacted to the Serb  fabrications on these so-called secret talks.</p>

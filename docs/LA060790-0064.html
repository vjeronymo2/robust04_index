			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> POLICE TO PATROL FOR VEHICLES IN WETLANDS  </P> <P> The Oxnard City Council has voted unanimously to spend $10,000 to pay two  police officers to patrol and keep off-road vehicles from driving through the  Ormond Beach Wetlands on weekends.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the city reinforced a vehicle barrier and approved higher  fines for trespassers in an effort to limit damage that off-road vehicles  inflict on the wildlife habitat.  </P> <P> However, at the request of various state and federal environmental groups, the  city decided to fortify its efforts by paying two police officers to work extra  eight-hour shifts on weekends, a city report says.  </P> <P> The patrols, which began two weeks ago, will be paid for by money taken from a  special fund reserved for redevelopment of the Ormond Beach area, the report  says.  </P> <P> City officials and environmentalists have said that all-terrain vehicles have  caused extensive damage to the wetlands, which include almost 200 acres of  dunes and marshes. The area is believed to be home to more than 200 species of  birds, 35 species of fish and 190 species of vertebrates, including squirrels,  possums, skunks and raccoons.  </P> <P> Ormond Beach extends along about two miles of coastline, bounded on the south  by Point Mugu Naval Air Station Pacific Missile Test Range and on the north by  the city of Port Hueneme.  </P> <P> In March, the council increased the fine for trespassing on the beach to $200  from $50. A month later, the city welded shut a gate that blocked the main  access to the beach at Arnold Road. HUGO MARTIN  </P></p>

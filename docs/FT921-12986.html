			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: One-off gain helps USAir to Dollars 1.6m net USAIR, one of the middle-ranking US carriers, yesterday unveiled a tiny Dollars 1.63m net profit in the final quarter of 1991. The result was a sharp improvement on the Dollars 221.1m loss in the same period a year earlier, when the Gulf-inspired fuel price increase hit the entire industry. Comparisons, however, are confused by a one-time pre-tax gain of Dollars 107m due to the freezing of a fully-funded salaried employees' pension plan. This will be replaced in 1993 by a defined contribution pension scheme. Sharply lower fuel prices also helped, as did the absence of restructuring charges, which knocked Dollars 90m off the 1990 fourth-quarter figures. Nevertheless, the company, whose operations are heavily biased towards the east coast, did manage a Dollars 61.2m operating profit in the final quarter, compared with a Dollars 270.1m loss a year ago. This was then largely eroded at the after-tax level by a net Dollars 58.3m interest charge. Seth Schofield, USAir's chief executive, suggested that the company did see some improvement in the final quarter, although he warned that 1992 could still be a difficult year for the industry. USAir is still showing a Dollars 305.3m loss after tax for the year, or a Dollars 414.8m deficit at the pre-tax level - although at one stage in 1991 it was predicting a pre-tax deficit of over Dollars 500m. Shares in the company closed  7/8 higher at 16 3/8 yesterday, ahead of the results' release. They are now double their lows in 1991, when fears about the company's long-term future were rife.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report, followed by Gil'ad 'Adin studio </F> report]    [Excerpts] Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin  Ben-Eli'ezer this evening confirmed that a detailed plan of  bypass roads in the autonomy territories has been prepared for  the Defense Ministry. Peace Now announced that if the  government stops investing in the territories and direct the  funds to other areas, it would correspond with the government's  commitments. Our correspondent Gil'ad 'Adin has the details:    A grandiose, multiyear plan which would cost up to 2 billion  new Israeli shekels, was how Construction and Housing Minister  Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer this evening defined the autonomy road  plan. According to him, the plan deals with paving bypass and  shortcut roads, as well as works on reconstructing and expanding  strategic roads. The purpose is to attain minimal friction  between the Jewish and Arab residents of the autonomy area.    The details of the plan are being kept very secret. It is  feared that if the road map is exposed, it would reveal the  final intentions of the government before the negotiations on  the second stage of autonomy have started. The Public Works  Division [PWD] refused to confirm that it had prepared the map  of the autonomy roads. A contingency plan exists for any  eventuality, PWD sources told us, and we will be ready to begin  work as soon as we are given the order by Minister Ben-Eli'ezer.  [passage omitted]    The map was handed over to the Defense Ministry which,  together with the Prime Minister's Office, is to decide on the  order of priority for the various projects. If the entire plan  is approved, it would cost some 2 billion shekel. In  comparison, this is double the PWD budget for works throughout  Israel in 1994.</p>

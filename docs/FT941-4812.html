			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: BCH under review for downgrade by Moody's Moody's, the US credit rating agency, has placed Banco Central Hispano, Spain's largest bank in terms of assets, under review for possible downgrade. The development affects about Dollars 2.5bn of debt, and BCH's share price fell 3.3 per cent yesterday in Madrid. The bank is currently rated A1 and Prime-1 for long and short-term certificates and Prime-1 for commercial paper. This is the first move by a rating agency on a Spanish bank since the Banesto crisis broke last year. The Spanish central bank sacked Banesto's board after finding that it had grossly overvalued its assets. Banesto is to be sold to a domestic bank next month. Moody's said it would focus on BCH's core earnings, including its reliance on non-recurring earnings, on the quality of its assets and on the progress of a cost reduction programme that followed the 1991 merger between Banco Central and Banco Hispano Americano that created BCH. BCH's net interest income narrowed in 1993 and its operating profit margin was significantly boosted by strong trading revenues earned during last year's volatile interest rate and currency movements. Bad debts, which were above 7 per cent of its loan portfolio, eased slightly and BCH claims now stand at 6.8 per cent, below the sector average.</p>

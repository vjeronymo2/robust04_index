			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Currencies: Sterling awaits outcome of Budget Very few UK investors are looking beyond tomorrow's Budget but the rest of the world must take a wider view of factors that will impinge on the currency markets. In the US, for example, monthly employment figures on Friday could provide the dollar with the chance it needs to break out of its present narrow trading. The UK Budget initially had as much appeal as a washing machine on slow spin  -most economists were convinced that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was backed into a tight corner by current low interest rates and the tax legacy of his predecessor. There was a growing conviction that he could do little more than increase the tax burden a little and cut rates by a smidgen. Tuesday's surprise half-point cut in base rates to 5.5 per cent has seen uncertainty and drama return. Does Tuesday's coded message that the chancellor had taken 'full account' of the budget mean there will be no more good news on rates? Will the fiscal squeeze be so tight that it will have to be balanced by another half-point sweetener before the end of the year? What does it mean for sterling? Last week, the pound defied the conventional wisdom that lower rates lead to weaker currencies. The rate cut was heavily discounted in money market lending rates so the pound rose against leading currencies. The chances of sterling pulling off the same coup twice in a short period are slim. Most economists agree that while base rates of 5 per cent might not be detrimental to the pound they would give pause for thought. The second focus of the week will come on Friday when the US releases its non-farm payroll data for November. The figure is considered to be the most important pointer to the direction the US economy is taking and economists are looking for a rise in jobs over the month of between 150,000 and 200,000. The dollar has been within in a tight range against the D-Mark of between DM1.68 and DM1.72 for some time and a higher than forecast jobs figure could send the currency into new territory. Finally the Bundesbank council is to meet on Thursday and there are some hopes it might reduce the Lombard and discount rates, although most economists forecast no further cut before the next meeting on December 16.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow realizes the basic necessity to withdraw  Russia's 14th Army from Moldova. There is no need to  procrastinate this process, said Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  on Tuesday, upon conclusion of talks with his Moldovan  counterpart, Mikhail Popov.    In answer to a question from Interfax Kozyrev said: "Russia  clearly understands that there must be no foreign troops in a  sovereign state. However it's not easy to prepare an organized  withdrawal of the 14th Army. This process will take time."    According to him, "it's useless to speak about serious  differences in the two sides' approaches to the times of  withdrawal." "Both Russia and Moldova realize perfectly well the  complexity of this issue, to which neither side has a clear  answer. It's gratifying that no one has tried to tackle this  problem unilaterally," Kozyrev noted.    For his part, Popov said that the presence of the 14th Army  in Trans-Dniestria [Transdniester] is "the most inconvenient  part of the Soviet legacy in relations between Russia and  Moldova." "We do not blame Russia for the resulting situation,"  he stressed.    The head of Moldovan diplomacy said he hopes that the  concrete times of withdrawal will be agreed upon during the next  round of bilateral talks planned for July.</p>

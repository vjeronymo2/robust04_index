			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SORRENTO VALLEY CEMETERY A FINAL RESTING PLACE FOR PETS  </P> <P> Like the quiet eye in the center of a hurricane, a tiny plot of land lies in  the midst of Sorrento Valley's growing industrial complex.  </P> <P> Overhead, the roar of traffic echoes from Interstates 5 and 805 as drivers  jockey for position. Across narrow Sorrento Valley Road, Amtrak trains rocket  by with increasing frequency and freight trains rumble through the night. Each  weekday morning and night, the macadam road carries a bumper-to-bumper cargo of  valley workers.  </P> <P> But none of this human uproar bothers the residents of Sorrento Valley Pet  Cemetery, 1 1/2 acres of serenity. Here Fifi and Fido rest beneath metal  markers (flush to the ground so they don't interfere with the lawn mower) and  the cremated remains of beloved kittens and parakeets rest in a  mini-columbarium.  </P> <P> In all, there have been 157 burials -- some complete with satin-lined coffins  and services in the tiny chapel -- during the cemetery's 35 years. In addition,  there have been more than 5,000 cremations in the pet-sized crematorium.  </P> <P> Velma Matthews, who bought the land in 1978, said there is no threat that the  remains that have been resting here since the first pet burial in January,  1956, ever will be evicted. But modern buildings are rising nearer to the site  and the pet cemetery crew must stay ever alert to prevent huge moving vans from  a company next door from parking on the cemetery grounds.  </P> <P> "Little services are about all we can handle," said Matthews. The tiny chapel  can hold about four or five humans and the pet's last remains. "We sometimes  just have a normal, simple interment outside. Or sometimes we have the pet on  view in the chapel, where the family can say their last goodbys."  </P> <P> A statue of St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals, stands near the  chapel, but Matthews stresses that the chapel is non-sectarian. She recalls one  service in which a rabbi eulogized the departed pet.  </P> <P> B.J. Shelton of San Diego settled for a simple interment for Shawna, her  19-year-old Irish setter and "my best friend."  </P> <P> Shawna joins 17 other Shelton pets in the plot, many of them Brittany spaniels,  which Shelton's late husband favored, but others were just pick-me- ups that  joined the family and won a lasting place in the Sheltons' hearts.  </P> <P> "There is a lot of love in there," Shelton said, indicating the plot where her  departed pets are resting. "We talked about it and we agreed that we wanted to  know just where they were.  </P> <P> "We knew that they would be safe here," Shelton said. The Sorrento Valley pet  cemetery has the same perpetual zoning protection as a human cemetery, she  explained.  </P> <P> When Shelton visits her pets, she often strolls a few yards beyond to tend the  grave of Hoover the Sparrow.  </P> <P> Hoover was just an ordinary sparrow that earned a place in the heart of a widow  by perching on the window sill and watching television with her. When, after  nine years of companionship, Hoover died, its benefactor gathered it up and  brought it to the pet cemetery for burial.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen her around for a while," Shelton mused about Hoover's mistress  as she pushed away the grass encroaching on Hoover's tiny brass marker. "She  may have gone on. So I sometimes leave flowers here too when I come because I  think it is a touching story."  </P> <P> Sorrento Valley Pet Cemetery's most recent celebrity burial occurred a few  months ago when the Oceanside Police Department's K-9 Corps turned out in full  uniform to bury Irk, a four-year veteran of the force who was credited with  assists in 28 arrests.  </P> <P> Irk, a German shepherd, had chased a suspect into a ravine and into the water,  where the man was trying to hide. Irk apparently caught pneumonia, went into  convulsions and died.  </P> <P> At Irk's funeral in February, Officer Chris McDonough, his handler, McDonough's  wife and three children looked on as Oceanside K-9 officers stood at parade  rest and their charges sat at attention while Irk's coffin was lowered into the  ground.  </P> <P> "It was a very touching ceremony," Matthews said. "We had a number of calls  from people asking if it would be open to the public. I decided not to do so  because we have such a small parking area and it was crowded with police cars."  </P> <P> Near the entrance to the pet cemetery, a tall double-trunked sycamore tree  shades the pet memory wall, where plaques commemorate beloved pets whose ashes  have been scattered there.  </P> <P> According to the pet cemetery's advertising brochure, cremation is available  for any type of pet, from small ponies (250-pound limit) to tiny baby birds. A  variety of urns are for sale if grieving owners want to keep their pet at home.  Cremation costs from $40 up, depending on the size of the pet.  </P> <P> "We only do individual cremations," Matthews said, describing the steps taken  to ensure that every owner ends up with his or her own pet's remains and a  simple metal tag identifying the deceased.  </P> <P> The small crematorium with its tall black smokestack is licensed by the San  Diego Air Pollution Control District.  </P> <P> "They were very good to us," Matthews said of the APCD. "No restrictions on our  permit. We are a fully licensed pet crematory."  </P> <P> The permit restrictions do cause some distress to bereaved clients, however,  because crematory rules do not allow the cremation of a pet's favorite blanket  or toy along with the body. A collar or bow-ribbon might be allowed, Matthews  said, but nothing that could create ash and pollution.  </P> <P> Paper flowers dot the graves that stretch across the wide cemetery lawn, and on  Memorial Day weekend, small U.S. flags were set for visitors to decorate the  tiny grave sites.  </P> <P> A funeral plus burial costs about $500, with a $10 yearly charge for care of  the plot. If a person fails to pay the yearly fee for five years in a row, the  pet's remains can be removed and the land reused, Matthews said. It happens,  she said, when families move away or when youngsters grow up and forget their  childhood pets.  </P> <P> Cemetery staff will pick up dead pets on a 24-hour basis, with an extra charge  for after-hours services.  </P> <P> "We collect the animals in style, in a station wagon," Matthews said proudly,  "not in a pickup truck as some do."  </P> <P> "San Diegans are very lucky. Although there are only about 500 pet cemeteries  in the world, we have two of them right in this area," Matthews said. She said  that only about 1% of pet owners seek burial or cremation of their pets after  death, "but they are a very special group."  </P> <P> The other area pet cemetery, San Diego Pet Memorial Park, is only a few miles  away, east of Interstate 805 near Miramar Road. It was started in 1962 by  former employees of the Sorrento Valley Pet Cemetery, Matthews said.  </P> <P> B.J. Shelton concedes that "a lot of people might make fun of it, caring so  much for a pet. But, I don't care." When her husband passed away nine years  ago, Shawna was there for her.  </P> <P> "She kept me from going crazy," Shelton said. "She was my best friend."  </P></p>

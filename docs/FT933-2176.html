			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / EC battles to head off crisis over Uruguay Round THE European Community was last night desperately trying to head off a crisis over the Gatt world trade talks amid a warning from the UK that failure to reach a deal would bring normal EC business to a halt. Germany warned of 'catastrophic dangers' to its economy if France's objections to the Blair House agreement between the EC and the US on limiting subsidised farm trade wreck chances of concluding the Uruguay Round by its December 15 deadline. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said the EC would be paralysed by recriminations if the Uruguay Round failed. 'It's not the case that in causing a crisis in Gatt we can avoid an internal EC crisis,' he said. 'I cannot conceive how the EC will continue with the normal transaction of business if it were seen as causing the collapse of the Uruguay Round.' As 35 EC foreign, agriculture and trade ministers met in Brussels, there were nevertheless signs of an emerging consensus in favour of giving the European Commission authority to test if the US is ready to accept an amplification of Blair House to address French concerns over limits on lucrative food exports. Senior Commission officials, and others who negotiated Blair House last November, said efforts to reach a compromise would centre on finding a formula to delay cuts in subsidised food exports so as to run down EC food mountains. 'If the Americans want to be helpful, that is an area in which we can help resolve this,' one Commission negotiator said. Sir Leon Brittan, chief EC trade negotiator, has written to Washington setting out concerns. But he warned ministers of the danger that the US would in turn exact new concessions in other areas of the Gatt talks. France's latest outline of its demands went further, covering adequate protection for the EC against food imports, extension of the so-called 'peace clause' on EC-US farm trade disputes, and a provision indexing the EC's share of international markets to their future growth, particularly in Asia. 'What is at stake is the basic concept of Europe and solidarity between us,' said Mr Alan Juppe, French foreign minister. UK officials would not be drawn on whether Mr Hurd's comments amounted to a UK threat to boycott EC initiatives. French officials seemed surprised by the hardening of Britain's position, which other member states and the Commission warned could make it more difficult to paper over differences. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister and Bonn's foremost defender of Gatt, said the French were 'playing for the highest stakes,' but added that 'we don't want to have a clash.'

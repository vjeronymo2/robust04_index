			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / BFI bid gives Attwoods a rude awakening Attwoods, the UK waste group, yesterday attacked a Pounds 364m hostile bid from Browning-Ferris Industries of the US as an opportunistic attempt to take advantage of one shareholder's desire to sell. The bid was sprung on Attwoods yesterday morning after a late-night deal between BFI, headed by former FBI director Mr William Rucklehaus, and Attwoods' largest shareholder, Laidlaw of Canada. Laidlaw, which has three directors on Attwoods' board, put the company into play by agreeing in secret talks to sell its 29.8 per cent stake to BFI for 109p a share. Laidlaw has also agreed that in the case of a higher offer from another bidder, it will remit the difference to BFI. Mr Ken Foreman, Attwoods chief executive, was believed to be less than happy yesterday over Laidlaw's actions. The fact that the Laidlaw directors who negotiated the deal with BFI had access to Attwoods' management accounts and budgets could be a blow to Attwoods' defence to the bid. The defence must also deal with a reputation tarnished by ill-fated acquisitions and financing difficulties. Laidlaw said it had tried to sell the Attwoods stake for a year. It is believed to have approached BFI, which claims to be the world's second largest waste company, some months ago. Mr Jim Bullock, Laidlaw chief executive, said the deal was in the interests of shareholders. 'If there were any improvement in the offer, it would be to the benefit of other shareholders, not to Laidlaw,' he said. 'We've been quite scrupulous in making sure that all shareholders are treated the same.' Attwoods' future depends on two other substantial investors, Templeton Investments of the US and Fidelity, which together control 27 per cent. Analysts yesterday expected the institutions to hold out for a higher offer. The current bid was 'extremely low, very opportunistic and right at the bottom of the 12-month trading range', said Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell of NatWest Securities. BFI is offering 109p per share, against last night's close of 117p. The offer represents Dollars 8.53 per American Depository Receipt, equivalent to five shares, and 85p per preference share. Laidlaw has agreed to sell its 73 per cent preference holding to BFI if the ordinary offer goes unconditional. Laidlaw has agreed to buy Attwoods' German portable sanitation business for Dollars 56.8m, (Pounds 36.6m), if BFI cannot find an alternative buyer. If BFI gets a higher price for the business, Attwoods' shareholders will receive the difference in an additional payment. Lex, Page 14 Disturbed night, Page 23</p>

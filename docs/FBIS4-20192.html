			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today said  that the letter from the Albanian permanent representative to  the United Nations Security Council is vague and unfounded.    Venizelos said that this letter reminds him of the letter  from Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi that asked the  United Nations to condemn Greece as a terrorist state because of  the incident at Ano Episkopi and its friendship with the Serbs.    The spokesman added that, in view of the 3 May meeting in  Zurich between Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and  Serreqi, the Greek Government wants to be cautious about its  statements since Greek positions are understood by the  international community.</p>

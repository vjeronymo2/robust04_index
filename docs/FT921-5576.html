			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Chatlines could be forced out of business by Oftel THE controversial telephone chatline industry faces the threat of being driven out of business by Oftel, the telecommunications regulatory body. Oftel said yesterday it intended to revoke a code of practice under which the chatlines operate on April 6. The effect would be to stop BT and Mercury Communications from providing the chatline-service companies with telecommunications facilities, bringing the industry to a halt. Chatlines, which allow individuals who ring premium-rate phone numbers to talk to other people who ring that number at the same time, have been criticised on the grounds that they encourage big phone bills. The services are charged at 48p a minute and there have been persistent reports of customers used to small bills being presented with demands for hundreds of pounds after their children have abused the service. There have also been cases of burglars phoning the lines from their victims' houses. Oftel's move has been triggered because a fund designed to compensate customers who face high bills as a result of unauthorised use of their phones has run up a Pounds 600,000 deficit. The Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services, which regulates chatlines and runs the compensation fund, said it had asked 12 chatline companies to clear the deficit about a month ago, but only two had paid. The committee said it was not clear why the others were not paying. Oftel said it was no longer satisfied that the code of practice made 'adequate provision for compensating those who suffer as a result of the provision of chatline services'. BT, however, has agreed to pay compensation to any of its customers who have outstanding claims which would have been paid by the fund if it had had enough money. Oftel expects the chatline companies to challenge its action in court by trying to get an injunction. The Independent Chatline Association, which represents the industry, had no comment to make yesterday. Chatlines have been controversial since their introduction about five years ago. BT was forced to abandon its own service following a public outcry. The current regime of a code of practice and a compensation fund followed an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Technology: Eloquent idea stresses that learning is a verb - A mighty mouse is pushing back the walls of the language laboratory The months and years of struggling to learn a foreign language using books and tapes may be numbered. A plan to develop Europe's first low-cost digitalised language learning laboratory has recently won EC backing, with the specific aim of making language learning easier, interactive, and more affordable. The European project, named Eloquent, will design and produce software for a computer workstation which can operate as a stand-alone unit or within a network. 'The traditional language learning experience is highly inefficient,' says Prof Stephen Hagen, Eloquent's project director. 'We intend to create a system that gives flexible and open learning, freeing both student and tutor from their conventional roles.' Traditional language teaching methods and materials often fail to address the very different learning requirements of individual students. Recent research by the National Council for Education Technology found that, on average, students only absorb 10 per cent of what they read; 50 per cent of what they hear and see; 70 per cent of what they say themselves; and 90 per cent of what they do themselves. 'The NCET study is further evidence that the student has to be actively participating and using all his or her senses to learn effectively. The multi-media option of Eloquent offers this solution,' says Prof Hagen. The Eloquent workstation is based on Acorn A5000 and A540 computers. The language programme is written onto high-density CD-ROM (compact-disc read only memory ) and optical read-write discs are used to record the student's responses, either spoken or written. A record of the student's progress is recorded on disk. If a number of workstations are connected in a network, a tutor can access any of the units while the students are working, interacting and giving guidance. A French lesson, for example, might provide the student with a colour video of a busy Paris street. The film scene would hide several 'hot spots'. With the click of a computer mouse, the student can select parts of the program to explore. Thus, a click over the baker's shop in the video will provide the student with a more detailed view of the inside of a baker's shop, either in moving or still pictures. The student may then be asked to identify certain items, make a purchase or hold a conversation. These are recorded and filed, either for a tutor to check later, or for the student to return to. A double click on the mouse would return the student to the street scene. Other developments being planned for Eloquent include using foreign language satellite broadcasts which the workstation could receive via telephone or cable. The broadcasts could then be sampled, allowing the student to select his or her own programme. It is the cost of the Eloquent system, however, which has most excited the language learning establishment. The basic cost of an Acorn workstation, disc and other software, will be less than Pounds 2,000. However, it is estimated that about 65 per cent of UK schools and colleges already use Acorn computers, so upgrading these existing computers will greatly reduce costs. Eloquent's initial budget of Pounds 1m will be half-met by the EC, with the remainder coming from the consortium partners: City Technology Colleges, Acorn Computers and Crystal Presentations from the UK, Dida-El (Italy), Link (Germany), Multi-Media Systems Institute (Greece) and Learnout and Hauspie (Belgium).</p>

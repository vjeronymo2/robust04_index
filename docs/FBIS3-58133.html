			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA) -- Germany and Norway insist that  Russia stop dumping nuclear waste in the North Sea and other  marine sites. This was made clear in Bonn today by Environment  Ministers Klaus Toepfer and Thorbjoern Berntsen. Toepfer drew  attention to a statement by Moscow that Russia will have to  continue sea-dumping liquid waste from nuclear plants until 1995  if Western help with disposal is not provided. By 1995,  activities of a Russian processing plant near the Barents Sea  pose a particular threat, Berntsen said.    According to the ministers, both countries are prepared to  help Russia within the scope of the G24 countries' aid program.  However, Toepfer says the precondition for this is for the  Russian side to undertake a binding program on disposal  measures. He implied that concrete assistance has so far failed  because of this. Russia intends to submit a technical program  for nuclear waste disposal, including costs, by 1 February.    As concluded by two Norwegian-Russian expeditions, which  assessed risks in the North Sea and included a German scientist,  Toepfer said another reconnaissance trip by a German ship should  take place this year. It is of vital importance "that we make  progress here." Areas posing a particular threat are the  reactors from spent nuclear submarines dumped in the North Sea  by the former Soviet Union.    Other topics covered at the start of the two-day visit to  Germany by his Norwegian counterpart were Oslo's negotiations  for European Union [EU] membership, the disputed issue of  whaling, and the support signalled by Toepfer for Berntsen's  candidacy for chairmanship of the UN Commission for Sustainable  Development, which will be decided in May.    Norway's membership in the EU membership -- which is the  second attempt to join after the people voted against such a  move in 1972 -- is viewed by Toepfer as important, not least for  environmental reasons: "Norway has high standards in the  environmental sphere." This could encourage other EU countries,  Toepfer said. Whereas Toepfer assumes that Norway will be an EU  member from 1 January 1995, Berntsen did not wish to rule out  entirely the possibility that his fellow countrymen might once  again vote against this in a referendum. His government would  regret this, he said. [passage omitted]</p>

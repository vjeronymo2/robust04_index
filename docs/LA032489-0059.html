			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  AZUSA SUED OVER MINING OF CANYON  </P> <P> The city of Azusa has been sued by two environmental groups claiming that it  was negligent in fashioning a compromise last year to allow a controversial  rock quarry to continue mining Fish Canyon.  </P> <P> The suit, filed by the Forest Preservation Society and the Committee to Save  the Foothills, claims that the city has been negligent in the way it issues  permits and oversees the 190-acre site mined by Azusa Rock Inc. A Pomona  Superior Court judge has ordered the city to respond by April 19.  </P> <P> The lawsuit asks Pomona Superior Court Judge Thomas F. Nuss to force the city  to apply current state mining and environmental laws to the quarry. Such  regulations would require a potentially lengthy and expensive environmental  impact report, which the city and Azusa Rock contend is unnecessary.  </P></p>

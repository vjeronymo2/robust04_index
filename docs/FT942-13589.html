			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / As they say in Europe: Warning lights flash in Italy The struggle to form a government in Italy has distracted attention from the truth that the worst is yet to come. Just consider the situation in two other countries. An editorial in an important paper runs: 'There is no doubt that the next time the prime minister takes a stand on any issue he will have to retreat.' The Englishman thinks: 'No doubt about it, Major's finished.' The Frenchman: 'Balladur, il est fini.' Italy's Silvio Berlusconi should take note. It was two years ago that John Major unexpectedly won an election in the face of long odds and the opinion polls. He is now nearly as unpopular as his government. Edouard Balladur gained a crushing victory a year later and became the most popular man in France. Now his ratings are in steep decline. Balladur provides a particularly instructive example of a negative kind for Berlusconi. He aimed to reduce the state sector, cut public spending and hack at the diseased social undergrowth. He has been thwarted at every turn. The latest attempt to deal with Air France marks only preliminary skirmishing before a number of desperate battles over what Liberation calls 'the flying Louvre'. The first one was lost. Alessandro Merli of Il Sole-24 Ore of Milan was in London to cover the 1992 election and says the recent Italian poll was a rerun of that affair. Achille Ochetto, leader of the left, behaved just like former labour leader, Neil Kinnock, and lost. He even said taxes might have to rise. Berlusconi said: 'We are the party of tax cutters' and won. The election victory that the left looked to have in the bag in the winter, withered as the days lengthened. Berlusconi has probably taken no notice of the obvious precedents but he will have a hard job to avoid following them. He may choose the Major way and suddenly find that tax rises are essential. He might even take a strong stand on a trivial issue or two and cave in. Or there is the minor, Balladur, way: put up policy proposals and withdraw them as soon as those affected object. But there is also the possibility that Berlusconi might be a new Thatcher: the economists around him make Anglo-Saxon free-market fanatics look wet. The only trouble is that nowhere in western Europe is Lady Thatcher seen as the beacon she manifestly believes herself to be. Britain is more often held up as an awful warning of the consequences of free market radicalism. Berlusconi ensures his radical ideas are, for the moment, kept to discussions among his backroom boys. He would not have shared an election platform with her even though he seems to be motivated by the same instincts. The British reply to the antipathy their example arouses should not be the kind of boastfulness that sometimes emanates from Conservative circles. It should run along the lines of: 'Think where we would be if we hadn't radically reformed. Think of those vast loss-making state industries that have been revitalised and sold off. What if public spending had not been kept under some kind of control through the 1980s? If trade unions had not been reformed?' Economic reform does not necessarily mean things work well after the right systems have been put in place. Economic management still has to be competent. Britain has a brilliantly reformed economy but those in charge have not always shown a deft hand in running it. Balladur's failures have ensured France still has a ludicrously structured economy. There are nationalised banks which have become a dustbin for the bag ladies of French industry; subsidised state industries which should be closed down; public utilities which would be insolvent if they were private entities. A minimum wage was pitched so high that mass unemployment is an inevitable result. Yet France has a currency that is worth more than when the markets forced it down and out of the exchange rate system, it has a structural balance of payments surplus. Some French private sector industries are world beaters and the economy has enjoyed a decade of low inflation. The lesson is that a long period of sometimes painful reform is of only limited use if you do not know what to do afterwards. The official British solution today is 'more change, more change' because change is what Britons are good at. The French are good at running a system that was put in place by the Vichy government 50 years ago and by the post-war Fourth Republic. Anyone trying to tackle its problems today runs up against colossal vested interests, but then it more or less works, because French officials make it work. So Berlusconi faces an interesting challenge. Is it worth changing an appalling system that has served Italy quite well? And if it is changed, will the new one be any better?

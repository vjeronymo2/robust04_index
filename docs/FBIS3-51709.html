			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Manola Robles] </F>   [Excerpt] Speaking at the end of a meeting that a group of  Mexican legislators held with President Patricio Aylwin, Mexican  Senator Carlos Seles Gutierrez said the Mexican Senate and  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari support the admission of  Chile into a free trade agreement with the United States.    Speaking about the possibility of a free trade agreement  with  the United States, Seles said:    [Begin Seles recording, in progress] ...whether through  NAFTA  or a bilateral agreement. This depends on Chilean national  interests. Overall we held a cordial meeting, during which we  discussed the progress that our bilateral ties have experienced.  [end recording]    Commenting on persistent oppostion to NAFTA in Mexico, Seles  said that any U.S.-Chilean free trade agreement would be based  on very different terms than those of the U.S.-Mexican  agreement, because 70 percent of Mexican trade is targeted at  the United States.    [Begin Seles Recording] I do not believe we will experience  the great impact that people are talking about, because if labor  costs were the determinant factor for companies establishing  themselves, then they would be establishing themselves in Haiti  or in countries that pay lower salaries than ours.    I believe the NAFTA agreement will inevitably lead to new  investments in Mexico. However, we Mexicans believe we will be  luring greater investment from countries oustide NAFTA, that is,  outside the United States and Canada. We believe we will be  luring greater investment from Asian and Pacific Rim countries,  mainly from Japan, and from Europe, which together with Mexicans  will be able to exploit Mexican resources to reach the huge  American market.

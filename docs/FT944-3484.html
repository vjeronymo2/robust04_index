			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Dream ticket's demise: Lionel Barber on the let-down felt by Euro-enthusiasts Mr Jacques Delors' decision against running for the presidency of France says a lot about the man, his age, his family commitments and his thin skin. But it may say more about the fragile state of public opinion in France toward Europe. As president of the European Commission since 1985, Mr Delors has been a driving force in Franco-German efforts to build an 'ever closer' European Union. The single European market, economic and monetary union, the Maastricht treaty: each bears his indelible mark. Now, with the Elysee seemingly within reach, Mr Delors has flinched. The disappointment of French socialists is nothing to compare with the sense of let-down felt by European supporters of faster, deeper integration. Mr Delors was their champion. They hoped he would form a 'dream ticket' with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to dominate the 1996 inter-govermental conference that will review the Maastricht treaty. 'When I first heard about his decision, I felt an explosion of anger,' says a long-time Eurocrat and friend of Mr Delors. 'He could have made this decision three months ago. Now I am afraid we will have to go slower in 1996.' In time, more sober conclusions may be drawn. The absence of one man, even a towering figure such as Mr Delors, will not alter France's calculation that Germany is its most important ally; or that French influence, especially over Germany, is best projected through a united Europe. The question is: what type of Europe? When Mr Delors leaves Brussels in January, his successor will be Mr Jacques Santer, the Luxembourg prime minister. Mr Santer sees himself as consolidator, not a promotor of new ideas in the mould of Mr Delors. For the past decade, the Delors-Kohl-Mitterrand troika has driven forward the plans for European monetary and political union, sweeping aside the doubters led by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, former UK prime minister. Yet the end product - the Maastricht treaty - was an uneasy compromise that fell far short of the ambitions of its promoters. Mr Delors still chides himself for being caught up in the planning for a single European currency while the British sabotaged provisions for 'political union' in Europe - the German-led push for greater powers for the European parliament, progressive elimination of the national veto in the Council of Ministers, and a common defence policy. Yet Mr Delors would be the first to admit that the British were assisted in their efforts by the French. It was Mr Pierre de Boissieu, now France's ambassador in Brussels, who devised Maastricht's 'pillar system' that divides European decision-making into different areas: some such as the common agricultural policy are decided at supranational level; others such as foreign policy, justice and immigration affairs are subject to looser intergovernmental co-operation. Inside the European Commission, contempt for the pillar system is rife. A senior official describes justice ministers' efforts to reach agreement on issues such as tackling organised crime as a 'sham'. Another official involved in the common security and foreign policy says nothing of substance has been accomplished, beyond the establishment of an EU presence in the heavily shelled Bosnian town of Mostar. 'There is trench warfare between the Commission and the member states,' he says. Euro-activists hope that 1996 will end the battle over national and supranational responsibilities, seeing the role of the inter-governmental conference as akin to the Philadelphia convention of 1787 that created the US constitution. Euro-sceptics vow to roll back Maastricht, mainly by depriving the Commission of its main power, the sole right to propose legislation on areas of EU competence. France stands somewhere in the middle, worried about following Germany into political union, but equally wary of the Thatcher-Seguin model of Europe as little more than a free trade area. Mr Delors' answer is an inner circle of integrationist-minded states led by France and Germany. This hard-core would be committed to common economic, political and security policies inside a European Union enlarged by the former communist countries of central and eastern Europe. Those unable to join the inner core at an early date (possibly Italy or Spain) or those unwilling (possibly the UK, Denmark or Sweden) would be free to catch up later. Mr Delors' views are broadly similar to the ideas put forward in a recent analysis by the ruling CDU-CSU party in Germany. Together they represent an act of faith in proclaiming the virtual end of the nation state and an attempt to prevent the paralysis of the Union's decision-making as it prepares for the next round of enlargement in eastern Europe. The exit of Mr Delors from France's presidential race diminishes the prospect of a strategic bargain between France and Germany in 1996 on political union. But Euro-sceptics will find that his absence does not diminish the powerful forces supporting European co-operation and integration. First, there remains strong support for establishing a single European currency by the end of the decade. Second, as the UK has grasped, US political and military disengagement from Europe is forcing consideration of new forms of defence co-operation. Third, an unstable Russia may accelerate the integration of eastern Europe into the Union, forcing a streamlining of decision-making and a corresponding erosion of national sovereignty. Mr Delors' withdrawal may have removed Mr Kohl's natural ally in this programme. But Germany's chancellor, who sees Europe's future as a matter of war and peace, will not easily be rebuffed.</p>

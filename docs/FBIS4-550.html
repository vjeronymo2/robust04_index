			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Fighting is taking place in Kigali itself.  [passage omitted] The Rwandan Government is accusing the UN  forces, the UNAMIR [UN Mission in Rwanda] of giving technical  help to the rebels, and the Belgian soldiers of facilitating the  evacuation of Rwanda Patriotic Front members from Kigali.    About 40 Belgians remained to be evacuated this morning -- a  dozen in Kigali and 20 to 30 inside the country. This is what  we have heard from military sources in Brussels. The Belgian  nationals have been located precisely and Belgian troops are  going to try to go and collect them today.    Late this morning 338 expatriates arrived at Brussels  airport. The Belgian ambassador in Rwanda was on the passenger  list. Princess Astrid went to welcome them. [passage omitted]</p>

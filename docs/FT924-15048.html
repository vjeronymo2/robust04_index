			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: New board at Crown company A FRENCH commercial court yesterday appointed a 'provisional director' to supervise the setting up of a new board of RFM, the French commercial radio network controlled by Crown Communications, the UK radio group. The decision follows the resignation of several RFM directors. The court-appointed director can also look at the financial viability of the loss-making network and its precise shareholdings. The court decision is a further embarrassment to Crown, owners of the London Broadcasting Company, which reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.58m in the six months to the end of March. Mr Christopher Chataway, chairman of Crown, the USM-quoted commercial radio group, however, yesterday dismissed the incident as 'a storm in a teacup at a minor subsidiary.' Crown had not known about the hearing. Crown is planning to sell the 114-station RFM network, which recently had its Paris licence renewed, to a consortium led by NRJ, an independent French radio network. Mr Chataway said yesterday he expected the sale to be complete by the end of the year. 'RFM is being supported by Crown and this (the court decision) has absolutely nothing to do with the financial viability of the company.' The Crown chairman said the group had the continued support of its bankers for the policy of stripping the company down to LBC, the London commercial station which he said was cash positive. The running of Independent Radio News had been taken over by Independent Television News and talks, Mr Chataway said, were at an advanced stage on the sale of IRS, the radio sales company. In January the CSA gave approval for a change of shareholding at RFM which would have meant Crown having 49 per cent, the management 21 per cent and a French bank Credit Mutuel d'Artois 30 per cent. Mr Chataway conceded yesterday that the management shareholding had not been implemented and probably would not now be implemented because of the pending sale.</p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Fall feared in mortgage applications A SHARP fall in the number of young people applying for mortgages later this decade was predicted yesterday, following the publication of research on how attitudes have been affected by falls in property prices in the past three years. The Building Societies Association disclosed internal research showing a fall in the number of people aged between 16 and 34 who regard owner-occupation within two years as their ideal, and a substantial rise in those favouring private rented homes. Mr Adrian Coles, director-general designate of the BSA, told its annual conference in Brighton that the change in attitude, combined with a fall in the number of people in their mid-20s, could lead to 'a very significant reduction' in mortgage applications. Mr Coles said the change was not surprising. 'It is younger people who will have obtained relatively large mortgages in the late 1980s, found high interest rates most difficult to cope with, and have been or are likely to be frustrated movers,' he said. He said that the average age of entry to owner-occupation could rise by three or four years, and this could lead to 'a difficult three or four years in the marketplace while the average age is increasing'. Mr Coles emphasised, however, that the research, which was carried out in February and March among 2,500 people, had shown that the overall proportion favouring owner-occupation within two years had recovered to its peak 1989 level of 81 per cent after falling to 77 per cent in 1991. The proportion of 16 to 24 year olds favouring owner-occupation within two years fell from 79 per cent in 1989 to 60 per cent in 1991 and only partly recovered to 71 per cent by this year. Among 25 to 34 year olds it fell from 89 per cent to 83 per cent before recovering to 84 per cent. Mr Coles said that the views of younger people were 'unfortunately' more influential than those of the elderly in determining the housing market because they moved more frequently and were more likely to become first-time buyers. The study found a large rise in the proportion of young people favouring rented accommodation. In 1989 only 4 per cent of 20 to 24 year olds aspired to this, but the proportion more than doubled to 11 per cent this year. Mr Coles said many young people had been put off owner-occupation because there was no longer a prospect of increases in house prices sharp enough to cover the transaction costs of moving home. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at UBS, said the prospect of a fall in the number of first-time buyers in the late 1990s meant that the government should not take measures which would stifle housing demand excessively.</p>

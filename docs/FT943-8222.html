			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / BICC sets sights on trebling cable sales in Asia: UK group discusses Chinese venture as profits rise 26% to Pounds 63m BICC, the UK cables and construction group, is planning to treble its cable sales in the fast-growing Asia Pacific market to Pounds 500m by the end of the decade and is discussing a joint venture in China. The plans were unveiled yesterday as BICC announced a 26 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits from a restated Pounds 50m to Pounds 63m. Its shares rose 4p to 416p. BICC is the world's second largest cables producer, behind Alcatel of France, with a strong presence in Europe and North America. Sir Robin Biggam, chairman, said exploiting the Asia-Pacific infrastructure market was crucial to the growth of the business, along with added value from product differentiation and low-cost production. Group sales in the Asia-Pacific region have risen from about Pounds 120m in 1989 to Pounds 280m last year, of which Pounds 160m came from cables. Exports from the UK account for Pounds 120m of the Asian cable sales, with the remaining Pounds 40m coming from 40 per cent-owned Power Cables Malaysia. Sir Robin said sales of Asian-made cables could rise to Pounds 300m by the end of the decade. Last month, the group said it was forming BICC Asia-Pacific Cables to handle business in the region. The UK company will have a 50 per cent stake, with the remainder held by Metal Manufactures, its 61 per cent-owned Australasian subsidiary. Sir Robin said BICC was discussing a venture with Shanghai Cable Works, China's second biggest producer, and a smaller venture in Vietnam. It was also pursuing opportunities in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. The importance of the region to BICC was underlined yesterday by the announcement that Balfour Beatty had received a letter of intent for a Dollars 158m contract - shared equally with an Indonesian partner - to do civil works for the 980MW Muara Tawar power station. Sir Robin said there had been no change in the situation in Malaysia, where the company has been hit by the ban on government contracts for UK companies. Private sector activities were continuing. He expected construction margins to remain under pressure, with any UK growth dependent on privately financed infrastructure initiatives. BICC also hopes to raise Pounds 100m over the next 18 months through property sales. Details, Page 16 Lex, Page 14</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Turning to television for the power and the glory - How a Scottish electricity group is planning to broadcast its message to shareholders Ian Preston, chief executive of the recently-privatised Scottish Power, is built with the solidity of one of his power stations. He does not look the sort of man who throws money around lightly. 'Prudent is the word,' he says. Yet the practical Preston has recently been spending time in the media village of London's Soho discussing new ways of getting his message across. In July, Scottish Power will become the first user of The Business Channel, which will use BBC television transmitters in the early hours of the morning to broadcast corporate meetings. A half-hour edited version of Scottish Power's 1992 annual general meeting on July 29 will be broadcast at 5.30 the next morning. And although the programme may catch a few early risers, the main hope is that people will record it and watch it later. Scottish Power's agm is not going to make much of a splash in the ratings but Preston hopes it might help to solve a rather tricky problem - how to communicate with his 900,000 shareholders. The company - the first big privatisation in Scotland  - has shareholders all over the UK. Although some of the original shareholders are likely to sell, Preston believes his permanent roster is likely to be around 750,000. Preston is afraid that many of the company's letters or brochures 'arrive with the junk mail and many get the same kind of treatment'. He was initially sceptical about The Business Channel, run as a joint venture between a new company, BMH Communications, and BBC Select, the subscription television arm of the Corporation. BMH was set up by Bryan Hall, the film producer who believes that eventually it could be broadcasting up to 250 hours a year on both BBC 1 and BBC 2 between 2am and 6am. 'I think we have all warmed to the idea as we began to think what the pluses are in communicating with both shareholders and staff,' said Preston. The half-hour programme will cost Scottish Power Pounds 30,000, not including production costs, but for that they will be able to show an eight-minute corporate video as well as the highlights of the meeting all over the UK, albeit it an unearthly hour. Preston is determined that the programme will be 'a fair representation of what takes place. Otherwise there is no point in it'. If there is a riot at the agm in Glasgow that will be shown too. The programme will be listed in both the Radio Times and TV Times but Scottish Power will also publicise its experiment in corporate communications to try to make sure as many shareholders set their video recorders as possible. BMH says it is talking to a number of large companies about using the new channel. Under the agreement with the BBC, it is possible to broadcast any valid public meeting whether annual or extraordinary or part of a campaign to fight-off a predator. Straight advertising of products is not allowed but a meeting to launch a new range of products or fashions to buyers could be broadcast on The Business Channel using BBC transmitters. Preston views his move into national television very much as an experiment and will be watching carefully to see what kind of audience and reaction he gets to Scottish Power: The AGM. Before he hands out another Pounds 30,000, the Scottish Power chief executive will want to be sure the message was spread a bit more widely than at his first agm last year when the company catered for an audience of 6,000 and actually got 600.</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks mirror fall in bond market Wall Street US blue-chip stocks dipped yesterday after the bond market failed to sustain an early move upwards, but secondary indices improved, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 3.86 lower at 3,648.68, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 1.10 to 447.63 in moderately active trading. However, the American SE composite gained 2.18 to 433.31, and the Nasdaq composite added 3.82 to 722.56. Stocks opened on a positive note, riding on momentum carried over from the previous session's powerful rally. Early on, bonds were holding steady and the flood of corporate results buffeting the market over the week slowed considerably. With no economic news to influence sentiment, Treasuries began to ebb by mid-morning, after the market tested resistance levels and failed to break through. President Bill Clinton's appointment of Mr Alan Binder and Ms Janet Yellen to fill two vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board was widely expected and had little impact, even though there was some concern that they would dilute its vigilance in fighting inflation. Stocks mirrored the modest slump in bonds. Near midday, however, they moved closer to their opening values in a convictionless updrift, briefly crossing into positive territory before slipping again in the final hour. Cyclical stocks were mixed, with International Paper down Dollars 1 at Dollars 61 and 3M off Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 47 3/8 . Alcoa, up Dollars 1 at Dollars 67 3/4 , helped compensate for their losses. Elsewhere, Sears gave back Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 46 1/2 after gaining ground on an encouraging earnings report the previous session. There were a few results out yesterday to inspire activity. Mobil gained Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 78 3/8 . Its estimated first-quarter net income of Dollars 1.31 a share, against Dollars 1.19 a year ago, beat expectations. Texaco was Dollars 1 1/8 higher at Dollars 65. Kellogg was well ahead of analysts' estimates, posting net income of 81 cents, against a consensus forecast of 76 cents. But the share price flagged Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 51 1/2 in spite of an upgrading by NatWest Securities. In the computer sector, Unisys dropped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 11 5/8 after disclosing that its worldwide orders were down in the last quarter. On the Nasdaq, biotechnology stocks improved after Amgen, the sector's bellwether, told analysts that its 1994 earnings projections were too conservative. The issue jumped Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 42, while Chiron climbed Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 59 5/8 and Biogen added Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 35 3/4. Canada Toronto stocks ended steady in moderate trading. The TSE 300 composite index slipped just 0.06 to 4,167.16 for a loss of about 73 on the week. Advances led declines 417 to 389 and volume fell to 52.6m from 70.1m yesterday. Trading value was CDollars 609.3m compared with CDollars 859.0m. Eight of the 14 stocks groups rose and one was unchanged. Energy stocks gained 1.48 per cent, consumer products, industrial products and mining also rose, and banking and gold stocks fell 1 per cent and 1.75 per cent respectively. Brazil Sao Paulo shares jumped 10.6 per cent in moderate trading, boosted by a technically driven buying spree on blue chips after prices dropped for seven sessions in a row. The Bovespa index closed 1,365 higher at 14,203 on turnover of Crz264.1bn.</p>

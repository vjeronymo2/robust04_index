			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fibre-Guided Spy Plane Flies 20 Km"] </F>   [Text] Aerospatiale and Sogerma-Socea have developed a  remotely piloted vehicle (RPV) called Pirat (Pirate), which both  sends and receives data through a fibre optic cable. It flies  up to 20 km from the operator.    The cable controlling the 2 m long RPV has been developed to  resist the stresses forced on it by erratic movements. The  aircraft itself weighs 20 kg and it is able to carry a payload  of up to 30 kg, such as a TV camera.    Optical transmission of the collected data also means there  is no "signature" so the data can be neither jammed nor  intercepted, the developers claim.    Originally developed for "intelligence gathering in theatres  of operation" the Pirat has been adapted to civilian projects  such as security patrolling of inaccessible locations or  industrial inspection.    The relatively cheap fibre link is intended to be an  expendable item. It may be detached before the plane returns.  Different recording devices may be carried by the Pirat's  modular fuselage.</p>

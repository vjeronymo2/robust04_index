			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Firmer metals prices forecast A TIGHTENING supply/demand balance and the spread of economic recovery in Europe and Japan are likely to lead to firmer base metals prices across the board next year, although the current weakness may be extended in the fourth quarter of 1992, according to Rudolf Wolff, the London metals trader. In a special report published yesterday, entitled The Outlook for Base Metals in 1993, Wolff notes that, 'although we expect increased growth in metal consumption, the metal industry is at the moment overshadowed by the build up in stocks'. It suggests, however, that the apparent bottoming out of the markets in early 1992 indicates that 'there are organisations prepared to buy and hold metals at these relatively low prices'. For copper, the report estimates that western world supply will fall short of consumption by 13,000 tonnes this year, following a 191,000-tonne surplus in 1991. Next year it forecasts that the supply deficit will grow to about 163,000 tonnes. It expects the three months delivery price to average Dollars 2,550 a tonne in 1993, up from an estimated Dollars 2,350 this year. A more modest recovery is expected for aluminium prices with the three months price average climbing to Dollars 1,400 a tonne in 1993 from Dollars 1,320 in 1992. 'The increasing oversupply in the (aluminium) market and the realisation that the West is likely to have to continue to absorb CIS exports, suggests that further production cutbacks are inevitable,' Wolff says. 'For this reason the potential for prices to sustain a downward move looks limited.' The report says prospects for consumption are healthy. 'Once supply is reined in and stocks show signs of falling, the aluminium market should be able to focus on the encouraging consumption prospects.' Wolff suggests that the zinc market's recovery in the first half of this year 'may well have anticipated stronger economic recovery,' so 'prices may now spend further time consolidating/correcting recent gains'. Nevertheless the report sees the zinc price averaging Dollars 1,400 a tonne in 1993, up Dollars 125 from the expected 1992 average. The lead price average is forecast to rise by Pounds 50 to Pounds 380 a tonne in 1993, while nickel's is put at Dollars 8,000 a tonne, up from Dollars 7,350, and tin's at Dollars 7,000 a tonne, up from Dollars 6,200.</p>

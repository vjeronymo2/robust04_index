			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Futures exchanges face clampdown China yesterday clamped down on the country's futures exchanges as part of continuing efforts to toughen regulation of chaotic financial markets. The Securities Commission, a regulatory arm of the State Council, China's cabinet, is expected to limit severely the number of exchanges after reviewing their licences. Some 40 futures exchanges dealing in commodities and currencies had mushroommed in China's cities since last year and were in effect operating beyond the control of the hard-pressed regulatory authorities in Beijing. The People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, reported at the weekend that speculation on international futures markets through local brokerages had led to huge foreign exchange losses. The China Securities News published State Council directives calling for a 'strict halt to the blind development of the futures markets'. These directives placed a ban on dealing on overseas markets and also required that existing positions be unwound. In an editorial, the Securities News said hundreds of millions of dollars had flowed out of China through futures trading. Many of China's so-called futures markets will, after the Securities Commission review of their activities, be designated wholesale markets and stopped from futures dealing.</p>

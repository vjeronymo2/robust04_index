			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: UK's turmoil weakens pound STERLING fell close to a three-year low against the US dollar yesterday as Britain's growing political uncertainty turned the pound into a 'sell' against most of the major currencies, writes James Blitz. Now that Germany appears in the grips of an economic recession, the market is starting to price in a cut in German interest rates and the pound may show less volatility against the D-Mark in the next few months than it has done in the period since Black Wednesday. Yesterday, the pound fell two pfennigs against the D-Mark to close at DM2.4225. But the biggest moves this week have been against the US dollar, which looks set to rise against all European currencies as German and US interest rates converge. Yesterday the pound dropped to Dollars 1.5640 against the dollar, later closing at Dollars 1.5790. It was down nearly a cent on the day, and nearly 7 cents so far this week. Sterling is mainly being weakened by the continuing turmoil in British politics, in particular Mr John Major's threat to call a general election if the government's attempt to ratify the Maastricht treaty is defeated in the House of Commons. Rumours that UK interest rates will be cut by another two percentage points also caused a sharp slump in sterling in Tokyo on Tuesday. The quarterly industrial trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry, predicting a continuation of the UK's recession, was the last straw for investors yesterday. Economists in the City of London are coming up with grim prognoses for sterling exchange rates. Mr Ian Beauchamp, chief economist at Hambros Bank in London, says that DM2.30 and Dollars 1.40 could well be the rates for sterling at the end of this year. There is a strong consensus among technical analysts that the fall through Dollars 1.60 on Monday was a key point on the chart, and that the pound could be heading as low as Dollars 1.20 in 1993. Otherwise, investors concentrated yesterday on whether the dollar could break through DM1.55 against the D-Mark on the upside. It failed to, despite indications that the convergence in US and German rates is a likely prospect. The dollar's first charge at DM1.55 came after Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, said that the margin between the Bundesbank's Lombard and Discount rates left room for manoeuvre. Traders felt that there could be room for an easing in the Lombard rate, perhaps at tomorrow's council meeting. The second dollar surge was provoked by the advanced third quarter GDP figures in the US, which came in much better than expected at 2.7 per cent. Forecasts had been for a 1.6 per cent gain. The dollar peaked at DM1.5455 against the D-Mark but closed at DM1.5340, down nearly  1/2 a pfennig on the day.</p>

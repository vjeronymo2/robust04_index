			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The orthodox communist government of the Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] has  once again signed cooperation accords with the Cuban Government.  Angolan circles have interpreted the move as a return to the  days of the Russian-Cuban domination with dangerous consequences  for Angola and its negotiating process. The cooperation accords  were signed in Luanda yesterday by Venancio de Moura and Roberto  Robaina, Fidel Castro's envoy and foreign affairs minister of  the island of tobacco. Roberto Robaina carried a message from  Fidel Castro which says Cuba is interested in sending occupation  troops in exchange for Angolan crude. The National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola will never tolerate this  because it violates the New York Accord signed by Cuba, South  Africa, and Namibia. The accord resulted in Namibia's  independence and the withdrawal of 60,000 Cubans from Angola.    Asked to comment on yesterday's accord, a senior Armed  Forces  for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] official said Cuba misses  the profits it earned through the war it waged in Angola, but it  should be reminded that the days of empires are over.    Yesterday Western diplomats were cited by Johannesburg's  Channel Africa as fearing the resumption of Angolan-Cuban  relations could endanger the Lusaka talks.    After having failed to recruit mercenaries of various  nationalities, the Luanda regime has opted for a return of the  invading Cuban forces which plunged the country into chaos over  the 16 years of their presence in Angola. There is nothing more  clear about Eduardo dos Santos' shady deals with Fidel Castro  than the irony of the Angola-Cuba commercial relations which are  nothing but military relations. The presence of Cubans in the  ranks of the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola  [FAPLA] is a fact in Cunene and Huila Provinces. Americo  Paulino, our correspondent in the region, has the details:    Over 10 trucks crossed the Namibian-Angolan border between  12  and 13 January 1994, carrying a Cuban contingent. The trucks  headed to N'Giva. Part of the Cuban contingent will be deployed  in Huila to beef up FAPLA units (?stationed) along the  Lubango-Cacula-Quilenges- Caluquembe axis. Other members of the  Cuban contingent will be sent to Cuvelai to reinforce FAPLA  units in the Jamba-(Catuca) region to occupy the Kuvango  District and then head to Huambo.    FALA's Operational Command for the independent Cunene region  has questioned the remarks made by Alioune Blondin Beye, UN  special representative in Angola, at a news conference. UNITA  has a lot of respect for Beye who said Mr. Sam Nujoma, chairman  of the South-West African People's Organization and president of  the Republic of Namibia, has contributed greatly to the Angolan  peace process. The question is: How can Namibia contribute to  peace if that country is used as a springboard for foreign  (?aggression)?    FALA forces are aware of the MPLA-PT's Machievalian  maneuvers  to deceive the Angolan and international communities with its  willingness to negotiate while Cubans enter Angola through  Namibia.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT  </P> <P> The Scene: The West Coast premiere Tuesday night of "Heavy Petting" at the  Director's Guild of America. The documentary intercuts clips of celebrities  talking about their adolescent sexual experiences with scenes from real sex  education, venereal disease and instructional films of the 1950s. A reception  before the film benefited the International Documentary Foundation and was  hosted by radio personality Dr. Demento.  </P> <P> The Buzz: Why, guests wondered, would anyone agree to discuss their teen sexual  experiences on camera? Director Obie Benz explained: "A lot of people were  nervous, and for good reason. But we interviewed 40 people, and got 30 hours of  film. This is really all very tame stuff. I'm saving the rest of the footage in  case there's a sequel -- which I'll call 'Heavier Petting.' "  </P> <P> Who was there: Lots of vocal groups and singers from the '50s and '60s,  including Richard Barry ("Louie Louie"); Jan, of Jan and Dean; Hank Ballard, of  the Midnighters; Dick and Dee Dee; the Tokens ("The Lion Sleeps Tonight"); Tina  Louise, of "Gilligan's Island"; and film star Kelly Lynch.  </P> <P> Entertainment: The Del Rubio Triplets, the fantastic have-guitar-will-travel  sister act from San Pedro, sang "Chain of Fools" and "These Boots Are Made for  Walking."  </P> <P> The Food: Caterers in '50s outfits sweated over a burger grill, a chili dog  cart, bins of French fries bubbling in grease and bottles of flavored seltzer  cooling in metal tubs of ice. For dessert, there were ice cream sandwiches,  Drumsticks and candy baked beans.  </P> <P> Dress code: Some guests actually dug out poodle skirts and leather jackets for  the occasion, but most of the crowd seemed content to wear the usual screening  attire: jackets and jeans.  </P> <P> Overheard: "I'm one of Sandra Bernhard's managers, and I need to find the  director," announced one extremely important person.  </P> <P> Triumphs: The Del Rubio Triplets' version of "Chain of Fools" brought down the  house. Guests also seemed impressed with the food, particularly the authentic  childhood taste of the hamburgers, which didn't have any California touches  like goat cheese or bean sprouts.  </P> <P> Glitches: Considering that the movie featured notables like William Burroughs,  David Byrne, Laurie Anderson, and Allen Ginsberg, it would have been nice to  see some of them at the party.

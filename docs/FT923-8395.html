			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Taped evidence of SA massacre lost THIRTEEN hours of tape recording of police radio calls during the afternoon and night of the June 17 Boipatong massacre were accidentally erased, a senior police officer told a judicial commission yesterday. Maj Chris Davidson, the police officer investigating allegations of security force complicity in the massacre of 42 township residents, said that all calls to the regional internal stability unit between 2pm on June 17 and 3am the next day had been accidentally erased by the person on duty. Maj Davidson was testifying before the Goldstone commission of inquiry into political violence, sitting in Vereeniging, near Johannesburg. Mr Justice Goldstone ordered that the tapes be submitted to the commission. Witnesses from the township have alleged that armoured patrol cars had dropped off attackers from Boipatong's Kwamadala hostel and had escorted them back to the hostel after the massacre in which 42 people were killed. Maj Davidson said that his investigation left him satisfied that the security forces were not implicated. South African government ministers were due to meet a delegation from the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) at a Johannesburg hotel last night. The meeting, the second this year, is expected to include discussion of possible PAC participation in constitutional talks, currently suspended but expected to resume soon. The PAC has refused to join the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the forum for negotiations, insisting that talks should take place outside South Africa, under neutral chairmanship.</p>

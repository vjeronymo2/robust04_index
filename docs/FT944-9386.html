			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Fed sees growth flying too fast for comfort: Why interest rates have risen by  3/4 of a percentage point Members of the Federal Reserve's policy-setting Open Markets Committee had probably made up their minds long before they met yesterday that they needed to raise interest rates sharply to cool down the economy. But if they had any last-minute doubts, statistics on retail sales and industrial production published just as they sat down in Washington offered more evidence of 'persistent strength in economic activity and high and rising levels of resource utilisation'. This underlined their belief in the need to raise interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point, and not the half point the financial markets had assumed. Retail sales jumped by 1.1 per cent in October and by 7.5 per cent over the last year, led by sectors sensitive to higher interest rates such as cars, furniture and building materials. Industrial production rose 0.7 per cent to stand 6.7 per cent higher than a year ago. Manufacturing production rose 0.9 per cent in October and 7.8 per cent over the last year. These latest statistics provide further evidence that even though the US economy is now in its third year of recovery from recession, it is still barely slowing from a pace that, for a fully industrialised country, can be counted as torrid. If the 6.3 per cent annualised rate of gross domestic product growth recorded in the fourth quarter of 1993 was a freak on the high side, the 3.3 per cent rate of the first quarter of this year was abnormally low, partly because of the California earthquake. Growth at a 4.1 per cent rate in the second quarter and at 3.4 per cent in the third quarter - and accelerating again in the fourth quarter, according to many Wall Street economists - remains much faster than the roughly 2.5 per cent pace the Fed would be comfortable with as sustainable without giving way to a surge in inflation. Although there have been some recent signs of slowdown, by most measures the economy is humming along at very close to full capacity. The number of payroll jobs has risen by 2.6m in the first 10 months of this year, bringing unemployment down to 5.8 per cent last month, lower than the point at which most economists estimate that labour shortages start to make themselves felt in the shape of higher wage demands. Job creation has been even stronger than measured by the Labour Department's statistics. A statistical adjustment added another 760,000 new jobs to the figures for last March. Interpretation of the unemployment statistics is rendered more hazardous because of a radical change introduced earlier this year in the way the data are collected. Nevertheless, anecdotal signs of labour market pressures are showing up even though aggregate numbers show wage inflation still to be well under control. Yesterday's industrial production data, too, showed tightness in manufacturing industry. The overall industrial capacity utilisation rate of 84.9 per cent in October is the highest recorded since the Fed revised its statistical series in 1982, topping the rate of 84.8 per cent recorded at the very peak of the last business cycle. A utilisation rate of 84.6 per cent for manufacturing industry is only just below the last cyclical peak of 85.1 per cent. These statistics are problematic, for it is uncertain how much capacity has expanded as a result of the heavy corporate investment of the last two years. Yet here, too, signs of capacity constraints are showing up. Purchasing managers report longer delivery times from suppliers, and manufacturers are increasingly turning overseas for supplies, especially for steel. Indeed, the US trade deficit - September's figure is to be announced on Friday and is expected to be unrepentantly large - can be read on one level as confirmation that US demand is growing faster than the domestic economy can supply. With the world's other major economies pulling out of their own recessions, their eagerness to export may diminish, and with it the brake they put on US manufacturers' ability to raise prices. If these indicators all point to inflationary pressures, the one place where inflation is scarcely showing its face is in the price indices. The consumer price index remains resolutely well-behaved: today's announcement of the October index is expected by Wall Street economists to show an increase of around 0.2 per cent from September, which would lower the year on year rate to around 2.8 per cent. Warning lights can be found in segments of the producer price data but the overall index remains resolutely well behaved. But the Fed wants - and the financial markets want the Fed to want - to control inflation before it shows its face. The difficult judgment is whether the Fed's five interest rate increases between February and August, together with yesterday's increase, have tightened monetary policy enough to chill the economy. The response to the Fed's actions comes with 'long and variable lags,' as economists like to put it. In the housing sector, for example, the immediate response to higher interest rates may be a rush of buyers, anxious not to miss the boat before rates move higher yet. And Fed governors have been scolding banks for taking some of the sting out of their efforts to raise interest rates by relaxing their own credit terms. They must now hope their decision to raise interest rates by  3/4 of a point  -the largest adjustment the Fed has made in interest rates since 1980, which banks charge each other on overnight balances held at the Fed - will not jam the brakes on the economy so hard that it plunges into recession.</p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES: AN ART FORM BASED ON DOMINO THEORY  </P> <P> He calls himself a "Domineer." Right now, he's a New Jersey lifeguard, in  training for his 75th marathon. Running is his real love. This week, though,  he'll assume his other persona for an appearance in Torrance's Del Amo Fashion  Center. What he'll be doing there is what's been paying the freight for a  decade: setting up rows of dominoes and then knocking 'em down. "Hey," he says,  "it's a living."  </P> <P> He's Bobby Speca, 32, and you may have seen him on Carson or "That's  Incredible" or in the Guinness Book of World Records. Once he set in motion a  spectacular chain reaction of exactly 111,111 dominoes, falling not just in a  row but up ramps and around corners and down elevators and off mini-high dives  . . . "The setup took two weeks," he says, "and the topple took 32 minutes.  I've subsequently lost the record -- some fellow in West Germany has done  something like 280,000 -- but I'm still the patriarch of the art, and the only  guy who makes a living out of it."  </P> <P> For commercial enterprises, Speca charges 15 cents per domino, plus expenses.  For the Del Amo opening of STOR, a furniture outlet, he'll publicly set up  11,111 dominoes Friday; knock them down Saturday from 11 a.m. to precisely  11:03; conduct a workshop from noon to 1; judge a toppling contest for a while,  and be home in time for a Sunday run.  </P> <P> Since he was inspired by a high school math teacher, Speca has expanded his  arcane art to include configurations with Darryl Dawkins-like titles: the "DNA  Double Helix," "Delayed Dynamic Dozen," "Bahama Tom Inverted Cascade Slide for  Life" -- all, of course, with tongue in cheek, bank statement in black and the  secure knowledge that Billy Crystal has asked him for his autograph.  </P> <P> A down-to-Earth dreamer with Mensa credentials and degrees from Penn in  astronomy and physics, Speca has toppled outsized dominoes underwater and  speculates on what would happen in outer space ("You'd have to magnetize the  bottoms . . . ").  </P> <P> Mainly, he is one of those rare people who love what they're doing. "If I look  back and think, 'Gee, all I did was the Iron Man Triathlon 30 times and a  couple hundred marathons, and throughly enjoy life,' will I feel guilty? Nah."  </P> <P> Serious Episodes With Comedy  </P> <P> The idea occurred to television writer Ruth Bennett when she was "back in the  Midwest, reading in the papers about a case in Detroit, and another in Ohio  where they actually burned down a house." Bennett -- longtime producer and  writer of "Family Ties" who left to do her own show, "Duet" -- had wanted to  write one more script for "Ties" before it went off the air, "and I wanted it  to be something with some weight to it."  </P> <P> It turned out to be a rousing two-parter dealing with the problems faced by a  black family moving into the Keatons' all-white neighborhood, a move contested  not only by overt racists but by "well-meaning" whites placing property values  over human worth. It was tricky but it worked, so well that it garnered for  Bennett the first Blanche Rosloff Award, presented this month by the Westside  Housing Council.  </P> <P> "It's not the sort of thing that happens in every neighborhood," Bennett  concedes, "but it's still happening enough to keep the council busy in West  L.A. As a matter of fact, they're fighting three cases right now."  </P> <P> Dealing with tough issues through comedy -- thus assuring a wide audience -- is  "a difficult art," says Bennett, who's also done a piece on alcoholism for  "Ties," another on illiteracy for "Duet." "It's a real balancing act. You have  to make sure that you don't belittle your subject, that you don't poke fun in  the wrong places." For Bennett, it works just fine.  </P> <P> Mourning Death of a Salesman  </P> <P> Susan Tanner called. Dad had died. Dad was Harry. Harry Tanner. Oldest -- and  arguably oddest -- car salesman in America. Maybe the world.  </P> <P> Harry would have been 89 this week. In April, he was Salesman of the Month at  Claude Short Dodge in Santa Monica. He had worked through the middle of May,  when the cancer he had licked came back to get him. "It was almost as if he'd  rather die than not work," said Susan. "He had a horror of being a useless,  crotchety old man in robe and slippers on the front porch."  </P> <P> Even besides his appetite for literature, Harry was different, no doubt about  it. "An oddity," Susan called him. "Selling cars is hardly one of the world's  most revered professions, but Harry was that rare kind of salesman whom people  trusted. He never cheated anybody. He always tried to give a good deal to  people who wouldn't ordinarily have an edge in the economic system -- the  young, the ethnic minorities."  </P> <P> Naturally, given his bent for the fair shake, Harry moved about some. "He  probably sold everything ever made in his lifetime," said Susan. "He believed  strongly in a cooperative society, and he was fired once for having copies of  the (anti-nuclear) Stockholm Peace Petition in the trunk of his car. So he  opened his own dealership, in Westwood. He'd get involved with all those  student artists who couldn't pay their bills, and he'd accept a trade. His  house is still filled with beautiful paintings, swapped for repair jobs."  </P> <P> He loved people, said his daughter, loved to schmooze, but "he couldn't stand  people who couldn't make up their minds. In '88, he got my husband and I what  he called a 'good deal' on a new Colt. I didn't like the color. I asked him  could we wait and think about it. He said, 'The deal's good for today . . . ' "  </P> <P> Along with a spotless rep, Harry left Susan three things: "He taught me to  respect the working class and library books; to fight for a better world, and  never to cross a picket line. He was quite a man." DICK RORABACK  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PLANNING HEAD WILL REPORT ON MANAGEMENT OF ECOLOGICAL AREA  </P> <P> Responding to a request from Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, the  county's top planning official said Tuesday he will prepare a report on the  county's 61 Significant Ecological Areas (SEAs), which were designated for  protection by the county's 1980 General Plan.  </P> <P> In asking for the report, Antonovich criticized a lengthy article in Sunday's  Los Angeles Times on neglect of the SEAs, which were chosen for their value as  wildlife habitat or as strongholds for threatened plants and animals.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Planning Director James Hartl agreed to report back to the  Board of Supervisors on the county's management of the SEAs. Pam Holt, a  section head with the Department of Regional Planning, said later that the  report will probably be submitted in two weeks.  </P> <P> Antonovich attacked the "very one-sided, inaccurate story" on the SEAs, which  are mainly in private ownership.  </P> <P> Under questioning from Antonovich, Hartl said 38 of the SEAs are in  unincorporated areas, while the other 23 are within city boundaries. Antonovich  asked if this meant the latter group of SEAs were not subject to county  land-use regulations.  </P> <P> "That's correct, supervisor," Hartl said.  </P> <P> Antonovich also said the story should have mentioned that a large development  planned for a SEA in Agoura was recently rejected by the county on the advice  of a panel that advises the county on protection of the areas.  </P> <P> The article said SEAs have been nibbled by development and are now under  enormous pressure from proposed housing and commercial projects, roads and even  garbage dumps.  </P> <P> The article reported that supervisors twice declined to fund a proposed study  on the condition of the SEAs, and did not follow through on a commitment to  seek funds to buy threatened SEAs.  </P> <P> Under questioning by Antonovich, Hartl agreed with him that the General Plan  "does not require" the county to buy SEAs.  </P></p>

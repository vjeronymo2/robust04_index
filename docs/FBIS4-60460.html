			<p>BFN     [Text] Israel's abduction of Mustafa al-Dirani continues to  provoke condemnation and denunciation.    Anwar al-Khalil, minister of state for Chamber of Deputies  affairs, asked about the U.S. stance on the kidnapping  operation. He said the United States might, intentionally or  otherwise, have paved the way for Israel to pursue its terrorist  policy, first, by ignoring Lebanon on its shuttle tour and  second, by including Syria on the list of terrorist states. He  stressed that the kidnapping will increase Lebanon's  determination to adhere to the resistance as one of the most  legitimate methods to liberate the land.    The Loyalty to the Resistance Bloc [Hizballah parliamentary  bloc] has stressed that the kidnapping represented overt  defiance and provocation. It called for the highest degree of  alertness and vigilance.    The act of piracy was also denounced by Deputy Muhammad  Baydun, the Amal Movement, the Progressive Socialist Party, and  the Syrian Social Nationalist Party.</p>

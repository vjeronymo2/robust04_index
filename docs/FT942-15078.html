			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Arts: A rare Rondine - Richard Fairman enjoys Opera North's new production A successful opera company has to keep hitting the top notes if it wants to stay ahead of its rivals. At its annual press conference Opera North has announced another imaginative programme for the 1994-5 season while busying itself this month with the first major British production of Puccini's neglected operetta, La rondine. The other mature operas by Puccini are mostly familiar favourites. This is the one that flew the nest. The original commission for an operetta never really suited Puccini and it took several changes of plan before he settled on a light opera, sung all the way through, to a plot so like a cross between The Merry Widow and La traviata that early audiences must have expected they could hum the tunes in advance. Despite the work's initial success Puccini remained unhappy with it and made a third and final revision unperformed since the war. Opera North - adventurous as always - decided this was the version to do. In essence, the change is that the leading lady no longer rejects the man she loves, but instead is rejected by him. Puccini niftily turns most of the same music to the opposite purpose; it is the psychological reversal that is significant. Magda, the swallow of the title, is a courtesan, still young at heart and attractive. Although she gets to sing the opera's famous number there is insufficient scope in the role for the character to take flight. Helen Field gave her a joie de vivre, a winning naturalness, that helped put flesh on Puccini's bones. Although Opera North is not flush with Italianate voices, Tito Beltran as Ruggero, chubby-cheeked, young as a puppy, has a plausible Italian-sounding tenor in the making. Anna Maria Panzarella and Peter Bronder lack that kind of vocal ring, but were appealing enough as the secondary couple. Under the conductor David Lloyd-Jones the opera swept the emotions along. La rondine may be a second-rate score, but it was put together by a first-rate craftsman. A touch of flair in the production tipped the balance: this was a splendid evening overall. Francesca Zambello has a sure feel for an opera's pacing and atmosphere. Never mind that Bruno Schwengl's designs ranged from handsome, gas-lit, black-velvet Second Empire chic in the first act to white modern cleanliness in the third. Opera North made La rondine work. Among next season's high points should be new productions of Chabrier's Le Roi malgre lui, Verdi's Oberto with John Tomlinson and Walton's Troilus and Cressida, together with Il trovatore and Pelleas et Melisande. The company will also give the premiere of H. K. Gruber's Gloria von Jaxtberg in a co-production with the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival and has announced Alec Roth in a new post as Composer in Association. The momentum in Leeds shows no sign of slackening. La rondine in repertory at the Grand Theatre, Leeds, until April 29, then on tour.</p>

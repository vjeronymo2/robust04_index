The  ambassador gave a detailed account of the results of the meeting  between the Ukrainian, U.S., and Russian presidents in Moscow  and the contents of the declaration they signed. It was  emphasized that the accords, reached as the result of the  meeting, on providing Ukraine with security guarantees, as well  as financial and technological assistance for eliminating  nuclear weapons and compensation for uranium contained in  nuclear warheads were creating the necessary conditions for  gradual elimination of the nuclear weapons deployed on Ukrainian  soil and for Ukraine to attain nonnuclear status. It said that  the accords, to a considerable degree, were resolving the  problems that caused the Ukrainian Supreme Council to have  reservations about ratifying the START I treaty and the Lisbon  protocol.    The hope was expressed that, as a nuclear power and  permanent  member of the UN Security Council, China would play an active  part in settling the issue of nuclear disarmament in Ukraine  and, in particular, of providing Ukraine with security  guarantees and financial assistance in order to eliminate the  nuclear weapons deployed on its territory.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Promise by Labour on 'green rights' A LABOUR government would give employees 'green rights' in the workplace, Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, has told trade unionists. The rights would include access to information and time off for training in environmental matters. The pledge comes as unions, employers and the government prepare to discuss the environment at a National Economic Development Council meeting next month. The Trades Union Congress will present proposals for a full range of environmental rights for unions. The proposals are likely to be strongly opposed by the Confederation of British Industry, which favours a voluntary approach. Employees should have access to information on environmental hazards and the right to seek independent advice, Mr Gould told a union-organised conference on the environment. He said: 'Trade union representatives should have the right for time off to receive training in environmental matters. They should have the right to call in independent watchdogs such as the Environmental Protection Executive (the new agency proposed by Labour) if they are unhappy about a plant or process. Whistle-blowers should not be victimised.' Mr Gould also backed a National Communication Union proposal for an environmental equivalent of the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health regulations. The TUC will put forward its own 'green rights' plan at the NEDC meeting on May 20. It is due to be attended by Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary. The proposals conform broadly with Labour's but add the right to negotiate changes in production and work organisation and the right 'without recrimination' to refuse to undertake work with potentially harmful environmental effects.</p>

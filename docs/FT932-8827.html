			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: The cost of clean water Last week Anglian drinkers apparently voted to pay more for better quality water out of the tap. Such an improbable result probably owes something to concern about the level of agricultural nitrates sluicing through local rivers. Similar consultation exercises by other water companies have shown more scepticism from consumers about the costs of environmental improvements. The companies have used this market research as a sighting shot for the 1994 review of water charges. Those shots - some aiming for 15 per cent real price rises - are certainly too high. Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, may think that real increases much above 2 per cent are excessive. Capital programmes are thus unlikely to be the gold-plated versions which are at the optimistic end of the water companies' suggestions. Post-1995 price caps will vary with each company's need for capital expenditure. Those with looser caps like Anglian will see turnover grow and, if costs are controlled, profits will also rise. But the higher capital expenditure will also push up interest costs substantially. Anglian estimates that on its central assumptions gearing will peak at 80 per cent in 1998, with interest cover down to three times. It also has dividend cover of 2.7 times earnings against the sector average of 3.2 times. At the other end of the rainbow Welsh Water may well have its price rises limited to the rate of inflation. That implies low turnover growth, but interest charges will be correspondingly modest and dividend cover is 4.4 times. The other problem for the high-spending companies is that Mr Byatt may be concerned about the divergence in bills between different areas of the country. Increasing pressure on capital intensive companies make rights issues for the most stretched a distinct cloud on the horizon.</p>

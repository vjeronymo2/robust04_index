			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Opler's longhorn moth is a member of the longhorn moth family, the Adelidae (Davis 1987, Powell 1969). It is a small, dark bronze colored, day flying moth with long antennae. The adults have a wingspan ranging from approximately 9 to 14 millimeters. Opler's longhorn moth is recorded from 18 sites extending along the west side of the San Francisco Bay from 5 miles southeast of Nicasio in Marin County south to the Gilroy area of Santa Clara County and from the Oakland area on the inner Coast Ranges. A single population is known from central Santa Cruz County. Excepting the Santa Cruz County locality that consists of a grassland habitat derived from marine sand deposits, Opler's longhorn moth is restricted to sites within serpentine grassland. The extent of survey efforts that have been conducted in suitable habitat in the San Francisco Bay area is unclear. At least 13 areas with serpentine soils within the range of Opler's longhorn moth cover more than 40 acres each (McCarten 1986, 1987). The larvae of Opler's longhorn moth feeds on  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Platystemon californicus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (cream cups), a widespread annual plant. In contrast to other invertebrate groups, such as butterflies and tiger beetles, whose biology, ecology, and biogeography are well known, few amateur or professional entomologists collect or study adelid moths and other microlepidoptera. Though urban development threaten a portion of the species' range of Opler's longhorn moth, additional status information (e.g., rangewide surveys) are needed prior to proposing the species. Moreover, no new information was received or available to the Service beyond that used to assign this species to category 2. As a result, the Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the present and future threats facing Opler's longhorn moth and determines that the petitioned action is not warranted at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 8, 1990, the Service received a petition from Dr. Dennis Murphy of the Stanford University Center for Conservation biology to list the Yontocket ringlet butterfly ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Coenonympha tullia yontocket <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) as a threatened or endangered species. The petitioner stated that the insect merits protection under the Act because it is known only from a single coastal dune locality in Del Norte County, California. The area is used for target shooting, off-road vehicles, garbage dumping, and camping, all potentially damaging activities to this population. Invasive exotic vegetation and potential housing development also likely imperiled the area. Based on this information, the Service issued a 90-day finding on November 1, 1991, which found that the petition presented substantial information indicating that the requested action may be warranted (55 FR 46801). A status review of the Yontocket ringlet butterfly was initiated at the same time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Yontocket ringlet butterfly was described by Porter and Mattoon (1989) from 76 specimens collected at several sites extending from Lake Earl to the mouth of the Smith River in Del Norte County, California. These sites likely represent a single population. The animal was found in dunes with coniferous lee slopes and grassy exposed slopes, and among dunes on slightly elevated ground around seasonally marshy sphagnum bogs. Sterling Mattoon ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1991) provided information regarding the range of the yontocket ringlet butterfly and presented data showing that the 11 known populations of this species range from Enderts Beach, 5 miles south of Crescent City, north along the coast to the mouth of the Pistol River, Curry County, Oregon. A population is known approximately 0.7 to 2.2 miles inland from the vicinity of the town of Carpenterville in Curry County. This substantially increases the number of populations and extends the range of the species approximately 22 miles north and 15 miles south of its previously known distribution. The type and degree of threats to these populations were not stated in the petition and other information available to the Service. In light of these data gaps, the Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the present and future threats facing the yontocket ringlet butterfly and determines that the petitioned action is not warranted at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 6, 1992, the Service received a petition from Drs. Dennis Murphy and Alan Launer of the Stanford University Center for Conservation Biology to list the unsilvered fritillary butterfly ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Speyeria adiaste adiaste <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) as an endangered or threatened species. The letter, dated December 31, 1991, was clearly identified as a petition and contained the names, signatures, institutional affiliation, address, and telephone number of the petitioners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petition stated that the unsilvered fritillary butterfly has been recorded from San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz counties (Sterling Mattoon, pers. comm., 1992; C.D. Nagano, unpub. obs.). This species is now found primarily in areas along the crest of the Santa Cruz Mountains or east of the crest in the northern and central areas of Santa Cruz County (Steiner 1990). The petitioners reported that recent colonies are known from four general areas in this region. The biology, ecology, and biogeography of the unsilvered fritillary is not well known. The foodplant of the larvae, violets ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Viola  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> sp.), is found in fern-dominated grassland glades or wetland areas. A large population occurs within Big Basin Redwood State Park in Santa Cruz County. The potential threats include urban development and suppression of fire. Lack of fire may allow succession to proceed and eliminate suitable foodplant and larval habitat. Although, the unsilvered fritillary butterfly may be declining, existing information is not available to estimate the extent or rate of changes in habitat or population levels. Further surveys are needed to adequately assess its distribution and population status. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner few data presented little else on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioners did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 3, 1993, the Service received a petition from David Weissman to list the Jacalitos Jerusalem cricket ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Stenopelmatus nigrocapitatus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), Berkeley ground cricket ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Neonemobius eurynotus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), Jacalitos shield-backed katydid ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ateloplus joaquin <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), splendid shield-backed katydid ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ateloplus splendidus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), Antioch shield-backed katydid ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Neduba extincta <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), San Bernardino Mountains grasshopper ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Trimerotropis bernardi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), Lompoc grasshopper ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Trimerotropis occulens <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), Santa Monica Mountains grasshopper ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Trimerotropis occidentaloides <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), Central Valley grasshopper ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conozoa hyalina <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and the Mexicali lubber grasshopper ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Spaniacris destricola <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) as endangered species. The letter, dated February 28, 1993, was clearly identified as a petition and contained the name, signature, address, and telephone number of the petitioner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Arts: Lust - Theatre After the spectacle of Sunset Boulevard, here is a return to a jollier, much more old-fashioned kind of musical. Not since Sir John Vanbrugh's The Relapse became Lock Up Your Daughters over 20 years ago can there have been such a successful putting of a restoration comedy to song. Lust is based on William Wycherley's The Country Wife and is every bit as lewd as the original, possibly in some cases even lewder. Far more than that, however, the show is huge fun from beginning to end. Lust is perhaps a slightly misleading title, for there is nothing remotely sinister about it. This lust is thoroughly healthy. The time is given as 1661. King Charles II has just been crowned, the characters throw off their puritan garb and the restoration is under way. So is the music which almost never stops. The borrowings by the Heather Brothers and the musical director, David Firman, are absolutely shameless, but glorious. There is a touch of Mozart, a bow to Gilbert and Sullivan, homage to Elvis and a recurrent fling with the tango. No attempt is made to present the music as a coherent whole, but it doesn't matter in the slightest. If it's a good song, put it in. Some of the songs in Lust are very good indeed. There is also a wonderful part in Horner. This is the character in Wycherley's play who pretends to have been castrated in order to increase his access to the ladies. Here he is played by Denis Lawson as a superbly handsome, romantic-looking Don Juan with long flowing locks and tremendous physical agility. Lawson can sing as well: notice his 'I Live for Love.' Yet this is not a pretentious show. In the era of the spectacular, it comes as a pleasant treat that the most extensive and perhaps the most expensive prop is simply a large four-poster bed. Lawson sings in it, swings on the horizontal bar and, of course, is caught in it. There is a marvellous vignette when hanging from the bar, his trousers just being removed by Lady Fidget, the couple is surprised by a potentially jealous husband. Almost with one bound, at least of the imagination, he is free. Some of the parts are an improvement on the original, notably Quack, the doctor who keeps up the pretence that Horner really has turned into a eunuch and carries the evidence to prove it. Played by Paul Leonard, this Quack is a servant to his master in the best Don Juan tradition. Apart from the lust, there is love. Helen Hobson's Alithea, sister to Pinchwife, the excessively jealous husband, has a fine romantic song in 'Come Tomorrow'. And there are jokes: a splendid number called 'China', which is not about China at all, neither the place nor the substance. The direction is by Bob Carlton and the Haymarket is just the right theatre for a piece that may seem modest in its aims and staging, but is vastly more enjoyable than most other musicals. Lust is a triumph of getting the basics right: acting, music and a good plot. Theatre Royal, Haymarket (071) 930 8800</p>

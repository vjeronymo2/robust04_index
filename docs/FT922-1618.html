			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / France (18): Momentum slackens - Nuclear energy takes account of the Greens SECURITY OF supply has been the core of successive French governments' energy policy for the past 20 years and is likely to go on being so. Short of its own oil, gas and coal, France was crippled by the first 1973 oil shock. One of the first actions of Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, on becoming president a year later, was to launch the most ambitious nuclear energy programme in western Europe, continued with little change over the past 11 years by his successor, President Francois Mitterrand. By the turn of this decade, up to 80 per cent of France's electricity was nuclear-generated, making France the most nuclear-dependent country in the world and the second biggest producer of nuclear electricity after the US. Since then, the proportion has dipped slightly, to 72 per cent last year, as some of the earliest power stations neared the end of their lives. Nuclear energy represents 37 per cent of overall energy consumption, still the highest of any western industrialised nation. Over the long term, Electricite de France (EdF), the monopoly power supply, wants to keep nuclear energy at around 75 per cent of electricity production, partly to keep a balance with other power sources such as oil and hydroelectricity but also because EdF's government owner needs to take account, more than ever before, of the rising influence of France's two ecology movements, the Verts and Generation Ecologie (GE). The ecologists do not deny that France needs secure energy supplies, but they do force the government to be extremely cautious over how the nuclear programme is to develop. The ecologists' problem, however, is that they are deeply split and they are both unsure whether they want to make an alliance with a mainstream party, let alone which one. Nowhere are the divisions between GE and the Verts deeper than on energy policy. GE, led by Mr Brice Lalonde, a former environment minister in the Socialist government, wants a moratorium on new nuclear plant - not too far out of line with government policy - and permanent closure of a controversial 1200 MW fast breeder reactor at Creys-Malville near Lyon. Mr Antoine Waechter, head of the Verts, wants all nuclear plants closed within 15 years, an idea dismissed by the government as outrageously impractical. Mr Waechter repeatedly refuses GE overtures for a merger, on the grounds that this would be selling out to the moderate establishment. The government's attitude to the ecologists is being tested as it agonises over the future of Superphenix, the fast breeder at Creys-Malville. The reactor, the world's most powerful of its type, was closed in July 1990 after repeated safety problems and the government has said it will decide, in the light of independent technical advice, on its future by July 3. In spite of France's determined reliance on its own nuclear energy, it remains even more dependent on oil than Britain or Germany, which have bigger coal and gas resources. This is why the government continues to keep a firm hold of the two state owned oil companies, Elf Aquitaine and Total, in spite of its recent privatisation programme. At both companies, the emphasis is on increasing reserves. Total is concentrating its sights on the Middle East for Total, where it is the largest western oil producer, while Elf has ambitions in Kazakhstan and Russia, where it recently become the first western oil company to sign production sharing deals.</p>

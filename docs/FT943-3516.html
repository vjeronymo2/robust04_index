			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Quebec business warns against splitting Mr Ghislain Dufour, head of the Quebec Patronat employers' organisation, with more than 400 member companies, yesterday offered to co-operate with Parti Quebecois leader Mr Jacques Parizeau, but urged him to focus on jobs, social problems, public finance and high taxes. 'We differ with the PQ on many issues and our offer of co-operation excludes independence,' he said. 'Mr Parizeau must end the constitutional uncertainty as soon as possible.' Quebec's business leaders largely kept out of the election campaign, while privately backing Mr Daniel Johnson's Liberals. They opposed Mr Parizeau's promises to the big unions, such as public service job security, his high-spending policies and commitment to separation. Now they are forming a detailed strategy to swing the expected referendum against independence . Many business leaders yesterday urged the new Quebec government to put the economy first and get the referendum over as soon as possible. Mr Peter White, chairman of the Canadian arm of Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger publishing empire, said: 'They must work on the recovery and competitiveness. The election results require them to put an honest question in a referendum within 10 months.' 'The PQ has a mandate to govern but not to lead Quebec into independence,' said Mr Michel Vennat, a lawyer-businessman and Counsel for Canadian Unity chairman. 'It must work with Ottawa and the other provinces and not isolate itself.' Mr John McCallum, the Royal Bank of Canada's chief economist, said the PQ must co-operate with Canada or Montreal's economy would suffer. Mr Robert Stewart, chairman of Scott Paper, with several mills, said it would be 'very serious' if the PQ assumed it had won a mandate for sovereignty. David Buchan reports from Paris: The French foreign ministry yesterday reacted to the Parti Quebecois election victory by restating its carefully, if inelegantly, worded policy of 'non-indifference and non-interference' towards relations between Canada and the majority francophone province. Determined never to repeat General de Gaulle's incendiary call in 1967 of 'Vive le Quebec Libre,' France has since tried to avoid being seen to take sides between the Canadian and Quebec governments. The foreign ministry spokesman said yesterday Paris 'has followed the elections with interest' but would not comment on the result. France, he said, had 'a special historical as well as cultural relationship' with Quebec, but at the same time intended to 'pursue the development of its excellent relations' with Canada, whose government is headed at the moment by a French Canadian, Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Quebec is not the only Canadian province to belong to La Francophonie, France's answer to the Commonwealth, which groups nearly 50 French-speaking states or regions. New Brunswick, which unlike Quebec is officially bilingual, also belongs.</p>

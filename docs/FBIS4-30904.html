			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 27 (CTK) -- An agreement to facilitate  customs clearance in the road, railway, and water transport  between the Czech Republic and Germany has still not been  concluded due to the German demand that Czech border communities  bear their pre-war Sudeten German names in the agreement as well  as the Czech ones, Miroslav Karnik from the Customs General  Directorate, confirmed to CTK today.    RUDE PRAVO, the left-orientated Czech daily, reported today  that the fact that the Germans did not want to recognize  agreements concluded between the former Czechoslovakia and East  Germany was another problem preventing an agreement from being  signed.    Once these things were clarified and the agreement is signed  it would be no problem for a Czech expert commission to agree  with the Germans on everything that should be done to simplify  customs clearance on the joint border, the paper wrote.    Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik said on Thursday [26 May]  that  the absence of the agreement was the main cause of the  kilometers- long lines of lorries forming daily at border  crossings. He described the German demand that Czech villages  also bear German names as a key obstacle hampering the  conclusion of the agreement.</p>

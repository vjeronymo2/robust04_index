			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bijeljina, 17 Jan (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic,  president of the republic of Srpska, stated in Bijeljina this  evening that the assembly of the republic of Srpska today had  adopted a decision to permit the exchange of UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] troops in Srebrenica with the same number of  Dutch soldiers armed with the same weapons, adding that this  operation could be carried out as early as tomorrow in  cooperation with the general staff of the army of the republic  of Srpska. Speaking about attempts to concoct reasons for  issuing threats to the Serbs, Karadzic added that, as regards  Tuzla, it was obvious that those who were advocating the opening  of the airport were trying to prolong the war, as this was yet  another way to help the Muslims obtain weapons.    There is no reason why all airports in Bosnia-Herzegovina  should not be opened, but not before a peace agreement has been  signed, because the airports would be abused for military  purposes, Karadzic said. Karadzic held a news conference after  the republic of Srpska assembly wound up its session today at  which it adopted a platform for tomorrow's round of negotiations  in Geneva. Details of the platform have not been disclosed.  Karadzic stressed that the Serbs had worked out options that  would be used to achieve their objectives, saying that he did  not expect any essential changes in the Muslim side's further  rejection of the peace plan. Karadzic recalled that the Muslims  were not forced to change anything; they were not under pressure  from the international community. Because all the threats were  directed towards the Serbs, the Muslims were encouraged to  continue the war. Karadzic said that the international  community was prolonging the war in Bosnia by maintaining  sanctions and issuing threats to the Serbs.    It is absolutely certain that the Muslims would accept peace  if the international community were to exert the same pressure  on all three sides and stop threatening the Serbs and if it  lifted sanctions against the Serbs, in which case the Muslims  would clearly realize peace is more beneficial to them than war,  Karadzic said. Karadzic said that although Serbians were  already used to threats, they nevertheless took all threats very  seriously: "These are not some minor forces but the world's  largest military organization."    He noted that "almost everything the international community  has done so far in the area of the former Yugoslavia was  irrational and irresponsible." He also stressed that he  believed that reason would prevail. He added that it was the  ultimate paradox that small nations like the Serbs could be such  a threat to Western national interests that such a huge force  might be deployed. The Serbian delegation will neither act nor  take decisions under pressure, Karadzic emphasized.    Replying to a question about his mood on his way to Geneva,  Karadzic said he was pessimistic as regards the international  community's intensions to support peace. The president of the  people's assembly of the republic of Srpska, Momcilo Krajisnik,  said that in the course of the debate on the platform, the  deputies had demanded that the coming period and the events that  might follow be taken seriously, since the Muslims were making  serious preparations for war. He said certain territorial  concessions had been criticized and that the deputies maintained  these concessions were seriously damaging to the republic of  Srpska.    Expressing regret at not being able to talk about the  platform because he was duty-bound not to by the assembly's  decision, Krajisnik added that this document includes an  invitation to talks and provides every possibility of satisfying  the interests of all three sides.</p>

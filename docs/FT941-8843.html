			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: US derivatives regulator acts on risk assessment The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the primary derivatives regulator in the US, is rushing to write new rules allowing it to examine the books of parent companies with derivatives-dealing subsidiaries. Although Congress gave the agency the powers to write holding company risk assessment rules in 1992, the CFTC delayed enacting them. That delay proved costly in January, when US subsidiaries of German industrial conglomerate Metallgesellschaft faced large margin calls on the New York Mercantile Exchange as oil futures and swaps positions went sour. High-level CFTC officials say they were hampered in discovering the risk MG Corp's positions presented to the Nymex clearing house because the agency lacked the means to demand full disclosure of the over-the-counter swaps positions. The situation was further exacerbated because MG Corp's credit had been guaranteed by its German parent, whose books also proved inaccessible to the CFTC. The CFTC is now pushing holding company risk assessment rules into law. The agency will hold a public hearing on the rules in Washington on February 23, and hopes to publish the rule proposal in the Federal Register soon after. The CFTC is often criticised for being ineffective. Industry attorneys say the agency may have avoided promulgating the risk assessment rules for fear of ruffling its futures broking consistency. However, a CFTC official said the rule-making was not a priority, as the agency could use the Security and Exchange Commission's year-old risk assessment powers in most cases.</p>

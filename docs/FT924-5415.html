			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UN may take hard line in Somalia THE UN Security Council is considering taking a tougher line against the warlords impeding the international operation to get help to the starving of Somalia. Diplomats indicated that peacekeeping troops could have a much stronger role in Somalia. After closed-door consultations, Mr Andre Erdos of Hungary, the council president, said member states were unwilling to tolerate the 'rampage' of the Somali warlords any longer. About 70-80 per cent of food and other relief supplies being sent to Somalia is being looted before it can get to the famine-stricken population. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, has been asked to present a report with recommendations on how to resolve the problem. Three months ago, the council agreed to send 3,000 more UN troops from Belgium, Canada, Egypt and Nigeria to join a 500-strong Pakistani battalion already in Somalia. But none of the new units has arrived because UN officials have been unable to pin down agreements with the warring factions. Under traditional UN rules, peacekeepers are lightly armed and permitted to use their weapons only for self-defence.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / London store to run creche LIBERTY, the London department store, is to operate the first creche in the West End for the children of shoppers. The creche will be an experiment for next Monday's bank holiday, and could become permanent if it is a commercial success. Liberty said it wanted to test demand from shoppers. 'This is quite a grown-up shop. The china and glass department, with its low-level shelves, would be a particular nightmare with a toddler in a buggy,' it said yesterday. The store, which has a predominantly female clientele, said the increase in the number of working mothers was likely to mean that a creche would be popular. If the creche is set up on a permanent basis it will also be open to Liberty's staff. Out-of-town shopping centres and stores such as the Swedish furniture chain Ikea have children's areas, but there are none in the West End. With a sense of British priorities, the Knightsbridge store Harrods used to have kennels for the dogs of shoppers but has never had a creche. There are no longer facilities for customers to park their poodles but the store has introduced loos for fathers and babies as well as mothers and babies, said Harrods. The Liberty creche will be run by an outside agency called Creche on the Move at a cost to the store of about Pounds 500 for the day. Six qualified staff will provide care, free to parents, for up to 30 children at a time aged between two and 10. Children will only be allowed to stay for an hour. The limit is intended to prevent parents leaving their children and shopping elsewhere.</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME BUYERS FAIR;  </P> <P> ESTIMATION COSTS;  </P> <P> CLOSING COSTS IN HOME SALE CAN BE NEGOTIATED;  </P> <P> PAYMENT: THERE IS NO LAW REGARDING WHETHER THEBUYER OR SELLER IS RESPONSIBLE  FOR MOST FEES. BUT DETAILS SHOULD BE SPELLED OUT IN WRITING.  </P> <P> Closing costs are the charges paid by a buyer and the seller when property  changes hands.  </P> <P> While certain charges are customarily paid by the seller -- the real estate  agent's commission, for instance -- and others by the buyer -- loan origination  fee, for example -- there is no law requiring that specific closing costs are  the responsibility of the seller or the buyer, according to Robert J. Bond,  writing in "California Real Estate Practice." (Scott, Foresman &amp; Co., third  edition, 1988).  </P> <P> The only exception is with government-backed loans, where regulations prohibit  the buyer from paying certain closing costs, such as loan discount points, Bond  said.  </P> <P> The seller pays only one-time or nonrecurring expenses, such as the real estate  commission or the transfer tax, while the buyer has both nonrecurring costs --  the loan origination fee and the appraisal fee, for example -- and recurring  costs, such as the property tax proration, hazard insurance and the impound  account -- also called the tax and insurance reserves or, in some parts of the  country, the escrow account.  </P> <P> The time to negotiate who pays what is when the seller submits the Real Estate  Purchase Contract and Receipt for Deposit -- the full name of what is often  called the deposit receipt, according to veteran escrow officer Diana L.  Stewart, president of Brentwood Escrow.  </P> <P> "All the escrow instructions are a direct result of the deposit receipt, so  make sure you agree on everything at that time," she said. "Read the escrow  instructions to make sure they agree with the information in the four-page  deposit receipt. If it isn't in the escrow instructions, it won't happen."  </P> <P> You shouldn't have many surprises about how much you'll pay as a buyer or  seller when the escrow closes, thanks to "Truth in Lending" laws and the Real  Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) administered by the Department of  Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  </P> <P> RESPA, in effect since 1976, requires specific procedures and forms for closing  costs, including the Uniform Settlement Statement, HUD-1, according to the  "Reference Book" published by the Department of Real Estate. Since RESPA covers  FHA and VA loans and loans from financial institutions with federally insured  deposits, the HUD-1 statement is almost universal.  </P> <P> Your escrow agent or real estate agent should be able to give you preliminary  estimates of the closing costs long before the escrow closes, according to  Robert Irwin ("Tips &amp; Traps When Buying a Home," McGraw-Hill, 1990). If you  have any questions, just ask the real estate agent well before the closing  date, Irwin said.  </P> <P> The accompanying chart lists the charges customarily paid by the seller and the  buyer, as well as items -- usually property taxes and hazard insurance -- that  are prorated so that both the buyer and seller pay their share.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BUYER'S ESTIMATED CLOSING COSTS  </P> <P> ESCROW COMPANY CHARGES  </P> <P> Escrow fees  </P> <P> Fees vary from company to company and with complexity of transaction.

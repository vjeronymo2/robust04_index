			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE POLICY LETS POLLUTERS CERTIFY TOXIC SITES AS SAFE  </P> <P> Swamped by a large and growing number of toxic dumps awaiting cleanup, the  state Department of Health Services has adopted a policy of allowing some  illegal toxic dumpers to clean up their own dumps -- and certify them as safe  -- without an on-site state inspection.  </P> <P> The new "self-certification" policy, set out in an internal memo obtained by  The Times, is the latest, most controversial element in a state campaign to cut  its toxic waste regulatory workload -- a goal environmentalists denounce as  "outrageous" and dangerous to public health.  </P> <P> Among other changes implemented in the state's toxic cleanup program in  February is a shift from cleaning up specific dump sites as fast as possible to  "stabilizing" such sites -- or simply stopping their poisons from spreading --  until the polluters themselves are coaxed into cleanups.  </P> <P> "It's a lesser effort than what they have been doing in the past," said a  legislative aide familiar with the new program. "They are no longer going to  try to clean up every site to the most pristine level possible. They're just  going to try to stop them from getting worse."  </P> <P> "It is part of a wholesale march away from regulation," said Ted Smith of the  Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition in Santa Clara County, which now leads the  nation in the number of Superfund cleanup sites. "They've basically caved in to  industry pressure and given up the fight to clean up these dumps."  </P> <P> Lach McClenahen, chief of the health department's toxic waste cleanup section,  countered that the policy will have the opposite effect, allowing the state to  increase by 50% to 60% the number of dumps cleaned up each year.  </P> <P> Under the new process, McClenahen said, dumps will be investigated by the state  and the site owner. Once the extent of the problem is determined, the owner  will submit a cleanup plan. If the state approves it, the owner is obligated to  carry it out at the owner's expense.  </P> <P> State officials will monitor the owner's progress and confirm completion using  records -- for example, auditing the invoices from hauling companies for the  amount of tainted soils moved to an approved hazardous waste disposal facility.  </P> <P> The state's goal, summarized by Deputy Health Director C. David Willis in a  March 9 memo to Health Director Kenneth W. Kizer, is "self-certification site  cleanup program that allows for independent RP (responsible party) cleanup  without (state) oversight."  </P> <P> Neither Kizer nor Willis could be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Responsible parties -- that is, the polluters -- who wish to clean up toxic  dumps will be required to certify to the state that their efforts conform to  state standards. But not all sites will be inspected by the state to make sure  that the toxics have indeed been cleaned up.  </P> <P> Environmentalists criticize the program for putting too much faith in  businesses that already have violated state regulations. The environmentalists  question whether businesses that created the illegal dumps can turn around and  start following state regulations when ordered to clean them up. A letter  promising a thorough cleanup is not an acceptable substitute for having a state  inspector on site to make sure the job gets done, they said.  </P> <P> Legislators also have expressed concerns about the new program.  </P> <P> "This is kind of an honor system, and I am not sure we're comfortable with  that," said a staff member for the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, which  scheduled a public hearing in May on the program after learning about it this  week.  </P> <P> Although McClenahen conceded that toxic dumpers could simply lie about having  mopped up their mess, he said his staff will be selective about which polluters  to trust and which to inspect.  </P> <P> "There's always the possibility somebody could do that (falsify a cleanup  program)," he said. "In fact, they could do that now and we'd be none the wiser  because we don't have people on site every day now.  </P> <P> "We're not going to turn everybody loose," McClenahen said. "Only those who  have shown they are cooperative and responsible. People with a bad track record  will continue in the enforcement track (with on-site inspectors)."  </P> <P> McClenahen said the new policy was adopted because the Department of Health  Services has long been criticized for not acting fast enough to clean up toxic  dumps.  </P> <P> "There's widespread disappointment that the state Superfund -- and even the  federal Superfund -- have not done more about this problem," he said. "We are  under constant pressure to produce more cleanups."  </P> <P> With the new policy of self-policing, the state anticipates it can increase the  number of completed toxic dump cleanups by at least 50% in 1990, to about 45  sites from the current annual average of 30. About half those cleanups are  major Superfund sites. There are 345 such Superfund sites in the state.  </P> <P> Self-certified toxic dump cleanups is one of dozens of "new initiatives" that  the Health Services Department has adopted this year in an attempt to cope with  the state's growing hazardous waste problem.  </P> <P> Among the other initiatives is a self-certification licensing program that  allows hazardous waste users to obtain state licenses to handle, store and  dispose of toxic chemicals simply by writing to the state promising to follow  all rules. In the past, on-site state inspections were required before permits  could be issued.  </P></p>

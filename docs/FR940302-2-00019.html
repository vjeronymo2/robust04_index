			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For both Toray and Teijin, in order to simplify analysis, we decided to test the home markets sales to determine whether we could use annual FMVs as a basis of comparison to U.S. sales. To determine whether a period of review (POR) weighted-average price was representative of the transactions under consideration we performed a three-step test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We first compared the monthly weighted-average home market price for each model with the weighted-average POR price of that model. We calculated the proportion of each model's sales whose POR weighted-average price did not vary more than plus or minus ten percent from the monthly weighted-average prices. We did this test for each model. We then compared the volume of sales of all models of whose POR weighted-average price did not vary more than plus or minus ten percent from the monthly weighted-average price from the total volume of sales. If the POR weighted-average price of at least 90 percent of sales did not vary more than plus or minus ten percent from the monthly weighted-average price, we consider the POR weighted-average price to be representative of the sales under consideration. Finally, we tested whether there was any correlation between fluctuations in price and time for each model. Where the correlation was less than 0.05 (where a coefficient approaching 1.0 indicates a direct relationship between price and time), we concluded that there was no significant relationship between price and time. Since home market prices of both companies passed all of these tests we used annual FMV's as a basis of comparison for both companies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Results of the Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of this review, we preliminarily determine that the following margins exist for the period November 30, 1990, through May 31, 1992:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s10,10  -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Manufacturer/producer/exporter  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Margin  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> (percent)  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Toray  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 4.76  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Diafoil  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 14.00  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Teijin  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 5.73  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may be submitted no later than 30 days after the date of publication of this notice.

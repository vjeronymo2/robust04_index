			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Business confidence is key to lending, MPs told - Banking WEAK business confidence and hesitant bank managers bruised by bad debts since the 1980s boom years may be the chief obstacles to lending to small business when the economy recovers, a Commons committee heard yesterday. Mr Brian Pearce, chief executive of Midland Bank, told the Treasury and Civil Service committee that he believed the main UK banks would have plenty of capital to expand their lending. Senior executives of the three other leading banks appearing before the committee agreed. Mr Martin Gray, chief executive of retail banking at National Westminster, said: 'We are not seeing a plethora of excellent quality propositions which we are having to turn away.' Mr Pearce disclosed that Midland made provisions in the financial year just ended against lending to 12,000 personal and small-business customers with shortfalls in their debt repayments of between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 250,000. All the bankers present rejected suggestions that bank managers had less power to make loan decisions than previously. Mr Geoffrey Miller, Barclays managing director, said his managers had power to lend a minimum of Pounds 20,000 unsecured and Pounds 80,000 secured, rising in some large branches to Pounds 1m. The other banks produced similar figures. Mr Miller said 80 per cent of Barclays' lending decisions were taken at branch level. Only 4,500 cases were referred to head office and 55,000 to its 24 regional offices. Asked what it was doing to help the Citizens' Advice Bureaux and other counselling bodies deal with debt problems, Barclays said it had supplied six managers to the CAB organisation. The committee suggested that some managers who might otherwise be made redundant could be seconded to advice organisations. Mr Trevor Blackley, NatWest's general manager of UK branch banking business, said his bank had given Pounds 250,000 over three years for money advice bureaux. All the banks said a statutory levy towards the costs of money advice would not be appropriate. Mr David Pirrie, a director at Lloyds, said banks already provided a great deal of financial counselling through their branches. MPs asked about mechanisms to ensure that the new banking code was enforced after it came into force on March 16. They were told that the banking and building society ombudsmen would collect details of infringements. Those banks and building societies which persistently failed to observe its provisions could be reported to the Bank of England or the Building Societies Commission.</p>

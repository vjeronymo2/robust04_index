Our  correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that according to Minister  Sarid's announcement, the issue has never come up in the cabinet  and no decision has ever been made. Minister Sarid said it would  be appropriate for elections to be held after an accord with  Syria is initialed. He believes that the government can win a  solid majority in these elections since the peace and security  package which will be presented to the public will be most  convincing.    Deputy Minister Gur said that the government would call for  a  referendum if called to make important concessions on the Golan  Heights. In a Knesset debate on the future of the plateau,  Deputy Minister Gur said that his remarks have the approval of  the prime minister and the entire cabinet. He also said that  Israel learned after the Clinton-al-Asad summit meeting that  Syria insists on receiving the entire Golan Heights in return  for peace. He noted that in the negotiations with Syria, we  will insist on all the security components based on our concepts.    The Ministerial Committee on National Security Affairs  opposes the motion by Likud Knesset Member Zakhi Hanegbi to hold  elections prior to the signing of a peace accord which includes  giving up any territory or which mentions the setting up of a  Palestinian self- government in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza  Strip. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the  ministerial committee opposes the motion on the grounds that it  refers to a clear-cut political issue.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rustem Sartayev and Sergey Gmyrya, Information </F> Center of the Republic of Kazakhstan Supreme Council: "Only Two  Parties With a Solid Electorate--the Communists and People's  Unity Alliance of Kazakhstan"]    [Text] Sociologists of the Information Center of the  republic's Supreme Council conducted three public opinion  surveys in February-March 1994 of Almaty residents on issues  related to the elections of the Supreme Council and local  representational organs of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The first  survey (448 respondents) was conducted one month prior to the  elections, the second (439 respondents)--three days prior, and  the third (511 respondents)--immediately following the  elections.    A comparative analysis of the results of the first and  second  surveys shows that election campaigning had virtually no effect  on increasing the interest of voters in the elections of  representational organs of authority. A certain reduction in the  interest level was even seen. According to data from the poll  conducted three days prior to the elections, only 17.8 percent  of Almaty residents (one month prior to the elections this  figure was 17.6 percent) were very interested in the coming  elections, more than half of those surveyed--52.6 percent (55.1  percent for the poll conducted one month prior) were interested  in them to some degree, and 29.4 percent (27.2 percent)  expressed complete indifference.    Nor was there any change in the number of respondents who  had  decided conclusively not to participate in the elections--26.9  percent (26.3 percent one month prior to the elections). Three  days before the elections, 24.6 percent still had not decided  whether to take part (26.8 percent--one month prior to the  elections). A certain increase was seen in the number of voters  deciding to participate in the elections--48.1 percent (44.2  percent--one month prior).    Results of the postelection survey showed that 64.6 percent  of the Almaty residents polled took part in the elections (62.8  percent of the electorate voted according to data of the Central  Electoral Committee). The most energetic voting activity was  observed with respect to pensioners, 89.5 percent of whom went  to the polls. Also active on election day were military  servicemen (75 percent), engineering-technical personnel (74.4  percent), the creative and scientific intelligentsia (69  percent), and workers (65.9 percent), who comprise 33.9 percent  of the total number of those voting.    Less energetic were teachers and doctors (61.5 percent of  their number voted), students (50.9 percent), entrepreneurs and  businessmen (50 percent), and employees of law enforcement  organs (41.2 percent). The low percentage of the latter group is  perhaps related to the fact that militiamen predominate here (of  mid-level and junior rank) who were actively engaged in  maintaining order during the elections.    The degree of participation by age in the elections was  directly proportional to the ages of voters. The greatest  activity was observed in the category of middle-aged and elderly  people: 87.5 percent--for those over 60, 73.1 percent--ages 50  to 59, 74.8 percent--ages 40 to 49, and 59.4 percent--ages 30 to  39. The least degree of election participation was observed in  the electorate of the 25-29 age group--49.2 percent of them  voted. At the same time, there was no substantive difference  between election participants categorized by ethnicity--61.3  percent of Kazakhs and 69 percent of Russians cast ballots. As  one can see from these figures, the Russian population of Almaty  was somewhat more active than the Kazakh population.    What were the reasons motivating almost two-thirds of Almaty  residents to take part in the voting? Over half (55.8 percent)  explained their decision by virtue of civic duty. Some 22.5  percent of the politically active citizens explained their  participation through a concern for the democratic development  of society, and 19.7 percent of participating city-dwellers were  influenced by the need to develop and perfect legislation.    Fourteen percent of those voting cited a need to protect the  interests of their nationality as being among the motives for  their decision (13.9 percent of Kazakhs and 17.2 percent of  Russians were thus motivated to participate). The need to elect  a professional parliament as a counterweight to the executive  branch of power was cited by 13.3 percent of respondents in  explaining their decision. Only 7.6 percent based their  reasoning on enthusiasm for a certain candidate (6.2  percent--one month prior to the elections). The low percentage  seen here illustrates the obvious lack of political figures who  are well known and enjoy the prestige of Almaty residents. Only  1.2 percent of the city populace explained their reasoning by  virtue of sympathies for a certain sociopolitical organization.    What is interesting is the motivation that led more than a  third (35.4 percent) of Almaty residents to decide not to  participate in the elections. The overwhelming majority of those  deciding not to vote (70.3 percent) explained their  nonparticipation through a belief that the election results  would not change anything; 69.2 percent felt that those desirous  of acceding to power would be elected all the same. Some 9.2  percent of those not voting explained their decision citing  indifference as the justification, while the same percentage  cited lack of information as the reason. Another 9.1 percent  believed their own personal problems were more important than  the elections.    Responses to a question regarding political sympathies of  respondents on the threshold of the elections showed the low  popularity of sociopolitical associations of the republic. This  is explained evidently by the fact that the process of formation  of the multiparty system in the republic is in its early stages,  and it is still too soon to be talking about the formation of  party-political structures of any durability, or about a clear  demarcation of political forces.    On the eve of the elections, 12.1 percent of respondents  showed a preference for the People's Unity Alliance of  Kazakhstan (one month prior to the elections--14.5 percent), the  Communist Party--9.6 percent (9.8 percent), independent  candidates--9.1 percent (3.1 percent), the Democratic Committee  for Human Rights--8.9 percent (5.1 percent), Union of  Veterans--8.9 percent (6.5 percent), the Slavic movement  Lad--3.9 percent (11.6 percent), People's Congress of  Kazakhstan--3.6 percent (4.5 percent), Socialist Party--2.1  percent (1.1 percent), the party Zheltoksan--1.4 percent (0.5  percent), Republican Party--0.9 percent (0.9 percent), the  Kazakhstan civic movement Azag--0.7 percent (0.9 percent),  Independent Center of Trade Unions--0.7 percent (0.9 percent),  and the party Alash--0.5 percent (0.9 percent). Some 22.7  percent of Almaty residents polled had not determined their  political sympathies three days prior to the elections (one  month prior to the elections this figure was 39.5 percent).    Results of the second survey showed that three days before  the elections 39 percent of city residents were unfamiliar with  the campaign programs of sociopolitical organizations (one month  prior to the elections this figure was 45.1 percent), 22.8  percent were insufficiently familiar with them (25.9 percent),  22.6 percent were roughly familiar (21 percent), and just 13  percent of city residents were familiar with them (6.7 percent).    Despite the increased percentage of voters who had  familiarized themselves with the campaign programs of  sociopolitical organizations towards the end of the campaign  period, survey results revealed that political parties missed  the good opportunity afforded by preelection activity to broadly  advertise their programs. This can be seen in the third place  finish achieved by independent candidates. Only the Democratic  Committee for Human Rights and Union of Veterans increased their  standings appreciably. The standings of the remainder either  decreased or remained at their previous level.    Despite the fact that the Communist Party was not registered  as of election day, the Communists have a fairly solid  electorate--consisting mainly of people whose standard of living  dropped sharply as a result of the reforms conducted. A  significant reduction was seen by election day in the number of  supporters of the Slavic movement Lad (one month prior to the  elections, 11.6 percent of those polled supported Lad; three  days prior--only 3.9 percent).    Analysis shows that the reduction was due chiefly to  workers,  who constituted more than half of the Lad electorate at the  outset of the campaign. Whereas one month prior to the  elections, 16.4 percent of all workers supported the movement,  three days prior this figure was 4 percent. By ethnic category,  an almost threefold reduction was seen in support for the  movement on the part of Russians--who comprised the overwhelming  majority of its electorate and apparently believed Lad would not  stand up for their interests with sufficient decisiveness.  Kazakhs, who constituted 11.5 percent of the Lad electorate  prior to the elections, stopped supporting the movement  entirely. As opposed to the Russians, Kazakhs obviously felt the  reverse was true--that the Lad program proposed too radical a  resolution of ethnic problems.    As to the question of criteria guiding the voters in making  a  determination of their representatives, the following results  were seen from the third survey. Almaty residents focused their  attention firstly on the competence of candidates for deputy  (15.7 percent of those polled), 13.7 percent showed a preference  for the independence of position of the candidates, 12.7  percent--for their moral qualities (incorruptibility,  trustworthiness of their word...), 8.6 percent were influenced  by the attractiveness of candidates' campaign programs, 7.6  percent--by the manner of communication, education, and  intelligence of candidates, 7.2 percent found the patriotism of  candidates important, 6.3 percent were influenced by a  candidate's affiliation with a particular sociopolitical  organization, and only 6.1 percent of survey respondents were  guided by the ethnic affiliation of the candidates.    Preelection survey data on the degree to which Almaty  residents were informed about candidates prior to the elections  show that only one-fifth of city residents (20.8 percent) knew  the candidates registered in their electoral districts, 23.3  percent knew roughly who they were, and 44.6 percent knew  nothing at all about the individuals campaigning in their own  electoral districts. Some 29.4 percent of surveyed city-dwellers  made their selection beforehand. More than a third of  respondents (35.8 percent) decided at the polling station.    The following results were obtained for a question asking  what influenced the respondent's choice if he had no previous  knowledge regarding the candidates: type of work of a candidate  was the deciding factor for 16.4 percent of city-dwellers  surveyed; occupation--for 15.9 percent; information about a  candidate's nomination--9.6 percent; party, movement, or union  affiliation--7.1 percent; nationality of a candidate--5.9  percent. Indicating a certain degree of tension in interethnic  relations was the fact that 15.1 percent of respondents voted  only for a candidate of his own nationality (17.3 percent of  Kazakhs and 18.5 percent of Russians voted in this manner)--41.6  percent of these made their selection beforehand, while 55.9  percent determined their choice at the polling station. Thus,  survey data show that the random element played a significant  role in the elections of deputies.    What do Almaty residents expect from their new parliament?  According to data from the third survey, more than half the  voters--52.7 percent (one month prior to the elections the  figure was 53.1 percent) nurture definite hopes in connection  with the newly elected parliament. Some 29.6 percent of survey  respondents expect professional work to be done on legislation  (one month prior to the elections--28.1 percent), while 18.8  percent (17.1 percent) believe the new parliament will change  the existing situation in society. Only 4.3 percent (7.1  percent) think the highest legislative organ will act as a  counterweight to the executive branch. More than a fourth--28.2  percent (26.8 percent) of surveyed voters expect nothing at all  from their new parliament. A comparative analysis of results of  the first and third surveys shows that the election campaign did  not increase the prestige of the highest representational  authority in the eyes of Almaty residents.    Proceeding from the data presented above, we may draw the  following conclusions.    The study shows that preelection campaign  activity--restricted within a rigid provisional framework, its  inadequate financing, low activity level of the candidates for  deputy themselves, weak support on the part of sociopolitical  organizations for their own candidates, inadequate clarification  of the election campaign in the mass media, and the absence of  new, bright political figures all worked to produce virtually no  increase in the interest of the electorate with respect to the  elections.    Analysis of the data obtained during the course of the third  survey shows that the element of randomness exerted a  significant effect on the result of the elections in the city of  Almaty, this being related to the absolute lack of information  on the part of over half (53.7 percent) of the city population  that went to the polls.    The elections show a growth of political passivity on the  part of Almaty residents as reflected in the refusal of more  than a third of the electorate to take part in the voting,  explaining their nonparticipation by virtue of a belief that  nothing will change for the better as a result of the elections  and that those desirous of acceding to power will be elected all  the same.    The election campaign exerted no significant influence on  the  process of establishment of a multiparty system in Kazakhstan  since, as opposed to Russia, the republic's political parties  failed to take advantage of the marvelous opportunity afforded  by elections to the Supreme Council and local organs of power to  make a statement about themselves and about their political  programs.    Results of the three surveys show that only two parties at  present--the People's Unity Alliance of Kazakhstan and the  Communist Party--have established a fairly significant and solid  electorate, on whose support they can today rely.    The results obtained during the course of the three surveys  show that the social consciousness of Almaty residents is  gradually crystallizing, and that it is becoming increasingly  independent, freeing itself from precepts of political  conformism, i.e., from the subconscious readiness to accept any  and all decisions of the state authority.</p>

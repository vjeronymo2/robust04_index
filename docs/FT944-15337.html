			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Mercury to double its mobile reach Mercury One-2-One, the mobile phone network operator, is to invest Pounds 230m in doubling the size of its network over the next two and a half years. The investment, which continues One-2-One's slow expansion, will give the UK's main population centres four cellular phone networks by early 1997, making Britain the most competitive market in Europe. One-2-One currently covers only the south-east and the west Midlands - about 30 per cent of the UK population. The networks of Vodafone and Cellnet, the two biggest operators, have national coverage. Orange, the newest network, covers about 65 per cent of the population and plans to extend its coverage to 70 per cent by the end of the year. With 140,000 subscribers, One-2-One is small by comparison with Vodafone and Cellnet, which have about 1.4m and 1.2m subscribers respectively. But the company claims to be gaining a third of all sales in its coverage area. Orange, which launched its network in April, refused to disclose subscriber numbers, prompting speculation among analysts that it was gaining customers at a slower rate than One-2-One in spite of its wider geographical coverage. The new investment will extend One-2-One's network to include all of the Midlands, the north-west, and the south and south-east coast. Mr Richard Goswell, One-2-One's managing director, said the company did not intend to cut tariffs or handset prices to attract more subscribers. 'We do not see any need for a price war. All four operators are comfortable in their parts of the market,' he said. Vodafone and Cellnet are also keen to delay serious price competition but have cut the price of their digital handsets sharply in the past month, to less than Pounds 100 for the cheapest. One-2-One's cheapest handsets sell for Pounds 200. Mr Goswell said the company would not increase subsidies for handsets to reduce the price. 'I don't believe in giving handsets away. It sends the wrong message about their value, and we want customers to make decisions based on the long-term cost of having a mobile phone,' he said. With more than five mobile phone subscribers per 100 people, the UK has more usage per head than any European country outside Scandinavia. Cellnet, a joint venture between British Telecommunications and Securicor, made the biggest advance of any operator in the quarter to September, with 133,000 net new subscribers compared with 123,000 for Vodafone, which remains the biggest operator. The networks of One-2-One, a joint venture between Mercury and US West, and Orange are built to the PCN standard, which requires the installation of more radio base stations than the GSM standard used by Cellnet and Vodafone.</p>

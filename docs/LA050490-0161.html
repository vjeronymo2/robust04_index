			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUESS WHAT?;  </P> <P> 'TAILORED PIECES' HELP GEORGES MARCIANO TAKE THE GUESSWORK OUT OF CAREER  DRESSING  </P> <P> Guess?, the label that has adorned so many teen-age derrieres, seems to be  growing up. A line of women's clothing, with definite career possibilities, is  now in stores.  </P> <P> The garments are intended for customers who have grown up with Guess? over the  past nine years, according to a statement issued by Georges Marciano, designer  and company president. Concentrating on tailored pieces, he has designed a  spring collection that includes a smart, fitted, cherry-red linen suit as well  as a lightweight blazer and well-cut, cropped, plaid pants.  </P> <P> Fall pieces, made in fabrics such as melton and wool-cashmere blends, have a  fit-and-flare attitude, as seen in a swingy skirt and a cuffed, two-button  jacket.  </P> <P> Prices range from $50 to $375.  </P> <P> Marciano refers to the new concept as "sophisticated city clothing for a young  career woman."  </P> <P> Who knows, perhaps the Brigitte Bardot look-alike in company ads will soon  outgrow her jeans and lace bustier, hop off the motorcycle, put away the  Italian cookbook, find a real job and slip into something more serious.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Marciano's provocative ads, his business acumen and his  generosity toward future designers have earned him this year's Otis/Parsons  Fashion achievement award. It will be presented in a ceremony on Saturday  night..  </P> <P> "Guess? has become a major fashion force, with his impetus obviously. He's  changed perceptions of fashion as well as changed the look of clothing," says  Frances Balcomb, director of communications for the Otis Art Institute of  Parsons School of Design in Los Angeles. "There's a kind of energy and youthful  optimism in Marciano's clothing. And, as a designer, he has been extremely  generous in helping our students."  </P></p>

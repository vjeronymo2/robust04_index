			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Portugal is set to resume an upward path - Falling interest rates are encouraging further equity investment After soaring gains throughout 1993 and early this year, analysts have welcomed this week's correction on the Lisbon bourse as a means of cleaning up a market that was becoming dominated by speculation rather than serious investment. 'A market that moves up in virtually a straight line for more than a year cannot be considered healthy,' says Ms Elizabeth Rothfield, an analyst with independent stockbrokers Midas Investimento. 'A spell of profit-taking is needed to put the market back on a more realistic footing.' But the correction is unlikely to be dramatic. The Banco Totta &amp; Acores index fell from a two-year high of 3,226.6 last Friday to 3,161.8 on Wednesday. Analysts will be satisfied if the correction reaches 5 per cent. But they are unsure prices will move down even that far. Liquidity is driving the bourse forward. Interest rates on medium and long term government debt securities, the traditional home of Portuguese institutional investment, have fallen from 14 per cent last May to 8.5 per cent. As a result, an increasing proportion of portfolios has been channeled into equity. This weight of money of money drove the BTA index up by 59.6 per cent in 1993 to 2,614 and it has already put on a further 20 per cent this year. Analysts forecast a overall gain of 20 to 30 per cent in 1994 on a substantially higher turnover. Lisbon's trading volume rose by 97 per cent last year to Es2,849bn (Dollars 16bn) while the value of the market more than doubled to Es2,193bn. This week's correction was triggered by a rise of 20 basis points in medium and long-term government debt rates after the Bank of Portugal failed to place all of a massive Es150bn issue of three, five, and 10 year paper. But the outlook is for a resumption of the downward trend in interest rates, which are expected to fall to about 7 per cent by December. The fact that the domestic institutions, which now dominate the stock market, are more nervous than their foreign counterparts is also contributing to the current correction. But they are also so bullish about the market overall that they are more often looking for excuses to buy. 'When investors in Portugal start asking you about inflation rates in Japan or the latest budget news from the US it becomes clear that they are not overly concerned with the fundamentals of their own economy or the performance of the companies they are investing in,' says Ms Rothfield. 'They take the attitude that they must invest and are buying into good quality companies even though they may be overpriced.' In fact, the outlook for the economy is relatively buoyant. After a recession in 1993 when output fell by an expected 0.75 per cent, the economy is likely to expand by about 1.5 per cent this year. Investors are already discounting forecasts of improved corporate performance in 1995, when gross domestic product growth could reach 3 per cent. Mr Ernani Lopes, a former finance minister, this week told a London seminar that Portugal's main corporate problems over the medium term will be increasing competition in domestic and foreign markets, affecting market shares and profit margins. Industry will also undergo a radical restructuring process at both sectorial and company levels. This will provide opportunities for takeovers of distressed companies and partnerships, he says. The shakeout will also produce portfolio investment opportunities, which will need to be based on adequate research and sound local advice. After returning higher than expected profits last year, the banking sector, which accounts for 65 per cent of equity turnover, will face greater difficulties in 1994, including bad debt, stronger competition, decreasing spreads and the need to cut costs. Mr Antonio de Sousa, secretary of state for finance, says that government plans to speed up the privatisation process will be a further stimulus. After completing the planned denationalisation of the financial sector, he believes the privatisation of industrial companies and public utilities this year will increase the equity market turnover of privatised companies from 31 per cent of the total in 1993 to more than 50 per cent this year.

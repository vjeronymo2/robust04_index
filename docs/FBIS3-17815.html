Will It Be Able To Survive?"]    [Text] On the morning of 28 March, when a reception was  held for Kazakhstani President N. Nazarbayev in the Kremlin with  all the honors befitting the leader of a sovereign state, one  could hardly have expected a significant breakthrough in  Russian-Kazakhstani relations, which have over the last few  months noticeably cooled, primarily owing to the acute  disagreements over the future of the Baykonur Cosmodrome.    However, that very same evening, even before the package of  around two dozen documents had been signed, it became clear that  B. Yeltsin and N. Nazarbayev had succeeded in eliminating the  mutual bones of contention -- of which there had been plenty  during the lengthy talks between experts and the leaders of the  Ministry of the Economy and the Foreign Ministry -- and adopted  a determined decision which promises to prolong the life of the  unique space rocket complex.    What happened during the eight-hour talks in Moscow? Why did  Nazarbayev so rapidly abandon the excessive claims that Alma-Ata  [Almaty] had put forward during the negotiating marathon? There  is every indication that the solution should be sought in a  practice that has become traditional for experienced  politicians: Ask for as much as possible and get as much as you  can.    By the time the Kazakhstani delegation arrived in Moscow the  set of documents prepared by the various departments looked like  this. The heads of state were to discuss and sign treaties on  military cooperation, on deepening economic integration between  the two countries, and on the basic principles for resolving  matters of granting dual citizenship, as well as, of course, the  agreement on the basic principles for the use of the Baykonur  Cosmodrome.    The heads of government were to settle questions of  collaboration in the field of military-technical cooperation and  the servicing and maintenance of the strategic nuclear forces,  and also to finally make joint efforts to remove a nuclear  device left in a silo at the Semipalatinsk test site following  its closure. According to one participant in the talks, these  and other draft documents did not give rise to particular  dispute. The Baykonur draft, which was submitted to the  presidents in a very "raw" form, remained the thorn in the  flesh. And not because the experts were unable to reach  agreement. They had been given mutually exclusive paramaters  for the cost of leasing the cosmodrome. Moreover, the  cosmodrome is doomed without the city of Leninsk, without the  Russian specialists living there. But Russian citizens cannot  live and work normally in this city, which is under Kazakhstan's  jurisdiction, unless the legal status of Russian specialists in  this country is defined.    The situation at the talks changed dramatically straight  after the two presidents had a one-on-one conversation lasting  roughly an hour. In his introductory address to the delegations  Yeltsin said: "There were some questions over the documents,  but we have settled them...." Soon many participants in the  talks on both sides began leaving the Kremlin. It turned out  that they were going off to the Finance Ministry and the  Ministry of the Economy since the presidents had given them  strict instructions: Coordinate your positions within six hours  so that the Russian side's leasing of Baykonur becomes a reality.    Economy Minister A. Shokhin described the gist of the draft  during a conversation with your IZVESTIYA correspondent. The  term of the cosmodrome lease is to run for 20 years. The amount  of rent proposed by the Russian side must not exceed $82  million, which has already been enshrined in this year's budget.  (Yu. Koptev, general director of the Russian Space Agency,  cited a figure of $105-150 million). As for the city of  Leninsk, Russia cannot fund it with the present number of  inhabitants -- around 150,000 people. We may be talking about  40,000 specialists and members of their families. The  Kazakhstani authorities are also to participate in funding the  city. Needless to say, all these problems cannot be settled in  six hours. Therefore some of them will be postponed until  Yeltsin's visit to Alma-Ata, which will most likely take place  this May. He received an invitation to that effect from  Nazarbayev.    After the joint document signing ceremony the presidents  told  journalists in unison that Baykonur will survive. "We had no  political disagreements. There were just technical  difficulties," Yeltsin said. Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev  described the latter in an interview with your IZVESTIYA  correspondent. The idea that has been around for some time of  dividing up the cosmodrome and handing it over to an  international company (the information "leak" about the creation  of a Kazakhstani-Ukrainian company was most likely arranged with  this in mind -- author's note) rapidly collapsed. And there is  no need to look for intrigues on the part of the military here.  Everyone who has studied the problem realizes that the  cosmodrome is unviable without Russia. It must remain a unified  complex.    "In other words, Nazarbayev had no other options?" I asked.    "I would say this: Kazakhstan is not the loser here," the  minister replied. "Preserving the cosmodrome boosts that  state's status. What is more, we will be paying to use it. And  there is no one else to pay. U.S. launch technology, for  instance, simply cannot be reconciled with ours."    The saga of the rescue of Baykonur has been declared over,  but it is too early to draw a line under it. Remember that it  was decided in Massandra to buy out the Ukrainian part of the  Black Sea Fleet. But nothing has budged an inch.</p>

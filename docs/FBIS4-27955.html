			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Kang Tae-ho] </F>   [Text] Economic sanctions against North Korea have been  discussed in earnest. It will likely be difficult to impose  UN-led sanctions because it will be difficult to win support for  such sanctions from China and Russia. As a result, only the  ROK, the United States, Japan, and other countries that are  diplomatically close to those countries will participate in  sanctions.    The United States considers North Korea as a hostile country  and a country assisting terrorism and has banned exports of  goods, except for goods for humanitarian purposes, and South  Korea has linked the nuclear issue to North-South economic  cooperation. Therefore, some people question why "sanctions" are  referred to at this time under these circumstances.    North Korea is now facing economic difficulties; has a need  to expand external economic cooperation to overcome the  difficulties; and has adopted a foreign trade-first policy as  one of the strategies to pursue during the three-year adjustment  period for socialist construction. Therefore, other people  point out that sanctions would deal a serious blow to North  Korea in that sanctions would prevent North Korea from promoting  external economic cooperation.    Generally speaking, a country's dependence on external  sources is the most important factor in assessing how effective  sanctions against that country will be.    It is difficult to correctly assess North Korea's dependence  on external sources because not much objective information is  available. Still, its dependence must be very low. North  Korea's volume of trade for 1992 is estimated at $2.66 billion  with the volume of exports at $1.02 billion and that of imports  at $1.64 billion. The ROK National Unification Board estimated  North Korea's GNP for 1992 at $21.1 billion. We can say North  Korea's dependence on external sources is a little over 10  percent. Given this factor, the effect of sanctions against  North Korea will be very limited.    North Korea is found to be in a sense defenseless against  sanctions in terms of its dependence on some specific countries  and in terms of its need to import food, oil, and other  strategic materials. North Korea does 33 percent of its trade  with China, 17.6 percent with Japan, and 12.3 percent with CIS  countries. This means North Korea does over 60 percent of its  trade with these three, and it does almost 90 percent of its  trade with its 10 biggest trading partners. Of course, the  effect of sanctions will be minimal because China's  participation in sanctions is negative and because only Japan  and a few other countries will participate in sanctions.    Also, oil, bituminous coal, and other minerals North Korea  imports account for a fourth of the total volume of imports, and  corn, rice, and other sorts of grain account for 10 percent.  The amount of imports for oil and grain, strategic materials,  is estimated at approximately $500 million, out of the estimated  $1.6 billion. North Korea has food and energy shortages. This  means North Korea is able to import less oil and grain than it  needs. Still, North Korea imports 57 percent of its oil from  China, 34 percent from Iran, and 4 percent from Russia, and it  imports 70 percent of its food from China. This is why China is  a factor that determines the success or failure of sanctions.</p>

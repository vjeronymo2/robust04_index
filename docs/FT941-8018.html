			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Prescott in row on private finance Labour leftwingers yesterday accused Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, of 'bouncing' the party into accepting plans for sympathetic treatment of private financing for infrastructure projects. The row follows the weekend release of a discussion paper on investment which leftwingers fear may lead to a scaling down of government projects funded by tax and borrowing. 'This was never discussed,' said one leftwing member of the shadow cabinet. 'This is a major initiative, and I am very worried about both the substance and the presentation. We have been bounced.' The document was co-authored by Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, and Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, for a symposium on infrastructure investment later this week. Mr Brown told BBC Radio from Geneva: 'It is the duty of a Labour chancellor to look at how we can use the resources we have to best effect.' The document, however, is widely believed to have been prompted by Mr Prescott, who has been pressing the case for greater use of private funds in infrastructure projects for several years. There was some dismay among leftwingers about the involvement of Mr Prescott, whose roots are on the left of the party. Mr Prescott said the shadow cabinet and Labour's national executive committee had been kept informed of discussions on the document 'at every stage'. Mr Prescott blamed the row on inaccurate briefings to newspapers by unnamed Labour 'spin doctors' who had not read the document. 'It is not very helpful, frankly,' he said. 'This is a document about accountancy, not socialism. There is no reason why there should be a problem.' The document says there is scope for much greater use of private finance in the provision of transport infrastructure, inner-city redevelopment, training, housing, childcare and defence diversification. It also suggests a limited application in the provision of publicly led projects in education and health. The document calls for 'imaginative' financing solutions, such as transferral of development benefits and regulatory changes in return for investment. Ideas include: Clearer rules on risk division, project-approval procedures and intellectual property rights. Redefinition of the public sector borrowing requirement to exclude government-owned trading companies. Relaxation of Treasury controls on jointly financed projects to take account of social benefits. A cut in the required rate of return, now 8 per cent, to between 6.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent, the average real return on private non-oil assets. Assessment rules giving priority to job-creating projects. A task force to resolve problems, and an 'investment broker' to investigate proposals, leaving the government to decide on priorities. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said the document amounted to a disguised attempt to embrace the government's private finance initiative of 1992. Joe Rogaly, Page 20</p>

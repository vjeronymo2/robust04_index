Lexa is alleged to have cast doubt on the morals of the  president and his professional capabilities in connection with  his age.    According to the paper, Lexa considers it absurd that the  Slovak criminal bodies deem his case to be so important that  they made it impossible for him to travel abroad. He considers  the unprecedented political trial to be comparable with those  communist from the 1950's.</p>

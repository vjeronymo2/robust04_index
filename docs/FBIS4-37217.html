			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Palestinian Official Denies </F> Accusations of Torturing Detainees in Strip's Prisons"]    [Excerpt] London, Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- A senior  Palestinian police official in the Gaza Strip has denied that  detainees are tortured. The official said that these are  unreliable allegations which have nothing to do with reality.  The official was answering a question about statements made by  Mu'tazz Hakim, whom the police arrested on 6 June at his  residence in al-Nasr district -- Block 60, Gaza City.    The official said that this person was not subjected to  torture or any other violations. Proof of this is that the  human rights association visited him during his detention.    But Kahil, who joined the police service recently to work in  the criminal investigation section in al-Rimal station, spoke  about the circumstances of his arrest and the torture he was  subjected to during four days of detention.

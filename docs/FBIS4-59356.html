			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ghani Eirabie: "India's Talks Offer a Ruse"] </F>   [Text] The wonderful diplomatic art of saying "nothing in  many words" seems to have been perfected by India in the six  "non-papers" it has recently sent to Pakistan. They skirt the  core issues between the two countries, but nonetheless New Delhi  insists that "non-issues" be discussed at yet another--and  perhaps equally futile--8th meeting between the two foreign  secretaries.    One is left with the unhappy impression that the proposed  exercise is designed to have the world believe that India and  Pakistan are engaged in resolving the dispute on their own and  so the international community need not concern itself with it.  Whereas the unfortunate position is that the entire exercise is  cosmetic, intended to gain time for the 500,000 Indian forces to  complete their ethnic-cleansing job in Kashmir.    This is established by New Delhi's March 21st clarification  of its January 24 non-paper on Kashmir. The slight hope raised  by the original vaguely-worded non-paper has been quashed by the  latest communication declaring categorically that India views  the state as an integral part of India and it sees no need to  ascertain the will of the Kashmiris--which amounts to saying the  core issue is not open to negotiation. This communication also  exposes the self-serving nature of the non-paper-I's call for an  agreement on the maintenance of peace and tranquillity along the  Line of Control. (But not the whole country.) The new  formulation tends to detract even from the Simla Agreement by  talking of the "ultimate solution" instead of the "final status"  of the state; and the real aim appears to be to convert the Line  of Control into a bilateral border, which compromises Pakistan's  traditional position. Oddly enough, India apparently seeks  Pakistan's help in consolidating its imperial hold on the  adjoining areas with its proposal for so called mutual  cooperation in the prevention of any encouragement of any act  detriment to the maintenance of peaceful and harmonious  relations.    India seems to conveniently forget that peace and  tranquillity along the Line of Control is being jeopardised--in  fact breached--by India itself. Through its deployment of half  a million troops equipped with the most lethal weaponry and the  most callous use of it against unarmed civilians. The havoc  caused by India's systematic genocide of Kashmiris has been  documented meticulously by several human rights organisations.  New Delhi's non-paper-I stresses the need to avoid "military  exercises" in the vicinity of the Control Line. It forgets that  Pakistan has never carried out any military exercises on its  side of the Line; and that for the last four years, it is India  that has actually been carrying out "live" military operation on  its side of the Line, resulting in an estimated 100,000  casualties, including 30,000 killed.    If anything, it is Pakistan which should be calling upon  India to pull out the additional forces it has inducted into the  state since 1990 and restore the balance of forces between India  and Pakistan as envisaged in the U.N.- sponsored ceasefire  agreement of 1949. Pakistan, in fact, could charge India, before  the UN Security Council, with flagrant breach of this  international agreement. In any case, India ought to de-induct  the additional forces to restore the balance and to prove that  it is sincere in its proposal for peace and tranquillity along  the Line of Control.    Additionally, India should establish its bona fides in this  regard by agreeing to strengthen the presence of the United  Nations Military Observers' Group for India and Pakistan  (UN-MOGIP) to enable it perform its mandatory job of monitoring  the Control Line, where there has been recurrent shelling and  air violations. The UN Observers should be enabled to patrol  the Line on both sides of it; and also authorised to monitor the  situation further inland on both sides of LOC. Additionally  full and free access should be provided to UN agencies and  international human rights organisations to all areas of Jammu  and Kashmir to check grave human rights violations.    On the related issue of Siachin, there is no need for a  repeat discussion on the principles of a settlement; they were  all decided at the Defence Secretaries meeting in June 1989 when  it was agreed that redeployment of troops must take place in  accordance with the Simla Agreement which requires both sides to  withdraw their forces to the positions obtaining in 1972.  India's non-paper-2 seeks to repudiate that commitment and to  that end, it contends that as agreed in November 1992, the two  sides shall disengage from "authenticated" positions they are  presently occupying and fall back to new positions since  identified by India. Now, the Indian contention happens to be  completely false; Pakistan never agreed to any authentication of  currently-held positions; and there is no question of any fresh  understanding on any fallback positions for the simple reason  that India is required by the Simla agreement to vacate all  positions that it was not occupying in 1972 and it certainly had  no positions in Siachin or anywhere near it. There is no point  in holding fresh talks to repudiate the earlier ones.    Five rounds of Indo-Pakistan talks on demarcation of the Sir  Creek estuary (subject matter of non-paper-3) have ended in  complete deadlock; the common-sense answer lies in now referring  the issue to international arbitration. In the case of the  Wullar Barrage built by India on river Jhelum in violation of  the Indus Basin International Treaty, (non-paper-4) technical  and legal experts have first to thrash out the issue in all its  bearings before the Foreign Secretaries can usefully apply their  minds to it. Again, while Pakistan would like even to further  extend the scope of the Joint Commission by including  environmental protection, combating natural disasters and  strengthening SAARC in its purview the prevailing level of  mutual bitterness between the two countries, especially in the  context of carnage in Kashmir, makes the present time most  inappropriate for a meeting. (India's non- paper-5).    Likewise, it is the deadly deadlock over the core issue of  Kashmir which imperils Pakistan's security and consequently  inhibits any fruitful dialogue on nuclear non-proliferation. On  principle, Islamabad subscribes fervently to non-proliferation  and would welcome any agreement intended to insulate population  centres against any nuclear attack, vide non- paper-6. But we  are averse to make-believe declarations. We are not convinced  of the genuineness of the Indian proposal for protection of  population centres when we find India pulling back its forces  from its eastern frontier and concentrating them against  Pakistan's major cities, when we see India so deploying its  missiles on the border that our major population centres are the  designed targets, or when we notice India acquiring and arming  deep-penetration attack aircraft to hit deeper into our  territory.    India's proposal for a "no-first-strike" commitment also  sounds hollow when India is so determinedly refusing to enter  into any regional non-proliferation arrangement. For years,  Pakistan has been offering: simultaneous ratification of NPT,  simultaneous acceptance of IAEA full-scope safeguards, mutual  inspection of each other's nuclear facilities, a bilateral  nuclear test ban treaty and establishment of a nuclear free zone  in South Asia. Each one of these proposals has been rejected by  India. More recently, Pakistan has proposed a conference of  India. Pakistan, Russia, China and the United States, to evolve  regional arrangements for nuclear non-proliferation and South  Asian security; but this too has not been accepted by India.    It is India's duplicity and its habit of wriggling out of  solemn commitments by legalistic sophistry or fancy  interpretations which make many Pakistanis sceptical about any  dialogue with India. While CIA has offered US Congress  irrefutable evidence of India's capability of deploying a  nuclear arsenal and of even evolving a hydrogen bomb, New Delhi  still insists on calling its 1974 nuclear bomb a "peaceful  explosion". While ordering two more squadrons of the latest  MiG-29's to reinforce its existing lineup of 750 most modern  warplanes, new Delhi opposes the US release of 38 F-16s to  Pakistan that it has already paid for on grounds that it will  upset the balance of power in the subcontinent. While the UN  Security Council, the US State Department, India's own founding  fathers (Nehru) and Lord Mountbatten papers all agree on  describing Kashmir as disputed territory whose future is still  to be determined by its people, India insists on claiming it as  an integral part of the Indian Union and dismissing the massive  popular uprising in Kashmir as no more than "terrorist  infiltration by a neighbour," and is employing 500,000 fully  armed soldiers to decimate the Kashmiris much the same way the  Yugoslav Serbs are ethnic-cleansing the Bosnian Muslims.    The conclusion is inescapable: The fake talks on  "non-issues" that India seeks to hold at the foreign  secretaries-level are designed to hoodwink the world into  believing that India is applying its mind to resolving the  Kashmir crisis, whereas the Indian strategy is to gain an  uninterrupted opportunity to "end the Kashmir problem by ending  the Kashmiris. Pakistan must beware of the trap.</p>

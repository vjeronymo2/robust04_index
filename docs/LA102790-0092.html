			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DIDN'T NEGLECT TENANTS, OWNERS OF HOUSE SAY  </P> <P> The owners of a house involved in a fatal fire in South-Central Los Angeles  said Friday that their elderly and poor tenants were not neglected -- despite  neighbor's comments that some of the house's occupants appeared skinny and  infirm. The owners, Leonard and Grace Fagan, both 77, live next door to the  fire-ravaged house.  </P> <P> They said the home was merely a "guest house" for people they knew who needed a  place to stay. Rent was about $50 a month for a room, they said.  </P> <P> Authorities concluded that the fire on South Laurel Street near Watts was  accidentally caused by a smoldering cigarette on a mattress. One tenant,  Charles Smith, 67, died and four others were hospitalized, authorities said.  </P> <P> The State Department of Social Services requires a board-and-care license for  commercial residential facilities providing non-medical care and supervision  for the elderly. The Fagans said they did not have a license and did not need  one. "We didn't have no rest home," Grace Fagan said.  </P></p>

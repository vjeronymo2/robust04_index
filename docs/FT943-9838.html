			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Arts: A lost 'Cry' from the past - The Proms There was a double Prom on Friday, and its late second concert attracted many new arrivals after the first: not the usual way around. That was because the second concert consisted entirely of Giles Swayne's 1979 Cry, eighty minutes' worth of 28 amplified voices - the BBC Singers - being put sonorously, slowly and meditatively through quite difficult hoops. Cry is, or was, almost a 'cult' piece. By the late 1970s, Swayne was not the only composer to feel disillusioned with academic music (mostly post-serialism then) and with avant-garde coteries. After flirting with rock, he found his inspiration in the folk music of Africa, where he has since gone to live. The outcome was Cry, a musical 'creation-myth' which rejected the formal devices of Western music in favour of vocalisation and native rhythms. Originally it depended exclusively upon the voices. A 1980 version made use of amplification, and a 1982 one subjected the voices to electronic 'treatment' as well, revised for the 1983 Prom performance. That was the form in which Cry made its famous impact: a suggestive hubbub of voices with a slow rate of change, rendered monumental and even magical by state-of-the-art electronics. It has not worn well. As aids to meditation for non-specialist audiences (probably stoned), long minimalist pieces have the advantage of instant familiarity; for 'visionary' appeal, Tavener and Gorecki have achieved more with simple Western harmonies. The special sounds of Cry are not so special now. (Nor, this time round, did they seem so haunting: high sopranos in forte wore a hard amplified glare, and the intricate subsidiary voices were often not enhanced but muddied by the electronics.) Above all, Cry seems innocent of any structure that would sustain its ambitious length. The earlier concert, if more Western-conventional, was happier. Kent Nagano conducted the Halle Orchestra in a programme that ran from Elgar to Berg, and showed how well he and the Manchester band understand each other now. If Elgar's Introduction and Allegro for strings sounded unwontedly vehement, that was more interesting than the languid glow that some conductors think right for it; and Berg's extremely difficult Three Pieces were handled with great subtlety and delicacy, despite the huge thwack at the end. In Mahler's Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen the soloist was Hakan Hagegard, whose baritone had a raw expressive edge that sounded wonderfully apt for all that innocent pain. These are songs that too often get ultra-smooth, cultivated treatment. As for Vaughan Williams' Sinfonia antartica, which shows all the marks of the film-music (for Scott of the Antarctic) from which the 80-year-old composer developed it, it makes a pleasant, kitschy, undemanding listen. Susan Gritton's wordless soprano was a positive asset.</p>

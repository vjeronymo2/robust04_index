			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Short-term rate eased by French bank THE Bank of France yesterday closed a chapter in the saga of its battle to defend the franc by replacing its main short-term lending facility - the 12 per cent five-day repurchase rate - with a cheaper and more flexible 10-day facility at 10 per cent. Yesterday's rate reduction followed last week's fall in French money market rates. It was greeted by a surge in the Paris stock market, with the CAC 40 index breaching the 2,000 barrier to close 1.57 per cent higher at 2,018.08. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the new finance minister, said he was confident interest rates would 'fall further in the days to come' and called on the banks to cut the cost of their loans. The franc firmed slightly, closing at 3.38 against the D-Mark; market rates were relatively stable, with overnight money at 9.75 per cent and one-month money at 9 per cent. Economists cautioned that the reduction was really a corrective measure to bring official interest rates down from their 'crisis' level in line with market rates. They were sceptical about the prospect of immediate cuts in bank base rates which have been held since January at 10 per cent, the same level as the new ten-day rate. 'Technically, this cut is not very meaningful,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, chief French economist at Salomon Brothers. 'But it is an important symbolic gesture.' Despite the new conservative government's emphasis on a long-term policy of lower interest rates, most economists suspect the French authorities will wait for the Bundesbank to signal cuts in German rates, particularly as the provisional inflation figures for March showed a 0.5 per cent increase, slightly higher than expected, bringing the annual rate of French inflation to 2.2 per cent. 'We certainly expect French rates to be far lower by the end of this year and there could be another small cut in the short term,' said Ms Juliette Brisac, economist at Paribas. 'But the next major move will come after action from the Bundesbank.' Yesterday's cut was welcome news for France's banks which have faced steep increases in borrowing costs because of the gap between market rates, at which they borrow money, and their own base rates. The French Banking Association has estimated the cost to the industry at up to FFr1bn a day. The banks are expected to try to recoup their losses before reducing base rates. Mr Marc Vienot, chairman of Societe Generale, one of the biggest banks, said in yesterday's Le Figaro that the banks were keen to cut rates for competitive reasons but 'need to recover what they have lost'.</p>

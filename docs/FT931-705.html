			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Arts: Today's Television The working day is over; you settle down on the old green sofa with a large glass of Graham's '75 and prepare for . . . what? Judging from the schedules, what the people in the television journalism departments assume is that you want your heartstrings tugged to breaking point and your withers thoroughly wrung. At World In Action, now more than ever on the tabloid ratings trail, they are going to 'speak to the victims of violent abduction' and 'expose the secret world of the child snatchers'. Won't that be nice (8.30 ITV). Channel 4 offers an hour on being Down And Out In Paris And London, (9.00) retracing the steps of George Orwell as he collected the material for his famous book 60 years ago. For many homeless people, it is said, nothing has changed since Orwell's (or, for that matter, Chaucer's) day. Sounds cheery. Then at Panorama, where nowadays the motto all too often seems to be: 'If it's boring it must be good', they promise to uncover 'explosive new evidence of crime, drug abuse and family breakdown in Britain's once tightly-knit Muslim community' (9.30 BBC1). How super.</p>

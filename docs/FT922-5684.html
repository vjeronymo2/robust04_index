			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Europa Minerals seeks Pounds 3.97m via rights FOLLOWING THE recent boardroom upheaval at Europa Minerals, the UK mining finance house, the group is dropping a cash-raising plan which would have involved companies associated with Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur, and is instead recommending a rights issue shares to raise a net Pounds 3.97m. The 9-for-4 issue at 5p a share is fully underwritten by Henry Ansbacher. At a recent special meeting some institutional investors supported moves by Austmin, a small Australian mining company which is the biggest shareholder in Europa, to remove Europa's three non-executive directors and replace them with Mr Guido Staltari and Mr Robert Duffin, both Australians and executive directors of Austmin. Europa said yesterday their appointment would add substantially to the board's knowledge of the Australian mining industry - a large part of the group's operating assets are in that country. Mr Duffin said Austmin would fully take up its rights and was partly sub-underwriting the issue so it expected to increase its present 14.5 per cent stake in Europa to between 18 per cent and 20 per cent. 'We believe in Europa and its assets and are putting our hands into our pockets to prove it.' With Europa's shares at 4 1/2 p each yesterday, he expected underwriters to be left with between 40 per cent and 60 per cent of the new shares. Many of the sub-underwriters were Australian residents or institutions because, said Mr Duffin, 'there is support for small resource companies there not available in the UK.' So the Europa board intends to seek a listing on the Australian Stock Exchange but will keep an office in London and its London quote. The cash raised will be used to reduce Europa's bank debt by about Pounds 3.57m and other debts by about Pounds 400,000. Europa's cash flow from operations at present is not sufficient to meet interest payments and fixed costs. Touche Ross has confirmed that, subject to the rights issue becoming unconditional, it will give an unqualified audit opinion on Europa's accounts for the year to January 31 1992. Europa said it would remain a diversified operating and investment group in the natural resources sector. The board in future would take a more active role in the management of Burmine, the Australian gold producer of which Europa owns 41.8 per cent, and the Preston Coal Company in New South Wales. Previously the board intended to withdraw from the Preston venture, 50 per cent owned by Europa. Burmine's initiative to increase gold production to 50,000 troy ounces a year via a joint venture with Golden Valley Mines, has the strong support of the Europa board. Europa will also retain its oil and gas interests which provide it with most of its cash flow. The company said it expects to further reduce its operating overheads and administrative expenditure. Brokers to the rights issue are Kleinwort Benson Securities and John East and Partners.</p>

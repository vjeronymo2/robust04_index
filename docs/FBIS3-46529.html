This, naturally, left surplus workers in Japan. Hitachi has  transferred 750 workers from its Tokai plant (Ibaragi  Prefecture) and its Haramachi plant (Fukushima Prefecture) to  heavy electric machinery plants and other affiliates, and has  cut its workforce by 1,000, including 250 by natural wastage.  Hitachi plans to cut the remaining 3,000-strong workforce to  2,000.    However, transferring staff is not easy. Heavy electric  machinery plants have no surplus power to accept extra workers,  and in each sector Hitachi has reached the limit of its ability  to juggle its workers between the various sectors concerned.    Moreover, even though it has cut 1,000 workers as planned,  it  is still overmanned. This month the Tokai Plant will enforce a  compulsory temporary leave of two days. Despite plans by  Hitachi to start producing personal fax machines and portable  telephones, the prospects are not bright.    And the strong yen is not helping. There are various kinds  of goods which are not economical to produce even at the level  of 110 yen to the dollar. A further shifting of the production  base overseas will be necessary in the future.    Meanwhile, heavy electric machinery plants and other  affiliates can no longer afford to absorb surplus workers.  Hitachi is suffering from this dilemma.    Furthermore, overseas production forces consideration of  measures to prevent deindustrialization within Japan as well as  the problem of finding new places for overseas production. The  greatest problem of all is the local procurement of parts, to  say nothing of the problem of infrastructure and the education  of workers.    Shuzo Kawashima, director in charge of the promotion of  overseas production at Fujitsu Ltd., said: "Overseas production  does not pay unless the local procurement rate of parts reaches  more than 50 percent."    The local procurement rate for Hitachi's Malaysian plant has  reached 70 percent, but the cylinders (rotating heads), which  are the principal parts of video tape records, are imported from  Japan.    Managing Director Yoshiki Yagi said: "We are having a very  hard time in Malaysia because the parts makers there want to  raise prices. They are desperate because of the appreciation of  the yen. Both the sellers and buyers of parts are cutting each  other up with swords clashing. Shifting the production base  overseas does not necessarily lead to an immediate reduction in  costs."  <H5>  There is Nothing To Make in Japan Any More </H5>   In the case of automobiles, which need about 30,000 parts,  moving the production base overseas becomes even more difficult.  Since the just-in-time system has taken root and replaced parts  inventories, a shortage of even one part can stop the production  lines.    It means, therefore, that the transfer of plants is  accompanied by a great shift involving parts makers. In order  to establish a single production line, an investment of tens of  billions of yen is necessary.    In addition, the overseas transfer of the automobile  industry, which very effectively absorbs employment, immediately  leads to the problem of unemployment. Auto industry executives  share the common feeling that "it is unwise for the automobile  industry to trigger employment insecurity."    However, the realities are harsh. President Yuichi  Nakamura of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation says: "Appreciation  against the dollar by just one yen wipes out a profit of 50  billion yen among the 11 automakers in Japan. We have already  suffered a loss of one trillion yen since the beginning of this  year due to the appreciation amounting to 20 yen."    At least 110 yen to the dollar is needed to make the export  of automobiles profitable. Dropping below the break-even point,  it becomes difficult to continue production in Japan, but moving  production overseas is not easy either.    Japanese enterprises cannot follow the speed of the yen's  appreciation, and every attempt they make has been forestalled.  This is the dilemma Japanese enterprises are in when it comes to  moving their production overseas.    There is a divergence of seven yen between the current  exchange rate and the break-even rate, the details of which will  be stated later. In order to make up the difference, an  immediate cut in costs must be made through the procurement of  parts abroad or moving production overseas.    Managing Director Hiroshni Kuwabara of Hitachi, Ltd. said  positively: "So long as exporting enterprises procure or  produce parts in Japan, they can cope with the appreciation of  the yen only to the level of 120 yen to the dollar. If the  exchange rate rises to 100 yen to the dollar, no amount of  automation can compensate."    According to a questionnaire conducted by the Economic  Planning Agency in January 1993 among 620 companies "on the  behavior of enterprises," the break-even rate for Japan's  manufacturing industries is 124 yen to the dollar.    Because of the sharp rise in the value of the yen,  therefore,  enterprises have been making frantic efforts through such  measures as adding the appreciation of the yen to prices, risk  hedging through forward exchange contracts, and rationalization.    As a result, the general view is that the current break-even  rate is about 115 yen to the dollar. Surveys conducted by the  Kogyo Bank Ltd. and the Asahi Bank Ltd. [as published] show  almost the same result.    However, the actual exchange rate has already dropped below  the 110 yen level; the current rate is about 108 yen. There is  a difference of as much as seven yen, therefore, between the  current exchange rate and the break-even rate.    In the case of Toshiba, for example, if the currency rises  in  value against the dollar by just one yen it causes a loss of 4  billion yen. A rise of seven yen results in a loss of 28  billion yen. In short, a little over half of the expected  recurring profit for 1993 has been lost.    An executive of Alps Electric Co., Ltd., a medium-sized  maker  of audio-visual related parts, ventured: "Our company may no  longer be able to produce in Japan parts which have a  competitive edge." The situation is such that shifting the base  of production overseas has become a matter of great urgency.  <H5>  "An Experiment" Begun by Toshiba in Dairen, China </H5>   In July this year, Toshiba's Dairen plant began operations  in  Dairen, China. The plant has adopted some unique practices.    Its production items, themselves, are a matter of interest.  They are small motors, printing units for televisions,  deflection corks for picture tubes, delay lines and others,  which are, at a glance, an odd combination.    That is not surprising, for the four items have been  transferred from separate plants. Production at each plant was  worth about several billion yen. However, profit margins began  declining and the scale of each plant's production was such that  it was too small to be shifted overseas.    The answer, for the production technology promotion  department of Toshiba's general staff, was the establishment of  Toshiba's Dairen plant. Toshiba adopted a system under which  applications for production at the production line of the Dairen  plant are accepted from each of its business departments.    Viewed as a whole, the idea in Toshiba is that if  unprofitable items held by each business department are put  together, that will produce enough profit to finance the capital  investment necessary for shifting the base of production  overseas.    However, under the vertical system of organization, it does  not pay to shift production of a small quantity of goods  overseas. When that happens, measures against the appreciation  of the yen are delayed, worsening the profitability of business.  Director Tetsuya Yamamoto explains: "The Dairen plant is an  experiment to speed up measures to protect ourselves against the  appreciation of the yen."    The plant site is nearly 120,000 square meters. There is  enough space for two more buildings, and the Dairen plant is  ready to accept applications for future use of the production  line from each business department. The current work force of  6,000 local employees is expected to increase further.    Meanwhile, for the past few years, Ricoh Co., Ltd. has been  making an effort to develop digital copying machines (used not  only as copying machines and faxes, but also as printers for  personal computers) and color copying machines. Demand for  these items has grown.    At present 6,000 digital copying machines and 600 color  copying machines are produced monthly. The number of color  copying machines sold has reached about 20 percent of the sales  figure for digital copying machines.    In particular, demand for color copying machines has been  greater than expected, and the Atsugi plant has had such a rush  of demands it has increased production of the machines.  Employees will have to work even on Sundays in December.    Managing Director Haruo Kamiki of Ricoh Co., Ltd. says:  "Over the next year production of digital and color copying  machines will be further increased. Production of low speed,  analog machines will be shifted to Shenzhen, China, and in  proportion to that, the domestic production of digital and color  copying machines will be increased. We are not worried about  the deindustrialization of Ricoh itself."    The development of original technology, which can keep  itself  out of a price competition, and the shifting of production to  high value-added products based on that technology holds the key  to avoiding deindustrialization.  <H5>  Aiwa Has Fully Pursued Shift To Overseas Production </H5>   If a production shift to high value-added products is  impossible, there is no other choice but to thoroughly shift the  base of production to overseas.    Aiwa is typical in that, despite the prolonged sluggish  demand for audio-visuals and the strengthening of the yen, it  has earned a recurring profit of 2.3 billion yen (the interim  settlement for September 1993), twice the amount earned over the  same period last year.    Aiwa's overseas production volume is expected to reach 75  percent by March next year. This shows how advanced Aiwa has  been in shifting its production base overseas, compared with  Sony Corporation whose overseas production volume is 35 percent.    At Aiwa's main plants in Malaysia, Singapore and elsewhere,  local procurement rates have reached more than 70 percent.    Aiwa has established a research and development center in  Singapore and has employed local designers. It has established  a consistent system -- local designing, local procurement, and  local production. It has been thorough in its approach.    What prompted Aiwa's decision to shift production overseas  was the previous recession caused by the strong yen. Aiwa  suffered a business loss of 4.27 billion yen in December 1986  and became a nondividend-paying company for the first time in 14  years. It continued not to pay dividends until 1989.    Aiwa, therefore, invited applications for voluntary  retirement from 1,000 employees. Its 3,000 employees were  reduced to 2,000, and its domestic plants were closed. The  shifting of the production base overseas is always accompanied  by such a sacrifice and pain.    An executive of a certain precision machine maker spoke  about  the difficulty of making the decision to move production  overseas.    He said: "No manager thinks the current strong yen reflects  the real strength of the economy. They think to themselves that  a change in the political situation will immediately bring about  a depreciation of the yen. They do not have the nerve,  therefore, to shift their production overseas because it means  dealing with the problem of employment."    The Japanese enterprises are at a standstill, caught in a  dilemma as to whether to shift their production overseas or not.  How long will the tug-of-war between "employment" and "profit"  last? Can they find a way out of the difficulty? The crucial  moment has yet to come.  <H3>  Small and Medium Subcontractors Perplexed and Troubled by  the Shift to Overseas Production </H3>   "We want you to reduce the unit price of parts by 4-5  percent."    Honda Motor Co., Ltd. conducts price negotiations with  subcontracting parts makers twice a year. At the beginning of  September this year, negotiations were conducted for the  purchase of parts for the latter half of the year. At the  negotiation table, the Honda side asked for a price cut of 4-5  percent.    The parts makers who were sounded out on the matter  immediately realized the seriousness of the situation. They had  been expecting a request for a 1.5 percent price cut had it not  been for the appreciation of the yen since the spring. They  suffered a further blow. They was a hint that a request for a  similar cut would be made at the next round unless the current  economic environment changed.    Such developments are not confined to the automobile  industry. A maker of office automation products says: "From  now on, we are going to ask Japanese parts makers to lower the  cost of their parts to the cost of parts made in Southeast Asian  countries." As can be seen, the requests from parts buyers are  becoming tougher and tougher. Unit prices have been lowered and  sales volume has been cut. Sub-contractors and parts makers are  being hit from both sides.    Research Section Chief Takenori Takagi of the Shoko Chukin  Bank says: "To small and medium enterprises, the ratio of  break-even point to sales is about 92 percent on average. A cut  of just several percentage points in sales is a great blow. The  small and medium enterprises are in a very serious situation."  <H5>  Parts Buyers Clamor for Price Cuts </H5>   An overseas director of a electronic materials maker said  resignedly: "Although the exchange rate has moved by only 15  percent, sales prices have dropped by 20 percent. Furthermore,  the clients are asking for further price reductions. We have  really reached the limit of our resources."    An electronic parts maker for household electric appliances  said: "I think that the parts buyers now look for low-priced  parts to the exclusion of quality. It seems that they intend to  patiently train local makers. But what are we going to do,  Japanese makers who have staked our lives and fortunes on the  quality of our parts?"    The fortunes of Japanese parts makers will dwindle to  nothing  if they do not act. Small and medium subcontractors will face  the decision of whether to stay within Japan or shift their  production base overseas.    Managing Director Haruo Kamimoto of Ricoh said: "When the  decision to shift production overseas is made, some parts  suppliers come forward, saying, `We will go with you.' When we  shifted production to Britain, four to five parts makers asked  to come with us; when we shifted production to Shenzhen, China,  about 10 makers applied to us."    For example, several big businesses, such as Ricoh,  Toshiba, Sharp and Seiko Epson have shifted production to  Shenzhen, China. They seem to welcome the fact that Japanese  subcontractors which supply high quality parts want to follow  them to China.    However, one of the subcontractors, a chemical materials  maker said: " Household electrical appliance makers and office  automation product makers can easily shift production overseas,  but it is not so easy for the equipment industry like ours to  make the move. We are unable to make any overseas investment  now."    An electronic parts maker said: "If a big firm moves  production abroad, we, a smaller business, would like to follow  it, but we are uncertain whether we can produce parts overseas  which are comparable in quality to those made in Japan. If we  produce inferior goods, our trustworthiness will be questioned  and our transactions within Japan will be canceled."    Other smaller businesses also hesitate to shift their  production base overseas. We can see another dilemma here.  <H5>  Local Plants Often Attract Unexpected Problems </H5>   Even when Japanese enterprises have successfully shifted  production overseas, they encounter unexpected troubles.    In the case of one rubber goods maker, local workers falsely  reported the number of inferior goods found in a day. According  to the report, there were five pieces of inferior goods in every  1,000 produced. Actually, the figure was closer to 100, and  furthermore, it was found they had been discarded in a rubbish  bin. It is said that unless Japanese resident representatives  keep a sharp watch on local workers, there is no knowing what  may happen.    A chemical materials plant which shifted production to  Indonesia suffered a big operating loss for similar reasons. It  seems "the idea of the yield rate is not acceptable to local  workers."    At the start of production, local workers used the wrong  kind  of raw material or mixed the material incorrectly. This mistake  has happened since, causing the loss of a whole day's production  on one occasion. This is a tragedy caused by the absence of  know-how among local producers.  <H3>  Japan's Subcontracting Structure Shaken by the Shift to  Overseas Production </H3>   Alps Electric Co., Ltd., an audiovisual goods part maker  which had enthusiastically promoted shifting production  overseas, decided, in January, to take in only half of the  orders placed with its subcontractors, because its production  volume had dropped. It is estimated that as a result, the  20,000 workers at the subcontractors' factories will be reduced  by half.    Furthermore, in August this year Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd.  discontinued the consignment production of CD (compact disc)  radio-cassettes entrusted to Sanritsu Electric Co., Ltd., an  affiliate in which Sanyo had invested 20 percent. Since the  greater part of Sanritsu's sales come from Sanyo, the closure of  Sanritsu is inevitable.    A Sanyo spokesman said peevishly: "The closure of the  Sanritsu plant is due to internal strife. We did not  discontinue the consignment production arbitrarily."    However, you can be certain that "the staged reduction of  consignment production" through the shift in production of CD  radio-cassettes to Singapore or Malaysia was the direct and  indirect cause of the closure of Sanritsu.    As industries develop more and more, it is inevitable that  mature industries will shift their production overseas. This is  the economic mechanism. Naturally, subcontractors and parts  makers which lack competitiveness will be forced to restructure.  More and more small and medium firms will be forced to move to  areas where wages are cheaper.    Research Director Teruyasu Murakami of Nomura Research  Institute said: "As far as Greater China (China, Hong Kong and  Taiwan) is concerned, we may think that a mechanism is almost  complete by which it will absorb every industry." The situation  is such that some things have become inevitable.    The chairman of an electronic equipment maker (whose stocks  are partially listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange) which, since  last year, has begun shifting its operation to China said: "In  truth, we are thinking of reducing the number of outside orders  to about two thirds. We do not want to part with highly  motivated enterprises or enterprises with technical know-how.  But we want to leave behind companies which lack initiative."    As we have seen in the cases of Alps Electric Co., Ltd. and  Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd., smaller businesses and subcontractors  with a weak management foundation will be hit hard, and their  numbers are sure to grow.    The ominous increase in bankruptcies among small and medium  firms may be the prelude to that.</p>

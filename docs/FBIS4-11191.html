			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister General Humberto Corado </F> Figueroa by unidentified reporter at a polling station at the  International Fair Grounds in San Salvador on 24 April --  recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] General Corado, what can you tell us  about the election?    [Corado] I came here to cast my vote and try to assess the  Salvadoran people's participation in this run-off election,  where I think there will be a clear winner.    [Reporter] What about the number of people participating?    [Corado] The number of voters is considerable. There are  some differences between this and the 20 March election. There  are fewer voting stations here at the Fair, but their  distribution is better. The election is taking place more  quickly, which will result in the process concluding sooner.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Corado] No irregularities have been reported to us so far,  either at the voting sites or the electoral process in general.    [Reporter] Did you cast your vote already?    [Corado] I am going to so at this very moment. [words  indistinct]</p>

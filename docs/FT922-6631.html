			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Grandson of 'Tin King' sells silver: Saleroom SOTHEBY'S started in New York on Wednesday to dispose of the most important art collection it has handled for two years - the silver, furniture and Old Masters of Jaime Ortiz-Patino, the grandson of Simon Patino, the Bolivian 'Tin King'. In the first session, devoted to French furniture, all the 103 lots sold for a total of Dollars 15.9m (Pounds 8.67m). The excellent provenance, rarity, and quality of the furniture on offer led to competitive bidding from private collectors and dealers, and total proceeds exceeded Sotheby's high estimate. The top price was the Dollars 1.98m paid by a private European collector for a Louis XVI ormolu mounted mahogany commode, painted with floral designs, and signed Joseph. It was made around 1770 and is attributed to Boullee. It is one of the few examples of top quality painted and veneered 18th century French furniture to have survived. A highly ornate Louis XIV table a ecrire, decorated with Chinese scenes, which had been estimated to sell for about Dollars 500,000, was bid up to Dollars 1.87m. A pair of Louis XVI ormolu mounted Boulle marquetry and Japanese lacquer commodes, signed by Levasseur, made Dollars 1.705m. Jaime Ortiz-Patino has been appointed adviser in Europe to the Bolivian government and is moving from a large house in Geneva to a small house in London. As a result he is selling some of his collection which should bring in at least Dollars 30m. Sotheby's jewels sale in Geneva brought SFr23m (Pounds 8.57m). A diamond necklace, made in London around 1900, unusual in that it is still intact, and heavy with fin de siecle opulence, sold for Pounds 380,297. The liquidators of BCCI pulled off a rare coup at Bonhams yesterday when they sold two sheet gold plaques over an iron core, 4 1/2 inches in diameter, dating from around 350 BC, for Pounds 187,000, as against a Pounds 20,000 top estimate. The plaques show a horsed warrior spearing an enemy and were made in Bactria, near modern day Iraq. Eight smaller plaques sold for Pounds 24,200. All were bought by a London dealer.</p>

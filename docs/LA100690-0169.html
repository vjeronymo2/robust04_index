			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS;  </P> <P> PRYSOCK DISPLAYS BALLADEER TALENTS  </P> <P> For those eager to hear familiar songs sung without untoward embellishment and  insincere emotion -- sung, in other words, the way they're supposed to be --  get to the Catalina Bar &amp; Grill for a set or two of Arthur Prysock.  </P> <P> During a too-short opening set Tuesday, Prysock showed his formidable talents  as a balladeer, rendering "I'll Be Around," "Since I Fell for You," "Save Your  Love for Me," and "When I Fall in Love" with commanding style and plaintive  emotion.  </P> <P> Though his vocal chops have not aged particularly well -- his burnished  baritone has given way to a hoarse bass, his natural range diminished so  greatly that his falsetto is needed to meet the demands of nearly every tune --  he still managed to deliver an appealing show.  </P> <P> Much of his show's appeal belongs to his brother's quartet. Red Prysock, while  not a particularly dynamic player of the tenor saxophone, nevertheless led the  organ-guitar-drums ensemble capably and provided a solid musical backdrop that  deftly supported the singer's efforts. The Prysocks' penchant for ballads must  be genetic, as both showed a significant flair for the form, with Red Prysock  giving his all on "A House Is Not a Home." Though the ballads are his forte,  Arthur Prysock shone on a couple of swing outings, including "September in the  Rain."  </P> <P> Prysock and company continue at the Catalina Bar &amp; Grill through Sunday.

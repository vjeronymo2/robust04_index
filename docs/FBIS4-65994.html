			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 26 (AFP) -- British Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd said Thursday [26 May] that Britain could not  maintain a military presence in Bosnia forever, but declined to  say whether London would call for an early pull-out if peace  talks fail to make progress.    "It can't be an everlasting presence. It has justified  itself up to now. We believe it will continue to justify  itself, but we certainly have no desire to keep British troops  indefinitely in Bosnia," he said.    He was responding to questions on whether Britain would  withdraw its forces, serving under the United Nations, if peace  talks failed to make progress.    Hurd had earlier held 45 minutes of talks with French Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur on the sidelines of a two-day,  53-delegation conference on European stability here.    Hurd, who also met Thursday with French counterpart Alain  Juppe and Defence Minister Francois Leotard, said however that  no date had been agreed by France and Britain for the withdrawal  of their peacekeeping forces in Bosnia.    France has warned it would pull out half its forces by the  end of the year if no progress in peace talks is made.    "We have not been so precise about dates, but we are on the  same line, in our main objective which is to bring about a  negotiated peace," Hurd said.    Other questions broached with the French involved Russia and  the European Union, he said.    Speaking of the search for a successor to Jacques Delors as  president of the European Commission, Hurd said former British  conservative minister and current EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon  Brittan was the best candidate.    The question was touched on during talks with Balladur, he  said.</p>

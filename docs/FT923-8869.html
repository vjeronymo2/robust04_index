			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors who lack a proper sense of direction - Diary of a Private Investor balding men in sober suits who seem to be in their 60s (although some are much younger). They are non-executive directors who, with the recent publication of the Cadbury report on corporate governance, are claimed to be a 'good thing' for companies. But are they? As a private investor, I have learned from bitter experience that having 'the great and the good' or even an army of accountants on the board is no guarantee of success. Fortunately, I avoided putting money into such companies as Polly Peck, Maxwell Communications or Dominion International. All had non-executive directors - and look what happened. (My wife was particularly upset about Dominion International being placed in the hands of administrators since she had a small shareholding). Similarly, there is no reason to believe that a strongly-managed company without any non-executives is doomed to failure. Indeed, it might well perform better than many others - especially those where non-executive chairmen and/or some of the non-executive directors interfere too much in the day-to-day operations or inhibit development by being too cautious. On the whole, though, I like to see at least two non-executives on a board - if only as an indication that it is not too hidebound by tradition. The trouble, as various surveys have shown, is that too many non-executives are appointed for the wrong reasons: they were at school or university with one of the executive directors, or played golf with him, or helped him to acquire a gong. What should non-executives do for a company and its shareholders? Much has been made of the need for a good non-executive to be 'independent,' but I like to see them having at least a modest shareholding. This demonstrates some financial faith in the management and direction of the company. But the shareholding should not be too big. It seems to me that non-executives with large holdings or high fees may be less likely to speak out on crucial issues because they are concerned about protecting their position. As well as independence, I believe non-executives ought to bring to a board a wide range of experience and expertise, and a strong belief in ethics. They should, of course, have the interests of the company as a whole (including shareholders) at heart. Some years ago, I attended a one-day course (organised by the Institute of Directors) on 'the non-executive director and the board.' I had become so convinced of the need for more companies to have truly independent non-executives that I thought I should become one. I then registered with the two main UK organisations (the institute and PRO-NED) which offer a service to companies seeking non-executives. According to PRO-NED's annual review: 'When chairmen use a search agency such as PRO-NED, their specification for the kind of person they are looking for tends to be uncompromisingly narrow. They are seeking, on the whole, main board directors of other PLCs, who are preferably chief executives and in the age range 45-55.' Unfortunately, one of PRO-NED's own information leaflets states that 'new entrants' to its register 'are not normally accepted below the age of 45.' PRO-NED adds: 'In the cause of independence, there is a case for bringing some directors on to the board who will have a different background and outlook and will provide a challenge to accepted executive thinking.' In 1990, at the age of 'only' 44, I was accepted by both non-executive registers. I stressed my degrees in law, philosophy (including ethics), and sociology and business experience. This included founding several companies, one of which I steered to a full stock market quotation. I also became its chief executive. Would people be beating at my door? The result has been absolutely zero. I did not expect PRO-NED's sponsors (such as the Bank of England) to offer me anything, especially as I would have been pressing for a realignment of the pound and a dramatic drop in interest rates. But I hoped to be of use on a company board. The same fate has befallen most of the other names on the two registers. Despite the urgings of the Bank ous City organisations, most non-executives are still appointed mainly because of who they know, rather than what. But is this so surprising when most City institutions themselves have boards appointed in a similar manner? Indeed, the Bank of England itself needs a wider range of directors. Perhaps I should tear out some of my hair, join a golf club and make more influential friends.</p>

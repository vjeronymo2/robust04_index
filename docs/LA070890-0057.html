			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> L.A. STUDIES WATERS OFF REDONDO BEACH FOR SEWAGE OUTFALL;  </P> <P> POLLUTION: THE PLAN -- ONE OF THREE BEING CONSIDERED -- CALLS FOR DUMPING 350  MILLION GALLONS OF EFFLUENT A DAY.  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles is considering construction of a second ocean outfall  for its giant Hyperion sewage plant, and one of the three routes being studied  slices south into waters off Redondo Beach.  </P> <P> The proposal for another tunnel-sized outfall, which would be from three to  five miles long, is in its early planning stages. The city's Department of  Public Works has yet to receive approval for the estimated $170-million to  $200-million project from permitting agencies or the Los Angeles City Council.  And an environmental impact report will not be ready for public review until  March, 1991, at the earliest, officials say.  </P> <P> Still, the prospect of 350 million gallons of effluent per day entering South  Bay waters is already stirring local opposition.  </P> <P> "I'm very concerned," said Torrance City Councilman Dan Walker, who sits on a  state water panel that would have to review the outfall proposal. "We have the  best of a bad water quality situation in Santa Monica Bay, and now they want to  give us this."  </P> <P> Richard Bonham of the South Bay Boaters Assn., a grouping of King Harbor  boaters, said, "We've got to be very vigilant," and if the plan goes ahead "we  have to fight it tooth and nail."  </P> <P> Los Angeles officials say they are considering a new outfall because the  principal one in use cannot handle all the plant's effluent by force of gravity  alone, requiring the plant to use costly electric pumps.  </P> <P> These large pumps push the treated sewage through that outfall -- a  12-foot-diameter line that extends five miles almost due west from Hyperion --  when the flow from Hyperion exceeds a rate of 325 million gallons a day. Plant  Manager John Crosse says the pumps are in use 16 to 17 hours a day, running up  electric bills of $100,000 a month, or $1.2 million annually.  </P> <P> Another problem, officials say, is that occasional power outages idle the  pumps, and excess effluent is sent through an emergency outfall that discharges  just one mile offshore.  </P> <P> Sanitation officials argue that with Hyperion's sewage flows growing year by  year, future power failures could hold increasingly serious consequences --  especially during wet weather, when rainwater seeps into the system and sewage  flows are at their height.  </P> <P> "We could be receiving a billion gallons a day during wet weather after the  year 2000," Crosse said. "With only the five-mile outfall, the one-mile outfall  and no pumps, there's a potential we wouldn't be able to get the (sewage) out  of the plant. We'd flood the plant."  </P> <P> Crosse says Hyperion now handles an average flow of 365 million gallons daily,  with flows during the 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. peak hours reaching a rate of 500  million gallons a day. In wet weather peak flows have approached 700 million  gallons per day, he said.  </P> <P> City officials and a private consulting company are studying three main routes  for a new outfall. One would run alongside the current 5-mile line, another  would extend slightly to the north and the third would be angled southward,  toward the underwater Redondo Canyon off Redondo Beach.  </P> <P> Each route includes options for three-, four- or five-mile outfall lengths that  end in two branches, called diffusers, of several possible sizes. City  sanitation officials say they are considering 18 outfall variations in all.  </P> <P> Walter Naydo, the chief of construction at Hyperion, says the goal is to wind  up with a reinforced concrete pipeline that is 12 to 13 feet in diameter and  capable of handling a gravity flow of up to 350 million gallons of effluent  daily. The price, he says, would be $170 million to $200 million.  </P> <P> Naydo declined to say which of the three routes is preferred for the outfall,  but he said there are two engineering arguments against the southern option and  one in favor of it.  </P> <P> Unlike the comparatively smoother routes to the north, the southerly path  crosses rocky terrain that would be more difficult to build on. It also enters  a portion of the Palos Verdes Hills fault zone, making it more vulnerable to  earthquakes.  </P> <P> The route's chief benefit, however, is that the sea floor drops off more  sharply in the direction of the Redondo Canyon than it does along the other  routes. According to Naydo, that means the line doesn't have to be as long to  reach the depths at which effluent disperses adequately.  </P> <P> "The deeper you discharge the less chance there is that it will impact  near-shore areas," he said.  </P> <P> The first opportunity for public review of the proposal comes next March, after  release of the draft environmental impact report, but opponents of the  southerly route have been quick with criticism.  </P> <P> South Bay Boaters Assn. President Sandy Overland says her group is worried that  a sewage outfall in the area might damage marine life in the Redondo Beach  Canyon, which she described as a "darned good fishery." She questions the need  for building an outfall at all.  </P> <P> "We'd prefer they recycle (treated effluent) and use it to water parks and golf  courses, things like that," Overland said. "Let's try to save our water and  save our ocean at the same time."  </P> <P> Sanitation officials said such water reuse is already being done but cannot  begin to offset the increases in sewage expected from the current pace of  development.  </P> <P> Elected officials have also begun drawing a bead on the outfall issue.  </P> <P> Walker says that although "a good case can probably be made for an additional  outfall," it should be built near the current one, not extended into waters  that have not been subjected to outfall contaminants. Walker sits on the state  Regional Water Quality Control Board, one of the regulatory groups that would  have to rule on whether to allow the outfall project.  </P> <P> Redondo Beach Mayor Brad Parton agrees. "I wouldn't want to see (an outfall)  off Redondo Beach," Parton said, adding that Redondo Beach City Council members  share his view. "In the north part of the bay they've had 'Keep out of the  ocean' signs a lot more more than we have here. . . . This whole thing makes me  nervous."  </P> <P> John Dorsey, head biologist of the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation's  environmental monitoring division, says the ocean bottom off the beach cities  has not been completely free from outfall pollutants.  </P> <P> In past years, contaminants from the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts'  sewage outfalls off White Point have rounded the Palos Verdes Peninsula,  settling in sediment off the beach cities, he says.  </P> <P> But Dorsey, speaking for himself and not for his agency, says he sees merit in  the argument that a second outfall should not be extended into a new portion of  the bay.  </P> <P> "My personal feeling is that . . . you might as well run it as close to the  existing one as possible," Dorsey said, "not go to a whole different part of  the bay that hasn't seen all the effects (of an outfall)."  </P></p>

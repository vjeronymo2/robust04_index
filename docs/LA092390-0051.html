			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNITING DOWNTOWNS  </P> <P> I write concerning Steven E. Flusty's "An Unbiased Look at L.A.'s Heart Finds  It Does Have a Healthy Beat" (Sept. 2).  </P> <P> I find it ironic that Los Angeles and Berlin happen to be sister cities, both  having an invisible wall separating two economic worlds.  </P> <P> But I offer a solution.  </P> <P> In 1973, the Broadway Department Store vacated its once proud, stately building  for its present location in the Broadway Plaza. This signaled the beginning of  the great department stores leaving the once grand shopping corridor for better  economic locations.  </P> <P> But if the New York institution, Bloomingdale's, were wooed into opening a  branch store in Los Angeles in an extensively and beautifully renovated former  Broadway building, this would mean the birth of an exciting retail district. I  think the presence of this store would attract shoppers throughout Southern  California and many small and large businesses would want to open shops along  Broadway as well as Spring and Hill streets.  </P> <P> A Metrorail station is near completion that would connect that station with the  basement of the old Broadway building just like there is a subway station  connecting the Lexington Avenue subway lines to the basement entrance of  Bloomingdale's in Manhattan.  </P> <P> I know this can work. With the near-completion of the State Office Building,  Ira Yellin's ambitious plans for the Million Dollar Theatre and Grand Central  Market, and the final completion of California Plaza, the two halves of  downtown will finally be connected, which should ultimately produce retail and  pedestrian activity in the area.  </P> <P> RAYMOND J.

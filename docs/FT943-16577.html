			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Business Travel: Time travel to a flexible clock - Michael Skapinker divulges how he avoids jet lag I had resigned myself to watching US chat shows with presenters who burst into tears, when Lulu came to my rescue. I became an ardent viewer of chat shows on my last visit to the US. They appeared on television in the early hours, and from 2.20am onwards I was wide awake in my hotel room. Back home in London, it was 7.20am, my usual waking time. The chat shows were compelling. In one, the host asked his guest if she had had an unhappy childhood. She had. The host wept copiously, miraculously perking up in time for the commercial break. During the day, I paid for this indulgence. I battled to stay awake during interviews, felt hungry when I would have been eating in London, and had no appetite when I had to join people for meals in the US. There was, I thought, nothing that could be done about jet lag, until I read a book called Around the World in Eighty Ways, published by Wexas International, a club which organises travel for its members. The book is full of famous people's travel tips. Lulu, the pop star, gives this remedy for jet lag: do not eat on the aircraft. Diana Rigg, the actress, offers the same advice: 'While on board, eat as little as possible and drink as much as possible, preferably non-alcoholic. Sounds dull, but it works.' I have tried this twice now, on long trips in opposite directions. It is dull, but being in an aircraft is seldom thrilling. And it does work. On a day-time flight to the Caribbean, I did not avoid food entirely, eating just enough to keep hunger at bay. I drank every non-alcoholic drink I was offered. I had no jet lag at all. I followed the same routine on a trip to Hong Kong, with the added challenge that this was an overnight flight. I arrived in Hong Kong in mid-morning, having snatched a few hours sleep on the flight. I went straight to a welcome lunch and then on to two interviews, finishing in the early evening. I was slightly weary, but without the feeling that my mind and stomach were operating to a different clock. This is not the only way to avoid jet lag. In the same book, the actress Maureen Lipman says she heard it was a good idea to put brown wrapping paper, cut to the shape of an inner sole, inside your socks. She does not say whether she has tried it herself. Has anyone? Does it work? Answers on this or any other jet lag remedy to me on fax 071-873-4343.</p>

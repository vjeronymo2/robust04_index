			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Commons endorses plan to freeze MPs' pay MPS VOTED themselves a year-long pay freeze in the Commons last night after the government appeared to indicate they would receive an increase of at least 3.9 per cent from January 1994. A government motion advocating the freeze was convincingly carried by 321 votes to 103, a majority of 218. Opposition MPs who voted against pegging next year's salary at Pounds 30,854 included former shadow cabinet members Mr Gerald Kaufman and Mr Roy Hattersley as well as Sir David Steel of the Liberal Democrats. The government had previously staved off defeat on a cross-party amendment advocating that for pension purposes, MPs should be treated as if they had a 1.5 per cent pay increase from January instead of a freeze. This was defeated without a vote after Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, offered to consult with MPs' representatives over the possible alternative of 'building on' general provisions for additional voluntary contributions in pension schemes generally. That approach, he suggested, might better resolve the difficulties the amendment was designed to address by guaranteeing MPs a return on any additional money they might wish to contribute. Opening the debate, Mr Newton said that the government accepted the need for a clear link between MPs' salaries and an accepted Civil Service grade. However, the growing role of performance-related pay in the Civil Service meant that changes to existing arrangements - implemented in 1987 - were necessary. The government had 'no wish' to return to the situation where MPs had to decide on their own level of pay each year, Mr Newton said. On the basis of the link established by the 1987 resolution, backbenchers would have received a 3.9 per cent increase this year to Pounds 32,057. Mr Newton said the government did not wish MPs to be permanently disadvantaged by 3.9 per cent in relation to civil servants, implying they may get a rise of at least this magnitude from January 1 1994. He said that restraint in public expenditure was 'a necessary condition' of the government's ability to direct resources to areas of spending which should 'rightly be priorities'. He reminded MPs that public-sector pay rises were being limited to a maximum of 1.5 per cent for the year ahead. It was 'right for the government and the House as a whole to give a lead in exercising restraint'. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, claimed the government was trying to use MPs as a 'stalking horse' to attack and undermine the position of others in the public sector. By freezing MPs' pay, the government hoped to create 'an illusion of fairness - that the highest paid are taking their fair share,' she argued. In fact, senior civil servants and judges would next year receive more than MPs and more than 1.5 per cent. Mrs Beckett urged MPs to consider their overall incomes before they voted. More than 50 of the Tory backbenchers who signed a Commons early day motion in support of the government's position had other declared interests.</p>

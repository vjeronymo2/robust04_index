			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: BLACK BOX BEGINS PROGRAM TO REFINANCE PART OF DEBT  </P> <P> Black Box Inc. of Simi Valley has started a program to refinance some of its  debt, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> Black Box is the parent company of Micom Communications of Simi Valley, which  makes devices that allow computers to "talk" to each other, and Black Box  Corp., a Lawrence, Pa., mail-order business for data communications products.  </P> <P> Black Box Inc. was taken private as part of a $334-million leveraged buyout of  the former Micom Systems in September, 1988, by the New York investment firm  Odyssey Partners.  </P> <P> Black Box said it will seek to exchange all of its outstanding subordinated  debt for new debentures. It is also seeking the consent of holders of a certain  class of preferred stock to changes in the terms of the stock, including  reductions in the rate by which dividends are accrued and the implementation of  certain conversion and redemption rights.  </P> <P> Although Black Box is private, the company said it notified the SEC of the  refinancing program because it now has a "shelf" registration on file with the  commission. That means the company, by updating financial reports to the SEC,  can later do an initial public offering with a minimum of administrative  preparation.  </P></p>

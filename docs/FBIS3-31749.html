			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today in Bratislava, Augustin Marian Husak, deputy  speaker of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, received  in the parliamentary building Yevgeniy Primakov, director of the  Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation.  (Tatyana Samolis), Yevgeniy Primakov's spokeswoman, stressed  that talks on cooperation between Russian and Slovak  intelligence services were in no case aimed against third  countries. She described the fight against international crime  as forming the priority area of cooperation. At the same time,  she denied that the talks had any connection with the present  political situation in Slovakia, one of the reasons being that  the visit was prepared some time ago. Later, our editor Ivan  Samel interviewed Augustin Marian Huska about the content of the  discussion:    [Begin recording] [Huska] The main concern of the discussion  was to ensure that such a delicate area as the area of mutual  relations in the field of information, the provision of  confidential information, and the like assumes a level  corresponding to that existing in democratic countries. We  talked about the geopolitical situation of Slovakia and Russia.  We expressed our desire that we no longer support the polarity  that existed in the world previously.    [Samel] You talked about geopolitical interests. Did you  also hear any negative comments concerning possible Slovakia's  entry into NATO?    [Huska] We made it on the whole quite clear that there was  in  the Slovak National Council a majority will to achieve  integration in European economic and defense structures. Our  guest did not voice any objections to it.    [Samel] Did you talk only about cooperation between the  intelligence services at a political level, or were  consultations on the fight against drugs and similar matters  also discussed?    [Huska] One could say that topic formed the biggest part of  the problem where cooperation is needed most. We both have  recognized that we are not professional enough to conduct the  fight against organized international crime.    [Samel] Did you also talk about some questions concerning  the  internal political situation in this country, and did this visit  have any connection with this situation?    [Huska] We talked about these matters only marginally in the  sense that stability is very fragile or, to put it better, that  the political situation both in this country and in Russia is  unstable and that what we are endeavoring to achieve in Slovakia  is to create a consensus among political parties and movements  so that the interest of the state becomes a category that is not  subject to contention between individual political forces.    [Samel] Do you not regard it as dangerous to a certain  degree  to establish certain contacts at this delicate level precisely  in the situation of instability, and here I have in mind  instability in Russia?    [Huska] The problem lies simply in whether we should wait  until various sections of Russian or Chechen mafias establish  themselves in this country.    [Samel] That is clear from our viewpoint, but what was the  interest on the Russian side?    [Huska] To check to what extent parliamentary bodies  indentify themselves with the overall trend towards the  elimination of polarization in Europe, with the overall trend  towards Europe drawing closer together, and towards the  protection of state interests. The notion about the  inviolability of frontiers made by both sides was very  important. [end recording]</p>

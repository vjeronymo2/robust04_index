			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: How Fidelity bounced back - In the first of a new series, Philip Coggan looks at a fund with aggressive instincts - Unit Trusts FIDELITY Special Situations was one of the first four funds launched by the US fund management group when it moved into Britain in 1989. Anthony Bolton, who has managed the trust from the start, says it is run as an aggressive fund, prepared to invest in companies in which other people are not interested. The concentration tends, accordingly, to be on the less-analysed, medium-sized and small company stocks, with only 5-10 per cent of the fund in the FT-SE 100 index. This can lead the fund into trouble during recessions when, for safety reasons, investors favour the more heavily-traded big capitalisation stocks. As the graph shows, the trust performed poorly over the period from late 1989 to September 1992. Investors who bought at the 1989 peak waited 3 1/2 years before they got their money back. Part of the problem, admits Bolton, was that the portfolio contained too many disasters  - stocks where the investment was lost totally, such as Parkfield, Davies &amp; Newman or Babcock Prebon. But he adds that some of the companies which he backed steadfastly through the recession, participating in rescue rights issues, have turned up trumps in the past nine months. Tie Rack, for example, has risen nearly sixfold from its low. Since the pound's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism, the bid price has risen more than 70 per cent. That places the fund second in the UK equity growth sector over the year to July 1, with growth of 37.3 per cent (offer-to-bid with income re-invested, according to Micropal). The only fund ahead of Special Situations over that period is Fidelity's Recovery trust. The relative performance of Special Situations over 10 years is also very strong. It is third out of 50 funds over the period, with growth of 484.9 per cent. Over five years, it is 23rd out of 115 in the sector, reflecting an increase of 59.8 per cent. It is only over the three-year period, where the ranking slips to 63rd of 136, that the relative performance looks unimpressive. Bolton says that people tended to opt for Fidelity's American fund in the early years because of the group's US origins. It took time to build up a record in the UK. The strong growth achieved by the fund in the mid-1980s helped turn it into one of the largest in the sector and, by last month, it had grown to a healthy Pounds 345m. Bolton feels that is too large to be run by one man, and he relies on a dozen analysts who between them follow every stock in the fund. The portfolio owns 104 companies and adheres to a strict stock-picking approach, leading to an eclectic choice of companies. The largest holding is in WPP, the advertising group run by Martin Sorrel which over-reached itself by aggressive expansion in the 1980s. Bolton says the company, having survived two financial reconstructions, should benefit from a consumer-led recovery, although he is reducing his stake after a good run for the shares over the past year. The second largest stake is in VSEL, the submarine group. Bolton explains: 'There is a hole in the order book after 1997 which makes many people nervous, but the company is piling up cash.' His next-largest holding is in News International, Rupert Murdoch's UK publishing company. Other large holdings include recovery plays such as Mirror Group and Wickes and Burton, and 'undervalued situations' such as St James's Place Capital and Security Services  - where Bolton believes the market has not recognised the value of stakes in, respectively, J. Rothschild Assurance and Cellnet. Bolton also has a substantial stake in Granada, where he has high hopes for the group's interest in the satellite TV station BSkyB. The trust is run with the aim of capital growth, which means Bolton has no dividend yield constraints on his investment policy. Only accumulation units are on offer, so this is not a fund for income-seekers. Charges The initial charge on the units is 5.25 per cent and the bid-offer spread on July 6 was around 6 per cent. The annual charge is 1.5 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000. On the savings scheme, the minimum monthly investment is Pounds 50. There is a 1 per cent reduction in the initial charge for those who continue to save for two years. Anyone who invests Pounds 100 or more a month gets 1 per cent off the initial charge immediately, and a further 1 per cent discount after two years. Special Situations qualifies for a Pep. Fidelity has a low initial Pep charge of 2 per cent, but it does impose exit fees on those who sell during the first three years. The exit fee is 3 per cent in year one, 2 per cent in year two and 1 per cent in year three. Accordingly, those who hold their investment for three years will see lower charges inside a Pep than outside it.</p>

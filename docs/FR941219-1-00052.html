			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 for endangered plant species set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered plants. With respect to the four plants from the four counties in northern California, all trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export; deliver, receive, carry, transport, or ship in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity; sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce; or remove and reduce to possession federally listed plant species from areas under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously damage or destroy any such plant species on any area under Federal jurisdiction; or remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such plant species on any other area in knowing violation of any State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. Seeds from cultivated specimens of threatened plant taxa are exempt from these prohibitions provided that a statement ``of cultivated origin'' appears on the shipping containers. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered or threatened plant species under certain circumstances. The Service anticipates few trade permits would ever be sought or issued for the four species because the plants are not common in cultivation or in the wild. Requests for copies of the regulations on listed plants and inquiries regarding them may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181 (503/231&hyph;6241; FAX 503/231&hyph;6243).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments Solicited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible.

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Manx Budget aids business THE ISLE of Man government yesterday presented to Tynwald, the island's parliament, a Budget designed to spread the benefits from the island's thriving economy among less well-off residents and increase aid for business ahead of the island's autumn general election. The island, a crown dependency, has its own parliament and manages its own financial arrangements, including setting its level of taxation. The Manx government will give an initial allowance of 100 per cent on new capital expenditure for industrial, tourist and agricultural buildings. Mr Donald Gelling, the Manx treasury minister, said he wanted to assist business, while 'seeking to ensure adequate funding for the provision of enhanced public services and for assistance to the less well-off'.</p>

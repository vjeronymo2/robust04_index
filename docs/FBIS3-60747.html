			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ole Mathismoen: ``Fear of Nuclear Transit </F> Through Norway'']    [Text] ``It seems a likely possibility that stolen nuclear  materials is being transported through Norway.''    This is said by Erling Stranden, who is the director of the  Department for Preparedness and Security at the National  Radiation Protection Board. Stranden says that it is not  inconceivable that the thieves who stole three fuel rods from  military storage in Murmansk either have smuggled the stolen  goods out through Finnmark or that they will try to do so.  ``Norway could definitely be part of a smuggling route,'' he  says.    Thomas Nilsen from Bellona, having worked with nuclear  threats in the north for many years, agrees: ``Inspection at the  border crossing at Storskog should be considerably improved. I  have crossed the border about 40 times since 1988. My luggage  has never been inspected; either on the Norwegian or on the  Russian side. According to our sources it has been possible for  a long time to buy different types of radioactive materials on  the streets of Murmansk. Almost anything can be obtained at Kola  as long as one has dollars. As customers for these kinds of  materials are found in other countries, it is probable that  Norway will be part of a smuggling route,'' Nilsen says.  <H5>  Easy To Smuggle </H5>   Last night it became clear that the three fuel rods are 1  meter long and have a diameter of 5-6 cm. They are unused and  were to be used in the reactor of one of the many nuclear  submarines at Kola. It is thought to be a simple affair to  transport three such metal pipes without being discovered.    As the rods are unused, radiation is minimal. They are  therefore relatively harmless to the thieves, as well as  unsuitable as a terrorist weapon. Used rods could have been  dumped in sources of drinking water, and so on, and poisonous  plutonium, strontium, and cesium would have caused enormous  damage. But as these three rods are unused, they are relatively  harmless. They contain mainly highly enriched uranium. Even with  a geiger counter the rods would be hard to detect.    Departmental Director Stranden at the National Radiation  Protection Board says that it would hardly be noticeable on the  geiger counter if measured from the outside of a car that had  the rods in the trunk. ``However, had a customs inspector found  the three suspect metal tubes and measured them directly, the  radiation would have been noticeable,'' Stranden says.    Consul General Knut Hauge in Murmansk thinks there is no  immediate reason to fear that Norway will become a transit  country for stolen Russian nuclear equipment: ``We must of  course be prepared, but the control at the Norwegian-Russian  border is, in my opinion, so good that this route is probably  not the most attractive one out of Russia,'' Hauge says.  <H5>  Good for Bombs </H5>   As the three fuel rods were to be used in nuclear  submarines,  the uranium in the rods is probably highly enriched--up to 90  percent. That makes the uranium suitable for bomb production. To  make even a small nuclear bomb, however, 5 to 10 kilos of  uranium is needed. The three short rods are not big enough to  contain that much. Russian authorities have not disclosed how  much uranium the rods contained.    Sources within nuclear circles in Murmansk yesterday  afternoon informed the Norwegian consulate general in that city  that since the rods are unused, it is unthinkable that they can  be used for terrorist purposes. However, the uranium can be  extracted from the rods and be used, for instance to produce  bombs, according to Russian sources.    Stranden agrees: ``Even though there is not enough uranium  in  these rods to make a bomb, it could be a first step for  countries wanting to develop nuclear arms. We know there are  nations having the technology and knowledge to make bombs, but  which lack highly enriched materials,'' Stranden says to  AFTENPOSTEN.  <H5>  Planned Theft </H5>   The theft was discovered in the middle of the day on 27  November in connection with a routine control. Police in  Murmansk so far do not know anything further as to when the rods  were stolen, but have asked for help from the public. The rods  were stolen from a storage facility at the military Rosta  shipyard in the northern Lenin area of Murmansk.    According to Hauge the police in Murmansk take it as a given  that this was a theft to order. ``The thieves obviously knew  what they were looking for, and according to the police, they  were familiar with the shipyard,'' he says. The fact that the  police are asking for help in a military theft is regarded as  sensational.    Spokesmen for the National Radiation Protection Board in  Norway, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and others  reiterated yesterday how frightening it is that such a theft can  happen. ``But we had to take into account that such things might  happen in today's Russia,'' says spokesman for the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs Ingvard Havnen.    When the Soviet Union collapsed, much of government control  disappeared. At the same time much of the control of Russia's  many nuclear installations disappeared.    As late as two to three weeks ago a couple of kilos of  Russian uranium was discovered by Turkish police. And just over  a week ago fuel rods were stolen from the Ignalina power plant  in Lithuania.    Nilsen thinks that the danger of radioactive materials  falling into the hands of terrorists or others with no  legitimate reason to possess them pose a greater security risk  in the north than the nuclear reactors themselves. He refers to  many episodes on the Kola peninsula as proof that security  measures are terrible.    In 1992 KGB agents carried out an arranged ``attack''  against  the nuclear icebreaker Sibir at the Murmansk docks. The agents  were able to get as far as to the reactor section before they  were discovered. The KGB did this to show how poor nuclear  security in the country has become. In the same year a Russian  television journalist was able to smuggle 200 grams of cesium  out of Atomflot, the icebreaker base in Murmansk. This comes in  addition to small fires in nuclear submarines and near accidents  at the nuclear power plant in Kola. Nilsen also refers to the  two occasions when he visited this nuclear power plant: ``Both  times we were shown around deep down in the reactor areas and in  the important control rooms without anyone checking our  luggage.''  <H5>  No Fuss in Murmansk </H5>   The nuclear theft has not frightened the city's inhabitants.    Yesterday morning the city's people could read an  announcement in the local paper that three fuel rods had been  discovered stolen from a storage area in town last Saturday. It  further announced that an investigating committee had been  formed consisting of 18 people, from the military prosecuting  authorities, from the counter espionage groups, and from the  police respectively. A special telephone number for tips to the  police was established for this purpose.    Hauge in Murmansk says that nobody in the city is concerned  about such matters as long as there is no danger of an increase  in radiation in the near vicinity. ``It was not even mentioned  in the local news this evening. I have tried all day to call the  police using the published hot-line number, but nobody  answered,'' Hauge said last night.</p>

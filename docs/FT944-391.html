			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Government ostrich-like on workers' rights Sir, The interesting juxtaposition of your leader, 'Time to debate worker rights' (December 22) and Samuel Brittan's article, 'The follies of the macho manager', points to the conclusion that since 'labour is now plentiful and cheaper than it used to be' (Brittan) reasonable improvements in employee rights are unlikely to damage competitiveness and labour market flexibility. As you say, the argument to the contrary, put at its most forceful by the government, can be overdone. Employment secretary Michael Portillo leads the attack, wholly undaunted by the opposition of 11 other member states, the European Commission and the European parliament. At a recent Confederation of British Industry conference, his minister of state, Ann Widdecombe, vigorously defended the UK's opt-out from the social chapter. She also attacked the directive on the establishment of European works councils, recently adopted by the 11, before a sceptical audience of UK employers who were, in the main, planning compliance with the directive for their EU operations, including those in the UK, following the lead of United Biscuits. Her powerful rhetoric was met with a slightly embarrassed silence. On employee rights issues, the government adopts an uncritical pro-employer organisation line to which many big employers pay lip-service but do not support in practice. Absence of constructive criticism at the draft stage leads to directives - and that on European works councils is a good example  -being adopted by the EU in a half-baked form. Worse, if in due course the UK decides to opt in, it is likely it will be bound to implement a series of directives on which there has been no formal UK input. Surely the economic added value of EU membership should be shared partly in the form of improved social benefits for workers where these can be delivered without prejudicing competitiveness? The rectification of the anomalous position of part-time workers under UK law was long overdue. Equally, the burden on UK multinational employers of complying with the EWC directive has been exaggerated. The government's ostrich-like attitude to the European Court of Justice's interpretation of the acquired rights directive and equal pay legislation, and the consequential costs incurred by the taxpayer, ought to direct its attention to the starting point of the debate you favour. The knee jerk as an instrument of policy is ripe for replacement. Also, with Labour so far in front in the polls, a rational examination of employment rights and their place in a market economy could produce a political dividend for the Conservatives.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Carmen Elida Contreras] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, the opposition party Democratic  Revolutionary Party [PRD] announced they will form an alliance  with the Liberal Republican Party and the Labor Party [Pala].  According to PRD presidential candidate Ernesto Perez  Balladares, this alliance will be the great coalition against  hunger, unemployment, and mismanagement.    Balladares stated: "I believe the great alliance will be one  against hunger, unemployment, neglect, and government  inefficiency, and the alliance is already formed."    At a meeting of the National Directorate, some 296 PRD  members approved their party's alliance with Pala and the  Liberal Party and confirmed their support for the presidential  ticket headed by Perez Balladares with Tomas Gabriel Altamirano  Duque and Felipe Virzi as first and second vice presidents,  respectively.    Perez Balladares criticized Arnulfist Party candidate Mireya  de Gruber's and former comptroller general Ruben Dario Carles'  programs. Carles is supported by the Civic Renewal Party,  Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement], and the  National Renewal Movement [Morena]. Balladares argued the two  tickets reflect "the official state of affairs and contain the  same proposals but in different packages."    Perez Balladares, who did not reject the possibility of  other  nonofficial groups joining his alliance before 8 February, said:  "It is not a matter of sharing the cake, but of sharing an idea,  a program. It is a matter of reaching an agreement as to the  basis for a program."    Perez Balladares criticized candidates such as Carles, de  Gruber, and Arias Calderon, who "live in and cling to the past"  and who "will blatantly fail in 1994" when the problems and  situations have changed.    The PRD's directorate reiterated its support for mayoral,  legislator, and alternate-legislator candidates nominated by its  new allies.    Meanwhile, Pala, which also held its political convention  yesterday, restated its decision to form an alliance with the  PRD and the Liberal Republican Party, and nominated the Perez  Balladares-Altamirano-Virzi presidential ticket.    Pala President Carlos Lopez Guevara pointed out that  although  Pala is not represented on the presidential ticket, all the  members support a "Torrijist alliance" to reach power together  next May.    At its convention yesterday, the Republican Liberal Party  unanimously supported the alliance and presidential ticket led  by Perez Balladares.</p>

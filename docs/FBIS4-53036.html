			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with new Justice Minister Hiroshi Nakai by an </F> unidentified YOMIURI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Former Justice Minister Shigeto  Nagano resigned because of his remarks on the Japan-China war.    [Nakai] There is no doubt that after invading Nanjing, the  former Japanese army committed cruel deeds on ordinary Chinese  people. Japan has to have a feeling of deep remorse and apology  not only for the Nanjing massacre, but also for its numerous  acts of aggression and colonial rule during the war.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How do you plan to deal with severe  criticism from various countries about Nagano's remarks?    [Nakai] The justice minister is not in a position to take  diplomatic action. But Nagano's remarks disgraced Japan's  diplomacy and inflicted mental scars on many peoples.  Therefore, as a successor to Nagano, I would like to take care  of this issue if the prime minister asks me to do so. Mr.  Nagano, however, took responsibility for causing trouble to the  nation and the cabinet. I think, with his resignation, other  countries will understand Japan's view of the war.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Defense Agency Director General Kanda  recently made remarks in favor of exercising the right to  collective defense. Foreign Minister Kakizawa also expressed a  positive stance on enacting legislation for emergencies.    [Nakai] It is quite right that Dietmen and the people voice  various different views on the Constitution and other issues.  But as a cabinet member, I have to protect the Constitution and  respect its longstanding interpretation by previous governments.  I have no intention to make comments on and participate in the  constitutional arguments as justice minister.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the power of the  justice minister over the public prosecutor general?    [Nakai] I am fully aware that the authority is stipulated by  law. But I have no intention to take action to intervene in  individual problems.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Currently, such basic laws as the civil  law are being reviewed.    [Nakai] Things are changing at a rapid pace. Sense of value  has also changed greatly. While considering this, the  government should, if necessary, revise laws by seeking a  national consensus and through in-depth discussions.</p>

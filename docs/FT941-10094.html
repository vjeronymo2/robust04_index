			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Argentina to widen wealth tax Argentina plans to broaden its wealth tax to include holdings in the previously exempt financial system. The government sent a bill to Congress this week that will tax financial assets such as shares, bonds and bank deposits at 0.5 per cent a year. These assets are currently untaxed to encourage saving. The government says it will maintain tax exemptions for foreigners. Previously, the wealth tax was payable only on assets such as cars, yachts and property worth over Dollars 100,000. The threshold remains unchanged, although the government will halve the tax from 1 per cent. Mr Daniel Artana, chief economist at Fiel, a private economic research foundation, said: 'This is nothing to get upset about. The financial system still receives a favourable tax treatment.' However he said the government should redouble efforts to raise revenues by further reducing tax evasion. Economists believe the government decided to tax holdings in the financial system to make up for declining tax revenues elsewhere. The changes are expected to triple wealth tax revenues to about Dollars 350m a year.</p>

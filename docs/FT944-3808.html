			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Essen Summit: Europe recovers its sense of direction - End of an era as Mitterrand and Delors bow out / Challenge of enlargement lies ahead On Saturday afternoon, toward the end of the Essen summit, the television cameras captured a glimpse of the new Europe in the making. The shot took in the 12 existing members of the Union; Austria, Finland and Sweden, which will join on January 1; and, for the first time, six leaders of central and eastern Europe. At the head of this extended European family stood the towering father figure, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany. Mr Kohl was at his irrepressible best in Essen. He thundered against the Euro-pessimists. He prodded colleagues into compromise. And he offered a heartfelt tribute to Mr Jacques Delors, praising the outgoing Commission president as 'one of the very few' in Europe who had supported German unification in the summer of 1989. The upshot was a solid, harmonious summit which restored a sense of direction to the European Union. Leaders reached a consensus on the big economic issues of the day, balancing the need to strengthen competitiveness with a commitment to better training and help for the long-term unemployed. On foreign affairs, the German-led push to build a wider Europe to the east was offset by a new Mediterranean strategy which will mean more aid for the EU's southern periphery, notably North Africa. The Union's watchword is consolidation. In western Europe, leaders know that they must continue to squeeze budget deficits and inflation with higher-than-desirable interest rates, the goal being to keep alive the hope of monetary union by the end of the century. All leaders appear committed to this course, including Mr John Major, the British prime minister - though he is not yet prepared to say if the UK intends to sign up to a single currency. Consolidation also applies to the six associated states in eastern Europe. As Mr Kohl stressed on Saturday, they must bear the main burden of transforming their former command economies so they are ready to withstand competition inside the single European market. All six - Poland, Hungary, the Czech republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania - will receive a blueprint or 'pre-accession strategy' next spring setting out the steps they must take for future membership. The Baltic states and Slovenia will follow suit once they conclude negotiations for associate membership in 1995. More broadly, it was clear that Essen marked the end of an era. First comes the departure of Mr Delors after 10 years in Brussels. His successor is Mr Jacques Santer, the Luxembourg prime minister, a man who prides himself on playing safe and avoiding unnecessary action. Just as significant was the final appearance of a frail-looking President Francois Mitterrand at a European Council summit. The memory of the front-row French press rising in honour of the man who has ruled France since 1981 will linger; so too, the French president's gentle teasing of Mr Edouard Balladur, the patrician prime minister who is desperately seeking to cover up differences on Europe within his own ruling Gaullist party. 'In life, nothing can be done without difficulty,' said Mr Mitterrand, clearly suffering from the effects of chemotherapy, 'nothing can be done in human society without pain.' The Delors-Kohl-Mitterrand axis has been the most important alliance inside the Union for the past decade. The Franco-German troika drove forward the plans for European monetary union, brushing aside the doubters led by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then UK prime minister. Yet the end product - the Maastricht treaty - was an uneasy compromise between supra-national decision-making and loose inter-governmental co-operation. The big question is whether this compromise will hold, or whether new deeper forms of integration must be found to cope with a Union which may contain as many as 27 members early next century. It is the essence of the 1996 inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty. On Friday night, Mr Delors gave what participants described as a fascinating first look at these questions. He spelled out that a new, expanded Union would require reducing the number of Commissioners; changing the system of six-monthly rotating presidencies; altering the weighted voted system which gives smaller states a disproportionate influence over decision-making; and introducing more majority voting. But he also made clear that the EU would have to reform its own policies to cope with eastern enlargement, including reform of the common agricultural policy and the multi-billion-ecu structural funds. Each of these matters is highly contentious. Yet without change there cannot be a Great Leap Forward to the east. The challenge for EU leaders - barely begun at Essen - will be to prepare public opinion. Only that way can the mistakes of Maastricht be avoided.</p>

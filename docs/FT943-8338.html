			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Fall in inflation eases fears of early move to raise rates: Underlying rate of 2.2% a 27-year low; FT-SE 100 climbs 43 points A surprise fall in underlying UK inflation to its lowest level for 27 years and a subdued rise in unit labour costs yesterday dispelled fears that the government would have to move quickly to raise interest rates. The news buoyed UK financial markets, with the FT-SE 100 Index rising 43 points to close at 3,190.3. However, gilts, which rose more than a point in the morning, eased later in response to weakness on European bond markets. The underlying inflation rate, which excludes mortgage interest payments, fell from 2.4 per cent in June to 2.2 per cent in July, the lowest annual rate in the series which began in 1975. The Central Statistical Office said, using equivalent statistics, it was also the lowest rate since 1967. Underlying inflation is well within the lower half of the 1-4 per cent target range, which the government had set for the end of this parliamentary term. Including mortgage payments, the retail prices index fell by 0.5 per cent between June and July, partly due to heavy discounting in summer sales. However, the CSO said the fall may have been exaggerated slightly because discounting in the sales occurred later this year than in 1993. The annual rate fell to 2.3 per cent in July from 2.6 in June. The Treasury welcomed the inflation data as 'very good news', adding that underlying inflation had now been running under 3 per cent for 10 successive months - the first such period since 1964. The good news on retail prices was reinforced by average earnings data, which showed the underlying annual increase in average earnings was unchanged at 3.75 per cent in June. Combined with a rise in productivity, this meant that unit labour costs in manufacturing in the three months to June were only 0.1 per cent higher than a year previously. Such a small increase indicates that cost pressures on manufacturers are subdued. Analysts felt the inflation figures would make it more difficult for the Bank of England to argue for an early rise in base rates, currently at 5.25 per cent, when the governor, Mr Eddie George, next meets Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, on September 7. The Institute of Directors yesterday warned against a premature rate rise. 'While recovery is continuing it is not yet in the bag and could easily be blown off course,' said Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director-general. Nevertheless, with Mr George having repeatedly indicated that the trigger for interest rate rises would not be current inflation, but expectations two years hence, some analysts said today's retail sales figures could provide an equally significant guide to movements in rates. The inflation news overshadowed employment data, which suggested the recovery was still not leading to the creation of full-time jobs. Although unemployment continued to fall in July, the 11,800 decline was below City forecasts. The number of people out of work and claiming benefit in July was 2,631,500, or 9.3 per cent of the workforce, on a seasonally adjusted basis. Meanwhile, figures from the Labour Force Survey, which was conducted between March and May, indicated an 80,000 rise in employment in the spring of this year, but showed that the new jobs were mainly part-time.

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Recorded crimes up 16% in year THE NUMBER of recorded crimes in England and Wales rose 16 per cent to 5.3m last year, with crime up in all 43 police-force areas. Mr John Patten, home office minister, said the figures showed a 'welcome slowdown' in the rate of increase. Figures for October 1990 to September last year showed a record 19 per cent annual rise. Mr Roy Hattersley, shadow home secretary, said the figures were 'truly appalling'. Labour said the figures had been released some weeks earlier than usual to avoid their release during the general election campaign. The government said they had been released yesterday 'because they were ready'. Violent crime increased 6 per cent last year, although crimes of violence accounted for only 5 per cent of all offences. Car crimes accounted for nearly a third of the overall increase of 730,000 offences. Police cleared up 1.5m crimes last year, an increase of 7 per cent, but this was outweighed by the rise in recorded offences. As a result, the clear-up rate fell 3 per cent to 29 per cent of the total.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Germany and Italy steady ahead of elections ELECTIONS AT the weekend sent investors to the sidelines in Frankfurt and Milan while higher interest rates depressed other continental bourses, writes Antonia Sharpe. FRANKFURT failed to continue Thursday's advance as buying interest dried up ahead of the weekend's state elections. The results are not expected to have an impact on the stock market next week, since the opposition SPD party is likely to defend successfully its seat in Schleswig-Holstein and any damage suffered by the ruling CDU party in Baden-Wurttemberg should be offset by support from its FDP coalition partner. Only a serious loss for the CDU would be seen as negative for the stock market. The DAX index traded in a narrow seven-point range before closing 2.03 lower at 1,719.63, up 0.5 per cent on the week, while the FAZ index, calculated at mid-session, rose 1.29 to 702.24, for a rise of 0.9 per cent on the week. Turnover fell from DM6.2bn to DM4.5bn. Blue chips were mixed, as Deutsche Bank fell DM3 to DM712 after its disappointing 1991 results on Thursday. But Veba bucked the easier trend, rising DM1.30 to DM389.20 in good volume of 761,440 shares. The stock has added 3 per cent since March 25, when it announced a DM1 rise in its 1992 dividend to DM12. Dealers said the diversified electricity utility was also regarded as a potential takeover target, since it had no large shareholders to defend its independence. MILAN closed mixed on position-squaring ahead of this weekend's general election, which could turn out to be a turning point in Italian politics. The Comit index rose 0.13 to 508.90, up 2.2 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at near to Friday's L101.6bn. Generali lent some support to the market, rising L100 to L29,400 but other leading blue chips were lower, with Fiat falling L45 to L4,185. San Paolo, which was listed on Thursday, fell L25 to L12,215. STOCKHOLM fell on worries about higher interest rates. The Affarsvarlden General Index dropped 12.90 to 980.5, down 2.6 per cent on the week, in steady turnover of SKr409m. Short-term interest rates points since Thursday, on concerns about a rise in Swedish capital outflows and higher interest rates in Finland. HELSINKI had a turbulent day on speculation over a further devaluation in the markka. The HEX index ended 1.6 per cent higher at 801.4. ZURICH concentrated on Roche after the pharmaceutical company announced an unexpectedly strong 56 per cent rise in 1991 group profits to SFr1.48bn. Roche certificates added SFr40 to SFr3,120 but closed below the day's high on profit-taking. Roche bearers added SFr50 to SFr4,350. The SMI index eased 8.9 to 1,829.1, depressed by firmer interest rates and a weaker Swiss franc, but was little changed on the week. AMSTERDAM closed mixed as a weaker dollar and a drop on the London stock exchange weighed on international stocks. The CBS Tendency Index fell 0.5 to 124.7 but was steady on the week. Heineken closed Fl 1.90 higher at Fl 191.20, off an early high of Fl 193.50. The brewer said yesterday that it planned to export beer to Germany from 1993. But some analysts were worried that Heineken's problems in Spain would bring additional costs which were not yet provided for. MADRID was unable to shake off this week's gloom, as the general index fell 2.12 to 250.55, down 2.4 per cent on the week. OSLO was dragged down by shipping stocks. The all-share index dropped 4.79, or 1.1 per cent, to 415.78 in moderate turnover of NKr245.94m. Bergesen was one of the day's biggest losers, falling below NKr100 for the first time since early 1991. Its A shares fell NKr3 to NKr97.50 while the B shares shed NKr5.50 to NKr97.00. BRUSSELS continued to focus on retailers, which accounted for more than one third of the day's turnover of BFr580m. The Bel-20 index closed down 4.47 to 1,188.55, little changed on the week. Colruyt closed up BFr10 at BFr4,755, GIB added BFr4 to BFr1,376 and Delhaize closed down BFr80 at BFr9,330.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - APR 3  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Hourly changes   Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1147.78  1147.56  1145.55  1145.81  1145.95  1145.85  1145.73  1144.60  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              Day's High  1147.91    Day's Low  1144.27  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            Apr 2     Apr 1     Mar 31    Mar 30    Mar 27           1149.08   1141.13   1149.80   1145.80   1140.84  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

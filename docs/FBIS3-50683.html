			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Roberto Magalhaes, PFL-PE, Liberal </F> Front Party-Pernambuco, Congressional Investigating Committee,  CPI, rapporteur, by Marcelo de Moraes in Brasilia; date not  given]    [Text] [De Moraes] Deputy Roberto Magalhaes' patience is on  the verge of exhaustion. Annoyed at seeing how congressmen have  manipulated the national budget over the past few years, the  rapporteur of the CPI that is investigating the budget mafia has  pledged to include in his report all those whose involvement in  corrupt practices has been duly proven.    The effort of examining all the documents has consumed  Magalhaes' time and health. He wants to submit his report by 15  January and has been working day and night drafting the report.  Not even the bad cold he caught last week made him slacken up a  little. He said: It does not matter if I am running a  temperature or am sick. The CPI cannot come to a grinding halt.    Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) [Progressive Renewal  Party-Para] follows in Magalhaes' footsteps. He went to  Congress to work as usual yesterday. Both Passarinho and  Magalhaes know the public demand great responsibility from the  CPI.    Even though he did not want to preannounce the names of  congressmen whose removal he will recommend, Magalhaes made it  clear that Senator Ronaldo Aragao (PMDB-RO) [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party-Roraima] and Deputy Carlos Benevides  (PMDB-CE) [Ceara], who made a deposition this past week, will be  on the list. Furthermore, those congressmen who are sure to  appear in the report include Deputies Joao Alves (no party-BA)  [Bahia], Cid Carvalho (PMDB-MA) [Maranhao], Manoel Moreira  (PMDB-SP) [Sao Paulo], Jose Geraldo Ribeiro (PMDB-MG] [Minas  Gerais], Genebaldo Correia (PMDB-BA), Fabio Raunheitti (PTB-RJ)  [Brazilian Labor Party-Rio de Janeiro], and Joao de Deus Antunes  (PPR-RS) [Rio Grande do Sul]. Feres Nader (PTB-RJ), a  substitute member, will also appear. The following congressmen  may also be on the list: Ibsen Pinheiro (PMDB-RS), Ricardo Fiuza  (PFL-PE), Sergio Guerra (PSB-PE) [Brazilian Socialist Party],  Jose Carlos Vasconcellos (PRN-PE) [National Reconstruction  Party], Paes Landim (PFL-PI) [Piaui], Flavio Derzi (PP-MS)  [Popular Party-Mato Grosso do Sul], and Raquel Candido (PTB-RO).    The CPI probe into the budget mafia is drawing to an end. In  your capacity as CPI rapporteur, how do you feel at his moment?    [Magalhaes] I am becoming terribly indignant at what I  consider very serious cases. There have been incredible and  long-standing manipulations of the national budget. There was a  huge irregular scheme afoot within the Budget Committee. These  cases are most grave. I can no longer stand to see all this.    [De Moraes] What impression did Senator Aragao's deposition  create on you?    [Magalhaes] Just to put you in the picture, a senator  manages  to get appropriations amounting to $600,000 for a foundation  that bears his name and is located in Rondonia. I think that  more than half the congressmen have never had assets of a  comparable value. He used some of that money to buy three  ambulances from a company he established and the vehicles are  conspicuous by their absence. And so the story continues.    [De Moraes] Did the deposition of Deputy Carlos Benevides  also irritate you?    [Magalhaes] That is another incredible case. An individual  chose 54 institutions that now receive social contributions and  manages to obtain the minister's okay without any problems. I  repeat, I can no longer stomach this type of thing.    [De Moraes] Is your report ready?    [Magalhaes] I am about to conclude it. Yesterday I received  a detailed report from Senator Eduardo Suplicy [PT-SP] [Workers  Party], which will help me draft my document. I am waiting for  more depositions, but all those involved in irregularities whose  guilt is established by the CPI beyond all doubt will be  included in the report.    [De Moraes] There are those who are in favor of postponing  the deadline for the Budget CPI to conclude its findings. Do  you endorse this?    [Magalhaes] No. I am against postponing it. I have already  discussed this with Senator Jose Paulo Bisol [PSB-RS] and  explained to him that it would not be possible. There is a  group that wants to delay the deadline for the CPI to submit its  final report, but we cannot go beyond 15 January. If we do  that, the work of the CPI will go unnoticed.    [De Moraes] Do you not believe that if the deadline were to  be extended the CPI may discover new things?    [Magalhaes] Now is the time to reach a conclusion. We can  investigate new allegations later. We must meet the deadline  established for the CPI report, otherwise these investigations  could go on for another six years.    [De Moraes] Do you believe your report will herald a new era  for Brazilian politics?    [Magalhaes] I do not think my report will, but I have no  doubt whatsoever that the decision taken by a plenary session of  Congress will.</p>

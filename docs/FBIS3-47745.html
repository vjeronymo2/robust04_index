Here is our radio review of U.S.-Vietnam  relations:    Many reports about the visits to Vietnam by six American  delegations have emanated from Hanoi this month. The first  visit was by Washington senators [word indistinct] the most  senior U.S. active-duty office to visit Vietnam, Admiral Charles  Larson, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Command.  Meanwhile, the latest search for the remains of American  servicemen missing in action is now underway in 15 provinces and  cities throughout Vietnam. And American politicians continue to  voice positive remarks about Vietnam.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher recently said:  Considerable information on the MIA issue has been achieved.  This was due, he said, to positive cooperation and goodwill  from Vietnam.    Senator John Kerry, a leading player in the search for  American soldiers missing in action said last week: Vietnamese  Government and people have done their best in cooperating with  the U.S. to settle the issue. Pending issues were created by  the U.S., not Vietnam. He further noted that the U.S. should  continue the internal struggle to dismantle obstacles that  hinder the normalization of relations between the two countries.    A significant number of American politicians and people now  want to lift the embargo against Vietnam and to normalize  relations with Vietnam.    In a recent Gallup poll held in the USA last year, among  over  1,000 questioned people, 58 percent supported normalization with  Vietnam. And the NEW YORK TIMES commented that the most legal  reason to lift the sanctions was that it was no more in  conformity with the interests of the U.S. itself. While the  whole world was now having free-trade ties with Hanoi, the  embargo punishes American businessmen. It would be much better  if the U.S. lifts the embargo. Nevertheless, if the U.S. still  keeps its outdated attitude, Vietnam will continue to develop  its cooperative relations with other countries. Now the ball  [is] in the American court. The question is whether the U.S. is  breaking up [words indistinct] proposals raised by American  politicians, people, and businessmen.</p>

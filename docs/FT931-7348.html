			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Hong Kong steps up pressure on Peking HONG KONG stepped up the pressure on China yesterday, vowing to publish democratic reform legislation soon unless Beijing agrees to come to the negotiating table, Reuter reports from Hong Kong . Mr Michael Sze, secretary for constitutional affairs, said he hoped Sino-British talks could start soon to end a long-running row over Hong Kong's future which has shaken the colony. He told the Legislative Council: 'We do recognise that the current uncertain situation cannot be allowed to continue for much longer and that we will need to gazette the bill if a decision on talks cannot be reached imminently.' Government-owned Radio Television Hong Kong reported that a bill based on Governor Chris Patten's proposals, which have drawn Beijing's fury, would appear in the official gazette tomorrow if China still refused to talk by then. A government spokesman refused to comment on the report, but Mr Patten denied that he had presented Beijing with an ultimatum. Speculation had raged that Mr Patten would miss a self-imposed deadline and postpone publication of the legislation scheduled by the end of this month to allow negotiations with Beijing. But the governor said the arrangements for local elections in 1994 and legislative elections a year later, at the centre of the dispute, had to be agreed this year. Referring to Mr Sze's statement, he said: 'That's not an ultimatum. What it is, is a statement of what is an administrative imperative.'</p>

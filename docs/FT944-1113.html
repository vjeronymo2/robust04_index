			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Five die in air freighter crash Three aircrew and two cargo handlers were killed yesterday morning when their Air Algerie Boeing 737-200 air freighter, on charter to Phoenix Aviation, crashed on its approach to Coventry Airport. The freighter hit an electricity pylon and clipped the roofs of two houses before catching fire. It came to rest in woodland between the Willenhall housing estate and the Coventry eastern by-pass. There were no casualties on the ground. Chief Superintendent Peter Clay of West Midlands Police said: 'It just missed a housing estate and we have to be thankful for that.' Electricity supplies to large sections of Coventry were cut off for several hours. Phoenix Aviation chartered the aircraft to carry live cattle to France and the Netherlands. The aircraft, having taken a load to Amsterdam, was returning empty to Coventry after a diversion to East Midlands Airport because of fog. Coventry was still misty at the time of the crash. Department of Transport air accident investigators have started to search for evidence which will establish why the aircraft prematurely lost altitude. Police said the flight recorder had been found. Willenhall residents said they had warned of the dangers of low flying aircraft for 20 years.</p>

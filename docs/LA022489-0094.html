			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S&amp;LS MAY HAVE OUTLIVED NEED, GREENSPAN SAYS;  </P> <P> BUT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS EXPRESS STRONG SUPPORT FOR SEPARATE LENDING INDUSTRY  </P> <P> Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday that the nation may  no longer need a separate savings and loan industry, but members of Congress  staunchly defended S&amp;Ls as vital suppliers of money for home mortgages.  </P> <P> Greenspan, who is the first official of his stature to suggest that S&amp;Ls  may have outlived their usefulness, told the Senate Banking Committee that he  doubts "whether specialized fixed-rate residential lending institutions are  needed today."  </P> <P> "Ultimately it's going to be the markets that are going to determine the  banking structure in this country," he said.  </P> <P> On the House side of the Capitol, meanwhile, banking committee Chairman Rep.  Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said: "I did not become chairman of this committee  to preside over the liquidation of the savings and loan industry.  </P> <P> "I am a strong advocate of the industry," said Gonzalez, as his House committee  gave a hostile reception to a Bush Administration plan to solve the S&amp;L  financial crisis through the possible liquidation or sale of hundreds of  S&amp;Ls within the next two years.  </P> <P> In an immediate step to calm nervous depositors, officials said Thursday that  the Federal Reserve will provide reserves of cash to stem any rush by  depositors to withdraw funds from S&amp;Ls. There was an unusually heavy  outflow of funds, $15 billion, in the last two months of last year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Supply Cash  </P> <P> The President and members of Congress have repeatedly pledged that the full  backing of the government stands behind S&amp;L deposits, which are insured up  to $100,000. However, the drumbeat of publicity about the financial crisis of  the federal fund that insures thrift deposits continues to cause widespread  concern. This prompted an announcement Thursday that the Federal Reserve, the  Treasury and the Federal Home Loan Banks will all cooperate in supplying the  cash needs of S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> "We stand ready to make certain the liquidity needs of the thrift institutions  are met," Greenspan said.  </P> <P> Although Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady insisted repeatedly Thursday that  the S&amp;L industry would emerge stronger from President Bush's proposed  rescue package, House banking committee members are fearful that the  Administration would be happy to see S&amp;Ls disappear into the banking  system.  </P> <P> "Rather than heal the wounds of this industry, your plan may put it out of its  misery," Rep. Richard H. Lehman (D-Sanger) told Brady at the House Banking  Committee hearing.  </P> <P> At the same time, Fed Chairman Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee that  S&amp;Ls may have outlived their usefulness.  </P> <P> There have been "important changes in the mortgage market" he said, which may  make it "unnecessary to provide special government-subsidized facilities for  mortgage lending." Home loans, once offered on a strictly local basis, are now  bundled into packages and sold as securities throughout the country.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Promotes Home Ownership  </P> <P> The Fed chairman said his agency plans to make it easier for bank holding  companies to acquire troubled thrifts, another move that should help wipe out  much of the traditional distinction between banks and S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> The S&amp;L financing system was created during the Depression to promote home  ownership. Previously, lending institutions offered loans running for just a  few years and required a large portion of the full purchase price as a down  payment. Federal legislation made possible the Home Loan Bank system, owned by  the S&amp;L industry, which made available a steady stream of funds for  mortgages.  </P> <P> At the same time, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. was created to  insure deposits up to $100,000. S&amp;Ls made most home loans until the  industry was deregulated in the early 1980s, but after that mortgage bankers  and other institutions actively entered the market on a large scale.  </P> <P> A new price tag for the S&amp;L rescue plan, $175.4 billion over 30 years, was  issued Thursday by the Administration, following criticisms in Congress that  the total cost had not been accurately disclosed. The Office of Management and  Budget said previously that the plan would cost $126 billion over 10 years,  including interest payments on the bonds to pay for S&amp;L liquidations and  sales. The bonds have a 30-year life, and Thursday's new total of $175.4  billion reflects the full interest cost. The taxpayers will be responsible for  $89.2 billion of interest payments on the bonds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Assume Higher Rates  </P> <P> However, members of Congress offer conflicting tallies. Sen. John Heinz  (R-Pa.), a member of the Banking Committee, believes the program will cost $200  billion, with about $110 billion of that paid by taxpayers. A House Banking  Committee analysis puts the cost at $335 billion, with $183 billion coming from  the taxpayers.  </P> <P> The congressional figures are higher because they assume much higher interest  rates, which drive up the ultimate cost of the bonds. Congress also is more  pessimistic than the Administration about the amount of money that will be  recovered through the sale of homes, apartments, office buildings and other  properties taken by the government from failed institutions.  </P> <P> A key provision of the plan, aimed at preventing a future collapse of S&amp;Ls,  would require the thrifts to increase their financial strength substantially.  Only 1,200 of the 2,500 solvent S&amp;Ls now have enough capital to meet the  standards that would be required by 1991 if the Bush plan is approved by  Congress.  </P> <P> Rep. Thomas J. Ridge (R-Pa.) suggested that S&amp;Ls falling below the capital  standards, but showing improvement, should be given additional time beyond 1991  to meet the requirement.  </P> <P> The Treasury secretary was polite but adamant in his refusal. "With all due  respect, we feel very strongly we ought to adhere to the 1991 deadlines," he  said. "Our feeling is the requirement could be met, and you will have a strong  industry."  </P> <P> Banks, which are generally stronger financially, would be able to buy weaker  S&amp;Ls and will "become the beneficiaries of all this," complained Lehman,  referring to the Administration plan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Congress Suspicious  </P> <P> Brady responded: "We have no intention whatsoever to deliver up the S&amp;L  industry to the banking industry."  </P> <P> However, many members of Congress fear that that is precisely the  Administration's secret goal.  </P> <P> Chairman Gonzalez, and Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.), whose subcommittee will  write the S&amp;L legislation, will fight hard against what they perceive as  efforts to dismantle the S&amp;L industry or convert thrifts into banks.  </P> <P> "I support a separate home lending industry in this country, and I will oppose  any attempt to do away with such an industry," Annunzio said.  </P></p>

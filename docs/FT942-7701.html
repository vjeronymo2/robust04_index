			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Oporto SE prepares for new role Oporto Stock Exchange is to close on June 1 before reopening in January as a national futures and options market, officials said. The Lisbon Stock Exchange will take over all Portugal's spot market trading from the same date. The decision follows a proposal made in February by Portugal's stock exchange commission (CMVM) to replace the spot market in Oporto with a derivatives exchange and develop a national spot market in Lisbon. Oporto and Lisbon currently act as separate trading floors for a national spot market on which 118 shares and bonds are listed. A total of 12 shares and bonds listed only on Oporto's second market for smaller companies will be transferred to Lisbon. The Lisbon stock exchange will pay Oporto Es2.4bn (Dollars 14m) over three years as compensation for the loss of the spot market. The CMVM proposal was made to end what it considers unnecessary rivalry between the two exchanges for the same small spot market. Analysts said a futures and options market was needed to increase the liquidity and efficiency of Portugal's capital markets and improve conditions for corporate financing. The measure follows the announcement of a radical reform package for the bond market which is due to take effect on June 23.</p>

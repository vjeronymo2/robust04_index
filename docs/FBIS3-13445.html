			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Military sources have said that yesterday the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] took steps toward clarifying the  open-fire instructions in the territories. Speaking to our army  affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe, the sources said the  steps were designed to prevent confusion among soldiers caused  by a Border Police officer's testimony before the Shamgar  Commission.    Our correspondent notes that the steps are designed to  elucidate the existing instructions, according to which weapons  are not to be used when enforcing law and public order on  Israelis in the territories. Nevertheless, when observing an  Israeli civilian shooting to hit others, or endangering others'  lives without being in a life-threatening situation himself, the  soldiers have to take every reasonable measure, including the  use of firearms.</p>

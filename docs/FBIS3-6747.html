In the appraisal, the professors stripped bare the  treacherous nature of the "reform" by the Kim Yong-sam regime,  characterising it as "subordinate politics and diplomacy," "big  business-centred new economy against reform," "new agricultural  policy driving away peasants," "government-controlled education  denying change," "return to the cold war  system--anti-independent reunification policy" and "retrograding  environmental policy".    They branded the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime as "power for  comprador businesses" and "power bent on consolidating the  subordinate relations with the imperialist powers, particularly  the U.S. imperialist total capital".    They pointed out that the revision of the "Combined Election  Law", the "Law on Political Funds", etc. sought by the Kim  Yong-sam puppet clique is not for a democratic reform, but is  aimed at consolidating the foundation of their power by  legalizing the political and economic fusion between the  "Democratic Liberal Party" and the comprador businesses through  the medium of "political funds".    Stating that the deceptive nature of the "reform" advertised  so loudly by the Kim Yong-sam traitor clique has been completely  exposed, they said it is proved by the fact that the force which  must be the objects of reform are fooling the people in the  disguise of the "leading force" of the "reform".</p>

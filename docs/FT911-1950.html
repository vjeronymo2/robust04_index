			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (32): Back to the start of his road - Profile: Zbigniew Bujak - What has happened to Solidarity?  FT writers trace the evolution of the movement and discuss the future of trade unions ZBIGNIEW BUJAK was an almost legendary figure in the 1980s as the clandestine leader of the Solidarity underground in Warsaw during martial law. On one celebrated occasion he wore a long, blond wig for a clandestine TV interview to demonstrate the range of disguises which kept the secret police always one step behind. Like many other colleagues now in positions of authority, he has failed to reap the rewards of the risks he took then. Indeed, he has found himself once more at the beginning of his political road, as he seeks to build a social democratic alternative to the government's policies. 'I am quite alone,' he says, sitting in a sparsely furnished office a floor above the Stefan Batory Trust, a foundation set up by Mr George Soros, the rich American-Hungarian financier, which Mr Bujak chaired until recently. Mr Bujak, now in his mid-30s, first became involved in politics as a young worker at the Ursus tractor factory in the late 1970s. He had links with the dissident KOR movement set up by Adam Michnik, Jacek Kuron and others to defend workers' rights during the repression which followed the 1976 worker protests. When the Solidarity trade union suddenly burst upon the scene in 1980, he was elected its leader in Warsaw. After martial law, he was one of the movement's national leaders until his arrest in 1986. Then he espoused free-market views, and when the Solidarity movement re-emerged in 1989 he wanted the trade union to do little more than smooth the way to a purely entrepreneurial society. 'I was a liberal at the beginning, and I believed that this would be enough to improve the situation of the companies and thus the employees,' he says. He saw Solidarity as acting as a giant labour exchange, helping industry to restructure and to defuse the discontent provoked by the economic costs of transition. He did not go into parliament but supported the previous Mazowiecki government, adopting a fiercely anti-Walesa stance during last autumn's presidential election. Yet even before the election, he felt that the government was not doing enough to support the formation of Polish capital, and that this was contributing to the growth of fears about foreign capital. But it was during the presidential campaign that Mr Bujak noticed the growth of opposition to economic change. 'The situation of the workers and the farmers wasn't improving, and this marks a threat for the whole programme,' he says. During the election he also noticed that he had lost contact with the shop floor. 'My people at Ursus told me that, by supporting the Balcerowicz plan (the Government's IMF-approved anti-inflation programme), I had betrayed them.' He realised also that people were beginning to fear the privatisation programme. Now, he argues that something must be done to help state-sector companies to perform better and leave privatisation for later. He explains his search for social democratic solutions as a way of trying to rebuild support for the economic reforms before they are, in his view, rejected altogether. 'Poland needs a programme which stands a chance of winning popular support and that explains the social democrat option,' he says, adding that his ultimate aim is still to rebuild a market economy. He sees the left-wing parliamentary post-Solidarity 'Solidarnosc Pracy' group, led by Mr Richard Bugaj, as a potential ally, as well as the moderates in the small Polish Socialist party (PPS) led by Mr Jan Jozef Lipski, another KOR veteran. He admits lack of funds means that these groups have little influence at the moment. But he is no longer afraid that his views mean he will be criticised for being crypto-communist. He thinks that communism's negative connotations are beginning to fade and believes it is no longer politically dangerous to be considered left of centre. He even predicts that the SdRP, the post-communist party, will get a 15 per cent share of the vote in the autumn parliamentary election.</p>

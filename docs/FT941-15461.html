			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Production setbacks hit Randgold mines A drop in tonnage milled and declining grades underlined the marginality of the four gold producers in the Rand-gold and Exploration stable in the quarter ended in December. The mines incurred a combined after-tax loss of R17.29m (Dollars 5.1m) against a R6.18m after-tax profit last time. Only the group's Harmony Gold Mining Company remained in the black. However, even here a fall in gold output coupled with higher costs and a slightly lower gold price shaved after-tax profit to R8.97m from R16.94m. Randgold's mines remained hamstrung by lack of flexibility in working practices, and in long-standing forward sales contracts which have locked the operations into gold prices often significantly below spot. The mines received an average gold price of R37,366 a kg, up from R36,586 in the September quarter, but well below the current rand gold price of close to R42,200 a kg. Mr John Turner, chief executive, said: 'Overall results are disappointing.' He said the sensitivity of the mines to small changes in underground production, gold output or working costs was often forgotten 'in the euphoria of higher gold prices'. The overall amount of ore milled fell to 2.23m tonnes from 2.41m tonnes, with gold output sliding to 8,941kg from 9,662kg. Average working costs jumped to R42,425 a kg against R38,668 a kg. The main culprit was East Rand Proprietary Mines (ERPM), which was slow to benefit from a switch to a continuous work schedule. Mr Turner, however, said improvements were expected. ERPM would return to profitability in the year as working costs were controlled, and as it reaped the benefits of the December R550m rights issue which cleared crippling debts of more than R520m. The mine showed an increased after-tax loss of R16.87m, compared with R9.39m, and failed to make a working profit. Durban Roodepoort Deep suffered a loss in output and productivity due to a lingering 10 per cent absentee rate among its 4,400 workforce. This followed violent clashes among mine-workers in mid-1993. Its after-tax loss doubled to R6.83m from R3.88m. Mr Turner said a study of the mine's viability would be completed in the current quarter. Closure of underground operations remained 'one of the alternatives'. Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mining turned an after-tax profit of R2.42m into a loss of R2.56m. Underground grade slipped to 6.2 grams from 6.7 grams a ton. The company is battling to keep its head above water until benefits of a tribute mining agreement with Anglo American's neighbouring Western Deep Levels mine are felt in mid-year.</p>

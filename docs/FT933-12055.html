			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / BJP chief prepares for Hindu India: Advani is determined to broaden the party base, according to Shiraz Sidhva AFTER years of being a party of upper caste Hindus and small traders, the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) has decided that it must broaden its base if it is to achieve its goal of wresting power in New Delhi. Mr Lal Krishna Advani, the 65-year-old head of the BJP has been assuring Moslems they will be safe in a Hindu India, and more secure than they have been in a secular country with Mr Narasimha Rao's Congress (I) government at the helm. Already, the BJP's committees are nominating members of the less privileged classes, something hitherto unheard of in the elitist Hindu party. Mr Advani is also doing all he can to get away from the party's Moslem-bashing image. Earlier this month a picture of Mr Advani warmly greeting a senior Moslem religious leader head was splashed across Delhi's front pages. Recently re-elected BJP president, the frail man who would be prime minister refuses to accept blame for the country-wide murders of nearly 2,000 people after his party encouraged the destruction of a mosque at Ayodhya last December. Nine months after India's most traumatic event since partition, the BJP is much stronger than when Ayodhya was its single issue. Mr Advani has never been apologetic about his party's decision to support the destruction of the mosque, which became a symbol of India's secularism after his party insisted that it stood on the birthplace of the Hindu god, Ram. He blames Congress and other opposition parties for not explaining to the country's Moslems that the mosque at Ayodhya had long ceased to be used by Moslems for prayer, and instead housed a temple since 1986 when Mr Rajiv Gandhi was prime minister. A local magistrate that year allowed Hindus access to the Mosque for worship. Mr Advani is prepared to face a snap poll in the event of the Rao government falling. The man who engineered the Hindu party's meteoric rise from two seats in the lower House in 1984 to 118 in 1991, knows that Ayodhya can bring the party no further political gain, and that there is a need to widen his party's agenda. 'We have always had a comprehensive approach to the nation's problems,' insists Mr Advani. 'It so happened that the principal issue agitating people's minds was Ayodhya in 1991,' he told the Financial Times last week. 'Any party who aspires to govern as pluralistic a country as India, cannot afford to concentrate on one issue.' Besides, claims Mr Advani, building a new temple on the site of the mosque has become 'the nation's cause', with even Congress (I) jumping on the bandwagon and sponsoring a religious ceremony there in June. 'A temple at Ayodhya has now become the resolve of the entire nation,' he says. However, he will oppose the introduction of a bill this week which seeks to detach religion from politics. However, secular-minded Indians are aware that if the BJP came to power it could change the face of Indian democracy. The bloodbath after Ayodyha is fresh in the minds of minorities who know that not all Advani supporters are as reasonable as he is. Corruption in high places is the BJP's newest mantra. With Mr Rao's credibility in question after accusations of involvement in the Rs50bn (Pounds 1.07bn) Bombay financial scandal, Mr Advani has been projecting himself as a credible alternative. Much of Mr Advani's confidence stems from the fact that the BJP is sure of winning the polls in the four states where its governments were dismissed after the Ayodhya-related violence. These include Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state and Madhya Pradesh, India's largest state, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh. Already, the party, aided by the disciplined cadres of the Rashtriya Swayam Seva Sangh (RSS), the parent Hindu organisation, is campaigning in the four states, where elections are due in October. The party plans to form a 'shadow cabinet' during the monsoon session of parliament to expose the government's 'failures' in key areas such as home and foreign affairs, defence, education and health. The BJP will also intensify its campaign criticising Congress handling of the Kashmir insurgency. The party has periodically jettisoned its right-wing policies to criticise the government's economic reforms programme. Mr Advani insists that there are no contradictions in the party's economic platform. 'We are all for liberalisation,' he says. 'But internal liberalisation must precede globalisation, and be carried out in phases.'</p>

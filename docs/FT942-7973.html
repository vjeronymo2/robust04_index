			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Murky outlook for healthcare reform Little of substance on healthcare reform will be agreed before the mid-term elections in November. The most that President Bill Clinton can expect is a deal with Republicans on incremental reforms of the health insurance market, for example legislation to prevent discrimination against people with 'pre-existing' conditions. I received this gloomy assessment last week from one of the most respected analysts on Capitol Hill. He spoke, ironically, just as a milestone of sorts was passed in the healthcare saga. Last Wednesday, two of the five congressional committees with jurisdiction over healthcare - those headed by Senator Edward Kennedy and Mr Dan Rostenkowski - finally began serious scrutiny of reform proposals. On the evidence of the stormy opening sessions, it would be rash to make any prediction of the final legislative outcome. Republicans tabled more than 100 amendments to Mr Kennedy's compromise bill and denounced it as a pasteurised version of Mr Clinton's 'socialised medicine'. Yet the mood changed the following day when they reached a surprising bipartisan accord on ways of containing the cost of a minimum package of benefits. The fact that Mr Rostenkowski, the Democrats' quarterback in the lower house, faces possible indictment on felony charges only adds to the uncertainty. Nobody doubts the depth of Mr Clinton's commitment to healthcare reform  - the centrepiece of his legislative agenda. He and the first lady have campaigned tirelessly for reform. The Democratic party enjoys comfortable majorities in both houses of Congress. Why, then, is he facing such an uphill battle? The answer lies in the nature of America's healthcare dilemma. Social reforms tend to be popular only when most people regard themselves as beneficiaries. In the late 1940s, Britain's National Health Service was a wild success because it greatly improved access to care for all but the seriously rich - and the cost in terms of higher taxation was not generally appreciated. In the late 1960s, much the same could be said of Medicare, the popular US public programme that guarantees universal access to care for the elderly, at highly subsidised rates. Now consider the Clinton reform. Rather than expanding opportunities it is about restraint and redistribution. The goal is to provide coverage for the 15 per cent of the population presently uninsured (inevitably a costly endeavour) while reducing the growth of overall healthcare spending - in the private as well as public sector. Ratcheting down growth of overall spending, while shifting resources to the uninsured, obviously requires new constraints on the 85 per cent who are insured, especially in their access to expensive high-tech medicine. Such constraints - however dressed up - are unlikely to be popular, particularly when no US politician, least of all Mr Clinton, will admit that any sacrifice is required. It is thus not surprising that congressional leaders, reacting to opinion polls, have already scuttled two of the principal restraints on spending proposed by Mr Clinton. Hopes of shifting Americans en masse into managed care by corralling them in mandatory 'health alliances', or quasi public sector purchasing co-operatives, have been abandoned. So, probably, has the White House dream of imposing caps on the growth of private health insurance premiums. Effective cost control looks to be a dead letter. The remaining question is whether Mr Clinton will succeed in guaranteeing universal coverage - supposedly his non-negotiable bottom line. Americans seem unwilling to countenance either an overt increase in personal taxation or, after a decade of red ink, a higher budget deficit. The White House thus concluded that the only plausible route to universal coverage lay in imposing an 'employer mandate' - a legal requirement that all employers must pay the bulk of insurance costs for employees. Yet this disguised tax is also strongly opposed, especially by small business, a politically powerful group. It seems draconian to impose new burdens on businesses just recovering from recession. And it is hard to refute the argument that higher payroll taxes will destroy jobs. Indeed many question the wisdom of increasing the corporate sector's social responsibilities at a time when links between employers and employees are becoming more, rather than less, fluid. Yet nobody in Congress has devised a plausible alternative route to universal insurance cover. In gauging Mr Clinton's chances this year, the best legislative parallel is perhaps the compendious 1986 Tax Reform Act. At the eleventh hour, congressional leaders confounded sceptics by agreeing sweeping reforms - albeit reforms that differed substantially from President Reagan's original proposals. Yet Mr Clinton should not draw much comfort from this. Tax reform, although highly complex, was manageable because lawmakers could trade concessions (for example higher corporate taxes in exchange for lower personal rates) almost at will. Healthcare reform is more demanding because the component parts must be internally consistent. Even setting aside political differences, Congress may simply lack the technical skill to devise a workable reform of US healthcare - one seventh of the economy - before November. Hence the plausibility of predictions that Mr Clinton, this year, will have to settle for modest reforms.</p>

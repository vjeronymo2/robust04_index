			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> If Joe Torre gives them the same insight he did viewers of Angel telecasts, the  St. Louis Cardinals will improve. . . .  </P> <P> Not a single deal was made Tuesday before the major league trading deadline, a  sign of these times of free agency and complicated contracts. . . .  </P> <P> The Dodgers and Giants should be aware that 18 of the Reds' next 20 games will  be played in Cincinnati. . . .  </P> <P> ESPN alienated viewers the way it handled coverage of Nolan Ryan's 300th  victory. The game wasn't supposed to be shown because of some crazy rule. But  my cable service carried the first inning and a half from Milwaukee, and then  switched to the Baltimore-Toronto game. . . .  </P> <P> Bert Blyleven, who has 279 victories, is the next pitcher with a shot at 300. .  . .  </P> <P> People dressed in suits at ballgames try to look like fans by wearing caps, but  it doesn't work. . . .  </P> <P> The good news about former Dodger top draft choice Bill Bene's last start at  Vero Beach is that he gave up only one run and three hits in eight innings. The  bad news is that he walked nine. . . .  </P> <P> Now that Eric Dickerson has signed with agent Leigh Steinberg, does that mean  he will become a quarterback? . . .  </P> <P> Student-athletes or athlete-students? Colorado and Tennessee opened football  practice Tuesday, six weeks before the start of classes. . . .  </P> <P> If the PGA is serious about improving human relations, it will refuse to stage  any tournament at a private club that has discriminatory policies. . . .  </P> <P> One of Ron Cey's 24 career stolen bases was shown on Diamond Vision the other  night as the Penguin was saluted during the Dodgers' 100th anniversary  celebration. . . .  </P> <P> Think Detroit Tiger president Bo Schembechler would like to sign a former wide  receiver named Kirk Gibson next season, even if he did play at Michigan State?  . . .  </P> <P> Baseball is at another record attendance pace, due in no small part to  reasonable ticket prices. . . .  </P> <P> You know the Cubs are in trouble when the third hitter in their lineup, Mark  Grace, has only 36 runs batted in. . . .  </P> <P> Now we get a lot of Dodger and Angel road games on TV, but all home games of  the Hollywood Stars and Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League used to  be televised by Channel 9. . . .  </P> <P> Last manager to move from the broadcasting booth to the dugout was Jerry  Coleman, whose San Diego Padres finished last in the National League West in  1980. . . .  </P> <P> The Saints reportedly want Steve Wisniewski and a No. 1 draft choice from the  Raiders for Bobby Hebert. That sounds too steep, especially for a team that  gave up another offensive lineman, Jim Lachey, for another quarterback, Jay  Schroeder, two years ago. . . . Word from the Green Bay Packer camp is that  Tony Mandarich's pass blocking techniques are rapidly improving. . . .  </P> <P> Maybe Stefan Edberg has become a gate attraction. The Wimbledon champion drew a  capacity crowd of 7,866 for a first-round match in the Volvo/Los Angeles  tournament at UCLA on a Tuesday night. . . .  </P> <P> The future of Mary Slaney, 31, again is in doubt now that she has undergone  Achilles' tendon surgery. . . .  </P> <P> Several jockeys are working a double shift these days, afternoons at Del Mar  and evenings at Los Alamitos. . . .  </P> <P> El Paso-based adviser Ron Weathers has done a terrific job orchestrating George  Foreman's comeback -- the right opponents, the right paydays and the right  publicity. . . .  </P> <P> Look-alikes: Buster Douglas and Dexter Manley. . . .  </P> <P> Julio Cesar Chavez and Don King, of all people, were seen in Steve Wynn's  office at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas Tuesday. Possibilities for late  November are a Chavez-Meldrick Taylor rematch or a Chavez-Hector Camacho bout.  . . .  </P> <P> Sacramento, home of International Boxing Federation junior-lightweight champion  Tony Lopez, will try to claim another world title when Loreto Garza challenges  World Boxing Assn. junior-welterweight champion Juan Coggi, Aug. 17 in Nice,  France. . . .  </P> <P> The Hambletonian, which will be raced at the Meadowlands Saturday, had more  appeal when it was held country-style at Goshen, N.Y., and Du Quoin, Ill. . . .  </P> <P> Golden State got more from Philadelphia -- a first-round draft choice -- than  Manute Bol was worth. . . .  </P> <P> Kevin McHale will be seen in an episode of "Cheers," next season as a ringer  for the saloon's basketball team in a game against rival Gary's Old Town  Tavern. . . .  </P> <P> Fay Vincent has put an NPG tag on Hank Steinbrenner -- No Parental Guidance. .  . .  </P></p>

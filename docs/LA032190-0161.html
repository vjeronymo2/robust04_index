			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BOOK HAS ENVIRONMENTAL BEAT  </P> <P> There's an environmental tie-in with the new book on drums by Mickey Hart, one  of the Grateful Dead's two drummers.  </P> <P> "Drumming at the Edge of Magic: A Journey into the Spirit of Percussion," which  will be published in September by Harper &amp; Row, is about the history and  significance of drumming and Hart's travels around the world in pursuit of  ancient and endangered drumming traditions.  </P> <P> "It's a natural progression from learning about endangered music to caring  about our endangered planet," says Hart. Therefore, because of Hart's concern  for the environment, particularly rain forests, his publisher will plant two  trees in a South American rain forest for every one tree required to produce  his book.  </P> <P> "Although obviously the paper used for book production doesn't come from rain  forest trees, we see this action as a powerful symbol of our joint  responsibility for replenishing natural resources," said Clayton Carlson,  publisher of Harper &amp; Row in San Francisco.  </P></p>

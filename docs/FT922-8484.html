			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Ahold turnover surges to Fl 6.7bn AHOLD, the Dutch food retailer active in the US and the Netherlands, said turnover surged by more than 20 per cent in the first four months of 1992, boosted by last year's acquisition of a US supermarket chain as well as by autonomous growth in existing stores. The company said operating and net profit in the first quarter of 1992 were also expected to be higher, confirming predictions of growth in full-year earnings, but gave no details. Turnover in the 16-week period rose by 22.1 per cent to Fl 6.7bn (Dollars 3.6bn), helped by last year's acquisition of the New York-based supermarket chain Tops Markets. If the chain, Ahold's fourth in the US, is excluded, group turnover was up 8.8 per cent in the period. In the Netherlands, where Ahold generates just under half of total turnover, sales rose 8.3 per cent to Fl 3.3bn. US sales increased by 34 per cent to Dollars 1.9bn. Without Tops Markets, Ahold's US turnover would have risen by 5.1 per cent. Besides the Netherlands and the US, Ahold is gradually building up a chain of supermarkets in Czechoslovakia under the name MANA. The company already has five MANA supermarkets in operation and hopes to add many more in 1992. Mr Pierre Everaert, chairman, told the annual shareholders meeting in Amsterdam that the process of establishing a chain of stores under Czechoslovakia's privatisation programme was proving to be slow, but he said Ahold was making progress.</p>

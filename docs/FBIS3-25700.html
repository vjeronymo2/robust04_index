On the second day of his visit, the  Angolan head of state held to a tight agenda. Tomorrow, he will  meet French President Francis Mitterrand. After meeting French  Prime Minister Edouard Balladur today, Eduardo dos Santos said  he has not gone to France to get weapons but to discuss peace  and economics. Our Paris correspondent reports:    President Jose Eduardo Santos will shortly speak at an  official dinner hosted by the French Foreign Ministry. The  speech, which will be followed with great attention by French  Government officials, is likely to deal with the Angolan  Government's economic program, and the dramatic situation faced  by millions of Angolans as a result of the unjust war waged by  Jonas Savimbi's organization. This afternoon, the Angolan head  of state had a working session with the French prime minister.  At the end of the meeting, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos  said:    [Begin Santos recording, in French fading into Portuguese  translation] We have reviewed bilateral cooperation, notably  economic cooperation. We briefed the French prime minister  about the ongoing Lusaka peace talks between government and  UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]  delegations. We informed the French prime minister about the  economic recovery program the Angolan Government plans to  introduce.    We have not come to Paris to ask for military aid from the  French Government. We have not discussed military issues, but  rather matters relating to peace and politics.    As for the peace talks, we have gone to Lusaka to find a  solution to the Angolan problem. [end recording]    Also this afternoon, the Angolan head of state met  government  and party officials. Tomorrow, he is scheduled to hold further  meetings, notably with President Mitterrand. Afterward, the two  leaders will lunch together.

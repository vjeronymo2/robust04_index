			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie struggles to hold on to 3,000 THE UK stock market, rescued towards the end of a confused trading session by a rally in government bond prices, managed to hold on to the Footsie 3,000 level yesterday, but only just. In early trading, this important benchmark was abandoned twice as equities reacted to the latest statistics on the domestic economy, as well as to developments on the global front. At the day's low the FT-SE 100 Index was 14.5 down at 2,990, but most of the fall was recovered later. The closing reading put the index at 3,001.6 for a decline on the day of only 2.9 points. The relatively steady performance in the London stock market was the more impressive since it contrasted with weakness on Wall Street, down 37 Dow points overnight and a further 22 points off early in the new session when London closed last night. Sentiment was helped by the latest UK economic data for the second quarter. Final figures for the gross domestic product were well received and the trade deficit appeared a little better than expected. Shares opened lower and were further depressed by trading news from Tesco, the food retailer. However, market turnover was little better than on Monday, when retail, or customer, business dipped below Pounds 1bn for the first time for many weeks. Any optimism following the cut in Japanese interest rates was quickly scotched by a spokesman for the British government who, while returning from Japan with Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, said that domestic interest rates are 'at the right level'. The stock market was met with Pounds 265m in rights issue calls, dominated by a not unexpected call for Pounds 215m from Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder. The prospects for further rights issue calls continue to bear down on a stock market still unhappy with the corporate results flow; yesterday afternoon brought another profits warning, this time from Philip Harris, supplier of scientific and industrial equipment. Revision of official figures on second quarter annualised GDP growth from 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent gave the stock market significant encouragement at midsession. 'The data was very positive for the corporate sector,' said Mr Ian Harnett of Strauss Turnbull. There were reports that economists at several leading market firms were considering firming up the year-end forecasts for the Footsie, which were raised as the market raced ahead at the end of last month. However, for the immediate term the market remained confused, with traders reluctant to see the Footsie fall below 3,000 but evidently not con-fident enough to chase prices higher. One factor was the unwillingness of the institutions to buy stock in spite of the market's now substantial fall from the intraday trading peak on the Footsie of 3,115, reached at the end of August. Trading volume remained low yesterday, although at 538.4m shares the Seaq total improved from Monday's lamentable figure of 442.9m. Non-Footsie business returned to more normal average levels to provide about 52 per cent of total business. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which extends beyond the Footsie to cover a wide range of second line issues, climbed 5.4 to 3,429 yesterday.</p>

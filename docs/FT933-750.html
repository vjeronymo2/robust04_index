			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / HK poll dogs China talks THE 12th round of Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political future ended in Beijing yesterday with the two sides as deeply divided as ever. The two have decided to reconvene on October 12, six days after Hong Kong governor Mr Chris Patten opens the new session of the colony's Legislative Council (LegCo), the local 60-seat lawmaking body, whose elections in 1995 are the subject of the talks. Yesterday's negotiations, and a meeting of foreign ministers scheduled for Friday, have been made considerably more frosty by the publication last Friday of Mr Deng Xiaoping's hitherto secret 1982 policy statement on Hong Kong. Mr Patten has had to play down its significance. He said Mr Deng's views had been superseded by the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. It was this agreement that controls Britain's transfer of the colony to China in 1997, not 'a speech which has been taken out and dusted down', he said. But the act of publishing Mr Deng's 11-year-old position underlines the seriousness of the current deadlock in talks about Hong Kong's 1995 elections and represents a hardening of Beijing's position. Mr Deng's text has become required reading for Beijing's officials involved with Hong Kong affairs. It was delivered on September 25 1982 in the form of an opening statement to Mrs Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher, then Britain's prime minister, when she met him in Beijing. Britain's purpose was to open talks on Hong Kong which Mrs Thatcher hoped might result in continuing British administration of the colony after 1997. Mr Deng would have none of that. 'On the question of sovereignty, China has no room to manoeuvre. . . The question is not open to discussion,' he said. Mr Deng linked the issue of sovereignty to China's experience of colonialism last century. To concede sovereignty would mean the present Chinese leaders 'were just like Li Hongzhang]' - a reference to an official of the Qing dynasty whom communist historians hold responsible for China's defeat in the Sino-Japanese war of 1894. Mr Deng also made plain that China would run Hong Kong after 1997 and was prepared in exceptional circumstances to take back the colony earlier. This was the aspect of his speech highlighted by Chinese officials who briefed the Hong Kong press last weekend. The issue of sovereignty is central to the current talks in Beijing concerning LegCo. Britain wants the last LegCo elections held on its watch - those in 1995 - to be transparent and, in Mr Patten's words, 'clean'. China, on the other hand, wants to control the outcome as much as it can. For example, Britain wants members of the electoral college who choose 10 of LegCo's members to be elected themselves. China wants the college. to be appointed. It also wants 12 candidates to be selected from the membership of the college and then for the whole college to choose 10. This fundamental difference in objective - Britain concerned with process, China with outcome - will be difficult to reconcile. When Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, meets Mr Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, in New York later this week he is likely to tell Mr Qian that unless China accepts it cannot predetermine the outcome of the election there is little use in the two sides continuing their talks. How China would react is unclear. In Hong Kong the prospect of a collapse in the talks is greeted with disquiet bordering on alarm. As Mr Allen Lee, leader of the conservative Liberal party, wrote in the weekend press: 'The people of Hong Kong want the talks to continue and to succeed; for unless Britain and China co-operate, the alternative for us can only be grim.'

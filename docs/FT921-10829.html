			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Effort to revive a casualty of conflicting policies: The archbishop's meeting on Apex in the light of voluntary-sector concerns BUSINESS representatives will meet the archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, at Lambeth Palace tonight for what leaders of Britain's voluntary sector fear may become a depressingly familiar type of gathering. Dr Carey will ask the private sector to help rescue the Apex Trust, the national ex-offenders' employment charity, after a crisis over government funding that forced it to call in an administrator last month. The battle to save the Apex Trust is not an isolated one. It has many similarities with recent moves to rescue Fullemploy, Britain's only national ethnic-minority training organisation, after government funding was lost. Throughout the country, lesser-known local organisations have closed or scaled down their activities over the past year as local authorities have cut voluntary-sector budgets. In the view of voluntary-sector leaders, the Apex Trust's survival battle has brought to a head a conflict between government policy - which favours an expanded role for voluntary organisations in delivering social services - and an ultra-cautious approach to finance. Mr Bill Mather, the Apex Trust's chief executive, said: 'What has happened to us is a signal and a symbol for the entire voluntary sector. The government says it wants the voluntary sector to take on more responsibility, but narrow Treasury thinking gets in the way when we try to do it.' Mr Mather said Home Office officials have been exploring with a group of voluntary organisations ways of extending their role in the criminal justice field. 'Good, innovative ideas have been emerging. But they will come to nothing while ministers allow themselves to be dominated by inflexible Treasury attitudes which look only at the short-term figures and ignore the value of the work other government departments are asking the voluntary sector to do.' One of Fullemploy's managers said Whitehall became an Alice in Wonderland world when Fullemploy collapsed earlier this year. A Pounds 250,000 Home Office grant had been withheld pending a Charity Commissioners' inquiry. The commissioners found that, in spite of earlier difficulties, Fullemploy was satisfactorily managed, and its relieved board assumed that that would release the grant. It did not. Fullemploy had reached the edge of insolvency while waiting for the Pounds 250,000, and the Home Office said it could not make a grant to an organisation when its solvency depended on receiving it. The Apex Trust's immediate crisis was also brought about by Pounds 250,000 - this time a disputed overpayment which the charity had to start refunding to the government. At least as significant in the trust's financial troubles, however, was a shift in the payment of training grants by Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) from advance to arrears funding. Like many voluntary organisations, the trust had negligible capital reserves and was thrown into immediate financial turmoil by the new arrangements. Mr Mather said: 'We have never had any working capital and have consequently lacked the financial security any organisation needs to run efficiently.' He is satisfied that almost all the charity's programmes are individually profitable and says the appeal to the private sector will be for a one-off infusion of capital to establish a secure base. About Pounds 500,000 is likely to be needed to achieve that. Many employers have first-hand experience of the Apex Trust's work with ex-offenders and are concerned about its impending demise. Since it went into administration last month, the trust has received messages of support from a range of organisations including Marks and Spencer, BP, WH Smith, the Post Office, British Gas, Whitbread, Boots, BAT Industries and Barclays. Its reputation among employers, combined with high-level support from the archbishop, one of the trust's sponsors, means it has some chance of raising the money. One of the lessons of the Apex Trust collapse is that voluntary organisations must diversify their sources of funding and not become over-reliant on public money. That is more easily said than done. The private sector receives far more appeals for support than it can handle, while individual donations to charity are on a plateau. In any case, activities such as the employment of offenders and ethnic minority training are not the easiest of causes to sell to individual donors. Voluntary-sector leaders emphasise the need for public-sector funding to extend beyond the financing of specific projects and recognise the need for administration, research and staff training to be adequately financed. Many organisations lack any reserves and can be blown away by a single financial demand or change of government policy. Above all, the sector believes the government must take more account of the social case for supporting voluntary organisations. Dr Carey's meeting tonight coincides with one at which another group of industrialists will discuss how the business community can assist the government's crime prevention initiatives. The Apex Trust's staff are in no doubt about the answer. Studies show that people who leave prison without jobs - which the trust exists to help provide - are three times more likely to offend again.</p>

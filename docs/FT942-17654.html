			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Fines point to paranoia ahead: Kieran Cooke charts the aftermath of Singapore's secrets trial Government officials in many countries would be delighted at a disclosure of economic growth running to more than 4 per cent - not so in Singapore. In a case which has intrigued and alarmed Singapore's financial community, two business journalists and three local economists were found guilty this week of breaching Singapore's Official Secrets Act by having disclosed a 4.6 per cent growth figure for the second quarter of 1992 before it was officially released. The five were fined a total of SDollars 21,000 (Pounds 9,000). 'Information in Singapore is already very tightly controlled,' said a senior representative of a foreign securities house. 'This verdict is bound to make analysts nervous over making any predictions about Singapore's economy. Paranoia is going to be the order of the day.' The saga that led to what became known as Singapore's secrets trial began on June 29 1992, when the Business Times, the island republic's leading financial daily, accurately forecast the preliminary second-quarter 4.6 per cent growth figure. It was officially released more than a month later. After the paper's report had appeared, Singapore's Internal Security Department (ISD) swung into action. Officers raided the Business Times, seizing reporters' notebooks and files. The local offices of two financial securities houses also received visits by the ISD. Monetary officials, securities analysts, economists and journalists were questioned. The government suspected a conspiracy. Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's elder statesman, hinted that certain 'pressure groups' were trying to undermine the government. In 1990, Mr Goh Chok Tong had succeeded Mr Lee as prime minister. Mr Goh had hinted he wanted to bring in a more liberal, consultative regime. Mr Lee said he doubted that the Business Times would have dared to use 'illegally obtained or leaked official figures' if he were still prime minister. The trial began in October last year. The accused - described by defence and prosecution as distinguished people who had excelled in their professions - were Mr Patrick Daniel, editor of the Business Times, Mr Kenneth James, a senior BT reporter, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, director of the economics department at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore's de facto central bank, Mr Manu Bhaskaran and Mr Raymond Foo, both economists with Crosby Securities, the regional brokerage. Mr Chan Sek Keong, Singapore's attorney-general, who headed the prosecution, said an important principle was at stake. 'It is that persons who have been entrusted with classified information, of whatever nature, in their official duties, must keep it secret.' The prosecution said all five had colluded in disclosing the official preliminary growth estimate: the leak had begun with Mr Shanmugaratnam and ended in the BT article. At times during the 42-day trial, prosecution and defence argued over whether or not the figure had been communicated inadvertently and, if so, whether this was an offence. At one stage, the prosecution case seemed in danger of collapse. with the judge ruling that there was no evidence to support the charge that Mr Shanmugaratnam had communicated the growth figure to the two brokers. However, the judge later suggested to the prosecution that the trial could go ahead on an amended charge against Mr Shanmugaratnam of having put classified information at risk. The trial's outcome poses questions about press freedom and the handling of information in Singapore, particularly in relation to the country's declared aim of becoming a main global financial centre. Singapore's Official Secrets Act lets the government classify almost any piece of unreleased information as secret. The attorney-general had said during the trial that communicating classified information 'unintentionally, recklessly or in any other way' constituted a crime. The defence argued that this gave the authorities carte blanche to prosecute anyone - from senior officials who had unintentionally released classified data to newspaper readers who saw such material. 'If documents containing classified information are blown by the wind and land in someone's else's hand, this could be seen as a crime,' said the defence. Singapore's press is already tightly controlled and few doubt that the convictions will make journalists more nervous, particularly about investigating the workings of government. Mr Daniel admitted during the trial that, by publishing the figure, he knew he could possibly be breaching the Act. But he said that most analysts at the time seemed to be overestimating economic growth and so to publish only their figures would give the wrong impression. 'I wanted to give a correct assessment of the economic performance up to June 1992,' said Mr Daniel. The Singapore government takes a very different view. 'The government will not allow anyone to use the excuse of 'aggressive reporting' or the needs of 'the information age' to divulge classified information,' said a senior official.</p>

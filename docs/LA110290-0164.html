			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> BREAK-IN GETS MORE OLICE ATTENTION  </P> <P> An Orange County gay rights activist whose home was ransacked and left  spray-painted with anti-homosexual slogans said he believes the incident is now  being investigated as a hate crime by Anaheim police.  </P> <P> Jeff LeTourneau said he is convinced that police, rather than treating the  incident as a "common break-in," have given the ransacking and vandalism added  interest because two more detectives, who were accompanied by a police  photographer, visited his home on Wednesday, one day after it was spray-painted  and $10,000 worth of electronic equipment and jewelry were taken.  </P> <P> Police Lt. Ray Welch could not confirm whether the department had changed its  investigation from a "routine burglary."  </P> <P> Welch, however, said that the investigation has been stepped up, and that  police will begin canvassing LeTourneau's West Forest Lane neighborhood for  further information.  </P> <P> LeTourneau, founder and chairman of the Orange County Visibility League, one of  the county's most vocal gay and lesbian rights groups, said he was overwhelmed  by the amount of support he and his roommates have received from Anaheim  residents.  </P> <P> "We're in the process of rebuilding what we have lost, but the good thing is  that there has been an outpouring of support from people that we don't even  know."  </P> <P> LeTourneau said one person delivered a portable television to his house.  </P> <P> He said he has received death threats in the past and threats that his house  would be burned to the ground.  </P> <P> "I believe that whether the ransacking is part of a bigger picture or an  isolated part, people are acting violently against gays and lesbians," he said.

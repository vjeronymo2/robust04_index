			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Trade policies 'ignore consumers' CONSUMERS' interests are ignored when protectionist trade policies affecting them are agreed, according to the National Consumer Council. In a report published today the council cites examples where trade agreements had proved costly to consumers: A deal between the European Community and Japan will raise the average price of each Japanese car sold by Pounds 740 and cost EC consumers Pounds 23bn over seven years. EC anti-dumping measures on electronic goods, such as CD players, video recorders and photocopiers, cost EC consumers and businesses some Pounds 1.3bn a year and UK consumers Pounds 270m. The price of clothes in the UK would on average be 5 per cent lower if it were not for the Multi-fibre Arrangement, which restricts imports from poorer textile-exporting countries. The argument that such protection saves jobs is denounced by Lady Wilcox, who chairs the council, as a 'big myth'. Jobs may be saved in one sector at the expense of others. The report recommends speedy completion of the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations. It also calls for trade policies to be 'formed in public, justified in public and evaluated in public, with the costs and benefits of any measures proposed spelt out and widely debated.' An independent body should be set up in the EC to evaluate costs and benefits of trade policy actions. Consumers' representatives should also be allowed access to non-confidential information on the basis of which EC decisions are made, notably in anti-dumping.

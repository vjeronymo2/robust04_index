			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with former Prime Minister Leonid </F> Kuchma, by Oksana Mykhaylenko; place and date not given:  "Peninsula of Instability or Compromise?"]    [Text] [Kuchma] Ukraine can develop by either choosing the  African way or the civilized one, that is European, Japanese, or  South Korean. We need new technologies and not shovels.    [Mykhaylenko] What role in this process do you assign to  Russia?    [Kuchma] Given that Japan, for instance, is trying to  initiate close ties with Russia why should Ukraine disrupt them?  Ukraine entirely depends on Russian raw materials. In light of  this, we should proceed from existing realities. Ukraine sells  80 percent of its products to Russia. If we lose this market we  will never be able to reclaim it. Our economy must not be  closed to the outside world. I am ready to personally greet  large Japanese firms thath will arrive in Ukraine with their  investments and new technologies. Everything that will be  manufactured on Ukraine's territory will remain there.    [Mykhaylenko] How do you treat the idea voiced by both  Crimean President Meshkov and Ostankino, who maintain that the  aggravation of the situation in Crimea is used to postpone  presidential elections in Ukraine?    [Kuchma] I would not like to be so blunt, but certain  nuances of this kind seem conceivable. It is possible to annul  presidential elections under the current circumstances. Who is  interested in annulling them? The president. Thus both you and  I have grounds to ask this kind of question.    [Mykhaylenko] Are you going to visit Crimea?    [Kuchma] My visit to Crimea would be inexpedient. We have  the president, while I am often depicted as the pro-Russian  enemy No. 1. The president should proceed from the belief that  future generations will not forgive us faulty steps. Once we  gave Crimea autonomy why raise a turmoil?    [Mykhaylenko] Crimean Supreme Soviet Chairman Tsekov  suggests that Ukraine join Russia along with Crimea.    [Kuchma] However I have never said this. Is it not clear  that those are just political games and a fight for power?    [Mykhaylenko] In light of current relations between Ukraine  and Crimea, what compromises can the Ukrainian and Crimean  legislatures reach?    [Kuchma] Legislative speaker Moroz should go to Crimea and  start negotiating. There is only one way to improve the  situation, namely by creating conditions for the economic  development in the Crimea. Perhaps form a free economic zone.  China does not want to take Hong Kong back, because the latter  is profitable for China.    [Mykhaylenko] What concessions should Crimea make?    [Kuchma] Crimea should acknowledge that it is and will  remain a part of Ukraine.</p>

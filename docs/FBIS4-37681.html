			<p>BFN     [Text] According to reports from the south this morning,  al-Nabatiyah, particularly the (Nadi al-Shaqif) area, came under  an Israeli artillery barrage, killing a soldier and injuring  another.    The Israeli enemy escalated its acts of aggression  yesterday.  Enemy artillery bombarded several areas in the south, creating  severe tension in these areas amid reports from the occupied  border strip on Israeli military movements inside the strip.  According to security sources, Israeli enemy forces and agent  militia [South Lebanese Army] [SLA] increased their military  ground movements in the occupied strip and launched large raking  operations in the woods and beside the roads. These sources  noted that the enemy set up barriers beyond curves in the roads,  and Israeli and SLA soldiers searched cars and interrogated  passengers. In addition, the Israeli forces set up a new  center east of Tallusah, which the resistance men attacked with  rockets. Other enemy movements were spotted in the Hula area.    The UN Interim Forces in Lebanon [UNIFIL] reports confirmed  that the heavy Israeli bombardment continued yesterday and  covered the western, central, and eastern sectors, noting that  the UNIFIL areas of operation also came under the barrage,  including the Fijian contingent area of operations in  al-Mansuri, the Nepalese area in Rshaf, the Irish and Ghanaian  area in Majdal Silm, and the Finnish area in Wadi al-Siryan.  These acts of aggression were accompanied by hostile  overflights over various sectors of the south. Israeli  helicopters flew over the western sector of Tyre up to the  international border from midnight until early this morning.  The resistance retaliated by firing a number of missiles at the  border strip.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Arts: Today's Television The nation's appetite for crime series, factual or fictional, is inexhaustible. That at least is the view of the television companies. The Nick (Channel 4 at 9pm) is real life, a fly-on-the-wall documentary which follows the force of Gipton station in Leeds as it patrols a large chunk of the inner city. Camera teams follow both CID and the uniform branch as they respond to emergencies. The idea has taken a firm grip in the US, where virtually every police car has a cameraman in the back, and sadly it should prove riveting viewing here. Equally investigative is Panorama (BBC 1 9.30) where, to mark the opening of the Labour Party Conference, Tony Blair is brought face to face with five representatives of middle England who try and uncover what he stands for. Alan Rickman (star of Truly, Madly, Deeply) is not a great one for self promotion, but he is producing and raising the money for his latest venture, Mesmer, about the 18th century pioneer of hypnotism. The late Dennis Potter wrote the script and filming is under way in Hungary where BBC 2's cameras catch up with him at 11.15.</p>

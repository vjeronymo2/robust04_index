			<p>BFN     [Text] (NA-DYN) -- With only two days to go before the key  gathering that will decide their party's future, Cordoba  Governor Eduardo Angeloz announced after talks with Radical  Chairman Raul Alfonsin yesterday that he will head a committee  that will have the task of reorganizing the party following last  month's defeat at the polls.    During the 45-minute meeting held at Alfonsin's Barrio  Norter  apartment, Angeloz -- one of the few Radical leaders to win the  April 10 Constituent Assembly elections in his province --  confirmed that his delegates will attend Friday's National  Committee meeting in Vicente Lopez. The body is scheduled to  receive a final report from Alfonsin on the balloting, in which  the Radicals trailed the ruling Justicialist Party by nearly 20  percentage points.    Alfonsin needs the support of the pro-Angeloz delegates at  the plenary meeting to face off the opposition of the so-called  Group of 44 Radicals, who oppose the constitutional reform pact  signed by Alfonsin and President Carlos Menem and are expected  to question Alfonsin's leadership.    One of the anti-reform camp leaders, Senator Fernando de la  Rua, told Radio 9.90 that he was "waiting for a change in the  party's leadership."    Commenting on the Angeloz-Alfonsin summit -- originally  scheduled to take place last week -- the senator said: "The  most important result of the talks is that the reorganization of  the party was discussed."    Another anti-reform Radical, Deputy Federico Storani, told a  local news agency that he was "optimistic" that the meeting  "will unlock" the internal conflict.    Angeloz, in turn, said that Alfonsin will continue as  Radical  head until the end of the Constituent Assembly, which will open  in Parana and Santa Fe on May 25.    The governor announced that he will head a committee of  "political action" which will start a round of talks with all  the party's internal sectors.    Angeloz also met yesterday with the heads of the Radical  Lower and Upper House caucuses, Deputy Raul Galvan and Senator  Jose Genoud, in what is seen as the start of an attempt to  resolve the party's internal crisis.    Angeloz admitted that he had a difficult task ahead and  announced that he will remain in the Federal Capital to continue  talks "to united and strengthen the party."    De la Rua meanwhile confirmed that he still hoped to be the  party's presidential candidate in 1995. But he underlined that  "it is not time yet to formally launch the candidacy."    In related news, the Radical Party Youth yesterday issued a  statement demanding the resignation of the National Committee  led by Alfonsin and holding it responsible for the April 10  defeat.</p>

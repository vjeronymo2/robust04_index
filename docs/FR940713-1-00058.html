			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Swank and Teer (1989) indicated the historical range of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jaguar included portions of the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas. These authors consider the current range to occur from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> central Mexico through Central America and into South America as far  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as northern Argentina. They stated that the United States no longer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contains established breeding populations, which probably disappeared  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the United States in the 1960s. They also maintained that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jaguar prefers a warm tropical climate, is usually associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water, and is only rarely found in extensive arid areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Brown (1983) presented an analysis suggesting there was a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident breeding population of jaguars in the southwestern United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States at least into the 20th century. The Service (U.S. Fish and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wildlife Service 1990) recognized that the jaguar continues to occur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the American Southwest as an occasional wanderer from Mexico.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Previous Federal Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The jaguar is listed as endangered from the U.S. and Mexico  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> border southward to include Central and South America (37 FR 6476,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> March 30, 1972; 50 CFR 17.11, July 15, 1991). The species was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> originally listed as endangered in accordance with the Endangered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Species Conservation Act of 1969 (ESCA). Pursuant to the ESCA, two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate lists of endangered wildlife were maintained, one for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foreign species and one for species native to the United States. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jaguar appeared only on the List of Endangered Foreign Wildlife. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1973, the Endangered Species Act superseded the ESCA. The foreign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and native lists were replaced by a single ``List of Endangered and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Threatened Wildlife,'' which was first published in the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register on September 26, 1975 (40 FR 44412&hyph;44429).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 25, 1979, the Service published a notice (44 FR 43705)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stating that, through an oversight in the listing of the jaguar and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> six other endangered species, the United States populations of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species were not protected by the Act. The notice asserted that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was always the intent of the Service that all populations of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seven species deserved to be listed as endangered, whether they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurred in the United States or in foreign countries. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the notice stated that the Service intended to take action as quickly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as possible to propose inclusion of the United States portions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species' range for listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 25, 1980, the Service published a proposed rule (45 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 49844&hyph;49847) to list the jaguar and four of the other species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referred to above in the United States. The proposal for listing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jaguar and three other species was withdrawn on September 17, 1982  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (47 FR 41145). The notice issued by the Service stated that the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandated withdrawal of proposed rules to list species that have not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been finalized within 2 years of the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 3, 1992, the Service received a petition from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructor and students of the American Southwest Sierra Institute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Life Net to list the jaguar ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Panthera onca <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) as endangered in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States. The petition was dated July 26, 1992. Two subspecies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of jaguar ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> P. o. arizonensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> P. o. veraecrucis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) are recognized as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurring in the United States. Therefore both subspecies are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encompassed by this proposed rule to revise the listed range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Panthera onca <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 13, 1993 (58 FR 19216&hyph;19220), the Service published a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finding that the petition presented substantial information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted and requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comments and biological data on the status of the jaguar.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(b)(3) of the Act requires the Secretary of the Interior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reach a final decision on any petition accepted for review within 12  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months of its receipt. This proposal constitutes the final finding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the petitioned action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

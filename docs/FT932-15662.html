			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Irish Life strikes a blow for industry reform - The company will now not offer combined savings and life insurance products IRISH LIFE made a small but significant breakthrough for reform of the life insurance industry this week. From now on it will not offer combined savings and life insurance products. Customers can buy both at the same time if they wish and combine them with one payment for extra convenience, but the costs of the two will be itemised and kept separate. This makes good sense. Savings and life assurance are different needs and it is unlikely that many people will need to do both at once. If you only need to take out insurance for your family in case you die, there seems little point in saving any extra. The approach does not sound revolutionary, because it keeps up the standard industry practice of using an irritating brand name. But behind the 'Total Quality Lifestyle' range of life and savings products lies some potential good value. How could the approach save you money? Irish Life provide the following example for a 30-year-old man who wants to cover his life for Pounds 250,000 for the next 20 years. Under a standard flexible whole of life policy, which includes an investment element, Irish Life says this would cost Pounds 307.65 per month for 20 years (assuming the fund grows at 7.5 per cent, and that the cover is indexed at 5 per cent annually). Using standard Lautro illustrative growth rates, this would produce a fund value of Pounds 154,000 on growth of 7 per cent, and of Pounds 315,000 on growth of 10.5 per cent. This sounds like an adequate deal. However, under the new TQL system, Irish Life would ask for life assurance premiums of only Pounds 54.95 per month, to cover for 20 years. If our 30-year-old also wanted to save then he could, if he wanted, put Pounds 252.70 towards the TQL Savings contribution and still pay the same as he would have done in total premiums under his flexible whole-of-life contract. Using the same Lautro assumptions, this would grow to Pounds 179,000 on growth of 7 per cent - 16 per cent more than the Pounds 154,000 from the whole-of-life policy. On a growth rate of 10.5 per cent the gain is even more pronounced - Pounds 379,000, an advantage of 20 per cent. Unbundling life assurance is not easy, and Irish Life's new 'Total Quality Lifestyle Account' includes three forms of assurance, two forms of term insurance and two savings plans. Contributions in each area are analysed and priced separately. However, the convenience of keeping the disparate elements under one heading, often touted by life insurance salesmen, is maintained by allowing all three elements to be administered under one account number using one direct debit and one administration fee. According to Tony Dallison, marketing manager: 'One of the common complaints from clients is that the product they purchase cannot change with their circumstances, or that if it can, there is a heavy penalty charge. This is no longer the case.' Irish Life should not be judged on its new improved structure alone. Ultimately, its products must stand on the cheapness of the protection premiums and the strength of its investment performance. It is likely that you will be able to get better value by shopping around. But the move does make life assurance easier to understand, and makes it harder for less scrupulous sales agents to sell people products which they do not need. It is also timely, as the Office of Fair Trading recommended last month that insurance companies should be forced to reveal what proportions of life premiums went towards investment and assurance. The life assurance industry has not yet made a detailed response to the proposals beyond claiming that the OFT's figures would be difficult to calculate. This is particularly the case for with-profits contracts, where investment profits are added via arcane annual bonus systems and do not fluctuate with a unitised fund. Life assurance is an integral, although minor, part of endowment policies, which offer life assurance but also pay out at the end of a fixed period even if you are still alive. The sum you would receive on death increases during the life of the policy, in line with investment returns. The exercise of separating life cover from the rest of the investment proved difficult for all the large endowment providers contacted this week by the Weekend FT, and different actuarial assumptions may have been used. They were asked how much of the Pounds 30 monthly premium paid into an endowment policy by a 29-year-old man would go towards life cover. Commercial Union reckoned that Pounds 1.20 from each premium would be needed to pay for the life cover. Standard Life reckoned on 80p for a 10-year policy, and 95p for a 25-year policy. GA Life estimated the cost at 55p per month. The Prudential was unable to produce a figure, although the company emphasised that it was quite prepared to disclose it - the problem was making the complex actuarial calculations involved. Legal &amp; General refused to disclose the information on grounds of business confidentiality. The Office of Fair Trading provided an example of the disclosure it would like to see from a good company, and estimated that life cover would cost Pounds 18 each year out of total premiums of Pounds 600 - or Pounds 1.50 from Pounds 50 premiums. A message common to all was that endowments should always be treated as investments. That is why the OFT wants life offices to disclose the same information for endowments as they do for unit trusts, which have no life cover element. In the meantime, Irish Life's exercise should make life assurance easier to understand, while allowing customers to shop around. Will other companies follow its lead?</p>

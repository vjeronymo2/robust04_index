The  government still hopes to reach an agreement, but it is already  admitting the possibility of postponing a bit the announcement  to creditor banks, which was to have been made on 10 March.    A high-ranking Finance Ministry source outlined to this  newspaper three areas of concern for the IMF: excessive foreign  capital inflow and its impact on the monetary policy; public  sector salary expenses; and the fiscal policy. A technician has  said that the IMF is planning a primary surplus (discounting the  payment of interest and monetary correction target of 4 percent  of the GNP).    The government decided to avoid placing immediate  restrictions on incoming capital. Provisional Measure 438, which  was released yesterday, gives the government the possibility of  creating an IOF [financial operations tax] of up to 25 percent  on the net value of currency exchange operations. There is  currently a 3 percent tax applying to foreign capital invested  in bonds and other securities, and a 5 percent tax applying to  foreign investment in fixed profit funds in Brazil. There are  indications that restrictions will be increased.    The IMF is also dissatisfied with public servant salary  spending. IMF technicians claim that 1993 spending grew too  much, in real terms. The government argues that this was the  inevitable effect of legal decisions on salary equalization. In  addition, it argues that during the Fernando Collor government,  salaries were reduced to levels that are unsustainable in the  medium term.    Rather than concentrating on salaries, the IMF concern has  always focused on the fiscal adjustment. In this regard, the  implementation of the URV [real value unit] opens new unknowns,  about which the IMF is certainly concerned.    Here is an example mentioned by a technician: How will the  URV conversion work for the salaries and utility rates of state  and municipal governments? The federal government can control  its own sector, for which austere rules were established, but  states and municipal districts are independent. These variables  obviously have direct influence on the deficit of state and  municipal governments.    In the case of the direct federal administration, the rule  established in the provisional measure creating the URV is  clear, but the provisional measure still has to be approved by  Congress.    The IMF is designing a primary surplus of 4 percent of the  GNP as a target for the entire public sector, including  state-run enterprises, states, and municipal districts. The  matter is being comprehensively analyzed. The table released by  the Finance Ministry to restructure the figures of the 1994  budget after approval of the Social Emergency Fund -- which was  promulgated yesterday -- estimates interest spending at $7.7  billion, which is equivalent to slightly less than 2 percent of  the GNP. This figure corresponds to federal administration  expenses.    The Brazilian promise is to balance accounts from an  operational point of view, excluding monetary and exchange rate  adjustment, but including interest in real terms. This means  that the bigger the spending in interest, the bigger the need  for fiscal funds for zeroing the operational deficit.    The objective of the economic team by reaching a balance on  operational terms is to end the government need to borrow money  from the financial market through the issuance of securities  except to refinance the debt principal. This would reduce the  pressure on the private sector and would allow, in the future, a  reduction of the interest rates paid by the government. In the  short term, however, high real interest rates are an important  instrument for controlling the implementation of the URV until  the new real currency comes into effect.    There is an basic concept difference behind the fiscal  debate. The IMF thinks that given that the Brazilian  stabilization plan is being implemented in an atmosphere of  political instability and during an election race, it will  require a fiscal "overkill" [preceding word in English], that  is, it will require the generation of a fiscal surplus beyond  what would normally be necessary, as a sure signal of the  Brazilian intention to stabilize prices. This is why the IMF  initiated talks with Brazil about an operational 3 percent  surplus of the GNP.    It has been demonstrated in the past few months, however,  that it will be politically impossible to obtain more than what  has been obtained. Economic team members say that the IMF has  accepted the idea of a balance in operational terms and that it  is only redoing its calculations to determine the consistency of  such goal.    As for the "heterodox" component of the stabilization plan,  a  reliable source has said that there are different points of view  inside the IMF. The "old guard" represented by Sterie Beza,  chief of the South Atlantic Department, certainly prefers the  traditional method of fiscal and monetary austerity. Younger  experts support the principle of removing the indexation of the  economy, as long as the "basic principles" of fiscal and  monetary austerity are respected.    IMF Manager-Director Michel Camdessus is in a difficult  position. His image was tarnished abroad and in Brazil after  endorsing the economic adjustment plan of former Minister  Marcilio Marques Moreira which never took off completely. Now,  he is currently much more careful to express support for  something inconsistent.    The IMF, however, does not want to be accused of being  responsible for preventing the creditors from reaching an  agreement with Brazil mainly because if the agreement fails, it  would take a long time to find another opportunity, perhaps a  year or two, as a consequence of the upcoming presidential  inauguration.    Despite everything, the government is confident that the IMF  will prepare a letter of intent and a memorandum of  understanding in time to allow Brazil reach an agreement with  the banks. The possibility of a postponement is nonetheless  already being admitted.    It would be necessary to announce on 10 March the reaching  of  a technical agreement and to sign the agreement on 15 April, the  day the agreement with the banks and bond issuance expire.  Instead of postponing the 15 April deadline, which would require  the approval of 95 percent of the creditor banks, it is possible  that, if necessary, the date for announcing the reaching of an  agreement be brought forward from 10 March. This would give the  IMF experts more time to clarify their doubts and monitor the  implementation of the URV.    A postponement of this kind, if it happens, will not be very  traumatic. A postponement would be much more serious if it were  the consequence of disagreements over substantial subjects. But  this possibility is currently not on the horizon.    There exists a frank skepticism toward the Brazilian  stabilization plan in the IMF's sister institution, that is, in  the World Bank (IBRD). The idea there is that the fiscal  adjustment plan so far implemented is clearly not enough.    In the times of the economic plan of Minister Marcilio  Marques Moreira, the IBRD was a harsh critic and clearly told  the IMF that it did not agree with its endorsement of the  Brazilian plan. So much so that the IBRD conditioned the  approval of structural credits to Brazil on the execution of the  agreement with the IMF for at least six months, something that  never happened.</p>

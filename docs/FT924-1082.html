			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Travel: Tumble-dried through desert landscapes - Fleeing the charmless tourist island of Jerba, Sara Webb heads west into the Tunisian Sahara, to a land of dancing butterflies IT WAS the writer and traveller Paul Bowles who said there are probably few accessible places on the face of the globe where you can get less comfort for your money than the Sahara. For a man who loved North Africa, Bowles could be damning about the amenities: 'You can still get something flat to lie down on, stewed turnips and sand, noodles and jam, and a few tendons of something euphemistically called chicken to eat, and the stub of a candle to undress by at night, but you will pay heavily for these luxuries. . . perhaps the logical question to ask at this point is: why go?' One reason for going might be to get away from a charmless coastal resort such as Jerba, I thought. The island off the Tunisian coast is one of many claiming to be the setting for the lotus eaters. Today, Ulysses' sailors would be only too pleased to escape the identical mock village hotels swarming with pale-skinned tourists in fuschia shellsuits. Much has changed since Bowles travelled through the desert. He entered Tunisia in the pre-independence days with two camels and a long-suffering camel driver who ran back and forth between them, attempting to force the recalcitrant beasts to move in a straight line while trying to tend to some knitting which hung around his neck. Today, you find electricity and air-conditioned hotel rooms. You journey across the desert in a cloud of dust and fine sand kicked up by a Jeep. It is a far less romantic way to travel, and less comfortable than the slow lolloping stride of a camel. The fine sand steals into every crevice of your clothing, lodges in your eyelashes and rasps against your teeth. The Tunisians say it is so fine it can slip unnoticed beneath the sealed cap of a fizzy drink bottle. You jolt from bump to hollow, tumble-dried through a succession of different desert landscapes: from the pink and gold mountains around Mides and Tamerza near the Algerian border, to the barren salt flats of the Chott El Jerid that sparkle with crystallised salt and dancing butterflies as jittery as the mirages; from the scrub-topped yellow hillocks around Douz until you reach the real desert, the picture-book desert of dunes near Ksar Ghilane which belong to the Great Eastern Erg. From a distance, the village of Ksar Ghilane was a splash of green set against a parched backdrop of sand. Close up, a scummy tideline of old plastic mineral water bottles and other rubbish marked the outskirts of the settlement. Hobbled camels and donkeys tethered outside the concrete bungalows snuffled among the detritus for edible leftovers. It looked a dump. But behind the palm trees lay a sea of rolling dunes as stippled and striated as a Bridgit Riley canvas - gold, tawny, and slowly reddening in the setting sun. We set out on camelback to see the old Roman fortress and, as dusk fell, the camel drivers briefly dropped on their knees, backs to the setting sun, and prayed to Allah. Within an hour, the clear sky was peppered with hundreds of stars, flashing and shooting in small bursts across the blackness, and blinking through my tent-flap long after the candles had burnt out. After the dust and dirt and blow-torch brightness of the desert, it is a relief to drive up to the shade of an oasis. Frogs splash around in the waterfalls and are probably the most active of the oasis inhabitants during the heat of the day. We stumbled across one of the date farmers in the village of Chebika, and he obligingly climbed a palm tree to pluck us some fruit. The ripening orange dates hung like heavy earrings below a spiky punkish halo of palm fronds, some wrapped in sheets of plastic to save them from rain damage and animals. Beneath, the pomegranates, figs and oranges grew in disorderly profusion. Of the 140 or so varieties of dates grown in Tunisia, the ones from the desert oases are said to be the best, but these ones tasted sour and unripe. The fruit is eaten or sold at the local market; in the past, the tree trunks and fronds were used to make the local houses, forming beams and thatching. But heavy rains and flash floods easily sweep away the flimsy buildings, and today some of the oasis dwellers prefer to live in concrete bungalows, with tiny windows to keep out the heat. Once the sun's heat starts to wane, the people come outdoors to chat and stroll in the main street. At least, the men do. Even though Tunisia is one of the more westernised Islamic countries, outside the big cities you might as well be in a single-sex country. Women, if they venture out, are shrouded in swathes of black cloth with not so much as an eyeslit to tell you in which direction they are facing. The men sip coffee in the street bars, or order the waiter to bring them a long-necked hookah to smoke in the evening calm. In the palmeries, two male trees are planted for every harem of 100 females. But in the streets, men far out-number women. Sara Webb travelled c/o Tunis Air (24 Sackville St, London W1X 1DE, tel: 071-734-7644). The Tunisian National Tourist Office is at 77a Wigmore St, London W1H 9LJ, 071-224-5561. Tunis Air flies from London Heathrow to Tunis on Fridays, Sundays and Tuesdays. If you want to visit the desert oases, you can fly from Tunis to Tozeur and then hire a Jeep and driver-guide. The tourist office in Tozeur should be able to recommend an agent if you want to arrange your own trip to the desert oases. It is better to take a Jeep and experienced driver - ordinary passenger cars are not suitable for rough desert terrain. Alternatively, you can join a group; many of the hotels in towns like Tozeur and Douz arrange trips to the desert. As always, accommodation ranges from the very comfortable (Hotel Tamerza Palace, for example) to the basic (the camping site at Ksar Ghilane).</p>

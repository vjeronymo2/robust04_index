			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Fears of 'chaos' over council tax COUNCIL TAX could produce as much administrative chaos as poll tax unless it is changed significantly, the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux (Nacab) warned yesterday. Nacab says in a report comparing plans for council tax with its experience of poll tax that clear information about the operation of the new tax should be made available well before its introduction. Nacab also wants an option for taxpayers to pay weekly, and says they should be allowed to pay any council-tax debts by 'realistic instalments' before bailiffs are called in.</p>

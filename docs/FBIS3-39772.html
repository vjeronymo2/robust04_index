			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russia `may undertake' an initiative to settle the  Greek-Skopjean [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM] dispute. Government sources reached this  conclusion based on Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's  talks in Athens. This conclusion is also strengthened by  information from Belgrade, according to which the Russian  Government has a broader plan to settle all the aspects of the  Yugoslav crisis. The ease with which Russia achieved the  lifting of the deadlock in Bosnia-Herzegovina confirms this fact.    The moderation with which Skopje has so far dealt with the  Greek partial economic embargo reinforces the view that Russia  has undertaken a behind-the-scenes diplomatic activity.    We must not let the fact that large European countries such  as Germany, which only reacted "lukewarmly" to the Greek  Government decision, pass unnoticed. Tomorrow's critical  European Union [EU] Council of Ministers meeting will clarify  the position of the 11.</p>

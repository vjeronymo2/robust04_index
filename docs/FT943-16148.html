			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / The Rail Dispute: NOP poll finds blame on government increasing A poll by NOP after last Wednesday's stoppage found that voters allocated 40 per cent of the blame to the government, 18 per cent to Railtrack and 18 per cent to the RMT union, Kevin Brown writes. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said the poll showed that voters did not trust the government's claims that it had left negotiations to Railtrack and the union. A cabinet sub-committee chaired by Lord Wakeham, the leader of the Lords, is monitoring the dispute, but ministers have no plans for further intervention in the short term.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / People: Carr leaves County NatWest for PW John Carr has resigned as a director of County NatWest to help develop a project finance division at Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm. As director of project finance, he joins a team of nine partners and about 40 staff including four assistant directors in the corporate finance division. He is at least the second person to join from County in the last two years. Carr spent nine years at the Department of Energy including two on secondment to Morgan Grenfell's energy and project finance department. He then spent eight years at County NatWest, where he became a director specialising in infrastructure finance. 'We began talking to each other and it seemed a very interesting opportunity,' he says of his latest move. 'Project finance is a natural extension of PW's existing work on privatisation.' The firm had already seen the opportunities of moving into project finance, he says, so he was 'knocking at a door that was already ajar'. Carr says that while banks often provide finance as well as advice on raising funds, PW can carve out a niche without offering financial support to its clients. 'Some clients are quite happy with someone clearly sitting on their side of the table with no funding interest to cloud their advice,' he says.</p>

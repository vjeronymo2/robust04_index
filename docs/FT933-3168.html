			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy The government must be particularly anxious to keep the lid on public sector pay. Any hint of weakness would undermine its credibility on inflation and raise new worries about the size of the public sector borrowing requirement. The result could be a nasty setback in the gilts market at a time when the funding need is still high. It is thus no surprise that the Treasury has come out with a stand on pay which could bring it into direct and embarrassing confrontation with the review bodies. Cynics will say that that by allowing increases to be financed by efficiency gains, the government has opened the door to spurious productivity deals that will end up breaching its cash limits. Doubtless there will be an element of fudge: it would be a miracle if the government could keep its wage bill unchanged in cash terms next year. But its 1.5 per cent limit for the current year has worked better than many anticipated and public sector workers will attract little sympathy from their counterparts in the private sector, many of whom are still enduring pay freezes. Although the Treasury's plan looks ambitious, the prospects are thus for continued constraint on public sector pay. Desirable as this may be for the overall economy, it will not do much for consumer confidence. Individuals will need rising real incomes before rushing back to the housing market and resuming purchases on credit. Indeed, there is an inherent contradiction between pay restraint working only because of a weak economy and expectations of a sustained consumer-led recovery. That makes yesterday's weak figures on manufacturing output all the more disappointing.</p>

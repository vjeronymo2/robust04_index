Burokevicius and  J. Jermalavicius are now in Lukishskaya [as transliterated]  Jail. The Lithuanian Prosecutor's Office is not carrying out any  investigations, it is giving the "members of the professional  underground," as they describe themselves, time to get  accustomed to their new position. The first cross-examination  showed that they do not really realize what happened. M.  Burokevicius is still in the jail sick bay with cardiac  insufficiency.    Meanwhile the Lithuanian General Prosecutor's Office has  asked the corresponding bodies in Russia for the extradition of  a few other people involved in the Vilnius coup case: Major  General A. Naudjunas, Colonel J. Kasperavicius, and the leaders  of the former USSR's power ministries, V. Kryuchkov and D. Yazov.    "We would never have gotten M. Burokevicius and J.  Jermalavicius had Moscow not wanted this," K. Gashka, member of  the Sejmas National Security Committee, told the newspaper  RESPUBLIKA. He has no doubt that leaders of the Communist Party  of Lithuania have been deliberately handed over to Lithuania so  that a third country's tasks can be carried out by means of  their trial in Vilnius.    What has happened has caused vehement discontent in Belarus  among the Communist faction in the Supreme Soviet and set-tos in  parliament. Belarusian General Prosecutor V. Sholodonov has  given orders for an inquiry to be started into his subordinates'  involvement in the "abduction" of Burokevicius and  Jermalavicius. The parliamentary commission for national  security, defense, and the fight against organized crime in  Belarus has asked for the republic's internal affairs minister,  V. Yegorov, and KGB Chairman Ye. Shirkovskiy to be removed from  their posts (the former's resignation has already been  announced).</p>

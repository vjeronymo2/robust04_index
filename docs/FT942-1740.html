			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Hungary rulers to share power Hungary's Socialists, after their overwhelming victory in last month's elections, have calmed fears of one-party rule by former communists by agreeing yesterday to share power with liberals. Socialist party leader and premier designate Mr Gyula Horn yesterday announced the concession of three of 12 ministries to the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats. Mr Gabor Kuncze, the central figure of the Free Democrats' campaign, is set to take the powerful Interior Ministry, as well as the position of deputy prime minister. The Free Democrats have also won a right to consultation which comes close to that of veto over government policies and appointments. But the Socialists controversially take the Defence Ministry and the national security office, two sensitive institutions which their communist predecessors used to maintain their hold on power. The Socialists won 209 of 386 seats and a majority in May's elections but they and the Free Democrats have come under pressure to form a coalition. Although the Socialists adhere to free-market and west-oriented policies, the Free Democrats are widely seen as a guarantee that the former communists' conversion will not be reversed.</p>

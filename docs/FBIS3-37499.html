Milosevic, president of  the Republic of Serbia, and which is also addressed to R.  Karadzic, other Serbian leaders, and the Serbian people.    The message contains Russia's request to the Serbs to  withdraw their heavy weapons from Sarajevo in as short a time as  possible in the interests of stopping the bloodshed, and  expressing Russia's readiness to deploy its contingent in  Sarajevo within the framework of the UN peacekeeping operation.    Yeltsin's message was handed over to S. Milosevic in  Belgrade  and to the Bosnian Serbs' leaders in Pale by Vitaliy Churkin,  the Russian president's special envoy and Russian deputy foreign  minister.    The Serbian leaders have accepted the Russian Federation's  initiative with gratitude. R. Karadzic stated at a news press  conference in Pale that the Bosnian Serbs will withdraw their  heavy weapons within the next few days. At the same time, they  count on the Muslim troops also halting all military actions in  Sarajevo, and that the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] will also  keep their side of the bargain.    The Russian and Serbian sides expressed mutual hope that by  solving the Sarajevo crisis they will help to end the war and to  achieve a political settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

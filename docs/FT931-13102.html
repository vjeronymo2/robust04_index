			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bankers Trust climbs 24% BANKERS TRUST, the big New York banking group, yesterday unveiled a healthy 24 per cent rise in fourth-quarter 1992 net earnings, to Dollars 170m, or Dollars 1.97 per share. The profits improvement occurred despite halved fourth-quarter trading revenues of Dollars 101m. It was helped along by lower bad debt provisions and higher net interest and fee income. The bank's net interest revenues before provisions in the fourth quarter was Dollars 396m, sharply higher than the Dollars 168m recorded in the last quarter of 1991. Fiduciary and funds management generated Dollars 158m of revenues, up by 19 per cent year-on-year. Fees and commissions were up 9 per cent at Dollars 144m. Fourth-quarter bad debt provisions declined by 25 per cent to Dollars 50m. Provisions for the whole of 1992 were 13 per cent lower at Dollars 225m. Total non-performing assets were down by 4 per cent to Dollars 2.46bn in the final quarter of 1992. For the full year, Bankers Trust recorded Dollars 761m, or Dollars 8.82 per share, of net profits, up by 14 per cent on the Dollars 667m, or Dollars 7.75, earned in 1991. Mr Charles Sanford, chairman of Bankers Trust, said the results demonstrated the inherent strength within the bank's portfolio of businesses, including risk management, underwriting, advisory, asset management, lending and operational services. He said favourable trends in asset quality positioned the bank for a promising 1993. The bank's capital was also strengthened during 1992, with total equity of Dollars 3.8bn at year-end, some Dollars 397m higher than at the end of 1991. The important tier one capital-to-assets ratio used by bank regulators was 7.65 per cent at year-end. On Wall Street, the bank's share price was Dollars 1 1/8 lower at Dollars 66 5/8 at the close.</p>

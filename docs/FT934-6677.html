			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Congress in deadlock on gun curbs The Senate is almost certain to be called back into session next week to vote on handgun controls, after several parliamentary manoeuvres failed to break a Republican filibuster. Senator George Mitchell, the Democratic leader, and Senator Bob Dole, his Republican counterpart, were still debating tactics last night on the floor of a virtually empty chamber, almost all the other senators having gone home for Thanksgiving. But Senator Mitchell was adamant he would not let the Senate adjourn until January without forcing another vote on the Brady bill, which imposes a waiting period on the purchase of handguns. This increasingly bitter confrontation, devoted to the finest technicalities of the bill, overshadowed the conclusion of a congressional term which continued to hand President Clinton a number of provisional victories. The House narrowly voted down the bipartisan Penny-Kasich bill, which would have forced Dollars 103bn in extra spending cuts over the next five years, and passed the president's more modest Dollars 37bn alternative. But the closeness of the first vote, 219-213, suggests that budget-trimming has not lost steam and that the proposed balanced budget amendment could pass next year. The House also approved after much delay, a campaign finance reform bill intended, mostly through voluntary compliance, to cut the cost of elections. Substantial differences, however, remain with the Senate version, to be carried over until next year. But both chambers finally agreed on a measure extending unemployment benefits by 13 weeks to those who have used up their standard six months of eligibility. This now awaits the president's signature. Yesterday he signed the bill ending US sanctions against South Africa. The Brady bill passed both chambers last week in slightly differing forms and the House on Monday night accepted the compromise version produced by a joint conference committee. This includes a five year life for the bill, whereas the Republican wants it cut to four, as was contained in the Senate bill. Mr Clinton was guardedly confident that a deal would eventually be cut. The extent of the pressure for tighter gun control was evident in the announcement by Winchester, the firearms manufacturer, that it was withdrawing from public sale one of its most destructive bullets. The Black Talon, it said, would only be made available for the police and military . This is the cartridge, able to pierce bullet-proof vests and expandable on impact, that had attracted the particular attention of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan last month. He proposed a punitive 10,000 per cent sales tax increase on it. Mr Howard Paster, the White House chief of congressional relations, who played a central role in winning approval by Congress of the North American Free Trade Agreement, surprised Washington by saying he would resign at the end of the year for family reasons.</p>

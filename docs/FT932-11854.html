			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Aga income unchanged in first term AGA, the Swedish industrial gas group, yesterday reported unchanged profits after financial items in the first quarter at SKr415m (Dollars 57m) compared with the same period last year, despite a sharp rise in sales to SKr3.7bn from SKr2.8bn. The company, with more than 80 per cent of its sales outside Sweden, said the sales figure was boosted by the devaluation of the Swedish krona last autumn and the consolidation of CEGF, a French cold storage company 98 per cent owned since the end of last year. Although depreciation charges rose to SKr342m, from SKr235m, reflecting increased levels of investment in eastern and other parts of Europe, operating income was up almost 20 per cent, at SKr392m, thanks to the devaluation effect. However, net financial expenses soared from SKr3m to SKr89m as a result of higher interest charges in krona terms for foreign loans and the cost of financing the purchase of CEGF. This left profits little changed. The 1992 results were restated to take into account results from the Swedish power group Gullspangs Kraft, which is 34 per cent owned by Aga and is now treated as an associated company. Mr Marcus Storch, chief executive, said the company was feeling the effect of economic downturn in Europe and had yet to see much improvement in the US, despite a general upturn in the American economy. He expected an improvement for the full year over last year's SKr1.48bn profit.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- Opposition leader Yohei  Kono urged Thursday [21 April] parties in the ruling coalition  to disband, saying a delay in choosing a new prime minister is  impermissible. Kono, president of the major opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP), said in a statement that the coalition  ignores the people through its prolonged negotiations, and that  the situation has already passed the permissible point.    He said the coalition should have the courage to disband  rather than conceal differences in policies. After the  dissolution of the coalition, parties should again discuss  policies and decide on a new government, he said.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced on April 8 that  he  will resign over his alleged shady financial deals and delays in  Diet deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget. During nearly two  weeks after Hosokawa's announcement of his resignation, the  ruling parties have not chosen his successor due to internal  power struggles and differences over key policies for a new  cabinet.    Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, head of the coalition's core  party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], is regarded as the most  probable successor to Hosokawa.    Kono also said Japan should have a "definite policy" before  sending its finance minister to a series of international  monetary meetings in Washington this weekend. On Sunday,  finance ministers and central bank presidents from the Group of  Seven (G-7) industrialized nations are scheduled to meet in the  U.S. capital.    The LDP president urged a speedy beginning to Diet  deliberations on fiscal 1994 budget bills, saying the obstacles  to debate disappeared now that Hosokawa announced he would step  down. The coalition government submitted the bills to the Diet  in early March, but the LDP insisted on discussing Hosokawa's  financial transactions first and has refused to start budget  debates.    Kono said Hosokawa's questionable deals should be discussed  further at a Diet committee, but not at the Budget Committee  where the budget is tabled, noting that he will continue to be  head of a political party, the Japan New Party.    Hosokawa had been under fire over suspicions about shady  fund-raising through a 100 million yen loan from a  scandal-tainted trucking firm and a stock purchase.</p>

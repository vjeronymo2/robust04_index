The shadowy National Action, which operates from post boxes  in Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne, launched a "White Australia-SA  [South Africa] Solidarity" campaign in its latest newsletter.    "In response to appeals for help from our brother nation,  the  Afrikanners of SA, National Action has decided to assist in  fund-raising for the nationalist AWB," the National Action News  said in an editorial. Donors are asked to send money to a bank  account in the name of the AWB Wenkommando [Victory Commando] in  Ventersdorp in the western Transvaal. The group is also  offering White Australia-SA Solidarity T-shirts, bearing the  swastika-like symbol of the AWB.    National Action, which is virulently opposed to Asian  immigration into Australia, is one of a number of rightwing  groups which operate of the fringes of Australian society. In  recent months it has published a series of articles promoting a  "boerestaat" [Boer homeland] in SA and its possible connection  with right-wing SA backers has attracted the attention of  Australian police.    A police spokesman said yesterday the force was looking  seriously at the AWB fund-raising appeal as a possible  contravention of the Crime (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment)  Act of 1978. The Act makes it an offence for anyone in  Australia to raise money or give money that will be used to  incite fear or death or violence in the people of any foreign  country.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A marketing program that is illegal under the anti-kickback statute may pose a danger to patients because the offering or payment of remuneration may interfere with a physician's judgment in determining the most appropriate treatment for a patient. Further, where the patient is a Medicaid beneficiary, these drug marketing practices may increase the Federal government's costs of reimbursing suppliers for the products. The OIG is investigating various drug marketing schemes, and enforcing the anti-kickback laws where these practices affect the Federal health care programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> What To Look For <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Generally, a payment or gift may be considered improper under 42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7b(b) if it is: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Made to a person in a position to generate business for the paying party; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Related to the volume of business generated; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;More than nominal in value and/or exceeds fair market value of any legitimate service rendered to the payer, or is unrelated to any service at all other than referral of patients. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OIG investigation may be warranted where one or more of the following features is present in prescription drug marketing activities: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Any prize, gift or cash payment, coupon or bonus (e.g., airline discounts and related travel premiums), offered to physicians and/or suppliers (including pharmacies, mail order prescription drug companies and managed care organizations) in exchange for, or based on, prescribing or providing specific prescription products. These items are particularly suspect if based on value or volume of business generated for the drug company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Materials which offer cash or other benefits to pharmacists (or others in a position to recommend prescription drug products) in exchange for performing marketing tasks in the course of pharmacy practice related to Medicare or Medicaid. The marketing tasks may include sales-oriented ``educational'' or ``counseling'' contacts, or physician and/or patient outreach, etc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Grants to physicians and clinicians for studies of prescription products when the studies are of questionable scientific value and require little or no actual scientific pursuit. The grants may nonetheless offer substantial benefits based on, or related to, use of the product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Any payment, including cash or other benefit, given to a patient, provider or supplier for changing a prescription, or recommending or requesting such a change, from one product to another, unless the payment is made fully consistent with a ``safe harbor'' regulation, 42 CFR 1001.952, or other Federal provision governing the reporting of prescription drug prices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

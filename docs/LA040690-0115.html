			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RACE TRACKS SOFT-SELL THEIR MOST LUCRATIVE ATTRACTION  </P> <P> By the traditional standards of the racing business, this will be an ordinary  day at Pimlico. There are no stakes races or notable horses on the 10-race  card; there are no special promotions, no tote-bag giveaways.  </P> <P> Yet the atmosphere at Pimlico, and at the Laurel simulcast, will be crackling  with excitement, because of a $228,814 jackpot that has amassed in the  double-triple. A bettor who correctly picks the one-two-three finishers in both  the third and fifth races could win more than $300,000.  </P> <P> There is nothing that will generate fan interest, publicity and wagering  activity more than such an opportunity to win a spectacular sum of money.  Laurel demonstrated this in memorable fashion in late 1988, when its  double-triple carryover grew into seven digits.  </P> <P> "That was by far the most profitable week any track in Maryland has ever had,"  said Jim Mango, the track's vice president for operations.  </P> <P> And yet the racing industry has devoted almost no effort to developing and  promoting exotic wagers. Some tracks' managements (Santa Anita's, for example)  act as if there is something vaguely distasteful about the wagering part of  their business. And most are utterly oblivious to the fact that exotic wagers  are potentially their most important product.  </P> <P> Consider for example a couple of events at Gulfstream Park this winter. The  track paid Bill Shoemaker to make a stop on his farewell tour, and promoted the  event relentlessly in the local media. This great expenditure of effort and  money may have added a paltry few thousand dollars to a normal Saturday handle  at Gulfstream, yet this was the kind of traditional promotion that track  marketing people love.  </P> <P> On the Sunday of the next week, Gulfstream's pick six had built into six  figures. If nobody hit it, track officials thought a carryover would boost  their handle the next racing day by as much as $600,000. Yet on that crucial  Sunday, the racing secretary foolishly carded a pair of small fields with  overwhelming favorites as part of the pick six -- enabling several bettors to  hit it and killing the carryover jackpot. (Elsewhere on the card, there were  three open 12-horse fields that probably would have foiled bettors if they had  been part of the pick six.)  </P> <P> If anyone in Gulfstream's management had chosen to think even briefly about the  pick six and its importance, the track would have had its carryover and its  resultant bonanza the next day. But nobody did.  </P> <P> The reason is that racetrack-marketing departments are in the habit of  promoting giveaways and special events like the Shoemaker tour, but they don't  market gambling. Few track managements have even tried intelligently to answer  the basic question: What makes a good exotic wager?  </P> <P> Tom Aronson, a Washington-based consultant to racetracks, has analyzed the  subject, and he said, "Bettors have a very keen ability to decide when they're  not being paid enough for predicting an improbable event. Some tracks tried  offering a pick six without a carryover and people wouldn't bet it; they said,  'If I'm going to pick six winners, I've got to get back more than $3,000.' But  to attract racegoers to a bet, it has to be within their field of logic. If you  ask them to pick six winners in a row, that's plausible; if you ask them to  pick nine in a row, it's not."  </P> <P> For this reason, California's pick nine, Hialeah's pick ten, and various  tracks' trifecta-superfecta combinations generally have not been popular. The  pick six and the double-triple are the only exotics that have had widespread  success. Fans think it is conceivable to hit them, and they like that there is  a reasonable consolation payoff for a near-miss. But no significant new forms  of exotic wagering have been introduced in years.  </P> <P> "State lotteries understand that every game has its limits and they have to  keep introducing new things to keep people's interest," Aronson said. "But  there is a limited understanding in horse racing of product development."  </P> <P> Where can exotic wagering go from here? Aronson likes the idea of guaranteeing  the minimum size of the betting pool to make it build faster. People don't bet  much in the double-triple when there is no carryover because there isn't enough  economic incentive. But if Laurel guaranteed a pot of $50,000, they would bet  from the outset and the pot would grow faster.  </P> <P> Mango thinks a better variation on the current theme would be to change the  size of the wagering unit. He said, "The common thing I hear is, 'Make the  double-triple a $1 bet.' But you'd never build up a big carryover, and you'd  allow the big syndicates to play three times as many combinations (thus giving  them an even better chance of tying up all the logical combinations). I'd like  to experiment with the size of the base wager. Suppose you guaranteed the  double-triple for $250,000 and made the base wager $5 or $10?"  </P> <P> One dog track in Florida has devised a successful variation on the basic  exotic-wagering theme with a $1 wager. The object in Hollywood Greyhound  Track's tri-super was to pick the first three finishers in one race and the  first four finishers in the next. But when the carryover reached $100,000 it  was "capped" -- no further money was added to the jackpot pool.  </P> <P> This might not seem to make sense from the track's standpoint, but Hollywood  had found that when a jackpot grew much higher, syndicates would make such  large investments that they would almost always hit the bet. But these  syndicates weren't going to invest, say, $30,000 in the tri-super to win  $100,000. The effect of the "cap" was to keep the tri-super jackpot alive,  night after night.  </P> <P> The possibilities are endless, if only more racetrack managements would start  thinking about them and engaging in "product development." One day somebody is  going to conceive of an exotic bet that will generate the excitement of  Pimlico's $228,814 double-triple carryover on an almost daily basis.  </P></p>

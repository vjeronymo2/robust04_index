According to the Shenzhen  City CPC Committee propaganda department, replacing the  propaganda board with Deng Xiaoping's picture with a new one is  an important official task of the city before the current spring  festival. This in no way implies that Deng Xiaoping will come  to south China on an inspection tour again. Some local  residents were seen standing on the roadside commenting on the  new picture and the new "quotation from Deng."    The new picture still stands at the original place, namely,  near the Grand Shenzhen Theater where Hongling Road Middle and  Shennan Road meet and which one must pass when traveling from  the city to Nantou and Dongguan. The board is five meters tall  and 20 meters wide. As there is a very big open space around  the board, one can see it very clearly from the top of a  building several kilometers away. The new picture of Deng  Xiaoping is mainly blue, green, and white. Deng's picture  occupies a prominent position with blue sky and white clouds  overhead and the Great Wall at the bottom. In the picture, Deng  Xiaoping is looking at Shenzhen and Dapeng Bay. In the upper  left corner is a 13-character quotation from Deng which reads:  "Follow unswervingly the party's basic line for 100 years."    Huang Xinhua, deputy chief of the Shenzhen City CPC  Committee  propaganda department, said: Putting up a new propaganda board  does not imply that Deng will make another south China trip.  Deng is held in high esteem by the citizens in the Shenzhen  Special Economic Zone. He has been to Shenzhen twice, and this  reveals his deep concern about Shenzhen's economic development.  It is annual routine business of the city government to replace  the old picture with a new one, which carries special  implications.    A local resident, aged over 50, who was passing the picture  on a bike, said to this reporter: Deng Xiaoping's reform and  open policies enjoy popular support. It would certainly be a  good thing if he were to come to Shenzhen again. He, however,  felt the new picture was not as nice as the old one because in  the new picture Deng looks older. Another cadre who came to  Shenzhen from another province on business also said that the  "new quotation from Deng Xiaoping" is not as good as the old one.</p>

Addressing several thousand Zulus in Ulundi, he reiterated  he  could not recommend to his loyal subjects that they vote in the  April poll. "I call on all Zulus to unite in the name of the  kingdom of kwaZulu. I call on all Zulus to fulfil their sacred  duty to defend our freedom and sovereignty to anyone in southern  Africa who dares to challenge it."    He alleged State President F.W. de Klerk's "contingency  plans" for the Natal/kwaZulu region entailed the deployment of  security forces "to clamp down on my people should they choose  not to participate in the elections".    Elections under the interim constitution were "an immediate  denial of our claim for sovereignty and self-determination".    "I find it quite impossible to recommend that any of my  subjects who are loyal to the throne should participate in the  forthcoming election, unless this matter (a sovereign Zulu  kingdom) is settled."    The king said Zulus had gathered in Ulundi on Friday to  proclaim before the world their freedom and sovereignty, and  their unwavering will to defend these at all costs. He revealed  that recent discussions between himself and Mr de Klerk on the  Zulu king's claims had made little progress, adding the  government had denied sovereignty to the Zulu nation and would  not restore a sovereign kwaZulu kingdom.    "Under the terms of a final proposal of the South African  Government, the Zulu nation and the kingdom of kwaZulu are left  at the mercy of the unitary state established by the 1993  constitution. We have reached the end of a road and we are faced  with the harsh reality that the SA Government cannot and will  not facilitate the restoration of the sovereign kingdom of  kwaZulu."    Zulus were faced with an historical dilemma of either  succumbing and forever relinquishing their sovereignty or to  take it upon themselves "and bring into existence what is ours,  what belongs to our fathers and what belonged to our children".    The king alleged Mr de Klerk had threatened to deploy his  security forces if Zulus did not vote in the April poll. "I  protest for the betrayals that the Zulu nation have suffered  from President de Klerk again and again."</p>

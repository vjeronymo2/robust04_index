This notice solicits offers to participate in operational tests that concentrate on evaluating the benefits of the following ITS user service areas:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) International Border Electronic Clearance; (2) Automated Collision Notification; and (3) Intelligent Cruise Control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The intent of this notice is to assess, using the selection criteria set forth below, a proposed operational test's potential for contributing to the advancement of the national ITS program, the proposed technical and management approaches for the test, and the appropriateness of the proposed Federal role in the project. The selection criteria set forth in today's notice supersede the criteria presented in previous operational test notices. This notice has been developed by the FHWA in cooperation with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Operational test offers must be received on or before February 19, 1995.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Offers to participate in the ITS operational test program should be submitted directly to the Federal Highway Administration, Office of Traffic Management and ITS Applications, Operational Test Division, (HTV&hyph;20), 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, D.C. 20590.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  For FHWA: Mr. George Schoene, Office of Traffic Management and ITS Applications, Operational Test Division, HTV&hyph;20, (202) 366&hyph;6726; Mr. Steve Crane, Intelligent Transportation System/Commercial Vehicle Operations Team, HMT&hyph;10, (202) 366&hyph;0950; or Ms. Julie Dingle, FHWA Office of the Chief Counsel, HCC&hyph;32, (202) 366&hyph;0780.

These goals contribute significantly to the DOT's broader goal of developing a national intermodal transportation system for moving people and goods in a safe and energy-efficient manner. The ``Department of Transportation's Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems (IVHS) Strategic Plan'' (DOT Publication No. FHWA&hyph;SA&hyph;93&hyph;009) describes DOT's goals, objectives, and program delivery plans for research and development, operational testing, deployment, and long-term ITS development under the Automated Highway System program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Operational tests serve as the transition between research and development (R&amp;D) and full scale deployment of IS technologies. An operational test integrates existing technology, R&amp;D products, institutional, and perhaps regulatory arrangements to test one, and usually more, new technological, institutional, or financial elements in a real world test. The tests permit an evaluation of how well newly developed ITS technologies work under real operating conditions and assess the benefits and public support for the product or system. Operational tests are conducted in a ``real world'' operational highway environment under actual transportation conditions. This distinguishes operational tests from research projects or other kinds of testing, for example simulation testing, test tracks, or tests on facilities that are temporarily closed to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ITS operational tests are conducted as cooperative ventures between the DOT and a variety of public and private partners, including State and local governments, private companies, and universities. The ``Department of Transportation's IVHS Strategic Plan'' summarizes the roles of each participant in the National ITS Program and operational tests. The general Federal role is to act as a leader and a catalyst, and to ensure adequate emphasis on public benefits. The DOT also guides the design and conduct of the project evaluation to ensure that the project is independently evaluated on a national program scale. The participating DOT administrations, the FHWA, the NHTSA, the FTA, and the RSPA are involved in ITS and their specific ITS program needs will tailor the particular arrangements of the operational tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The DOT is also developing a National ITS Program Plan which will build on and expand the ``Department of Transportation's IVHS Strategic Plan,'' providing the detailed ``road map'' required to both plan and track progress toward deploying systems and technologies that support user services of the ITS program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Program Plan is being developed based on the following set of ITS User Services:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> 1.0&blank;Travel and Traffic Management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

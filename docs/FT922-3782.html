			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: US court rules against Kodak in service dispute THE US SUPREME Court has ruled against an appeal by Eastman Kodak, the US photographic products group, in a decision that raises key questions about a company's ability to control replacement parts and service on equipment it manufactures, AP-DJ reports from Washington. The justices, on a 6-3 vote, affirmed a federal appeals court ruling reinstating an anti-trust lawsuit filed against Kodak in 1987 by 18 independent companies that repair Kodak copiers and printers. They charged that Kodak had violated federal anti-trust law by refusing to sell replacement parts to owners of Kodak equipment unless they agreed not to do business with independent service companies. It was alleged that this illegally tied the sale of one product to a separate condition or service.</p>

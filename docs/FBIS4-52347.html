			<p>BFN     [Text] On 1 May, Former Deputy Prime Minister Michio  Watanabe of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] unveiled a plan  to promote "reforms tantamount to dissolving the party." He has  been strongly urging the need to regenerate the party. The plan  is composed of four pillars, including plans to fundamentally  review the party platform and actively promote young LDP  members. Watanabe plans to present his plan to LDP President  Yohei Kono following the Golden Week holiday.    When he decided to abandon his plans to run for the  premiership and to secede from the LDP, Watanabe met with Kono.  At the meeting, Watanabe stressed the need to reform the party,  saying: "We need reform that is equivalent to forming a new  party." He expressed a strong sense of crisis because the LDP,  while running the government for so many years, had  bureaucratized personnel matters as well as party organizations,  thus losing its vitality.    His plan calls for: 1) a drastic review of the party  platform  which dates from the Cold War era; 2) promoting young and  promising members; 3) streamlining LDP headquarters by  reorganizing party organs; and 4) activating local organizations  and strengthening cooperative ties between local organizations  and headquarters. In particular, he explains the "need to find  promising people" by abolishing the long-established seniority  system, under which cabinet posts were allocated to those who  had been elected to the Diet more than five or six times.  Moreover, he urges the need to reduce the number of people  working at headquarters, trim expenses, and review local and  other small organizations. He also urges the need to intensify  headquarters' daily activities.    At its general meeting held on 27 April, the Watanabe  faction  decided to map out concrete plans to reform the party. However,  the faction did that to flesh out "Watanabe's private proposal."  After the Watanabe faction completes its work and maps out  concrete plans, Watanabe intends to strongly urge Kono and the  LDP executive department to bring about reform.</p>

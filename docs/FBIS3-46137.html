			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 26 (XINHUA) -- The PEOPLE'S DAILY  [RENMIN RIBAO], in an editorial to be published tomorrow,  stresses the importance of speeding up infrastructure  construction according to China's capabilities.    While acknowledging that infrastructure construction is  booming all over the country, the editorial warns against the  tendency in some localities of paying no heed to objective  conditions, neglecting economic returns and blindly seeking big  projects and construction speed.    It criticizes some areas for failing to implement a national  unified construction plan, undertaking redundant projects and  over- extending the construction scale.    "These malpractices are detrimental to the healthy  cultivation of a socialist market economy, the rational  distribution of natural resources, the display of comprehensive  economic returns and the coordinated growth of China's economy  as a whole, and even have damaged national interests," the  editorial says.    The country's leading newspaper also stresses the impOrtance  of seeking truth from facts in doing everything. "In doing so,  we must do everything in our power, and more importantly act  according to our capabilities," it points out.    The undertaking of major infrastructure projects is crucial  to the overall distribution of the national economy and the  overall supply-demand balance of the macro-economy, it says.    That is why it is imperative to subject these projects to a  national unified construction plan, it adds.    In undertaking infrastructure projects, it is also necessary  to pay close attention both to social efficiency and economic  returns, the editorial says.    Everything possible must "e done to step up the construction  of those infrastructure facilities badly needed to spur China's  economic growth, it stresses.    However, it is also necessary to build such facilities in an  orderly and step-by-step way, it adds.    With a relatively low level of economic development, China  will face the problem of insufficient financial resources and  supply shortages of materials for a long time to come, it says.    "Therefore, we ought to concentrate on the construction of  top- priority infrastructure facilities, while doing our best to  prevent waste resulting from redundant and blind construction,"  it says.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sandor Papp, deputy chairman of Parliament's </F> Environmental Protection Committee, by Janos K. Braz; place and  date not given: ``Sandor Papp Views the State of Our  Environmental Protection'']    [Text]    Braz: Hungary is the waste pipe in the Carpathian  basin: Pollution and oil spills from the rivers of neighboring  countries are flowing into Hungary, while the wind is carrying  in acid rain. We asked Sandor Papp, deputy chairman of  Parliament's Environmental Protection Committee, to comment on  the consequences of all this on the state of Hungary's  environment.    Papp: From the state's viewpoint, the most  important issue is that more than 90 percent of surface waters  and rivers flow into Hungary from neighboring countries.  Therefore, we can also say that we are exposed to pollution  originating from neighboring countries. This draws attention to  a very important fact -- that the Carpathian basin is  ecologically a uniform region. Therefore, we can only protect  the environment if we develop adequate relations with  neighboring countries to prevent damages.    Braz: What are these relations like at the moment?  Are they insufficient, sufficient, or do they need improvement?    Papp: These relations cannot be described in one  word. For example, our relations with Austria are good. We  have certain problems with Slovakia, Ukraine, and Romania. For  example, oil spills often flow into the Koros River from  Romania, and we cannot pinpoint the origin of these spills.  Another frequent case is when Hungarian experts try, and fail,  to contact Romanian experts and, in such cases, irrespective of  the size of the pollution, the issue automatically turns into a  political issue because it is impossible to treat the subject  differently.    Braz: How does the environmental state of  individual countries affect Hungary's current economic and  market restructuring? How does the appearance of foreign  capital affect environmental protection?    Papp: An environmental debt and damage has  accumulated in Hungary in the past two or three decades, and the  size of this debt is approximately equivalent to Hungary's  foreign debt -- namely $20-22 billion. This amount derives from  the following calculation: Economic activity causes an  environmental burden equivalent to 4-6 percent of the gross  national product [GNP] annually, and we use 1 percent of the GNP  for cleaning up the damage. It is obvious that one cannot  eliminate this environmental damage overnight, even with the  best law. We need a proper environmental law, but this is not a  sufficient condition for mending our environment. This issue  obviously affects the flow of foreign capital. However, foreign  investors are primarily disturbed by the uncertain, unregulated,  and unpredictable economic situation rather than by the  well-defined tasks and environmental protection regulations. We  know that the auditing of environmental tasks is also carried  out in the process of privatization. Thus, it is possible to  deduct the sums allocated to the elimination of environmental  damages from the purchasing prices. One of the most negative  examples is the Lehel Refrigeration company of Jaszbereny where  the new owners discovered environmental damages on the premises  after the purchase, and the elimination of these damages would  have cost the equivalent of the factory's entire purchasing  price. I would like to stress that foreign enterprises are most  worried about the unregulated and unforeseeable economic  situation rather than about the state of the environment.</p>

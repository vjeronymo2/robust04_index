			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREEDERS' CUP;  </P> <P> IF UNDEFEATED MEADOW STAR FINISHES FIRST AGAIN, CHARITY IS BIG WINNER  </P> <P> If Meadow Star, the undefeated 2-year-old filly, wins her Breeders' Cup race at  Belmont Park Saturday, the monetary winners as usual would be her jockey, her  trainer and the bettors who supported her.  </P> <P> But the biggest winner of all would be the Children's Rescue Fund, which  provides assistance for abused and homeless children. Carl Icahn already is a  winner, just for a promise.  </P> <P> Icahn, the TWA chairman, owns Meadow Star, and a week ago he announced that his  share of all the filly's future earnings will be donated to the fund. This  could be a substantial windfall for the charity that Icahn founded, since the  winner's cut of the $1-million Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies is $450,000,  minus 10% apiece for the trainer and the jockey.  </P> <P> There have been previous instances of horse owners donating money to charities,  but veteran racing officials cannot recall a proposition as potentially  beneficial as Icahn's. Meadow Star has won six consecutive races, all of them  by comfortable margins, and at 3-5 on the morning line she is the heaviest  favorite for the seven Breeders' Cup races.  </P> <P> A victory Saturday would also make Meadow Star one of the favorites for next  year's Kentucky Derby, and although only three fillies have won that race, one  of them -- Genuine Risk -- was trained by Le Roy Jolley, and he says he plans  to nominate Icahn's horse for the 1991 Triple Crown races.  </P> <P> "I was down at Laurel (in Maryland) for some races last weekend," Jolley said.  "And the reaction to Mr. Icahn's offer of the Meadow Star purses struck a very  warm chord among racing people and fans there. Many people I had never met came  up to me and wished me luck. It was a unique experience."  </P> <P> Icahn, 54, grew up in New York, in the borough of Queens. The son of a lawyer  and a schoolteacher, he was not underprivileged. After graduating from  Princeton, he dropped out of medical school because he was more interested in  corporate affairs. His philanthropic interests are widespread: He belongs to  hospital and library boards, does work for the blind and founded a program for  the prevention of child abuse at New York Hospital. The Children's Rescue Fund  builds houses, provides social service programs and helps mothers with drug  problems.  </P> <P> "You can see some strange things happening if you take a look around," Icahn  said. "You can see kids hungry and struggling at one end of the street, and  then at the other end you can see people doing well and throwing parties. This  program (the children's fund) is designed for the end of the street that's  doing poorly."  </P> <P> Icahn came into racing in 1985, immediately spending millions of dollars on  broodmares, and he boards more than 40 mares at two farms in Central Kentucky.  He was a partner with Peter Brant in the ownership of Gulch, who won the  Breeders' Cup Sprint in 1988, and last year, Icahn's Rose's Cantina was fourth  in the Distaff.  </P> <P> Brant, who this year received a three-month prison sentence over tax  irregularities, took his horses away from Jolley in 1988 and sent them to Wayne  Lukas, who saddled Gulch for his winning Breeders' Cup race. Icahn, however,  didn't sever his racing relationship with Jolley, and after Meadow Star, a  daughter of Meadowlake and Inreality Star, was bought for $90,000 at a yearling  auction, she was sent to the trainer who won the Kentucky Derby with Foolish  Pleasure in 1975 and Genuine Risk in 1980.  </P> <P> Meadow Star made her debut at Belmont in June, winning by more than five  lengths in a five-furlong clocking of :58 4/5. Since then, she has five stakes  victories, the most recent on Oct. 6 at Belmont, where she ran as far as a mile  for the first time and won the Frizette by 14 lengths. The Breeders' Cup race  is only one-sixteenth of a mile farther.  </P> <P> "The way she's running, next year she will beat the colts," said Jose Santos,  who rides Meadow Star.  </P> <P> Champagne Glow was second in the Frizette and is running in the Breeders' Cup,  but her trainer, Joe Pierce, has no delusions. "Our filly is a nice filly," he  said after the Frizette, "but we'll be running for second in the Breeders'  Cup."  </P> <P> In comparing Meadow Star with Genuine Risk, Jolley suggests that there's no  comparison. "This filly (Meadow Star) is stronger physically and more durable,"  Jolley said. "Genuine Risk was more delicate, and she gave so much of herself  every race that you had to be protective of her. Meadow Star has a great  mentality, a great positive attitude. I think she would run the same no matter  who she ran against."  </P> <P> If Go for Wand beats Bayakoa in Saturday's Breeders' Cup Distaff, she would  probably thrust herself into a two-way battle with Criminal Type for  horse-of-the-year honors. Criminal Type's season, and probably his career, is  over because of an ankle injury.  </P> <P> However, if Go for Wand doesn't win, and Meadow Star does, Jolley's filly would  also become a horse-of-the-year candidate. When Secretariat was a 2-year-old in  1972, he was voted horse of the year, but it's been much longer since a  2-year-old filly took the national championship. Moccasin, the only one, shared  the award with Roman Brother in 1965.  </P> <P> Icahn's charity cannot benefit from the voting, since the horse-of-the-year  title is not a monetary award.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Besides donating Meadow Star's purse money, Carl Icahn said he will also match  any contributions that are made to the Children's Rescue Fund in the filly's  name. . . . Rambling Willie, the pacer in retirement at the Kentucky Horse Park  in Lexington, Ky., earned $2 million, and his ownership contributed 10% of the  purses to a church in West Mansfield, Ohio.  </P> <P> Trainer Le Roy Jolley has won with one of 12 Breeders' Cup starters, Manila  taking the Turf in 1986. Jose Santos rode Manila. Gulch was sixth and seventh  under Jolley in the Breeders' Cup before he won the Sprint for Wayne Lukas. . .  . Don LaPlace, the Belmont Park handicapper who made the morning lines for the  Breeders' Cup, said he never had a stakes favorite as high as 4-1 until he hung  that price on Dispersal in the $3-million Classic.  </P> <P> Jockey Craig Perret, who won the Juvenile last year with Rhythm, said the same  colt, who is running in the Classic, gives him the best chance Saturday for  another Breeders' Cup victory.  </P></p>

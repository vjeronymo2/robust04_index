			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 23 Jun (EFE) -- Cuban State security has  summoned several human rights activists for questioning on their  alleged cooperation with those individuals inside the residence  of the Belgian ambassador in Havana, a dissident source said  today.    Among those summoned to "Villa Maristas," which is the  general headquarters of Cuban State security in Havana, are  Elizardo Sanchez and Vladimiro Roca, both members of the  "Democratic Socialist Current," and Jesus Yanes Pelletier of the  "Cuban Human Rights Committee."    The dissident source explained they had been summoned by  authorities for questioning on their alleged connection with the  Cubans occupying the Belgian diplomatic mission. The source,  however, affirmed they do not know those who are inside the  Belgian diplomatic mission, adding that they could be  independent human rights activists.</p>

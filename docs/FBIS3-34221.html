He said  that President Zeroual gained the support of those attending the  dialogue and of various political forces in the country,  including those who did not participate in the dialogue.    In a statement to the MENA correspondent in Algeria, Khatib  said: The political parties that withdrew from the dialogue were  seeking to frustrate it. We know what their objectives were.    He noted that a draft document on organizing the  transitional  period was presented for discussion during the dialogue and that  all the participating parties and organizations approved it.    On the reason for amending the draft document's article on  appointing the president, Khatib said: The draft stipulated  that the president be chosen by the dialogue and the dialogue  committee. In view of the withdrawal of the main parties from  the dialogue, it was decided to go back to the Constitution,  which gives the Higher Security Council the right to appoint the  president. This article was amended in accordance with the  Constitution.    Commenting on Bouteflika's nomination for the presidency and  then his withdrawal, Khatib said: Bouteflika agreed at first to  become president and was given all the authority he asked for.  But some parties and political forces objected to him,  following the leak of his nomination to the press, because he  does not stand for breaking with the past, which everyone was  looking for.    He stressed that the parties and the people expressed full  satisfaction with President Zeroual when it was publicly  announced that he would be president because of his  qualifications to lead the state.    On the contacts with the "banned" Islamic Salvation Front,  Khatib said that these contacts are continuing and have achieved  encouraging and fruitful results. He expressed his hope that  during the next stage there will be positive steps to stop the  wave of violence in the country.</p>

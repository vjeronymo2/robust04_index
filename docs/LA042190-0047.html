			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE SHOW OFFERS AN A-PEELING SLICE OF CALIFORNIA LORE;  </P> <P> AGRICULTURE: IN ITS 75TH YEAR, THE SAN BERNARDINO EVENT WILL FEATURE EXHIBITS,  ENTERTAINMENT.  </P> <P> Ask most Californians what happened in the 1840s, and they'll tell you that's  when gold was discovered. But another kind of gold also came to the state  during that busy decade: Growers produced the first commercial orange crop.  </P> <P> Oranges are the main attraction at the 75th Diamond Jubilee of the National  Orange Show, which continues through April 29 at the National Orange Show  Fairgrounds in San Bernardino.  </P> <P> "This is the 75th year of the show (there was a hiatus during World War II),  and we plan to always honor oranges," said C. Roger Cooper, president of the  nonprofit show's board of directors.  </P> <P> The earliest groves of oranges were planted near Union Station in downtown Los  Angeles, which made shipping easier. By the 1850s, oranges grown in Southern  California were being sent by wagon to Los Angeles Harbor, by boat from there  to San Francisco and then by wagon again to gold mining towns near Sacramento.  Lemons, highly prized because they stayed fresh longer, sold for as much as $1  apiece.  </P> <P> In 1877, a load of Valencia oranges grown in the Southland was shipped east for  the first time, arriving in St. Louis two months after it left.  </P> <P> But it was the introduction of navel oranges in the early 1880s that cemented  the fruit's position as a key agricultural crop. Two parent trees of Washington  Navels -- called that because they cleared customs in the nation's capital  after being shipped from Brazil -- were sent to Luther and Eliza Tibbets,  growers in Riverside.  </P> <P> One of the trees died shortly after its arrival; the other is still thriving.  (If you'd like to see this historic orange tree, stop at the intersection of  Magnolia and Arlington avenues the next time you're in Riverside. It was  transplanted to this site in 1902.)  </P> <P> Navels had the distinct advantage of producing a crop virtually the entire  year, and they were neater to eat than juicy Valencias because the thick skin  was easier to peel. (Navels are so named because of the depression at the  orange's end, which contains a small, undeveloped secondary fruit.)  </P> <P> By 1911, oranges were such a popular crop that promoters in San Bernardino  County were advertising 50 acres, already planted with trees, for $5,000. Many  of the people who optimistically bought these little orchards were out of  business within a year, but many hung on. Agricultural production in Southern  California peaked in the 1940s.  </P> <P> Then a more alluring gold -- skyrocketing real estate prices -- slowly began to  turn the thousands of acres of orange groves into housing developments.  </P> <P> The decline in the number of groves was hastened as neighboring residents  started complaining about "smudge-pot smog" -- the gritty black smoke from  diesel-powered pots used to prevent fruit from freezing. And although the  oranges were there first, many localities decided to ban oil heaters in the  orchards.  </P> <P> A great many of Southern California's best-known institutions are built on what  used to be orange groves, including Disneyland and Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> Although the crop has dwindled in this part of the state, interest in it and  its lore has not. The National Orange Show, which opened Thursday, was started  in 1911, and Cooper said the organization plans to open a packing house museum  within a year.  </P> <P> The orange show is open from 3 to 10 p.m. on weekdays and from 10 a.m. to 10  p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. It features exhibits on the history of oranges,  in addition to handmade quilts, baked goods, flower arrangements and livestock  displays. Entertainers ranging from Glen Campbell and Donny Osmond to Frankie  Avalon and Annette Funicello will be featured.  </P> <P> The National Orange Show, through April 29, 3 to 10 p.m. weekdays, 10 a.m. to  10 p.m. weekends, 689 E St., San Bernardino (near the intersection of  Interstates 215 and 10). For information, call (714) 383-5444. Admission to the  show is $5 for adults, $3 for children 6 to 12, and free for children 5 and  under.  </P></p>

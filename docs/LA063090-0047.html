			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANDELA'S VISIT TO L.A.;  </P> <P> YOUNGSTERS FIND RARE CHANCE TO SEE A REAL HERO;  </P> <P> MANDELA: STUDENTS FIND SEVERAL WAYS TO SHARE IN ANTI-APARTHEID LEADER'S STAY IN  L.A. TO SOME, HE'S A KING; TO OTHERS, A HOPE FOR A BETTER FUTURE.  </P> <P> For many of the children of Los Angeles, these are times of guns in the  classroom, of gangs, drugs and disillusionment. A time of too few heroes. That  was why Harold Love was so excited Friday after seeing Nelson Mandela at City  Hall.  </P> <P> "You sort of felt like you were in medieval times, seeing a king," said Love,  who at 15 was born too late to know Martin Luther King Jr., and other civil  rights giants as anything other than history book figures. "In a way, he is: A  king for his people."  </P> <P> While Mandela came to Los Angeles principally to meet with its movers and  shakers, moguls and movie stars, there were many in his audience who believed  his most important accomplishment was simply to stand before the city's  troubled youngsters as a real-life hero.  </P> <P> Specific visits with youngsters were not on Mandela's Los Angeles schedule, but  plans had been made to ensure they had opportunities to hear his message.  Community groups ferried gang members by bus to his speech at the L.A.  Coliseum. Schoolteachers took their young charges to City Hall. And students  organized a march on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to welcome Mandela.  </P> <P> "I want to learn, is he true?" said 14-year-old Donte, who lives in a Crenshaw  District home for minors on probation. "Can he help me? Can I look up to him?"  </P> <P> Friday afternoon, hundreds of students from throughout Southern California  could be seen walking to the Coliseum from Rancho Cienega Park in Southwest Los  Angeles carrying banners and chanting slogans to the beat of an African drum  troop.  </P> <P> "He has the strongest soul of any world leader," said Jacob Pinger, 19, a  member of the Los Angeles Student Coalition, which organized the nearly  four-mile youth march along with black, Asian and Latino student organizations  throughout Los Angeles. "Kids are sick of seeing people elected and then  selling out as as soon as (the) people forget their promises.  </P> <P> "Mandela," he said, "is a leader that doesn't sell out."  </P> <P> Motorists honked horns and saluted the marchers with upraised fists as they  moved slowly through the Crenshaw District.  </P> <P> Throughout South Los Angeles and other parts of the city, parents and teachers  had spent the last few weeks teaching their children about Mandela, to make  sure his message of hope and dignity was not lost.  </P> <P> At Marcus Garvey School, where black history is as much an educational staple  as reading and arithmetic, a little girl with auburn-colored corn rows had said  earlier in the week that she hoped Mandela would bring her a miracle.  </P> <P> "I want Mandela to tell us people shouldn't be in gangs," said 11-year-old  Amber Mason, "that they are killing up their own people. I hope Mandela would  change (it), that he'll make a difference."  </P> <P> Mandela holds a special significance for many black children, who grew up on  stories of Selma and Montgomery, bus boycotts and freedom marches, but who were  born too late to experience them.  </P> <P> "Most of them weren't around when King was living, so (they) don't understand  the significance of King and Malcolm X," said Louis Sheppard, a co-founder of a  manhood training program for young black men, who brought 42 students to see  Mandela speak at City Hall.  </P> <P> "I believe by hearing Mandela they'll get a more international perspective and  realize that African-Americans are not an isolated people. They're getting to  see the problems affecting Africans all over the world."  </P> <P> Sheppard, a history teacher at Palomar Junior High in Pomona, added: "By being  here, they'll see the closest thing they're ever going to see to Martin Luther  King Jr. Twenty years from now, when their kids are talking about Mandela,  they'll be able to say, 'Oh yeah, I remember when.' And it'll make a  difference."  </P> <P> But Mandela's message can transcend color. Young Mi Suh, a 19-year-old  Korean-American, said that Mandela is also her hero. Like King, she said, his  fight is for all victims of racism. "And that includes me. That includes the  color yellow."  </P> <P> She has read much about battles against oppression; of the civil rights  movement in America and of her own parents' struggles against the Japanese  occupation of their homeland. But history, she said, means little until you  feel it for yourself.  </P> <P> "All the great things you hear (about) you have to make personal before it  means something to you," said Suh.  </P> <P> Not all youngsters were as convinced. Some said bluntly that they saw no  connection between South-Central and South Africa. They felt they would find  little inspiration in the words of an elderly man who lived half a world away.  </P> <P> A few did not even know who Mandela was.  </P> <P> "I thought he was a rapper," admitted Marcus, a former gang member, who first  heard Mandela's name on a rap-oriented radio station last week. "They were  saying 'Nelson Mandela will visit' and I said, 'Who is this guy? He must be  somebody.' "  </P> <P> Marcus, a short, stocky 16-year-old, was one of six teen-agers in a Crenshaw  District group home being taken to hear Mandela's speech at the Coliseum.  Officials did not want to his last name published because he is on probation.  </P> <P> Marcus said he didn't believe in heroes. Marcus said he believed a long time  ago, when he thought supermen could leap buildings in a single bound. But they  couldn't help him get a job, or give him an alternative to gang life. So he  dropped them.  </P> <P> "Now," he said, "I'm my own hero."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Darrell Dawsey contributed to this report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RELATED STORIES, PICTURES: B3,B4  </P></p>

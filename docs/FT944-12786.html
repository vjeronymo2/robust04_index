			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Observer in Lebanon: Woad to success 'When my ancestors were painting themselves in woad and hitting each other with clubs, the dawn of civilisation was taking place here.' So said Lord Alexander Hesketh, 43, at Beirut's Coral Beach hotel, introducing the inaugural flight of British Mediterranean Airways from London's Heathrow to the Lebanese capital. Chairman of BMA, Hesketh took with him an assorted bunch of hacks - Observer included - and friends, checking out the company's leased Airbus A320 (worth Dollars 45m) and Beirut's potential. Hesketh is shy about BMA's shareholders; it's a private company. He says 62 per cent is British, the remainder held by backers including Italians and Argentines. Hesketh, who also sits on the board of Babcock  - next to Lord King, former chairman of British Airways - says BMA is no gamble, though he adds: 'Romanticism has always been a weakness of mine.' British Airways has just decided it too will start flying London-Beirut. 'They will try to kill us. We shall have to resist,' concludes Hesketh.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Zorkin: "Concerning the Accord </F> Agreement. Valeriy Zorkin: `The Most Important Question Is the  Effectiveness of the Authorities Themselves'"]    [Excerpts] The publication in recent days of various texts  designed to raise to a formal level the idea of national accord  which is now prevalent in society is in danger of turning into a  regular race around Sadovoye Koltso for the National  Reconciliation Prize. This idea, which has enormous  constructive potential, is for some reason being deliberately  steered away from broad public discussion, and because of the  vagueness, formalism, and incomprehensibility -- to ordinary  people -- of the proposed "memorandums," it is becoming the  subject of haggling among just a small group of politicians.  [passage omitted]    If this or that draft agreement is not to become just  another  ideological one-day wonder, the following must be borne in mind.  A national accord is a kind of social contract, a public  agreement on certain principles or measures capable of pulling  the country back from the brink of the abyss. It is not a deal  made by the political elite behind the people's back, but a  compromise among the main political forces expressing the  people's own vital interests. And it should not be an agreement  between robber and robbed, but a broad public understanding that  without the immediate implementation of concrete priority  measures the country cannot be prevented from drifting into  national disaster. And the role of the authorities in this  compromise is a distinct and, I would say, subordinate role.    The authorities do not impose their own terms from above, by  means of a decree, on the basis of their own selfish, narrow  party interests; they face the people with an admission of their  mistake in leading society into an impasse, at the same time  proposing a carefully thought-out change of political course in  order to implement priority anticrisis actions. If the  authorities are not prerpared to take this fundamentally  important step, any agreement naturally becomes, for them, a  "mandate" to further plunder and ruin the country.    To avoid the abyss, harsh measures are needed, but measures  based on strict compliance with the law and on society's  consent. This latter is no less important in that without that  consent any strong-arm solutions, including a state of  emergency, will be futile and ineffective in a huge country like  Russia.    The most important question now is the effectiveness of the  authorities themselves; without this, it is impossible to  restore order in the country. The first steps toward an  agreement on national reconciliation and society's consent for  these authorities specifically to implement anticrisis measures  should be rigorous discipline in the state apparatus and a curb  on corruption and arbitrary bureaucratic rule.    The second key question on which an accord has already  developed in society is that of halting the wave of crime  involving "shoot-outs" among mafiosi groups in public places,  causing mass casualties among innocent people, even children.  Society itself is prepared for a redistribution of the meager  resources available in the country in order to create a  protective environment and curb the rampant crime which is  encouraged by the chaos that prevails in the power structures.  But in that case, one wonders, what use are ineffective  authorities to a society that is forced to act on its own  account?    The third key question should be that of an accord on urgent  economic measures. It is necessary to prevent the economic  bankruptcy of the state, with all the ensuing economic and  social problems (such as the nonpayments crisis, the shutdown of  industry, the lack of resources for agricultural operations or  for wages). A fourth problem on which a national accord has  already formed is that of resolute actions to restore the  destroyed links between the former Union republics, as well as  translating to a practical plane the work of recreating a new  union statehood on a strictly voluntary basis. Especially since  initiatives in this direction come not only from Moscow, but  also from Alma-Ata [Almaty], Minsk, and the capitals of other  former republics.    Naturally one can speak of the existence of a social  consensus on questions of preventing the destruction of Russia's  intellectual potential, support for enterprise geared to the  national interest, etc. Concrete proposals have been in  existence on all these matters for a long time. All that is  needed is the desire on the part of the authorities and the  existence of the will, the capacity to fulfill them.    All in all, accord is possible only on the basis of a change  in the catastrophic course imposed by the radical "democrats."</p>

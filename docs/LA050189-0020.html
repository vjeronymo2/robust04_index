			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TABLE TOP FUSION  </P> <P> Lee Dye's article "Fusion Claims Are at Odds With Basic Laws of Physics" (Part  I, April 12) fails to point out that the history of physics (and mathematics)  is marked by a recurring pattern of formulation of "good laws"; discovery of  "something wrong" in seeming violation of the "good laws," then enlargement of  the "good laws" to include the "old laws" as a special case, and handily  including the new phenomenon.  </P> <P> According to this time-honored pattern, physicist Charles Barnes should now  have a first opportunity to look for ways of enlarging the basic laws of  physics; a sure way to a Nobel Prize and perhaps even Hollywood fame.  </P> <P> When all is said and done, physics will be richer for this "illegal" phenomena.  </P> <P> RAMON MIRELES  </P> <P> Downey  </P></p>

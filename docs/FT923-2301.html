			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): TV chip adjusts the fine tuning A French-Japanese collaboration has produced a semiconductor chip that promises to bring down the cost of manufacturing a television substantially, writes Steven Butler. Sanyo Electric and Thomson Consumer Electronics have started producing a chip that in just a few seconds adjusts 46 different parameters - including colour, luminance, and horizontal and vertical synchronization - to produce a perfectly clear, balanced picture. Until now, the parameters had to be adjusted separately, some by machine, some directly by line workers. The cross-border collaboration fits a pattern that could be more common in the years ahead. Although Japanese companies bring considerable experience in semiconductor technology, western companies like Thomson still have the edge on digital processing. Digital processing is critical to the operation of the chip, and will be important for the next generation of electronics products.</p>

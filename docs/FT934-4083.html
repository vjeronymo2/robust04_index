			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / People: A proponent of brown coal These are tough times for Manfred Stolpe, prime minister of Brandenburg, which has the only social democratic-led government in eastern Germany, writes Judy Dempsey. As an easterner and former head of the Evangelical Church in east Berlin and Brandenburg, Stolpe has been hounded for his alleged connections with the Stasi. As a politician, he must answer for the state's level of unemployment which officially exceeds 17 per cent. Brandenburgers yesterday voted in the state's first local government elections since unification, but Stolpe, born in 1936 in Szczecin, then in Germany but now in Poland, is determined to set his sights on next year's state and federal elections. Success in two key sectors of Brandenburg's economy - brown coal and steel - could ensure him another term. The going will be tough. The economic viability of the giant Laubag mines, which the Treuhand privatisation agency is selling, depends on producing 55m tonnes a year. That would secure 12,000 jobs, a fifth of pre-unification times. The problem Stolpe faces is a growing rebellion from the cities which want to switch away from lignite to clean gas. 'I am convinced we can make brown coal competitive. The fact that Britain's PowerGen and the Americans are buying Mibrag (lignites fields in Saxony-Anhalt) is a signal that brown coal has a future, and a clean one at that,' he says. Keeping afloat Ekostahl, one of the region's largest steel plants, will not be easy. The Treuhand is negotiating its sale to Riva, the Italian steel manufacturer. But the European Union is questioning the level of subsidies involved in turning the plant into a mini-mill. 'We hope the EU will support us,' says Stolpe. 'The subsidies will not be needed indefinitely. There are markets in eastern Europe, Ukraine and Russia for Ekostahl's products.' If Stolpe could secure a future for Brandenburg's brown coal and steel, the burghers might secure him a political future too. If so, it would prove that an Ossi, or easterner, can ride the storm.</p>

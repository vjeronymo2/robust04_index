			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> NO CHARGES WILL BE FILED IN INGLEWOOD HIGH SCUFFLE  </P> <P> Rather than press criminal charges against the principal of Inglewood High  School for a scuffle with the school's basketball coach last month, City Atty.  Howard Rosten has called on the school district to discipline Principal  Lawrence Freeman.  </P> <P> Rosten said in a three-page report released Monday that he reserves the right  to prosecute Freeman for his "unprofessional, undignified and reprehensible"  conduct if "justice is not achieved" through the school system within the  one-year statute of limitations.  </P> <P> While he suggested that the school district could best resolve the situation,  Rosten in an interview declined to recommend any specific disciplinary action.  "Justice is one of those floating terms, but you know it when you see it," he  said. "If they don't do anything at all -- pretend it's not an important event  -- then I would say that's no justice."  </P> <P> The conflict occurred June 6 when Freeman, known for his brash leadership  style, reprimanded Coach Vincent Coombs in the principal's office for not  following an order to purchase trophies for members of the basketball team.  After Freeman ordered Coombs out of his office, the coach stood in the doorway  as Freeman repeatedly pushed the door against him, according to witnesses.  </P> <P> Supt. George McKenna ordered Freeman off campus a few hours after the incident  and reinstated him several days later when the two men met and Freeman agreed  to return to work. The incident marked the second clash between Freeman and  McKenna in the school year that ended in June.  </P> <P> Freeman's supporters, who credit him with keeping the high school free from  gang activity and for establishing high expectations for students, argue that  McKenna is attempting to purge the 67-year-old principal from the district.  McKenna, who became superintendent in September, 1988, has denied that he is  out to get Freeman.  </P> <P> While Rosten's report criticized Coombs for lacking judgment when he did not  leave Freeman's office after repeated demands by the principal, it focused  blame on Freeman.  </P> <P> "The conduct of the coach was not criminal," Rosten wrote. "Technically the  conduct of the principal probably was."  </P> <P> Rosten said a trial of Freeman for criminal battery could go either way. But he  pointed out that such a case would include "the undesirable spectacle of high  school students testifying in the trial of their principal." Several high  school students were among those who witnessed the confrontation, Rosten said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Criminal Intent  </P> <P> Rosten also said the school disciplinary process could "more fully and  completely" address the incident, by assessing both men's work records and  Coomb's refusal to reward his players or leave the principal's office.  </P> <P> Rosten said he found that Freeman did not have a criminal intent during the  incident, but was acting in a way he thought to be within the limits of his  job.  </P> <P> "There are no allegations of fact which indicate that the alleged crime was  committed for personal gain, or for any of the classically 'criminal' reasons  ordinarily condemned by society through the criminal law," Rosten wrote. "It  appears that the events alleged occurred exclusively within the context of  'school activities' and, whether in good judgment or not, were intended to be  part of the discharge of the perceived duties of the principal."  </P> <P> McKenna said his investigation into the incident is winding down and his  recommendation to the school board will be made in about a week. The maximum  sanctions could be suspension or demotion, McKenna said, declining to indicate  whether Freeman actually faces such sanctions.  </P> <P> If the board approves McKenna's recommendation, Freeman could ask the board to  reconsider and if it does not, would have the opportunity to appeal the  decision to the state Commission on Teacher Credentialing. A decision by the  state panel could take six months, McKenna said.  </P> <P> Freeman said in an interview this week that he wants to put the incident behind  him and get on with running the high school. He said he plans to meet with  McKenna and Coombs. They could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to dwell on it," Freeman said. "I'm just going to wait and see."  </P></p>

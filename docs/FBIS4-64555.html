			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on French Foreign Minister Alain </F> Juppe's speech in Brussels on 2 May: "Alain Juppe for Enlarged  Europe of More Than 20 States"]    [Text] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe called on the  European Union (EU) on Monday [2 May] to adopt a "clear and  ambitious position" with respect to the countries of Central and  East Europe and the Mediterranean countries which are knocking  with increasing insistence at its door, by setting a date for  the start of membership negotiations and by drawing up a list of  countries seeking talks.    "We cannot be satisfied with delaying or vague replies,"  Juppe stressed in a speech in Brussels on Monday evening to the  Royal Institute of International Relations. The foreign  minister referred to the EU responsibilities to these countries  at a time when the "order of Yalta" as decried so much by France  and Europe has collapsed.    "We welcomed the fall of the Berlin Wall as a first step  toward a larger Europe (...). It is time to give concrete  effect to this statement, by setting a date for the start of  membership negotiations," he added.  <H5>  Flexible Transitions </H5>   The French foreign minister also recommended a body of  "pragmatic measures" designed to facilitate this process. Among  other things, he believes this should include a list of  countries interested in future negotiations and a certain  "flexibility" when examining membership procedures. He proposed  an association of future member states in the area of common  foreign and security policy prior to EU full membership,  together with "transitional arrangements" allowing candidates to  adapt their economy to common EU policies.    However, France sees the institutional reforms for a Europe  enlarged from 20 to 25 member states as a precondition for such  moves.    "Everyone agrees that the present institutional framework,  which is already ill-suited to a Europe of 16, will bring  problems which will be difficult to overcome in a Union of 20 or  25 members," Juppe stressed. The French minister gave the  example of a parliament which would include 716 members, a  Commission of 24 members, a presidency once every 10 years for  each member state, and a Council of Ministers paralyzed by  sessions taking four hours just for every participant to speak.    Even if "the search for unanimously acceptable solutions  proves difficult," France "will be the determined adversary of a  status quo which we would see as tantamount to paralysis or  dilution," he added, calling upon the Twelve to already start  the process of reflection with a view to the 1996  intergovernmental conference.  <H5>  The Principle of Subsidiarity </H5>   During his talk, Alain Juppe also stressed respect for  national identities: While accepting the transference of major  powers to the EU, he stressed the essential value of the  principle of subsidiarity in his eyes. "Europe must only  substitute for or complement the member states where its action  is strictly necessary: The crisis of confidence (...) is no  doubt partly due to our lack of understanding of this principle  of reality." France will therefore be very attentive to this  point.</p>

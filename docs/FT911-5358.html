			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Greece to scrap curbs on long-term capital outflow GREECE is to lift curbs on long-term capital outflow next month, allowing Greeks to invest in property and securities abroad, Kerin Hope reports from Athens. Mr Dimitris Chalikias, Bank of Greece governor, said the new rules take effect in May. Greece was granted two extensions for complying with an EC directive on freeing outward capital movement on the grounds of its worsening current account deficit, totalling over 5 per cent of GDP last year. But under an EC emergency loan, no further delays can be allowed. Mr Chalikias dismissed fears that the current account deficit will be fuelled by huge capital flight. Capital transfers abroad could be handled by commercial banks without central bank approval. Curbs on foreign exchange allowances will be eased; the Dollars 300-a-year ceiling on credit card purchases made abroad will be scrapped.</p>

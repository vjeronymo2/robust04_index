The Paris meeting of the donors group, chaired by the World Bank, commended Indonesia for doubling its non-oil exports over the past 4-5 years to Dollars 27bn (Pounds 17.5bn) in 1993-94. The World Bank said issues of human rights and of East Timor, which Indonesia seized from Portugal 20 years ago, were not raised during the meeting.</p>

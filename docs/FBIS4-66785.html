			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikhil Chakarvarty: "America's Intentions in </F> South Asia"]    [Text] The United States of America has a large battalion  of thinkers that has access to an extensive pool of information.  It is believed that this large battalion of thinkers help form  public opinion and government policies. However, what do we  learn when the question of actual implementation of these ideas  arises? We learn that the Clinton administration, despite the  presence of this large think tank, is showing a surprising lack  of maturity in its policies dealing with the world. It rarely  got any praise for its action in Somalia and its reputation was  not enhanced in Bosnia. Improper action in North Korea also  deprived it from any possible glory. As for its policy on China,  it has not demonstrated any tendency towards an encouraging or  authentic policy. Similarly, the Clinton administration has not  earned any respect in dealing with Japan over their ugly and  improper trade war. The fall of Mr. Hosokawa's from his position  as prime minister has not helped Mr. Clinton's policy on Japan,  that is if a policy does exist.    Against this dubious background, Deputy Secretary Strobe  Talbott's recent visit to India and Pakistan was a simple  exercise and did not hint about any new outlook on South Asia.  Even if we grant that he was more careful and conventional  compared to his emotional assistant, his trip has not show any  new direction. We can say that Strobe Talbott came here and saw  everything, however, unlike Julius Caesar, he did not conquer.    In New Delhi, putting a brave front, he tried to assure us  that "Washington wants to improve relations with India for  better relations, and wants to do the same with Pakistan." In  other words, New Delhi should not worry about what Washington is  doing with Islamabad. It also means that India has nothing to do  with or worry about what the United States is giving or not  giving to Pakistan. Similarly, Pakistan should also consider any  agreement or dealings between India and the United States as  unimportant. This issue should be considered a bilateral issue  by both countries. This argument appears to be good on paper,  however, in reality it is oversimplification of the issue. When  the United States and Pakistan signed an agreement in the 50s,  Jawaharlal Nehru had opposed it and told President Eisenhower  that the dangers of Cold War were being brought to this region  by this treaty. The U.S. argument was that this would help  Pakistan fight the communist power. The hint was that Pakistan  had to deal with the Soviet Union, and not with its neighbor  India. Krishna Menon had expressed his memorable reaction to  this U.S. action. He had said that he had never faced a gun that  can be fired only in one direction. He had also said that supply  of arms to Pakistan was a cause of concern for India. The fact  is that even after the end of the Cold War, Pakistan's strategic  importance to the Pentagon's future plan has not diminished in  the context of Central Asia and the Persian Gulf. The United  States needs a place to set its foot in the vast area between  Xinkiang and Iran. It needs a credible reason also, which only  Pakistan can provide. Washington also believes that only the  military can provide both stability and reliability in Pakistan.  The latest offer to modernize its Air Force and provide it F-16s  and other military equipment help meet this dual goal. United  States' most trusted and stable group in Pakistan can be kept  happy and a very important watchtower to protect the U.S.  interests in this crucial region will be strengthened.    During Talbott's talks in New Delhi, it was felt in the  capital that the maneuver of getting Pakistan's agreement to cap  its nuclear program in exchange for providing it F-16s will not  be successful because no Pakistani government will be ready to  give up its nuclear program. Still, after the talks in Pakistan,  which Talbott called fully successful,' it appears that the  Clinton administration is very eager to provide F-16s and other  lethal weapons to Pakistan immediately. Efforts are being made  in the U.S. Congress to suspend the Pressler amendment in order  to supply these. The fact is that the main pressure on the  Clinton administration is to ensure the sale of the productions  of the huge U.S. airplane and missile industry. Senator Pressler  has already unmasked this fact, especially in the context of  supplying F-16s to Pakistan. Should Narasimha Rao desire, as  some of his advisors would want, President Clinton can also  provide India with a batch of those fighter planes or send other  kinds of planes to India. In this context, we should not forget  that the noise made over the cryogenic engine deal with Russia  and forcing it to back out of the contract, was all done to help  boost the sale of American rocket manufacturers. India is being  pressured to give up its missile program for this same reason.  The U.S. weapon industry that President Clinton wants to  encourage and advance has this inherent reasoning, "If you need  rockets or missiles, we are ready to sell you our products. Why  are you making rockets and missiles?"    Now the question naturally arises: What is the reason for  publicizing these efforts to halt Pakistan's nuclear program?  Talbott had made it clear in New Delhi that the deal with  Pakistan should be seen as a deal which has some strict and  clear conditions. This condition is Pakistan's clear agreement  to halt its nuclear program before the F-16s are supplied to it.  He clarified this idea further two days later in Islamabad. In a  very carefully expressed criticism he had made it clear that  agreement to initiate U.S. proposals has been made. He also said  that the goal of joint efforts was to expand on that  understanding.</p>

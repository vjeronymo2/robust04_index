			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister, who is in Germany on a four-day  official visit, has held talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl.  During the discussion, Mr. Goh pointed out that Germany and  Singapore are natural partners and complement each other's  strength in the region. Mr. Goh's trip, his first as prime  minister, is taking place amid more positive prospects for the  German economy. Most economists agree that the German economy  will start picking up again this year with GDP [gross domestic  product] growth between 0.5 to 1 percent. During the trip, both  sides will formalize the German-Singapore business forum. It is  to encourage companies from both sides to form joint ventures in  third countries.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Letter: Forcing home a point Sir, As a house, we have long argued that the current suppression of inflation is, as yet, more cyclical than structural in nature, and owes more to recession than to sterling's entry into the ERM. What is more, the benefits of the latter, in terms of the producer prices index (PPI), are being negated by still high inflation in the non-traded goods and services sector of the economy. We are thus indebted to your own newspaper for once again forcing the point home ('FT price rise', February 1). We note with interest that since the beginning of 1988, the price of the FT has risen by one third while the PPI has risen by less than 20 per cent. The financial markets should henceforth read any comments in your newspaper about the supposed benefits of price stability with some scepticism.

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / British Association for the Advancement of Science: Trials on 33 memory drugs under way THE INTERNATIONAL pharmaceutical industry is carrying out clinical trials on 33 different drugs intended to improve memory in elderly patients, said Professor Brenda Costall of Bradford University's pharmacology department. 'The memory enhancing drugs will not do anything in the normal brain but they do help if the memory is impaired through age,' she said. One of the candidate drugs is Zofran, which the pharmaceuticals company Glaxo sells as a treatment for nausea in patients receiving surgery or chemotherapy. All of the 33 drugs produced encouraging results in animal tests. Prof Costall predicted that it would become clear within five years which, if any, helped human patients.</p>

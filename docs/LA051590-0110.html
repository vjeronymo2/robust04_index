			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEINBRENNER MEETS WITH WINFIELD; HEARING TENTATIVELY IS WEDNESDAY  </P> <P> A hearing on Dave Winfield's refusal to accept a trade to the California Angels  from the New York Yankees for pitcher Mike Witt is tentatively scheduled  Wednesday before baseball arbitrator George Nicolau.  </P> <P> Yankee owner George Steinbrenner met with Winfield and his agent, Jeff Klein,  on Monday but was vague about details.  </P> <P> Another meeting is scheduled today.  </P> <P> Angel General Manager Mike Port hinted at a contract extension to entice  Winfield to accept the deal.  </P> <P> "California sits here as a club willing to go to whatever lengths it has to to  bring Dave Winfield here," Port said. "Is it our plan to have Dave around in a  longer term rather than a shorter term? The answer is yes."  </P> <P> At issue is Winfield's insistence of veto power over trades as a 10-and-five  player, 10 or more years in the majors, the last five with the same club.  Winfield has refused to report to the Angels since the deal was announced  Friday.  </P></p>

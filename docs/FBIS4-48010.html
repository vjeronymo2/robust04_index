			<p>BFN     [Text] We told you earlier that the interim head of state,  His Excellency Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, visited Isare today,  after reassuring those persons who had taken refuge at the Unity  Monument and his residence in Kiriri. They were from (Imuyira),  (Sororezo) and (Rweza). He asked them to return to their homes.  The people claimed that they were fleeing following shooting  incidents in their areas last night. They said that the  shooting was carried out by the soldiers. You heard this in our  midday bulletins. Therefore we asked the army's spokesman,  Lieutenant Colonel Jean-Bosco Daradangwa, for the truth of the  matter:    [Begin Daradangwa recording] It is true that some people  fled their homes after hearing the shooting. As you know, last  week the disarmament of the population was launched. You know  that the process started [words indistinct]. Some of the rebels  escaped. In some places the people, in conjuction with security  forces, discovered where they were hiding. One of the hiding  places is in Muyira, at a place called Kirombwe. That is why  the Armed Forces are now trying to dislodge 200 people from  there. It is the shooting between those people and the Armed  Forces which made the the citizens flee in fear. [end recording]    Daradangwa also told us that the Armed Forces captured guns  and other weapons, such as grenades.</p>

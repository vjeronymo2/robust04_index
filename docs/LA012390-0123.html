			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MESSIER IS VOTED BEST ALL-AROUND  </P> <P> Wayne Gretzky is the player they would pick if they were starting a franchise,  but Mark Messier is the NHL's best all-around player, according to a survey of  NHL players by the Pittsburgh Press.  </P> <P> A total of 123 players, about one-fourth of the league's active players, took  part in the poll, held in conjunction with Sunday's All-Star game at  Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> In the voting for best all-around player, Messier, the Edmonton Oilers' center,  was picked on 64 ballots to 19 for Gretzky and 13 for Boston Bruin defenseman  Ray Bourque. Pittsburgh center Mario Lemieux, the Oilers' Jari Kurri and  Detroit's Steve Yzerman earned four votes apiece.  </P> <P> Winnipeg's Thomas Steen was voted the most underrated player.  </P> <P> Gretzky, the King center who was held scoreless in the All-Star game, also was  selected as the toughest player to defend against and was the runaway winner  for best playmaker. He collected 102 votes to six for runner-up Lemieux.  </P> <P> Lemieux, who won a record third most valuable player award Sunday by scoring  four goals, was picked as the best puck handler and most likely to score on a  breakaway.  </P></p>

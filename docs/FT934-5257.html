			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (27): Advice for the leaders LEADERSHIP &amp; INFORMATION PROCESSING by Robert G Lord and Karen J. Maher Routledge Pounds 13.99 THE INDEPENDENT BOARD DIRECTOR by David Clutterbuck and Peter Waine McGraw-Hill Pounds 24.95 THE ECONOMICS OF TRAINING by Paul G Chapman Harvester/Wheatsheaf Pounds 17.95 It is an American belief that executive leadership is vital in understanding the workings and performance of organisations. This belief is probably justified in the American context, though not necessarily so in others in others, for example in Japan. Lord and Maher have attempted, at last, to get away from traditional approaches to understanding leadership which tend to examine leaders in isolation from their environment. Their book has an opaque title and their prose is rather academic. Nevertheless, they have produced an important study which considers how executives make decisions, and how the acceptance of their decisions is constrained by the perceptions that others have of the style and content of their leadership. They conclude that leadership affects and is constrained by cognitive and social processes at all levels of human systems, and it similarly affects and is constrained by task-performance at each of these levels. This sounds common sense, but the book applies the approach in some detail, showing why females may not be perceived as leaders, how leaders can expand the scope of their discretion, and precisely how context may limit both leadership possibilities and perceptions. Practically, Lord and Maher suggest that leaders often address problems from too narrow a perspective. They present four models of information processing, which can act as alternative ways of understanding and approaching problems. Business leaders in Britain are finding themselves forced to take positions on the question of non-executive directors - or Independent Board Directors, as Clutterbuck &amp; Waine prefer to call them. In The Independent Board Director, the authors present findings from their research which suggest that NEDs are often the wrong people for the post, appointed for the wrong reasons, and their talents are poorly utilised. NEDs themselves are often unsure of what is expected of them, and companies which could most benefit from NEDs - smaller companies, which often lack depth of management expertise - are the least likely to have them. Clutterbuck and Waine counter these maladies by setting out best practice in the field. The material is organised in chapters which address simple questions, such as: 'so what is a non-executive director?', 'what does an effective NED do?', 'why do people become NEDs?', and so on. The most useful part of the book is the chapter on 'how can independent directors contribute more?' and that on 'choosing and using Independent directors.' Clutterbuck and Waine make a strong case for training programmes for independent board directors. But does training provide value for money? Paul G Chapman's The Economics of Training provides a reasonably comprehensive account of the application of economic ideas to the analysis of training, and attempts to develop a general theory based on the human capital approach, the transactions cost model, signalling, asymmetric information and labour structure. Of more immediate interest to British readers will be Chapman's critique of past and current UK training policy and the formulation of training policy in international context. A particularly strong section investigates empirical evidence of the value and effect of training programmes, and he concludes that the sad history of Britain's deteriorating training policies is best explained in terms of the prevailing economic philosophy rather than of hard economic judgment. 'Like the annual Budget,' counsels Chapman, 'policy changes should be periodic and limited. In an imperfect world, policy should aim to improve existing training arrangements rather than searching endlessly for the 'right' policy.' Excellent advice, but perhaps it will only happen when we have an environment in which firms can create cooperatively the solutions which are needed by industry and commerce.</p>

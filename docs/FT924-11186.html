			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Hire side helps Moss Bros treble MOSS BROS, the clothing outfitter, more than trebled pre-tax profits, from Pounds 102,000 to Pounds 354,000, in the half year to July 25, helped by a strong showing by its hire business. Sales were up 3 per cent to Pounds 23.9m (Pounds 23.3m) boosted by a first time contribution from last year's purchase of Dormie from Sears Menswear. Turnover was up 1 per cent on a like-for-like basis, reflecting an increase in sales across all the groups activities, which include Cecil Gee, Savoy Taylors Guild and Suit Co. The hire division increased its market share by 2 percentage points to 38 per cent. Mr Rowland Gee, managing director, said: 'When we went into the recession we said these are the economic conditions in which we have to trade. What we have now may be normality. It is no longer a case of trying to forecast when the recession is going to end.' Accordingly, Mr Gee said the company had reduced the number of suits sold at a discount by keeping stocks low. Earnings per share rose from 0.14p to 1.42p. The interim dividend is held at 1.5p to be paid on December 4.</p>

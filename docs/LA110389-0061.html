			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALTRANS STUDY FAILED TO CHECK NIMITZ PILLARS;  </P> <P> QUAKE: TECHNOLOGY COULD HAVE SPOTTED FLAW, BUT COLUMNS WERE NOT A PRIORITY.  </P> <P> Caltrans never conducted a complete seismic study of the double-decked Nimitz  Freeway, even though computer technology available for more than a decade could  have uncovered flaws that contributed to its collapse, a top department  official acknowledged Thursday.  </P> <P> State engineers conducted a partial seismic study of the Cypress viaduct in  1977 as part of a program to strengthen the freeway structure in the event of  an earthquake. But they never examined the design of the expressway's columns,  which gave way in the Oct. 17 earthquake, said James E. Roberts, chief of the  department's structures division.  </P> <P> "We were not looking at columns at the time," Roberts said. "That was not our  high priority."  </P> <P> Last week, Roberts said the 1977 analysis had shown that the freeway would  withstand a major earthquake -- but that state officials could not find a copy  of the study.  </P> <P> In an interview Thursday, however, he said the missing seismic analysis only  examined how to strengthen the roadbed portion of the Cypress structure and was  not a comprehensive earthquake study.  </P> <P> Roberts' disclosure is significant because Caltrans officials have repeatedly  said they had believed the Nimitz, with its two-level, double-column design,  would stand up in an earthquake.  </P> <P> Forty-one people were killed in the collapsed section of the Nimitz Freeway in  Oakland.  </P> <P> James H. Gates, a Caltrans structural mechanics engineer who headed the 1977  study, lamented in an interview this week that he and his staff did not  discover the danger in the columns when they conducted their analysis.  </P> <P> "The disturbing thing from my point of view is that I didn't spot that  problem," Gates said. "The disturbing thing from the point of view of the guys  working for me is that they didn't spot the problem.  </P> <P> "We've been trying since 1986 to identify those vulnerable structures. We don't  have any excuse. We just weren't able to do it. When you're looking at 15,000  bridges, it's like finding a needle in a haystack," he said.  </P> <P> The first warning the state received that such columns might be unsafe came  about 2 1/2 months before the earthquake struck, when a committee of four  engineers working as consultants to the department alerted the state that three  freeways in San Francisco with a similar design were vulnerable to quakes.  </P> <P> Like the Nimitz, these freeways were supported by columns that were fastened to  the roadway with "hinges," which were designed to provide flexibility. In the  case of the Nimitz, however, the columns were not strong enough to withstand  the 7.1 earthquake that rocked the Bay Area. The three San Francisco freeways  were damaged but did not collapse in the quake.  </P> <P> The 1977 analysis of the Cypress structure was conducted as part of the  department's earthquake retrofit program, in which older bridges and highways  were upgraded to meet new earthquake standards.  </P> <P> For a freeway such as the Nimitz, that meant tying together sections of the  roadway with steel cables so they would not come apart in a quake. But  strengthening the roadbed may have put even greater stress on the columns and  contributed to the collapse of the structure, state engineers have said.  </P> <P> Roberts said a computer program developed in 1978 made seismic analysis much  easier and could have helped spot the flaw in the Nimitz structure. But by  then, he said, department engineers had moved on to other work.  </P> <P> Because of the quake, the department will now conduct a complete seismic study  of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge at a cost of several hundred thousand  dollars, he said. One section of the bridge collapsed in the quake and is  undergoing emergency repairs that are scheduled to be completed by Nov. 17.  </P> <P> Roberts said it is unlikely that the 1977 analysis will ever be found, because  such records are frequently destroyed after four years. Rather than a formal  study, he said, the seismic analysis was a series of calculations for  strengthening the roadway.  </P> <P> Gates, in a memo to Roberts earlier this week, said it is not possible to  "guarantee" that there will not be fatalities on highway bridges in the event  of another major earthquake. But he said the program to upgrade structures had  been effective in reducing casualties in quakes during the last decade.  </P> <P> "We have tried to the best of our ability to anticipate the potential damage  from future events and feel badly that we did not foresee the collapse at  Cypress Avenue," he said in the memo.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Virginia Ellis contributed to this story.  </P></p>

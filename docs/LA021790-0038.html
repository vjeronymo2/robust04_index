			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REMEMBERING GOLDBERG  </P> <P> Even though it is a common denominator for all of us at some time, the death of  Albert Goldberg and the rather touching "An Appreciation" by Martin Bernheimer  (Feb. 6) started this day on a sad note for me. So much of what Bernheimer  wrote about Goldberg brought back memories to me.  </P> <P> On the few occasions at operas and recitals that I conversed with Albert, he  struck me not only as the lucid, perceptive critic that he was, but as a  consummate gentleman. The amenities, the social graces, were always there.  </P> <P> I really only began to take note of opera in my student days, later studied  voice and sang a bit, and it was in those days when the San Francisco Opera  used to make annual visits to the Shrine Auditorium that I became an avid  reader of Goldberg's opera reviews for The Times. There was always that  eagerness and anticipation to get his "slant" on a production. It became  ritualistic.  </P> <P> The last time I spoke with the then emeritus critic was when I spied him at the  last recital of the great diva Lily Pons in Palm Springs in 1973. His review  read, ". . . Unmistakably Lily Pons!" Goldberg's writing through the years  surely causes me to add, "Unmistakably Albert Goldberg!"  </P> <P> FRANK R. WYNNE, Los Alamitos  </P></p>

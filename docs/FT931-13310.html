			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Sport: Ford gets it right first time - Motoring / Stuart Marshall test drives the new Mondeo and is impressed FORD REALLY has got its most important new model in years right first time. Two weeks ago, I wrote here that if the Mondeo's on-road performance lived up to its paper promise, it ought to breathe new life into Ford. But I wondered out loud if, like quite a few new Fords in the past, it might have some aggravating drawback that would put me off. It has not. I judged the left-hand drive 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0 litre Mondeo saloons and hatchbacks I tried in southern France last week well able to look rivals like the Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel Vectra), Nissan Primera, Toyota Carina E and Peugeot 405 in the eye. Owners or users of the veteran rear-wheel driven Sierra that Mondeo replaces may well find it so much better that they will feel it has moved up half a class. As multi-valve engines go, those powering the Mondeo are good without being outstanding. One can say the same of the standard five-speed gearbox. But what makes Mondeo shine is the thoroughness with which Ford has tackled noise, vibration and harshness. All the cars felt reassuringly solid and throughout two days of energetic driving were squeak and rattle free. I started with an entry-model 1.6 litre. At around 130 kph (81 mph) on the autoroute - all right, just a bit more - there was barely a whisper of wind and tyre noise and only a soft hum from the engine. Away from the autoroute's smooth tarmac the ride was supple, shock-absorbent and quiet. (Mondeo is shorter than Sierra, but its wheelbase is longer and the track wider). The medium low profile 65 series tyres did not roar on coarse surfaces, nor thump when hitting potholes. Four up and with a boot full of luggage, it handled with elegance and ease. Power assistance, standard on all Mondeos, takes away steering effort but you still know what kind of surface the tyres are on. The 90 horsepower 1.6 litre engine spins freely up to high revolutions in the gears but pulls smoothly in fifth from under 30 mph (50 kmh). The 1.8 litre, 115 horsepower Ghia I tried next felt much peppier, a 2.0 litre, 136 horsepower model more muscular still. The 1.8 and 2.0 litre Mondeos were enjoyable, even stimulating, to drive on the uncrowded D roads of the Var. There were times when I convinced myself the 2.0 litre could easily have been an Audi or BMW. But the 1.6 litre rode best; the least powerful, narrowest-tyred models always do. Visibility is good over the short, downswept bonnet and the driving position is fine. The Ghia's soft leather seats with power adjustment could have come from a Pounds 30,000 car. So does the Mondeo have no flaws at all? Not quite. A six-footer finds it difficult to be comfortable in the rear seat because head and legroom are meagre unless the person up front is short-legged. The overall gearing of the 2.0 litre models - only 20 mph/32 kmh per 1,000 rpm - is too low. Of course, it makes for great flexibility in town and vigorous acceleration in fourth or fifth - but who wants to cruise a 2.0 litre car on an autoroute at more than 4,000 rpm? There is no rear-seat problem in the spacious Mondeo estate because the cushion is lower. I shall be surprised if the 2.0 litre cars do not go on sale with revised gearing. Unquestionably, Mondeo is off to a good start. There will be sighs of relief at Ford from March onward as it begins eroding the gains General Motors (Vauxhall and Opel), Rover and Peugeot have made at the ageing Sierra's expense. The latest Escort has persuaded some Sierra buyers to trade down to a smaller but nicely furnished and more modern car of equal performance. Mondeo may do the same with Scorpio users. Imagine a really posh model with the US designed and made 2.5 litre V6 engine, electronically-controlled automatic transmission and traction control system, leather trim and air conditioning. It would match or exceed Scorpio standards of luxury and performance without the bulk - and it is coming before long. So, too, are the four-wheel drive models, the turbocharged and intercooled 1.8 diesels and the estate cars. All we need to know are the prices, due for release just before the Mondeo's public debut at Geneva in March. If they are as keen as whispers suggest, Ford's recovery prospects will be brighter than seemed possible a few months ago.</p>

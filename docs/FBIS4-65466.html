			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Segni: `If Silvio Falls, Try </F> Someone Else'"]    [Text] Rome -- Who will succeed if the Berlusconi  government fails to pass the Senate? For Pact for Italy leader  Mario Segni, the present prime minister will have to hand over  the reins. "Nowhere is it written," he reasons, "that it is  necessarily Silvio Berlusconi who has to form the government.  In the majority of the Right, which has won and which should  provide the prime minister, there are other individuals and,  hence, other possible governments."    "It is absurd to call new elections if the government  falls,"  Segni went on to warn, even venturing to suggest a possibly  benevolent attitude of his group toward a new government "headed  by a different person and who would not pose the serious  problems of incompatibility (as posed by Berlusconi), and who  would not promote exponents of a Right which is discredited in  Europe."    Senator Francesco Cossiga gave a more articulate forecast.  "If the government fails to pass the Senate," the former  president of the Republic stated, "resignation will be  necessary" for Berlusconi, who will have to hand over "to the  person whom we have to get used to seeing as the head of the  opposition, that is PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] leader  Occhetto." If the PDS too fails to win a vote of confidence,  for Cossiga this would open the way to the formation of a  "government of national unity, with a short program and led by  an individual acceptable to both Left and Right, or a government  which would take the country into the elections." This last  possibility, for the former head of state, should not be  "absolutely dramatized, because in the system which we have  chosen early dissolution is a built-in part of the mechanism  when the majority expressed by the people does not function."    "I hope that the Senate will find the votes, because --  [Interior] Minister Roberto Maroni states bluntly -- who will  take on the responsibility of bringing down the government, to  which there is no alternative, whatever Segni says. He knows  that the only alternative is new elections." But new elections,  in the opinion of the new interior minister, would be an  unpopular step, which people would not understand. "From all  sides, including those who voted progressive, I sense a desire,  " Maroni confesses, "to get the government started off in order  to then assess its actions. Everyone's real wish is for  governability."</p>

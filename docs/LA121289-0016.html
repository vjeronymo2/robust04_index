			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> KENTUCKY;  </P> <P> INTOXICATION DENIED IN CRASH FATAL TO 27  </P> <P> A man charged with 27 counts of murder as a result of a bus crash last year had  not been drinking heavily the day of the accident, relatives and a friend  testified as the defense opened its case in Carrollton, Ky. The defendant,  Larry Mahoney, 36, of Worthville, admits drinking the day of the crash, driving  on the wrong side of Interstate 71 and striking the loaded church bus. But the  defense maintains that the 27 victims were killed because the bus was unsafe.  The fuel tank of the bus owned by the Radcliff First Assembly of God church  exploded, sending flames throughout the bus carrying 67 people home from an  outing.  </P></p>

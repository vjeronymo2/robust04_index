			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 18 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Ernesto Zedillo,  presidential candidate for the ruling Institutional  Revolutionary Party (PRI), is ahead of his opponents with 45.4  percent of voter preference, according to a study released today.    A poll conducted by the S.C. Opinion Study Cabinet [Gabinete  de Estudios de Opinion S.C.] reported that Zedillo was followed  by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidate for the Democratic  Revolutionary Party, and Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the  National Action Party with 11.4 and 8.9 percent, respectively.  The other six candidates obtained 6.7 percent support, while  27.6 percent of the voters have not reached a final decision.    Elections will be held on 21 August in Mexico to choose the  next president of the republic and to renew the Chambers of  Deputies and Senators.    The third preelection poll published this Monday by EL  NACIONAL newspaper revealed that there is confidence in the  electoral register and that people feel voting will be respected  in the upcoming elections.    As part of the 63-question survey, some 1,100 people were  polled in 17 states throughout the country between 7 and 10  April, in accordance with a multi-period [polietapico] survey  through which it was inferred that 75 percent of those polled  considered the new electoral register reliable.    Zedillo, who replaced former PRI presidential candidate Luis  Donaldo Colosio -- murdered on 23 March in the border town of  Tijuana -- "enjoys the support of a clear majority of the  supporters of the ruling party," the newspaper reported.  "Despite the magnitude of the tragic events leading to the  assassination of Colosio, the voting intentions of citizens were  hardly affected," EL NACIONAL added.    Marcela Lombardo of the Popular Socialist Party, Rafael  Aguila for the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction  Party, and Jorge Gonzalez for Mexican Green Ecologist Party are  also participating in the elections, as are Alvaro Peraza for  the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution, Cecilia Soto for  the Labor Party, and Pablo Emilio Madero for the National  Opposition Union.    The survey also found that 53 percent of those polled termed  President Salinas' administration positive, while 7 percent  described it as unfavorable.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Support grows for private landlords THERE IS widespread support among politicians and housing experts for reviving the private landlord system, a report commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation, said yesterday. The report called for incentives to encourage private landlords and to secure funding for rented housing from financial institutions. It also said there should be improved tax breaks and measures to make it easier to regain possession of properties let out. Among those who have given 'broad agreement' to such measures is Ms Sheila McKechnie, director of the housing charity Shelter, and businesses that provide private rented accommodation. The report said reversing the decline in private rented housing was the only way to meet the demand that councils and housing associations could not meet. Revival of the sector would require government subsidies to bridge the gap between the landlord's likely income from rents and the returns available from comparable investments, the report added. Income tax exemptions on rent and capital gains tax allowances such as those offered to owner-occupiers should also be considered. The report advocated steps to reassure landlords that they could regain possession of their properties with reasonable speed from tenants who did not pay rent. It said court procedures should be streamlined to eliminate delays - now as long as six months - in obtaining a hearing. Sir George Young, housing minister, welcomed the report. 'I hope we shall succeed in creating a sector in which the major financial institutions - the pension funds and insurance companies - feel they can invest with confidence once more,' he said.

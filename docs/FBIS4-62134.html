			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Smirnov report: "Ubozhko Wants to Ride Into The </F> Kremlin on a Tractor"]    [Text] Chelyabinsk -- There are 13 contenders for the last  two Russian Federation Council seats in Chelyabinsk.    Last December there was a whole host of politicians trying  to  fight their way into the Duma. It was packed here -- the  candidates had to push and shove -- but when it came to the  Federation Council the elections were null and void -- no one  wanted to run!    Now, however, there are 13 contenders for the last two seats  in Russia. An ominous number. But the "temporarily nonworking"  ex-general V. Varennikov probably is not superstitious about  such things. He has visited Chelyabinsk twice. He addressed  the public who, as the local newspapers reported, greeted his  speeches with applause and shouts of approval.    All sorts of people are being attracted to Chelyabinsk  Oblast. General Makashov was here on the eve of the presidential  elections. Zhirinovskiy perorated from atop a tractor at the  Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant. Federation Council contender Lev  Ubozhko, chairman of the Conservative Party of Russia, did not  give a fig for this Zhirinovskiy: "When I speak, there will be  nothing that that...can do!" As a politician he rates himself  above Zhirinovskiy and as for Yeltsin -- even more so. Lev the  Terrible!    The oblast administration, it seems to me, is watching these  elections with a certain unease. All last year Vadim Solovyev,  the head of the administration fought the oblast Soviet (or  rather the Soviet fought him). After the putsch the deputies  were turfed out and a lull ensued. But the apparatus settled  down into the comfortable, well paid jobs. Where the means  exist the ends are not hard to achieve. The opposition has been  biding its time in the shadows but has been very actively  promoting its candidates into a place in the sun. Who knows how  the Federation Council deputies will behave toward the  administration? The Duma deputies, for example, have already  brought up the big guns -- a commission from the Russian  president's apparatus has already come for a heart to heart talk  with Solovyev.    The only calm people here are surely the voters. Calm with  regard to the elections, of course. And keeping your cool when  whole districts are without water and the city is up to its ears  in garbage is no easy matter. Hardly anything is going to  change after the elections either.</p>

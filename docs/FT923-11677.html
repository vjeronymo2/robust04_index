			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Barclays seeks to halt US action BARCLAYS Bank is trying to stop the administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation suing it in the US for Dollars 30m paid to it by MCC three weeks after the death of Robert Maxwell last November. Touche Ross, the administrators, claim that the payment was an unlawful preference and should be returned to MCC. They contend that the decision on where to sue for it is a matter for them. Barclays argued in the High Court yesterday that any claim to the money - part repayment of an overdraft facility granted to MCC - should be made in the English court. The bank sought an injunction restraining the administrators from suing for the return of the money outside the UK and from making any claim for it in proceedings under the US bankruptcy code. Last December, MCC filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law. Mr Nicholas Merriman, QC for Barclays, said the overdraft facility, under which the bank was still owed Pounds 32.3m, was an English commercial transaction making working capital available to an English company and its UK subsidiaries, and was governed by English law. The English court was the natural forum in which to try the dispute, he said. The administrators were using the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the US 'in order to circumvent what would otherwise be an unsuccessful claim under English law'. Mr John Higham QC, for the administrators, said Barclays was saying that the US court ought not even to consider whether it should deal with the case, but that the English court should dictate the answer. The hearing continues today.</p>

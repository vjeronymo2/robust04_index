			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Coal Investments seeks Pounds 26.3m through placing and open offer Coal Investments yesterday announced a placing and open offer to raise Pounds 26.3m. It wants the money to increase capital expenditure, provide working capital and increase its holding in Mining (Scotland), the government's preferred bidder for British Coal's Scottish region. Existing shareholders are being offered the chance to subscribe for about half of the shares - up to 36.6m - being created through an open offer of four new shares for every 13 held. The balance are being placed firm at 76.5p, against yesterday's closing share price of 81p, down 4p. The issue represents more than 50 per cent of the 60m shares already in existence. Coal Investments, led by Mr Malcolm Edwards, is increasing its stake in Mining (Scotland) to between 22.8 and 29.6 per cent, paying Pounds 8.3m initially. MS is paying Pounds 39.4m for British Coal's Scottish region plus about Pounds 10m for surplus coal stocks. Of the Pounds 53m needed to fund this, Pounds 25m will be raised through bank debt and Pounds 28m through equity. CI also announced the conclusion of contracts to supply the English electricity generators with 4.8m tonnes of coal over six years. It is also in contract talks with British Steel, which it said would enable it to lift output to between 3m and 4m tonnes. The company is to spend Pounds 6m at its Coventry pit to develop a longwall face to fulfil the generator contracts. Coal Investments said that geological problems at Cwmgwili earlier in the year had prevented budgeted output being achieved; however, a move to a better part of the seam meant budgeted production was now being achieved. A new washery would improve margins, the company added. COMMENT The consolation for Coal Investments for RJB Mining taking over such a large part of British Coal is that the electricity generators will want alternative markets. This helps to explain why CI has been able to win 5m tonne contracts with National Power and PowerGen, and there should be more to come. Even so, the company has much to prove, particularly on the production front. The problems at Cwmgwili and the late delivery of machinery at other mines are dismissed as unimportant by Mr Edwards but, in such a young company, they will be not be considered immaterial by all investors. If Coal Investments can meet its targets it could recover from expected losses this year to make profits of Pounds 18m next year. The prospective price/earnings ratio, assuming a full tax charge, would be about 6.</p>

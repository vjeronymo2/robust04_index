			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Alba advances 36% amid encouraging trading Alba, the consumer electronics group and UK market leader in home audio and small screen colour television sales, yesterday reported a near-36 per cent rise in interim profits and described pre-Christmas high street trading as 'very satisfactory.' The rise, from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 1.63m pre-tax for the six months to end-September, came on turnover 10.9 per cent higher at Pounds 50.1m. The comparative profit figure included a Pounds 194,000 loss on the now discontinued Greenwood Theatre television studios. Mr John Harris, chairman, said: 'Trading in the UK has been good in the period under review and, despite the weak trading conditions in France and Germany, we have experienced reasonable levels of business in these countries.' He added: 'Current business in the run up to Christmas is very satisfactory.' The chairman's comments on current UK trading were in sharp contrast to some of Alba's competitors including Amstrad, whose chairman, Mr Alan Sugar, warned last week that there was no evidence of a pre-Christmas high street spending boom. In addition to audio and domestic appliances, which Mr Harris said had sold particularly well, the group has successfully entered the higher profile UK satellite equipment and Nicam stereo TV markets. Earnings per share increased to 2.63p (1.82p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 1p.</p>

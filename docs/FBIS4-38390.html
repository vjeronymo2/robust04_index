			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Yadukha report from Simferopol in the "Peninsula" </F> column: "Crimean Parliament Shows Its Teeth to the President.  Half the Peninsula's Population Awaits Action from Meshkov"]    [Text] The Crimean Supreme Council session which has just  opened showed that, despite ideological common ground with the  parliamentary majority, President Yuriy Meshkov has failed to  avoid traditional friction with people's deputies.    After the session formed a working group on further talks  with Kiev on the fate of the Crimean constitution the deputies  went ahead with discussing the cabinet structure. The  president's proposal to cut the apparatus of the ministries of  culture, education, and public health by merging them into a  social security ministry was rejected out of hand by the Supreme  Council. Yet more important for the head of state was the  confirmation of eight candidates from the Yevgeniy Saburov team  who so far are only acting ministers.    Addressing parliament, Mr. Saburov stated that Crimea has  turned out to be not ready to rectify the "twisted economic  relations" amid plummeting demand. The vice premier sees an  answer in attracting foreign investments and swifter  privatization and reform in general.    This did not please the deputies who do not trust in the  possibility of legal privatization while regarding calls for  wide investments as attempts by "Moscow Varangians" to sell off  the peninsula to foreigners. The house jeered and called for a  concrete plan of action. It was in vain that Mr. Meshkov tried  to remind the deputies about former cooperation, asking to  confirm his men. The cabinet opponents were joined by communist  and Crimean Tatar factions, with the result that the ministers  were not approved. Meshkov, Saburov, and the government walked  out of the house.    Meanwhile, the popularity rating of Meshskov, who not so  long  ago scored a fairly convincing victory in elections, is falling.  According to the Crimean Social Studies Center, only 12 percent  of the respondents fully approve of the president's performance;  18 percent support it; the same proportion of respondents say  they have never trusted him; and 43 percent want action from him.</p>

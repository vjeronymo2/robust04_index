Judging from initial reports received from the  Belgian capital three main questions will take a central place  on the session agenda. First, can the transatlantic alliance be  maintained now that the Cold War has ended and the United States  is terminating its military presence in Europe, and if so, how  can this be done? Second is the relationship between NATO and  its former adversaries -- the states making up the Warsaw Pact,  many of which, as well as Lithuania, Macedonia, and a number of  others, are persistently knocking on the bloc's door. Third,  what kind of future does the alliance have in general, and what  tasks is it designed to fulfill now? In addition, at the  insistence of France and the Netherlands, there will be a debate  about whether bombing strikes should be made on Serb positions  in connection with the latest exacerbation of the situation in  the area of Sarajevo.    We will have to wait a day or two for the results of the  discussion of all these questions. But even now it is clear  that no NATO Council session has ever attracted such attention  as the one now taking place in Brussels. An avalanche of  speeches, statements, publications, and comments has swamped the  public. The most diverse opinions are being expressed. The  British SUNDAY TIMES, for example, claims that the North  Atlantic alliance is on the brink of a slow death because the  reason for its existence has disappeared. While THE NEW YORK  TIMES observer W. Safire calls on NATO leaders to take advantage  of the "temporary weakening of Russia" to expand the bloc and  include East European countries in it.    U.S President Bill Clinton also agrees with the need to  review the alliance's role. But he believes that efforts must  be channeled into developing partnership with East European  countries, including those which previously comprised the USSR.  And, THE WASHINGTON POST observed, he has taken on a solemn  duty: America will play a leading role, "linking" the stable,  democratic states of the West with the emerging democracies of  the East in the military and economic spheres and in the sphere  of creating democratic institutions.    This purpose should be served by the "Partnership for Peace"  program, which will essentially be an intensification of the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council's activity. The question of  expanding NATO is not being put on the agenda now because it  carries the risk of dividing Europe into blocs and drawing new  demarcation lines on its map.</p>

Liu Chengxiang, of the State Statistical Bureau [SSB], said  the order was given by a vice-premier, Zou Jiahua, at a meeting  in Beijing last week.    Zou had called on the bureau to adhere to party discipline  and state laws to solve what he called "negative, corrupt  behaviour".    "Our leaders are worried that their ability to take signals  from the economy this year may be hampered by fake statistics,"  Liu said.    Liu said retrospective analysis of gross domestic product  growth figures was showing up about 2 percent of errors every  year. Problems were worst in numbers from coastal areas and  township enterprises, he said.    "Local officials know that others will judge the  achievements  of their political careers based on statistics," he said. "As a  result, there are a lot of weaknesses showing up in our national  statistical system."    Under-reporting of profits and tax revenues was another  worry  of the bureau this year after a new national tax-sharing system  was introduced, he said. In other cases, excess paperwork was  causing things to be counted twice by mistake.    In one recent case, a local forestry bureau reported it had  planted 20,000 hectares of trees over the past five years when  in fact the same 4,000 hectares had been repeatedly replanted  after the seedlings kept dying from lack of proper care.  Meanwhile, Beijing will rely more on the bureau this year than  in the past to guide its macro policy, Liu said.    "The central government has asked us to start providing them  with sample-based analysis and forecasts so that they can be  more sensitive to the economic situation this year," he said.    The State Council had been told the growth rate was too  high.  In their January meeting with the State Council, SSB officials  advised that growth was "a little too high," Liu said.    "We said that the growth rate so far this year will lead to  inflation which urban people cannot bear," he said.    While Beijing's official targets for 1994 are 9 per cent GDP  growth and 10 percent inflation, the SSB had already bumped up  its internal estimates to 11 percent growth and more than 12  percent inflation, he added.</p>

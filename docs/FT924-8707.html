			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Repaying debt is consumer priority CONSUMERS, unconvinced by lower interest rates, continued to make the repayment of debt a priority last month. Official figures out yesterday showed that consumers paid back Pounds 60m more than they borrowed in September following a net repayment of Pounds 36m in August. Almost all of last month's fall in consumer credit was accounted for by a big reduction in credit card debts. Lending by banks on credit cards that are part of the Visa or Mastercard system fell by Pounds 58m, compared with a fall of only Pounds 3m in August. Net lending by finance houses rose by Pounds 6m, while loans by building societies fell by Pounds 8m. The figures from the Central Statistical Office also showed that new credit advanced to consumers rose to Pounds 4.4bn in September compared with Pounds 3.8bn in August. Economists said that last month's higher figure probably reflected a big rise in loans on household goods, following a rush to buy houses in August, before the stamp duty concession was removed. Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brother said: 'Although consumer credit remains weak, it has not shown a fresh collapse over the summer.' A broader measure of credit growth which includes bank loans on personal accounts and lending by non-bank credit cards shows an acceleration in net consumer credit growth in the latest quarter, compared with the second quarter. In the three months to the end of September, consumer lending according to this measure expanded by Pounds 332m compared with the second quarter's exceptionally low figure of Pounds 155m. Although the narrow measure of consumer borrowing represents only about 15 per cent of total private sector debt - it does not include mortgages - it is a useful snapshot on consumer behaviour. The latest figures, for example, show that in the third quarter, consumer credit fell by Pounds 18m, reflecting caution about the economic situation and the high cost of borrowing. The figure compares with growth of Pounds 202m in the third quarter last year, and growth of Pounds 786m in the third quarter of 1990.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Warning sends AAF shares down 66p SHARES in AAF Industries plunged 66p to 125p as the modular buildings and alloy wheels group announced that the results for the six months to June 30 would be 'significantly below those of last year'. Then, pre-tax profits increased slightly from Pounds 2.22m to Pounds 2.26m. The warning comes just two months after the group made a Pounds 7.65m rights issue. The company said that the business of Alloy Wheels International looked 'in line with the management plan' at the time of the rights with deliveries for a 'significant volume of wheels for a major US automotive manufacturer' due to start on October 1. However, the problems lay in the system building side. Here, margins have 'remained at very low levels' with competition further intensifying. The company said that 'substantial redundancies' had been necessary and further rationalisation was being examined. Moreover, the company admitted that the review of all operations - and the internal controls - at the Blackburn site had been 'inadequate' and that unprofitable contracts had been undertaken as a result. In the US, Preferred Medical Enterprises, a specialist modular building operation, had been closed - incurring losses of about Pounds 1.4m - as recession and reduced medical and military expenditure resulted in lower demand for new medical facilities. In an attempt to beef up the management team, Mr Alex Brown, of W&amp;A Investment Corporation, the South African consumer and industrial group whose stake in AAF was diluted to 43.1 per cent by the rights, has become chief operating officer. AAF is due to report its interim results in early September when further information on the review currently under way will be made available. The directors 'remain confident in the prospects of the group'.</p>

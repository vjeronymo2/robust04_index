			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese government  has begun to tackle the problem of the loss of state property by  improving legislation and tightening management.    The loss finds expression primarily in that, when a foreign-  funded enterprise or a stock company is set up, assets of a  state- owned enterprise are often not evaluated precisely.  Consequently, these assets turn, through different channels,  into assets of collectives, individuals or foreign investors.    A survey conducted last year shows that two-thirds of the  10,000 state-owned businesses establishing joint ventures with  overseas firms did not evaluate their state-owned assets.    Chinese economists estimate that the loss resulting from  lack  of evaluation or under-evaluation of state-owned assets when  Chinese companies launch joint ventures with overseas firms  amounts to 30 billion yuan a year.    The loss stemming from lack of evaluation or  under-evaluation  of state-owned assets when existing enterprises become  joint-stock companies is also enormous, they say.    An official of the state-owned assets administration said  that the unpaid use of state-owned assets to set up  profit-making businesses and the existence of large numbers of  money-losing state- owned companies also cause serious losses of  state-owned assets.    He estimated the loss of such assets over the past decade at  500 billion yuan in total. "The loss of tax revenues and the  loss of state-owned assets have become two serious problems in  China's economic life," he said.    The Chinese government has made it clear that the  state-owned  sector will serve as the mainstay of China's economy in the  course of shifting to a market economy, he noted.    The state-owned sector is still growing despite the policy  of  encouraging the common development of multi-economic sectors, he  said.    For example, the value of state-owned assets climbed 14  percent in 1992 to 3,069.7 billion yuan.    The official said that the loss of state-owned assets runs  counter to the Chinese government's reform policy.    Economists attribute the loss chiefly to the absence of a  unified and effective system for managing state-owned assets,  ill-defined functions of departments in charge of managing  state-owned assets at all levels and loopholes in existing laws  and regulations.    The Chinese government is now taking a series of measures to  stem the loss, they said.    The most important measure is to evaluate state-owned  assets.  Last year 10,000 state-owned enterprises finished evaluating  their assets, and another 10,000 will do so this year.    China currently has 1,000 accountants' and auditors' offices  authorized by the government to evaluate such assets, the  official said.    He said that when establishing a Sino-foreign joint venture  or a joint-stock company, a state-owned enterprise must have an  assets evaluation certificate approved by the state-owned assets  administration.    He said that the standing committee of the national people's  congress is drafting a law on state-owned assets and formulating  a set of regulations on the supervision and management of assets  in state-owned enterprises and another set of regulations on how  to assess the increase in the value of state-owned assets.    He said that when a state-owned enterprise changes its  property rights in the future it must evaluate its assets,  define its property rights and clear its debts.</p>

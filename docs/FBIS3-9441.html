Including, therefore,  the rapprochement negotiated by the United States between the  Bosnian Croats and Muslims. At least, this is what Serbian  Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic claims. "We give the  initiative credit, and we give the United States credit for  coming up with it. However, we would like to obtain more  information from them. Guarantees that the initiative is based  on genuine peace, and on a just, balanced solution."    "The absence of war between Bosnian Croats and Muslims, the  fruit of U.S. mediation, already constitutes the beginning of a  political solution between them. However, the third party, the  Bosnian Serbs, were not consulted. That is the weak point of  the initiative. The war involves all three factions, yet a  solution is being sought through bilateral talks," Minister  Jovanovic said.    "There is nothing unnatural in this rapprochement,"  according  to the minister, who arrived in Brussels yesterday. Belgrade is  giving the initiative the benefit of the doubt. "If the  intention behind it is serious, then hats off to it; but if it  is merely a prelude to an alliance against the third party, then  it will not work," he said.    Jovanovic pointed out that peace has been on the horizon for  a long time. The blueprint is enshrined in the preliminary  agreements that were thrashed out by the European Union (EU) in  negotiations in Geneva. "The third parties are calling for  peace. They want a political solution. But which one? That  remains up in the air, because the fate of the three communities  in Bosnia does not lie entirely in their own hands. Foreign  forces are becoming more and more in evidence in the Balkans,"  warned the minister.    The Muslims, in particular, are bending to such influence,  he  said a little later. Who did he mean by "foreign forces"? The  United States, among others, it would seem, who have taken the  initiative away from the EU. "But also the Turks, Iranians,  Saudi Arabia, all those who finance the Muslims and back them in  pursuing the idea of a unified Bosnia," he said.    The Bosnian Serbs have good intentions, emphasized  Jovanovic.  They are prepared to live in a loose union of three republics  [losse Bosnische unie van drie republieken], but they cannot go  any further than that. On top of this, they are demanding  guarantees and clarity. For instance, what form will that  confederation with Croatia take?  <H5>  Link </H5>   Jovanovic replied negative when asked whether Bosnia might  not become some form of link in the long term, the beginning of  another new, loose, "Yugoslavia-type structure." "After  everything that has happened, that is difficult to imagine," he  said. Slovenians, Croats, and Muslims are afflicted with a kind  of "anti-Yugoslavia" syndrome, stoked up by anti-Serbian  propaganda from abroad. The problem lies with them, not  Yugoslavia.    The minister also sees progress being made in Croatia  concerning the problem affecting a part of the Serbian minority  that declared its own independent state, the "Serbian republic  of Krajina." The Croatian Serbs are due to start negotiations  in Zagreb on Tuesday. "I expect them to come up with a positive  result," Jovanovic said.    That solution will probably have to be approached in stages.  "First of all, the hostilities must be brought to an end. Then,  life must be allowed to return to normal again. Only when all  that has been achieved can we proceed to the third, and most  difficult, phase, i.e., embarking on political negotiations."  The minister did not wish to speculate as to how the final  outcome might look. "The result will have to be one achieved on  the basis of a genuine consensus," he said.    Does the question of the Albanian majority in the Serbian  province of Kosovo not threaten to rear its ugly head as soon as  the situation in Croatia and Bosnia has stabilized? "That is a  pipe dream of those who like fishing in troubled waters,"  Jovanovic said. "Kosovo is a different problem, one which has  nothing to do with the Yugoslav crisis. Anyone who seeks to  create an artificial link between that crisis and Kosovo is  merely seeking to blackmail Yugoslavia and Serbia," he argued.  "Kosovo is a classic problem of a national minority striving  for separatism. The problem has to be solved accordingly.    A national minority has no right to its own state. Anyone  who tolerates that is playing with fire. Because that would  mean that the same principle could be applied in a number of  other regions of Europe," he concluded.</p>

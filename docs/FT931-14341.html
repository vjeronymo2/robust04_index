			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Aberdeen Trust cuts final dividend Aberdeen Trust, the investment and unit trust management group, raised pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.76m in the year to September 30, against Pounds 1.23m struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 1.36m. Despite net attributable profits ahead at Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 851,000) and earnings per share at 1.53p (1.45p), the final dividend is cut from 1.5p to 0.5p making a total of 1.5p (2.5p). The company said it believed that dividends had previously been maintained at an unsustainable level and now wished to adopt a long-term policy capable of producing growth. It believed that a period of consolidation was appropriate to enable it to develop investment activities and to maximise operating profits. A rationalisation programme had been commenced which would significantly reduce overheads.</p>

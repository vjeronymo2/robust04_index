			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: Investcorp pays Dollars 375m for Circle K business CIRCLE K, the Arizona-based convenience store chain, has signed a definitive agreement for the sale of its business to CK Acquisitions, an investor group led by Bahrain-based Investcorp. The price tag, however, is only Dollars 375m, compared with Dollars 425m envisaged under a preliminary accord three months ago. Circle K filed for bankruptcy protection over two years ago, and the deal is subject to approvals from both the bankruptcy court and the company's creditors. The preliminary agreement was opposed by the official bondholders' committee at Circle K, although three other creditor groups have already said that they support the revised deal. Circle K operates some 3,400 convenience stores in 32 states. Investcorp and its partners, meanwhile, have built up significant retail interests in the US - most notably, acquiring Saks Fifth Avenue, the department store chain, from Britain's BAT Industries. Child World, the ailing toy retailer which is also operating under the protection of Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code, has petitioned the courts for permission to liquidate stocks and close remaining stores. The company said it was in talks with Lionel Corporation about merging the two companies' businesses, but that in the absence of an agreement, it expects to initiate going-out-of-business sales 'within a short period of time'. A bankruptcy court hearing has been set for June 15.</p>

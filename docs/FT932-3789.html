			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Miyazawa defends global trading role MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday firmly rejected any new boost for the Japanese economy, and, at a time of tension with the US over Japan's huge trade surplus, robustly defended his country's role in the global trading system. He said he believed Japan was on the road to recovery, with the fiscal stimulus packages of April and last August 'more than sufficient to help Japan's economy back on track'. Japan was just as open to imports as the US and EC, he said, and was contributing most towards the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. While expressing confidence that over time the market economy system would bring prosperity in the post-Cold War world, he was doubtful about the future of Russia and other former Soviet republics. 'No one is quite sure if the former Soviet Union will be democratic and will have a market economy,' he said. Aid for Russia would be the biggest issue at the July 7-9 economic summit of the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations in Tokyo, he predicted. At the same time, Mr Miyazawa promised that Japan would play a bigger role in world affairs, especially through the United Nations. But while Japan would like to be invited to join the UN Security Council as a permanent member, it 'would not campaign' for such a position. 'It is not a question for Japan alone,' the prime minister observed. 'If we take a strong approach, we might hamper the functioning of the Security Council.' Japan realised that achieving its goal, which is supported by the US but likely to be opposed by other Security Council members, would be a 'very long process,' he said. Looking sprightly and cracking an occasional joke, the 73-year-old leader pointed out that Japan's most recent Dollars 116bn (Pounds 76bn) economic stimulus package was seven times the size of president Bill Clinton's programme to boost the US economy, and, unlike the US measures, had passed their parliamentary hurdle. On trade, virtually the only issue standing between Japan and a successful settlement of the Uruguay Round was its protecting of rice growers which was 'not supposed to be a major issue for either the US and Europe,' he said. To promote a Uruguay Round market access agreement in time for the Tokyo summit, Japan had offered tariff concessions on 770 manufactured items and was prepared to cut its average tariff to 1.5 per cent from 3.6 per cent. The prime minister cited International Monetary Fund figures to show that Japan imported as much per head as the US or the EC: some Dollars 1,900 in 1991 against Dollars 2,000 for the US and Dollars 1,800 for the EC from non-Community countries. Japan was not a 'fortress' Mr Miyazawa insisted. Nor would east Asia become a fortress, because the economies and societies in the area were too diverse. Indeed, Mr Miyazawa took a relatively sanguine view of the emergence of regional trading blocs. Neither the EC nor the North American Free Trade Area (Nafta) would turn into economic fortresses because of the power of modern global communications to prevent this. However, he voiced one concern held strongly in Japanese business circles. European integration and the disappearance of internal barriers in the EC had created problems for Japan, he said. Restrictions were being placed on European car imports 'which were against the spirit of market integration in Europe,' he said. This was a 'problem we may have to sit with for a little while.' He promised that, at the Tokyo summit, Japan would raise by about 50 per cent its overseas development assistance and the so-called recycling resources - loans, guarantees and export credits - made available to developing countries. The increased spending plans would replace aid and loan allocations that have totalled about Dollars 50bn over the past five years. The prime minister said Japan 'must contribute as much as possible' to issues such as arms control and disarmament and in international efforts to deal with the problems of refugees, disease and the environment.</p>

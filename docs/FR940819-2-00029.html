			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> RIMA responded to our questionnaire and to each of our requests for supplemental information. Therefore, we have determined that RIMA attempted to cooperate, even though it was unable to substantiate much of the information contained in its COP/CV response. Since RIMA attempted to cooperate, we have applied a rate of 91.06 percent, the highest rate ever applicable to RIMA for the subject merchandise (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Silicon Metal from Brazil, Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 56 FR 26972, June 12, 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 25:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners contend that it is the Department's established practice to exclude from the dumping calculations sales that were sold during the review period but shipped outside the period of review. Because Eletrosilex's only sale was shipped after the close of this review period, petitioners argue that Eletrosilex had no sales subject to review for the current 1991&hyph;1992 administrative review. Petitioners contend that the Department should maintain the 91.06 percent all others rate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eletrosilex since this constitutes the most recent information available for Eletrosilex. Petitioners note that in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Asahi Chemical Indus. Co., Ltd.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 585 F. Supp 1261, 1267 (CIT 1982), the CIT held that when there were no shipments during the period of review, the Department uses the most recent information to determine margins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree. Section 353.22(b) of our regulations stipulates that administrative reviews ``normally will cover, as appropriate, entries or sales of the merchandise during the 12 months immediately preceding the most recent anniversary month.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We based this review upon sales because (1) the selling price and each of the expenses associated with this sale were known by Eletrosilex and reported to the Department at an early stage of the review process, and (2) use of this sale in our margin calculations constitutes the most accurate reflection of Eletrosilex's pricing practices during the review period. Moreover, we note that we have based some other administrative reviews upon sales rather than entries (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Portable Electric Typewriters from Japan, Final Results of Administrative Review,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 56 FR 56393, 53697, November 4, 1991, and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gray Portland Cement and Clinker from Japan, Final Results of Administrative Review,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR 48826, 48832, September 20, 1993). Finally, we note that the question addressed in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Asahi  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> was whether we could conduct an administrative review in the absence of exports, entries or sales during the period of review. In this case, Eletrosilex clearly had sales during the period of review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 26:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CBCC and RIMA contend that the Department violated the statute and the regulations by failing to publish the final results of review by July 31, 1993. CBCC and RIMA note that section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act stipulates that the Department will issue a final determination ``(A)t least once during each 12-month period'', and that &sect;353.22(c)(7) of the regulations indicates that the Department will publish a final determination ``not later than 365 days after the anniversary month.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CBCC and RIMA contend that the Department abused its discretion by conducting a verification of sales and cost data since these verifications further delayed the issuance of the final results. CBCC and RIMA suggest that the final results should be based upon the record that existed on July 31, 1993, and that the record at that time indicated no dumping margins for either company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree. The CIT has determined that the completion of administrative reviews within the one-year time period is ``directory'' rather than ``mandatory'' (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Koyo Seiko Co.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 796 F. Supp. 517,523 (CIT 1992)). While we strive to complete administrative reviews within a year, the issuance of our final results is sometimes delayed by other regulatory and statutory requirements associated with the administration of the antidumping law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this case, petitioners demonstrated that ``good cause'' existed for verification pursuant to 19 C.F.R. &sect;353.22(c) and 353.36(a). Specifically, petitioners noted potential deficiencies in the replacement cost data provided by CBCC and RIMA. Because ``good cause'' existed for verification, our decision to verify the COP responses of CBCC and RIMA was appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 27:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Minasligas indicates that it agrees with the statement in the Department's cost verification report (December 17, 1993) that an allocation of direct and indirect labor, maintenance, and other overhead items based upon production quantity would result in lower fabrication charges than those reported in its questionnaire response. (Minasligas allocated these charges on the number of furnaces in its COP/CV response.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

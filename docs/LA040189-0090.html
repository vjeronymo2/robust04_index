			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DINAH SHORE GOLF TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> INKSTER ISN'T ENJOYING ROLE AS FRONT-RUNNER  </P> <P> Juli Inkster says it's extremely hard to win a tournament as a front-runner,  adding, "That's why I can't watch the leader board."  </P> <P> Others in the field of the $500,000 LPGA Nabisco Dinah Shore tournament at  Mission Hills Country Club might disagree.  </P> <P> Inkster is threatening to run away with the tournament. She shot a 69 Friday  after a first-round 66 Thursday and is nine under par after 36 holes.  </P> <P> More significant, she has a four-shot lead over Beth Daniel, her closest  pursuer.  </P> <P> The desert heat hasn't taken its toll on Inkster, 28, who won the Dinah Shore  tournament in 1984.  </P> <P> "On the back side I was tired, but it wasn't the sun," Inkster said. "I just  have a cold, but I had a lot of fluids and stayed relaxed."  </P> <P> Starting on the 10th tee, Inkster quickly extended her two-shot lead with  birdies on the 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th holes. She had a bogey at the 15th  hole, but birdied the 17th for a score of 32 at the turn, and then had two  bogeys and a birdie at No. 4 on her back side.  </P> <P> "I played really well today," Inkster said. "I made some putts and hit a lot of  greens. I was aggressive and confident.  </P> <P> "It's good when you can shoot 66 and then come back and shoot in the 60s  again."  </P> <P> Inkster said that her caddy, Worth Blackwelder, husband of Myra Blackwelder,  who is in the field, told her to stay relaxed with his soothing Southern  accent.  </P> <P> "He's from Kentucky, but he is a real Duke fan," Inkster said. "He kept telling  me, 'Coach K (Duke basketball Coach Mike Krzyzewski) would say to remain calm,  plug away and not put on the full-court press yet."  </P> <P> Inkster is, of course, aware that she has a substantial lead, but she doesn't  want to dwell on it.  </P> <P> "No tournament is ever a runaway," she said. "I'm going to play like I'm trying  to catch up, instead of being ahead."  </P> <P> Inkster's husband, Brian, the pro at the Los Altos Country Club, is in the  gallery. But he's trying to stay away from his wife.  </P> <P> "Brian stays as far away from me as he can," Inkster said. "He's a hole ahead  of me. He's my No. 1 fan and supporter whether I do good or bad. He's also my  teacher."  </P> <P> Inkster has 11 career victories, three last year, since she joined the tour in  1983. When she won here in 1984, she beat Pat Bradley in a sudden death  playoff.  </P> <P> That tournament is distinguished for NBC-TV halting play for about 10 minutes  because the women were playing too fast.  </P> <P> Bradley, a leader at the time, was fuming, eventually losing to Inkster in the  playoff.  </P> <P> Inkster was 10 under par Friday when she reached the par-four seventh hole. Her  drive strayed to the right, landing in the rough in front of a fairway bunker,  about 170 yards from the green. Then, she hit a six-iron that found the green,  where she two-putted for her par on the 383-yard hole.  </P> <P> She lost a stroke on the par-three, 166-yard eighth hole by three-putting.  However, she recovered to get her par on the 508-yard ninth hole.  </P> <P> "When I've won I've usually done it by coming from behind," Inkster said. "I'm  very much of a momentum player and it takes me a while to get going."  </P> <P> Daniel, who shot a two-under 70 for a 36-hole total of 139, said she was shaky  at the outset of her round and uncomfortable.  </P> <P> She had reason to be after getting a double bogey on the third hole, a par-four  of 406 yards.  </P> <P> "From that hole on I played four under par," Daniel said. "It (the round) could  have been disastrous."  </P> <P> Daniel, who is battling a viral infection, said she still has a fever, adding,  "The heat isn't helping matters."  </P> <P> Asked why no one is apparently charging at the leader, Daniel said: "I thought  the course played extremely difficult today. The pin placements were much  tougher.  </P> <P> "Also, Juli has a history of playing well in majors. They turn her on."  </P> <P> However, Daniel doesn't believe that Inkster's four-stroke lead is  insurmountable.  </P> <P> "Not the way this course is playing," she said. "On one day if you're not  hitting your driver well and hit it into the rough, you'd have a tough time  putting it on the green."  </P> <P> Daniel also said that it's an advantage to follow an afternoon round with a  morning round as Inkster has done because momentum can be sustained.  </P> <P> Daniel will be playing with Inkster today and she says she'll ignore the  leader.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to sit and watch her and be in awe," Daniel said. "I don't  normally watch other people in my group."  </P> <P> Golf Notes  </P> <P> Amy Alcott, the defending champion, faltered to a 78 Friday after shooting a 71  (149) Thursday. . . . Nancy Lopez is at 147 (72-75). . . . Tammy Green, who  shot a 68 for a 36-hole total of 140, is alone in third place.  </P></p>

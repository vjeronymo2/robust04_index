			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Indonesians ask Tokyo to open up markets JAPAN'S prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, arrived in Jakarta yesterday on the first leg of a south-east Asian tour and was immediately urged to open up his country's economy, Reuter reports. An editorial in the Jakarta Post yesterday called for stronger Japanese assurances backed by action to remove tarriff barriers. President Suharto was expected to raise the issue of high tariffs on Indonesian plywood, one of the country's biggest exports, in formal talks with Mr Miyazawa today. Tokyo officials said Mr Miyazawa would stress the importance of a continuing US military presence in the region in his talks in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Brunei. This would be the thrust of a keynote speech he would make in Bangkok on Saturday, they said. Sanyo Electric of Japan yesterday announced a Dollars 27m (Pounds 17.7m) joint venture to manufacture refrigerator compressors in Indonesia, Robert Thomson writes from Tokyo. Sanyo will provide 90 per cent of the capital for PT Sanyo Compressor Indonesia, to be based in West Java. The remaining 10 per cent will be held by two local private investors. 'We will establish this company in response to growing worldwide demand for small-sized reciprocating compressors,' Sanyo said. 'Indonesia is a large market, and the labour resources are excellent so we decided to build the new factory here.' Production is expected to begin in June next year, with initial annual production of 400,000 units, rising to 1.2m over five years. The new company will eventually have about 440 employees. Sanyo already has compressor plants in Thailand, Singapore and Taiwan, and three subsidiaries in Indonesia manufacture televisions, batteries, and electronic components.</p>

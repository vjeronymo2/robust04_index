			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Investors who need income / A look at the snags For many investors, a decent income is a priority - but getting one has become increasingly difficult since the steep fall in interest rates over the past 18 months. Providers are finding the going tough, too. This week, Hypo F&amp;C's High Income unit trust, which has pulled in more than Pounds 500m since its launch on the back of an offer to pay an annual 10 per cent, said it would cut the payout to 9 per cent from June (see Serious Money on page II). Since the launch of the trust in February 1993, there have been two cuts in base rates, taking them from 6 per cent to 5.25 per cent. British interest rates are bottoming out, but many experts believe there will be another rate cut this year. This would make it even harder for income-seekers to live off their savings. There are any number of products designed to meet the need for income, but they can be divided into three types of investment: cash, bonds and equities. Deposits We list the highest bank and building society rates weekly in our highest rates table (page VIII). The highest returns are on the larger deposits. Norwich &amp; Peterborough's postal account is paying 7 per cent gross on Pounds 60,000, while some notice accounts will pay similar rates on smaller amounts. Rates are low for those with savings under Pounds 5,000: Halifax, the largest building society, is paying just 3.5 per cent gross on Pounds 1,000 and 3.75 per cent gross on Pounds 2,500. Postal accounts tend to pay the higher rates - but although they are described as instant access, it will usually take a week before you can get your hands on the cash. The trouble with chasing rates is that they can change rapidly. And they will fall again if base rates are cut once more. Moreover, although most people think of a society as 'safe', because the nominal value of its capital remains the same, they tend to ignore the effect of inflation on that capital. This is not as great a problem today, with the retail price index rising at 2.5 per cent in the year to January, but even at 4 per cent - the top of the government's target range - the value of money halves in 18 years. The chart (right) shows how significant the effect of inflation can be in determining the real rate of return. Bonds These are the traditional investment for income-seekers in most countries. At Thursday's close, the redemption yield on UK government bonds, also known as gilts, was 6.67 per cent over five years and 7.33 per cent over 10 years. Riskier bonds, such as those issued by companies and some foreign governments, will pay higher yields. The drawback with bonds is that you run the risk of capital loss if their price falls. And, if you buy a gilt for more than face value, you are certain of a loss if you hold it until maturity. Equities Over the long term, equities give protection against inflation and offer the potential for much higher capital gains than from cash or bonds. But the volatility of the markets means you cannot regard equities as a straightforward alternative to a building society. The present yield on the FT-SE-A All-Share index is only around 3.5 per cent; but by choosing companies which pay higher dividends, such as utilities, you can achieve higher rates. Income shares of split-capital investment trusts are aimed specifically at income-seekers. Instead of issuing just one type of ordinary share, split-capital trusts issue two or more types; these lay claim to different parts of each trust's assets and dividends. Income shares receive the majority of the trust's dividends but are at the back of the queue for capital gains. At present, they have an average yield of about 11.6 per cent. But they carry the risk - in some cases, the certainty - of capital loss. The total return theory The most common way to seek an income is to look for investments with the highest interest rates; the snag is that, usually, the highest returns are found on the riskiest investments. But those people with large portfolios and a firm grip on their finances can afford to think about income in a different way. By investing for total return - both income and capital growth - they can take some of the annual growth as income, with the advantage that it will be taxed as capital gain. If the amount taken falls within their capital gains tax allowance of Pounds 5,800 (Pounds 11,600 for a married couple), there is no CGT to pay. Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services, says: 'Assume that someone has invested Pounds 10,000 in 10 Pounds 1,000 shares and, after one year, the value has increased to Pounds 15,000. Now let us assume that he has not used his CGT allowance but wishes to enjoy 'income' of Pounds 1,500. He sells one share for Pounds 1,500, of which Pounds 1,000 is the original capital and Pounds 500 is gain. The Pounds 500 would not be subject to tax (since it falls within his CGT allowance) and so the whole Pounds 1,500 would be tax-free in his hands.' Robin Angus, director of equities at NatWest Securities, is another enthusiast about the total return theory. In the company's latest Investment Trust Annual Review, he writes: 'I simply cannot understand why people chase income through buying investment products offering fancy yields when, through investing for total return and realising some of their capital gains, they could satisfy their financial needs while getting a higher total return and paying less tax into the bargain.' The danger with turning capital into income is that you can overdo it. You could simply be returning capital to yourself in the form of income. For the system to work, the investment needs to grow at least as much as the amount being taken out annually. Furthermore, dealing costs will reduce the return. There are packaged products making use of the idea. Ivory &amp; Sime has an investment trust which makes use of the annual CGT exemption. The trust sells a proportion of an investor's holding automatically each year in order to generate monthly income. The first Pounds 5,800 of income from these sales is tax-free. The net asset value of the trust increased by 16.9 per cent in the six months to its year-end on December 31, and the board has decided it can afford to increase the annual return from 7 to 7.15 per cent from April. James Capel's Generator personal equity plan, and Newton's Distributor fund, are unit trusts which allow the investor to choose the annual level of income they withdraw up to a maximum of 9 per cent (Newton) and 7.5 per cent (Capel). Both aim to replace the capital withdrawn but cannot guarantee to do. By investing through a Pep, the investor does not need to worry about CGT or income tax but faces initial and annual charges of 5.25 per cent and 1 per cent (Capel) and 6 per cent and 1.5 per cent (Newton). The advantage of these Peps is that, theoretically, the investor is in control so that, if the stock market falls, he can stop taking income in order to minimise capital erosion. The danger is that he becomes dependent on the income stream. The total return theory works in a rising market or if capital gain has built up untouched over the years. But great care is needed not to withdraw too much capital, undermining the scope for future growth.</p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Michael Prowse on America: Just do it, Mr Clinton The weeks before inauguration are a magical time for presidents-in-waiting. Like a student preparing for college, Mr Bill Clinton has been revelling in the opportunities lying ahead. On the economy, however, the time for tough decisions has arrived. On Wednesday he is expected to name his economic team. Next week droves of economists, businessmen and policy-junkies will converge on Little Rock for a televised 'economic summit'. Shortly thereafter, Mr Clinton is expected to outline his strategy for economic renewal before starting lengthy negotiations with congressional leaders. The laudable aim is to have legislation ready for enactment soon after he assumes power in the new year. Top congressional Democrats now seem likely to gain prominent economic posts in the Clinton administration. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Texan head of the Senate finance committee, is all but certain to become treasury secretary. Mr Leon Panatta, chairman of the House budget committee, is a strong contender for budget director. Such appointments would be a shrewd way of ensuring a smooth passage for delicate economic and social legislation: congressional leaders are far more likely to co-operate with respected former colleagues than with outsiders brought in from Wall Street or business. But in the long run policies matter more than personalities. On economics, the big question is whether Mr Clinton can keep his eye on medium-term structural problems. A succession of respected bodies, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and - in Washington - the Brookings Institution, have urged Mr Clinton to take tough action to raise the national savings rate, which fell to a disastrous 2.5 per cent of national income under the Republicans, compared with about 8 per cent in previous decades and an average of 10 per cent in other industrial countries. Domestic savings and investment rates can diverge a lot in the short run. The link between investment and growth is equally obscure over short periods. But in the long run, a country that does not save or invest much cannot grow much. There is no escaping this fundamental logic. Nor can it be denied that a decade of huge budget deficits - negative saving by the public sector - has done more than anything else to erode US savings. Economic historians will judge Mr Clinton less on his pet projects, such as new student loan schemes, than on his success in restoring budgetary sanity in Washington. Fortunately, the path toward budget retrenchment is being smoothed by signs that the economic recovery is taking firmer hold. On Friday, the Labour Department reported the fifth consecutive monthly decline in the unemployment rate - to 7.2 per cent, enviably low by European standards. Employment, factory overtime and the length of the average work-week all rose significantly, pointing to a solid increase in industrial production last month. Friday's employment report followed a run of sparkling numbers. Consumer confidence, factory orders, retail sales, leading indicators, the Purchasing Managers' Index, money supply growth and bank lending are all rising, in some cases substantially. Revised figures for the third quarter showed the economy expanding at an annual rate of 3.9 per cent, by far the best result since the Reagan years. On close inspection, most of these numbers are overstating the economy's strength. Most of the fall in unemployment since June, for example, reflects a shrinking workforce; job gains, so far, are tiny. Consumer confidence usually rebounds after elections and is still far below levels normal for a vigorous recovery. The rise in factory orders was concentrated in volatile sectors such as defence and transport. Consumption has been temporarily lifted by a decline in the personal savings rate from already low levels. Export figures do not yet reflect declining demand in Japan and Europe. Yet the fact remains that the US is enjoying its seventh straight quarter of growth, in stark contrast to the experience of most other countries. The economy is expanding at an underlying rate of about 2 per cent and seems more likely to gather momentum than to relapse into another semi-recession. Much of Mr Clinton's campaign rhetoric is thus out-of-date. The case for a short-term fiscal stimulus to 'grow' the economy was always weak; anything more than a symbolic package would now be irresponsible. Mr Clinton's original plan was to match spending increases (on education and infrastructure) with tax increases and spending cuts, thus allowing the deficit to decline a little as economic growth picked up. With the economy strengthening of its own accord, this now looks insufficiently ambitious. Coming into office as a business cycle upswing gets under way, Mr Clinton should seize a golden opportunity to raise the national savings rate sharply by progressively cutting the deficit to zero. As the OECD and others have pointed out, this does not require an exceptional effort, merely fiscal measures commonplace in other countries, such as realistic controls on healthcare costs, a scaling back of 'middle class' welfare benefits and modest increases in energy and consumption taxes.</p>

			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> POPULAR PUB TO REOPEN  </P> <P> The former Loch Ness Monster Pub, an Old Pasadena counterculture institution  closed for the past three months, will reopen Friday under a new name,  according to the new owners, Martita Titus and Art Jong.  </P> <P> The bar, renamed the Old Pasadena Pub, was to have opened last Friday.  </P> <P> But fire inspectors paid a surprise visit and ordered a number of violations  corrected, including widening the hallway, installing panic doors on the exits  and repositioning a wrought iron gate to swing in the opposite direction, Titus  said.  </P> <P> The pub's previous owners, who closed up shop three months ago in a rent  dispute with the building's owner, could not be reached for comment. Jong said  the old owners have told him they plan to reopen elsewhere in Old Pasadena.  </P> <P> Titus promises the Old Pasadena Pub will offer the same ambience -- darts,  dancing and music by Snotty Scotty and The Hankies -- that made the Loch Ness a  local legend at the corner of Union Street and Fair Oaks Avenue.  </P></p>

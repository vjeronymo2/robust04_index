			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cash-starved bauxite association to soldier on Members of the International Bauxite Association have agreed to continue the producers' group, despite mounting financial problems because of the failure of some to meet their obligations. The association, which has its headquarters in Jamaica, has been forced to scale down its operations and cut back its staff over the past two years because of the withdrawal of Australia, the world's largest producer, and the increasing delinquency by some members. A recent meeting of officials from most of the nine member countries agreed not to phase out the IBA, concluding that the aims of the organisation were still relevant, said Mr Robert Pickersgill, Jamaica's mining minister. The delinquent members have agreed to settle all arrears. The IBA was established 20 years ago and has been acting as a data bank for its members, allowing them to exchange information and ideas on the state of the industry. Members once accounted for about 85 per cent of the western world's bauxite production, while contributing 54 per cent of alumina (aluminium oxide) production and 18 per cent of primary aluminium output. The association lists its members as Ghana, Guinea, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Sierra Leone, Surinam, and Yugoslavia. Mr Nenad Altman, the secretary general, said recently that membership was open to the states of former Yugoslavia.</p>

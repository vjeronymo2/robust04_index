			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Cooperation Through Joint Scientific </F> Projects"]    [Text] Branko Crvenkovski, prime minister for Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FRYOM], yesterday  received an Albanian Government delegation headed by the  president of the Committee for Science and Technology, Maxim  Konomi.    The meeting emphasized the satisfaction with the action  taken  to promote cooperation between the two countries through the  Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation that will  be signed by Macedonian Science Minister Aslan Selmani and  Konomi.    It was concluded that this agreement was very important for  promoting cooperation in the area of science as a basis for  cooperation in more important areas of mutual interest for the  two countries. The possibilities for cooperation envisaged in  the agreement open the road to bilateral and multilateral  cooperation between the two states, as well as cooperation among  the countries in the Balkans, Europe, and the world. Regional  scientific projects are the main projects for which financing is  envisaged by the European Union and the United Nations, above  all traffic, economic, energy, information, and ecology programs.    Yesterday, the Albanian delegation also had a meeting with  the president of the Macedonian Academy of Science and Arts,  Ksente Bogoev. Interest in cooperation between the two  academies was expressed, as well as general readiness to  organize a meeting of the delegations of the academies in Skopje  and Tirana. Cooperation can be also implemented by organizing a  scientific symposium on the ecological protection of Lake Ohrid,  which is of great significance for both countries.    Frederika Popovska-Pavlovska, vice president of St. Cyril  and  Methodius University and responsible for international  cooperation, informed the guests from Albania about the  organization in our universities. She expressed interest in  cooperation at university level, and also at the level of  particular faculties and scientific institutions, which will  enable cooperation on the level of teaching and scientific  personnel through joint scientific projects. Interest was also  expressed in including the two countries in the TEMPUS and  KOPERNIKUS programs, which involve cooperation among higher  educational institutions.</p>

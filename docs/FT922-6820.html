			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: US buyer for ASH's surveillance division AUTOMATED Security (Holdings), which supplies burglar alarms and other security products, is selling its electronic and television surveillance wing to a US company for Pounds 150m. The loss prevention business, which includes till monitoring to prevent theft by shop staff and the new TVX system using a tiny video camera, is being sold to Sensormatic, a supplier of electronic security systems listed on the New York stock exchange. It is acquiring a business that made Pounds 11.1m trading profit last year on sales of Pounds 60.2m. Net assets before the deduction of borrowings were Pounds 68.5m in November. It is being sold debt-free. ASH previously tried to float off this wing. More recently, it tried to sell part of the leasing portfolio to reduce debt. The cash consumptive nature of the business had raised concern among analysts. Mr Tom Buffett, chairman, said the sale would wipe out the group's debt and 'take away balance sheet concerns'. At the end of November, ASH's net borrowings were Pounds 95m. The group still has about Pounds 60m of convertible capital bonds. ASH made Pounds 23.2m pre-tax profit last year and the first fall in 19 years came as a shock to the market, further undermining the share price. This had fallen from more than 300p two years ago to 81p in March. The recovery continued yesterday with an 11p rise, though the announcement did not come until after the market closed. ASH's remaining security systems business made a trading profit of Pounds 35.1m on sales of Pounds 119m last year. The deal should lift the interest burden on the remaining business. Mr Buffett said the deal marked an alliance between the two groups. He would become non-executive vice-chairman of Sensormatic. The initial payment of Pounds 50m cash is expected to be followed by another Pounds 100m from the proceeds of a public offering of securities by Sensormatic.</p>

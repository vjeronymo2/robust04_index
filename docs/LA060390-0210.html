			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON BEACH COUNCIL MAY USE BED TAX TO OFFSET BOND COSTS  </P> <P> The City Council will consider a plan Monday that may help defray the cost of a  $20-million bond for which the city is obligated to help pay for a sprawling  seaside redevelopment resort project.  </P> <P> City planners have proposed that the city hire a consultant to study how much  bed-tax revenue can be raised at four hotels planned at the ongoing Waterfront  project to help repay such a bond.  </P> <P> A 10% tax is charged on all hotel and motel rooms in the city, of which 6% goes  into the Redevelopment Agency fund.  </P> <P> Under the Waterfront proposal, the redevelopment portion of the tax would go  toward repaying the bond.  </P> <P> The proposed method of payment "is rather unusual," Deputy City Administrator  Robert Franz said.  </P> <P> But city officials favor it as a way of trimming the amount of money the agency  will have to pay from tax-increment revenues to repay the bond.  </P> <P> The bed-tax study, which would take a month or two to complete, would determine  how much the agency could save on the bond, Franz said.  </P> <P> Council members will also consider a plan to enable the Waterfront owners to  lease Zack's concession stand, located on the beach across from the  development, for the next 10 years.  </P> <P> The 45-acre hotel project at Pacific Coast Highway and Beach Boulevard, which  also will include 800 condominiums, restaurants and shops, calls for a walkway  to connect the facilites with the beach, so owners want to tie the snack shop  into the development.  </P></p>

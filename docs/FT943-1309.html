			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Survey of Residential Property (6): Island refuge from cold, grey winter - Prices in the balmy Canaries and Madeira A growing number of Britons are taking their holidays in the sun not in the heat of summer but in cold, grey winter. For them, buying a winter holiday-home in a warm climate makes sense and they should be able to let at high season rates in summer. Spain's Canary Islands, off the north west coast of Africa, are favourites. Breezes keep them from being too hot and the temperature changes little throughout the year. Of the seven major islands, Tenerife, the largest, is probably most popular. Its southern coast has beaches, golf courses - and most of the tourists. The north is damper and greener. There is plenty of choice of property. one resort in the south has apartments, villas, building plots and a country club with 17 tennis courts. The villas cost from Pounds 70,000 (Pta 14m) to Pounds 200,000, with garden and swimming pool. An interesting Canarian house halfway up a cliff looks down on the fishing village of La Caleta. It needs modernising but has scope for imaginative conversion, Pounds 28,000. UK agent Babet, in Somerset, can send details of these and many other homes on the island. Allow 7 per cent of the purchase price for legal costs. Since 1965, Chilcott White (Overseas) in Croydon, Surrey, has acted as selling agent for a Canarian landowner building groups of detached homes in Tenerife. Today it offers two to three-bedroom cliff-top properties in the north, close to the Orotava valley and eight miles from Puerto de la Cruz. These bungalows or split-level villas are built to order. Prices, with land, are about Pounds 40,000 to Pounds 50,000 (larger plots are available). A garage costs from Pounds 3,500, a swimming pool, Pounds 10,000. Add 30 per cent for purchase fees and taxes. Building takes six months. Gran Canaria, the third largest Canary island has long sandy beaches, which make it popular; pine forests and mountains. It also has areas of caves, both coastal and inland. Many become fascinating homes. Estate agent Sheena Gallagher, of Property Market, in Las Palmas, can offer a cave-house with sitting-room, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen. It is on mains electricity, 'but water comes naturally into an underground tank in winter.' The property has its own area of land and can be reached easily by car. The price is Pounds 50,000. This agency also has converted farms at around Pounds 350,000 and a number of old 'character' properties. One, at Pounds 35,000, has two bedrooms and a cellar, which is a cave. Another, built in 1670 and well cared-for, has four bedrooms, several out-houses and an artist's studio. It has attractive views. Price Pounds 145,000. North of the Canaries, the small Portuguese island of Madeira has a different character. The Canaries are tourist-orientated, Madeira has a more settled atmosphere and a faithful winter-sunshine following. It is a beautiful island, often called a floating garden - so much vegetation grows so easily in its mild climate, but it is short on beaches. Its image may have become dated, but Madeira is no longer the 'forgotten island'. EU money pours in to improve its roads and help it develop a new business status, with an offshore financial centre, free trade zone and much else. Owners of private yachts can benefit from Madeira's international shipping register, which offers a tax holiday until 2011. There is a good deal of property and land to be had, though the island does not advertise this much to the outside world. A third of the population lives in its capital Funchal, where prices are highest. Here, among new developments, are blocks of one to three bedroom apartments, from Pounds 53,000 to Pounds 110,000. These are offered by Ilhopredio, in Funchal, an estate agency run by John Rodrigues and his English associate, Michael White. Prices of existing properties range from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 240,000. 'The market is a little quieter but still buoyant and prices have settled,' says White. 'There is a thriving community of English, German, French and returning Portuguese from South Africa.' But the recession had reduced the number of buyers from Britain. Another Funchal agent, Ivo Pereira, belongs to a group building hotels and apartments. It is building apartments just outside Funchal. They are part of a project with its own swimming pool and are priced from Pounds 85,000. Information: Tenerife: Babet 0460 76213; Chilcott White 081-688 4151.

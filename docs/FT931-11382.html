			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Granada likely to cut 60 to 70 jobs GRANADA Television is expected to announce between 60 and 70 compulsory redundancies today among its programme-making staff. The company has already said it wants to shed between 250 and 300 jobs and last week accepted 120 redundancy applications. 'These are PA's, floor managers, stage managers - the people who make programmes,' said Ms Anne Rawcliffe-King, a national officer for Bectu, the broadcasting union. There are currently 894 permanent staff at Granada and Bectu says this will now fall to 650 even though the company has one of the largest programme contributions in the ITV network. The union believes that remaining Granada staff will be asked to accept a cut in basic wages even though the Granada Group recently announced a 129 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, up to Pounds 130m for the year to the end of September 1992.</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Construction Contracts: Japanese theatre complex SCHAL ASSOCIATES INC has won a contract for construction of a USDollars 450m (Pounds 260m) performing arts centre, the Second National Theatre, in Tokyo. The 741,000 sq ft five-storey building will include three separate theatres with a total of 3,500 seats. The largest theatre will feature a 1,900 seat auditorium for opera, similar in scale and style to classic European opera houses. Schal is constructing the building in a joint venture team headed by Takenaka, one of Japan's leading construction services companies. The arts centre is being built for the Japanese Ministry of Construction in the Shinjuku area of Tokyo. It is called the Second National Theatre because there is already an older National Theatre building used exclusively for traditional Japanese performing arts. The project was one of a number identified in bilateral trade agreements between the US and Japan as being open to foreign participation. Schal was the first US construction company to win a public works project in Japan under bilateral trade agreements and its current workload for Japanese clients includes the west wing of the Tokyo Telelecom Centre. Founded in 1976, Schal Associates is a world leader in construction services and a subsidiary of New York-based Bovis Inc, the US construction arm of P&amp;O.</p>

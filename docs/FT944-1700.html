			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Observer: Low note One of the latest additions to London's National Portrait Gallery - a Nigel Boonham sculpture of the English National Opera's former general director, Peter Jonas - doubtless looks very fine in the midst of its 20th century collection. But can that really have been its intended destination? Boonham, whose previous subjects include the Princess of Wales and Lord Runcie, was commissioned by the ENO to do a bronze of Jonas when the latter departed in the summer of last year. All quite normal - Jonas had been in situ for eight years, and had been widely regarded as a brilliant director. Before, that is, things tailed off towards the end. The sculpture had been finished for months before it mysteriously popped up at the NPG just recently. Hope Jonas, now installed at the Bavarian State Opera, won't act prima donna-ish about this minor shift of key . . .</p>

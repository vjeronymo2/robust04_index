			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Ouster of Kim Yong-sam Group From Power Urged" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- Cho Il-min, chief of  the Pyongyang mission of the South Korean National Democratic  Front (Hanminjon), issued a statement to the press on April 18  on the lapse of 34 years since the April 19 popular uprising.    The heroic April popular uprising involving patriotic  students and people of various strata of South Korea was a  historical event that marked a brilliant victory in the struggle  of the South Korean people to overthrow the Syngman Rhee  dictatorial "regime" and build a national independent government  free from subjugation and fascism, he said.    Pointing out that the colonial fascist repressive rule of  the  U.S. imperialists and their stooges is still in force in South  Korea contrary to the desire and aspirations of the valiant  participants in the April uprising, he said:    "We must kindle fierce flames of struggle once again to  bring  the second April 19 uprising to the land of South Korea and oust  the Kim Yong-sam group from power.    "Our Hanminjon will wage a more staunch struggle to drive  the  U.S. imperialist aggressors out of South Korea and liquidate  their colonial rule, holding higher the banner of independence  against the United States, in the van of the people of all  strata including students.    "For the present, we will expand the mass struggles against  the rice market opening, the introduction of Patriot missiles  and the resumption of the `Team Spirit' joint military exercises  and rapidly develop them into anti-war, anti-nuke, anti-American  struggles.    "We will certainly accomplish the cause of national  reunification in the 90s by smashing all the anti-nation and  anti-independence moves of the splittists at home and abroad,  upholding the banner of the 10-point programme of the great  unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country'  put forward by the great leader President Kim Il-song."</p>

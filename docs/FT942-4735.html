			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Laura Ashley's Pounds 1.2m for Maxmin Mr Jim Maxmin, the former chief executive of Laura Ashley, is to receive a Pounds 1.2m pay-off following his abrupt departure from the fashion retailer which he is widely credited with reviving. The news of Mr Maxmin's compensation package, which includes two years' salary and pension payments, was accompanied by the departure from the board of his protege, Ms Denise Lincoln, the human resources director. Further management changes are likely to be announced within the next few weeks, although it is not clear whether Mr Maxmin will be replaced. Mr Hugh Blakeway-Webb, who lives in the US and receives expenses of Pounds 1,000 a day, stepped up from non-executive to executive chairman following his departure. Mr Maxmin left Laura Ashley in April after what was described as a disagreement over investment priorities. It is understood that Mr Maxmin was pushing for greater investment in human resources, while the non-executives wanted to focus on retailing. The non-executives include Mr Takuya Okada of Aeon, the Japanese group which bailed out Laura Ashley with a Pounds 30m cash injection in 1990. Mr Maxmin was on a two-year rolling contract, with a salary of Pounds 399,000 (Dollars 590,000).</p>

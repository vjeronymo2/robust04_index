			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Sport: Horses for courses Last Wednesday, on Derby Day at Epsom racecourse, I became a social revolutionary. I was walking back to the grandstand from the paddock when I discovered that my way through was completely barred. Phalanxes of policemen had formed a square around an empty, open car and were holding up those who wished to pass. There was a clear path back to the grandstand but this - was through the Members' Enclosure. Here, too, the way was barred. After a few minutes of enforced immobility amid a throng of non-members, I confronted a security man. 'You have got to let us through that enclosure,' I said. No, he couldn't do that. We were not members. 'We have just as much right to be here as they have. You cannot stop us moving about the course just because somebody is leaving ..' 'The Queen is leaving,' he said, in a shocked and pompous tone. 'Listen,' I said, 'there are about a hundred of us and three of you. How are you going to stop us?' And, beckoning to the crowd behind me, I walked through the members' enclosure, past the morning dress, the millenary and the little badges that said 'We belong.' I probably made a ridiculous figure, getting fiery-eyed about my racegoer's rights; but I felt like Wat Tyler, marching my band of peasants upon the nobility. And yet not one of the people that I was fighting for followed me into the enclosure. They had, I think, been told too many times that they had no business being there. Most race meetings promote a glow of egalitarianism as all present submit themselves to the sport itself; they annihilate class differences. But the big occasion race meetings, those that attract the stars of royalty and their attendant satellites, just as surely propagate them. At the Derby, at Royal Ascot, I find that instead of thinking about horses, I am obsessively revolving around my mind the question of the English social structure. There are few better ways of spending an afternoon than in the atmosphere of worldly bonhomie which pervades, say, Newmarket or Goodwood; but the glamour meetings, which should be even more fun, are almost ruined by the fact that class, not racing, is the central issue. Last week's Derby Day crowd was playing up to its various class stereotypes for all they were worth. The non-members that I had tried to lead in revolution were swearing and shouting, wrenching the rings out of lager cans with formidable force and stripping off their shirts. One of them, a dangerously drunk girl in an unbuttoned suit, stumbled across the invisible electric fence which separated the grandstand from the members' enclosure. 'Rosie]' screamed her beleaguered beau, 'you can't go in there, you silly cow] You'll get banged up]' Meanwhile, the members were staring at Rosie as if she were a seaside donkey that had infiltrated the parade of Derby entrants in the paddock. There eyes were cold, full of conscious superiority. They were in, we were not, and they were loving it. Every time I fell among their rigorous tailcoats and the elliptical resonance of their squeak and bray, I felt diminished, down at heel, common as muck. Every time I emerged from their territory into the miasma of the grandstand, I felt like an aristocrat. Both feelings were completely absurd, yet temporarily both were real. In everyday circumstances - at an everyday race meeting - neither set of people would conduct themselves in such exaggerated fashion. But there is something about the segregation at these big events which has an almost fatalistic effect upon people, turning them into parodies of their class as if there was no other way that they could behave. You think we're hoi polloi? Right, mate, we'll give you hoi polloi. Upper class? Yes, my man, certainly we are upper class. It is impossible to expect anything else, given the difference in the way that members and non-members are treated. I have attended Royal Ascot both in and out of the enclosure, and I have seen the metamorphosis of the course officials from camp commandants to cap doffers. I accept that members have paid more money, and that for this they are entitled to a little more luxury, but not to be treated as superior beings. It used to be that all England would go to occasions like the Derby for the joy of experiencing the race itself. Now it seems that attendance is a more self-referential business, in which people reinforce meaningless ideas about themselves and play their part in a crude pageant. How silly this is; and how much it detracts from the event, which should be more important than the people that attend it. Especially an event which can produce a moment like the smooth explosion of acceleration from Erhaab as, his coat black and oily in the sun, he moved into a different dimension from the horses ahead of him: the moment when the obsession with top hats and baseball caps fled the mind of every person present.</p>

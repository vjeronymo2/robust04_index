			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Dealt a mixed hand: A look at the challenge before Jacques Santer Pity Mr Jacques Santer, next president of the European Commission. In the next few weeks, the affable Luxembourger must decide a division of portfolios, a thankless task which will produce few winners, many losers, and bruised egos all round. Mr Santer took soundings this week among fellow European prime ministers. From Lisbon to London, he heard pleas for special treatment; none louder than in Paris where the Balladur government had warned of the need to respect France's 'weight' in the European Union. The pressure must be faintly unsettling. Mr Santer never sought the top executive post in Europe, and only secured it on the say-so of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who saw the Franco-German candidate, Belgium's Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, fall to a British veto. 'This is Santer's first big test,' says a Commission official. 'It's a test of his grip on the new Commission and of his clout with member states.' Mr Santer inherits a demoralised Commission whose mission needs rethinking. His preparations for assuming the presidency on January 6 next year coincide, too, with debate on the shape and pace of European integration which may affect his team's composition. Spain insists the balance between north and south be preserved, despite likely enlargement of the EU next year to include Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway. Italy, too, was unnerved by the recent paper from the governing CDU/CSU coalition in Germany advocating a 'hard core' of five member states led by France, Germany and the Benelux countries. For its part, the UK is struggling to fend off French-led attacks on Sir Leon Brittan, the chief EU trade negotiator. The UK's obstructionism in Europe has weakened its bargaining position; but it is lobbying to persuade the Bonn government that keeping Sir Leon in charge of economic relations with central and eastern Europe would better serve German interests than would giving his portfolio to the protectionist-minded French. Mr Santer's greatest constraint is that he may inherit as many as seven Commissioners. Of them, Mr Martin Bangemann, the German industry commissioner, Mr Karel Van Miert, the Belgian competition policy commissioner, and Sir Leon are heavyweight 'barons of Brussels' who form a powerful old guard. In the summer, Mr Santer hinted incumbent commissioners might keep their present jobs, though he reserved the right to trim or reorganise their empires. Opinions differ on whether this was a shrewd or short-sighted move. 'Santer passed up the chance for a real shake-up of portfolios,' says an official who recalls that Mr Jacques Delors' first move in 1984 was to demand commissioners' resignations. But another long-serving official says Mr Santer's tolerance of the status quo was clever as it reduced scope for conflict. Allocating portfolios is the Commission president's most demonstrable power, but interference by member states renders it something of a fiction. The question is how far Mr Santer can pick a team in which talent is given due weight and the Commission's role as umpire, power-broker and policy catalyst is preserved. His first problem is that there are not enough good jobs to go around - even more so now that the number of commissioners is due to expand from 17 to 21 if the Scandinavians and Austrians join the EU next year. At most there are five top jobs and five medium-sized portfolios; the rest are consolation prizes. Trade and competition policy are in the top rank as they carry statutory powers and the authority to negotiate international agreements on behalf of member states. Hence the declaration of interest - some would say presumptuous - by Mr Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the French technocrat who served as adviser to a French commissioner in the early 1980s. Agriculture is also vital, not just because the Common Agricultural Policy accounts for half of the EU's Ecu70bn (Pounds 55bn) budget but because further CAP reform is crucial. Other attractive jobs include the economics portfolio (where the Commission has the right under the Maastricht treaty to recommend which countries qualify for monetary union), and industry (where Mr Bangemann wants to expand his telecommunications brief). Medium-sized jobs include environment (which might pass to an eco-conscious Swede); regional policy (for which Mr Neil Kinnock, the former UK Labour party leader may make a pitch); and social policy (a high-profile dossier to which Mr Padraig Flynn, the Irish commissioner, appears committed). Finally, there is the job of administering the single market. Many hope for someone more forceful than the incumbent, Italian diplomat Mr Vanni d'Archirafi. Mr Santer's aides are considering an expanded 'institutional affairs' portfolio to prepare for the 1996 inter-governmental conference to review Maastricht and liaison with the newly assertive European Parliament. There is also gossip about a new 'turbo-charged' transport portfolio overseeing proposed trans-European networks linking north and south, east and west through rail, telecommunications and gas pipelines. Transport may be offered to Mrs Edith Cresson, former French socialist prime minister. Best known for comparing Japanese workers to ants and her aspersions on the sexuality of the British male, she is awaited in Brussels with some trepidation. The most pressing problem remains reorganisation of the Commission. Mr Santer must decide whether to unscramble Mr Delors' most important innovation: the creation of a commissioner for external political affairs, currently Mr Hans van den Broek, former Dutch foreign minister. He must also decide how to improve co-ordination between commissioners, their cabinets and the career civil service. Without action, the bureaucracy will creak along with its duplications and petty infighting. The most vivid example is the turf-battle between Mr van den Broek and Sir Leon. It is a formidable challenge. Mr Santer might do well to ponder Mr Delors' response when told Greece wanted him to stay on for a few months while his succession was sorted out. 'Never again,' he said.</p>

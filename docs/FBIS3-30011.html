			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- The ruling coalition  parties and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) agreed  Thursday [24 February] on amendment of government-sponsored  political reform bills, political sources said. The two sides  are expected to jointly submit the amended package to the Diet  on Monday and the bills are likely to be approved by the House  of Representatives and the House of Councillors by Wednesday or  later, they said.    The two camps struck a deal Thursday on the last remaining  point of difference, when the coalition parties conceded to an  LDP demand to discuss giving political parties the status of a  juridical person, the sources said.    The LDP has called for the reform bills to state that  political parties have the status of a juridical person, saying  parties should be in a more responsible position because they  will be subsidized by the government under the package.    The coalition has opposed this, maintaining that freedom of  association under the Constitution may be violated if political  parties are obliged to have a juridical person's status.    The two sides agreed to keep discussing the matter and  conclude the debate by the time a bill on the locations of 300  single-seat constituencies for the lower house is presented to  the Diet, the sources said. The bill is expected to be  presented in the fall.    According to the package, 300 lower house will be elected  through a single-seat constituency system and the remaining 200  through a proportional representation system. Currently, lower  house members are elected from constituencies with two to six  seats.    The package was passed January 29 at the last extraordinary  session of the Diet, but some amendments and the date of  enforcement were removed from the package to get it through.    Shortly before the passage, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  and LDP President Yohei Kono agreed that the amendments and date  of enforcement will be discussed at the current ordinary session.</p>

During a closed  door session of the UN working group on the reform of the  Security Council, Hatano said he is taking "this opportunity to  emphasize once again Japan's firm determination in this regard."    Japanese diplomatic sources said Japan expects to have veto  power as a permanent security council member, although Hatano  did not elaborate on the veto issue during the meeting.    Hatano also proposed an increase in the number of  nonpermanent members of the Security Council from the current  10. The five permanent members are Britain, China, France,  Russia and the United States.    Britain has joined the United States in expressing support  for permanent UN Security Council seats for Japan and Germany.</p>

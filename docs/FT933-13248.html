			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Frontline's SKr420m issue fully taken up FRONTLINE, a Swedish shipping group, said yesterday it had placed new shares worth SKr420m (Dollars 58.3m) with a range of international investors to dispel uncertainty arising from its ownership structure and to bolster it against further weakness in world shipping markets. The group said the issue of 20m shares, which represented 46 per cent of the company's stock, was fully taken up by about 20 pension funds and other institutions in Norway, the UK and the US. The issue, handled by Fearnley Fonds of Norway, was priced at SKr21 per share. This compared with a buying price of SKr23 and a selling price of SKr29 on the Stockholm stock exchange just before the placement was announced. Frontline said no other shipping company was involved in the placement. The company had been the subject of some takeover speculation as two leading shareholders have signalled they will soon sell out their stakes. One, a Swedish wage-earners fund soon to be disbanded, held 30 per cent of Frontline before the new issue, and the second, Bilspedition, a Swedish transport group, held 10 per cent. Mr Kjell Jonson, the chief executive, said the share issue guaranteed that Frontline would be able to ride out any credit problems that might arise if shipping markets remained weak for the next three or four years. Frontline, with a fleet of about 20 ships, has invested heavily in the past two years in so-called OBO 170,000-tonne combined bulk/liquid carriers. It said it had pre-tax losses in the first six months of SKr120m after depreciation costs of SKr135m.</p>

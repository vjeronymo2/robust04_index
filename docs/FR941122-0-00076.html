			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Specific information on wolf reintroduction procedures can be found in Appendix 4, ``Scientific techniques for the reintroduction of wild wolves,'' in the EIS, ``The Reintroduction of Gray Wolves to Yellowstone National Park and Central Idaho'' (Service 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Status of Reintroduced Populations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 10(j) of the Act, wolves reintroduced into central Idaho are designated as a nonessential experimental. Such designation allows the wolves to be treated as a threatened species or species proposed for listing for the purposes of sections 4(d), 7, and 9 of the Act. This allows the Service to establish a less restrictive special rule rather than using the mandatory prohibitions covering endangered species. The biological status of the wolf and the need for management flexibility resulted in the Service designating the gray wolves reintroduced into central Idaho as ``nonessential.'' The Service determined that the ``nonessential'' designation, together with other protective measures, will conserve and recover the gray wolf in central Idaho and southwestern Montana.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is anticipated that released wolves will come into contact with humans and domestic animals inside and outside the central Idaho experimental population area. Public opinion surveys, public comments on wolf management planning, and the positions taken by elected local, State, and Federal government officials indicate that wolves should not be reintroduced without assurances that current uses of public and private lands will not be disrupted by wolf recovery activities. The following provisions respond to these concerns. There would be no violation of the Act for unintentional, nonnegligent, and accidental taking of wolves by the public, provided the take was incidental to otherwise lawful activities, did not result from negligent conduct lacking reasonable due care or was in defense of human life. Such wolf takings would need to be reported to the Service or other authorized agency within 24 hours. The Service may designate certain Federal, State, and/or tribal employees to take wolves that required special care or pose a threat to livestock or property. Private land owners or their designates would be permitted to harass wolves in an opportunistic noninjurious manner on their leases or private property, provided such harassment was reported within 7 days to the Service or other authorized agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the ``nonessential'' designation, private landowners or their designates would be permitted to take (injure or kill) a wolf in the act of wounding or killing livestock on private land. However, physical evidence (wounded or dead livestock) of such an attack would be required to document that the attack occurred simultaneously with the taking. A report of such a take would need to be immediately (within 24 hours) reported to the Service or other authorized agency for investigation. Once six or more breeding pairs are established in the experimental population area, livestock owners or their designates could receive a permit from a Service-designated agency to take (injure or kill) gray wolves that are attacking livestock on permitted public livestock grazing allotments. Such a take would be permitted only after due notification to Service designated agencies and unsuccessful capture efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wolves that repeatedly (two times in a calendar year) attacked domestic animals other than livestock (fowl, swine, goats, etc.) or pets (dogs or cats) on private land would be designated as problem wolves and relocated from the area by the Service or a designated agency. After one relocation, wolves that continued to depredate on domestic animals would be considered chronic problem wolves and would be removed from the wild.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is unlikely that wolf predation on big game populations would be a primary cause for failure of the States or tribes to meet their specific big game management objectives outside of the national parks and national wildlife refuges. The Service could, however, determine that wolves responsible for excessive depredation should be translocated to other sites in the experimental area. Such actions are expected to be rare and unlikely to impact the overall recovery rate. States and tribes would need to define such situations in their Service-approved wolf management plans before such actions could be taken. Under the nonessential designation, wolves could not be deliberately killed solely to resolve predation conflicts with big game.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The States of Montana and Idaho and potentially affected tribes will be encouraged to enter into cooperative agreements for management of the gray wolf outside of national parks and national wildlife refuges. These cooperative agreements would be reviewed annually by the Service to ensure that the States and tribes have adequate regulatory authority to conserve listed species, including the gray wolf. The National Park Service will be the primary agency implementing the experimental population rule inside the boundaries of national parks, while the States and tribes will be the primary agencies implementing this experimental population rule outside national parks and national wildlife refuges after their wolf management plans are approved by the Service. The Service will provide oversight, coordinate wolf recovery activities, and provide technical assistance. If the States and tribes do not assume wolf management responsibilities or adhere to provisions of their wolf management plans, the Service would assume management authority. If for unforeseen reasons the wolf population failed to sustain positive growth toward recovery levels for 2 consecutive years, the influencing factors would be identified. The Service and affected States and tribes would be responsible for determining if any management strategies need modification. The Service in coordination with the States and tribes would implement those strategies to ensure wolf population recovery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service finds that protective measures and management practices under this rulemaking are necessary and advisable for the conservation and recovery of the gray wolf and that no additional Federal regulations are required. The Service also finds that the nonessential experimental status is appropriate for gray wolves taken from wild populations and released into central Idaho. The nonessential status for such wolves allows for additional management flexibility. Nonessential experimental populations located outside of a national park or national wildlife refuge are treated for purposes of section 7 of the Act as if they were only proposed for listing, and not listed. Only section 7(a)(l) and section 7(a)(4) apply to Federal actions outside national parks and national wildlife refuges. Presently, there are no conflicts envisioned with any current or anticipated management actions of the Forest Service or other Federal agencies in the area. The national forests are beneficial to the reintroduction effort in that they form a natural buffer to private properties and are typically managed to produce wild animals that wolves could prey upon. The Service finds that the less restrictive section 7 requirements associated with the nonessential designation do not pose a threat to the recovery effort and continued existence of the gray wolf.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

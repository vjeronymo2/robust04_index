			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 22 (TANJUG) -- Not a single ethnic  Albanian has applied for state secondary school entry exams,  according to Zika Nedeljkovic, Serbian Education Ministry  official in Kosovo and Metohija. Nedeljkovic told the Belgrade  daily POLITIKA EKSPRES on Wednesday [22 June] that, `We are  aware that extra-legal exams are being held for ethnic Albanian  secondary school pupils, with enrollment probably taking place  in private homes.'    This is the third year that ethnic Albanians have boycotted  state secondary schools, even though classes in Albanian have  been organized for 12,500 pupils and in Turkish for 240 pupils,  the daily said. There has been a strong separatist movement  among ethnic Albanians in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo  and Metohija for decades. Leaders of the movement demand the  annexation of the province by neighbouring Albania.    Ethnic Albanians backing the separatist movement boycott the  laws of Serbia and Yugoslavia, refusing to go to school, to work  or to pay taxes. They did not vote in the 1990 and 1992  multiparty elections. Ethnic Albanian students boycott school  classes and university lectures to avoid the Serbian and  Yugoslav school curriculum. They attend illegal classes in  private homes and use the curriculum of neighbouring Albania.    Yugoslav and Serbian officials have unsuccessfully appealed  to ethnic Albanian intellectuals in the provice to oppose the  separatists and to support a return to state schools. The  result is that generations of ethnic Albanians are unable to  find work because they have not obtained secondary school  certificates. The Yugoslav Constitution guarantees civil rights  regardless of ethnic origin. Ethnic Albanians can attend  classes and lectures in Albanian and have newspapers, magazines,  radio and tv programmes in Albanian.    There are 1,400 schools for ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and  Metohija, 60 education centres and university lectures are  offered in Albanian.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Letter: Yeltsin view on energy prices Sir, I was perplexed and disturbed by John Lloyd's article, 'Yeltsin signals change in economic policy' (June 1). It states that Yeltsin has signalled a 'sharp change of course in Russian economic policy in the face of rising public discontent'. The article is based largely on Yeltsin's comments to Jacques Delors, European Commission president, about social discontent in Russia, and on Yeltsin's objections to an immediate rise in energy prices to world levels. John Lloyd seems to have greatly over-reacted on both points. First, and most seriously, Delors' remarks seem to have been misconstrued. The essence of Delors' remarks, according to the text of his news conference, is quite different from your article's interpretation. In fact, Delors stressed that Yeltsin remains committed to the reforms; committed to higher energy prices; and, in fact, committed to an acceleration of the reforms. As for oil prices, John Lloyd should know that the International Monetary Fund is not demanding an immediate introduction of world prices for energy, but rather a phased increase over a period of years. Thus, Yeltsin's recent statements about the need to raise oil prices gradually do not signal any fundamental conflict with the IMF or a change of course of Russia's reforms. Russia's situation is difficult enough without prominent news stories that create an exaggerated sense of instability. I hope you accept these comments as constructive. I regard the FT as the highest quality financial newspaper in the world. I rely heavily upon it (and John Lloyd's reporting), and am grateful for your consistently superb standards.

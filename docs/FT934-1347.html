			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Vietnam Premier demands tougher penalties against corruption Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has demanded tougher penalties against corruption, saying Hanoi must win back the people's confidence as waves of graft and money-worship sweep the country, Reuter reports from Hanoi. Mr Kiet said Hanoi would strengthen anti-corruption laws in 1994 and 1995 and would launch a 'large campaign' to dissuade government departments from luxury spending, the official Vietnam News Agency reported. 'The situation has become so serious that it should be prevented and driven back by the efforts of the government and the active participation of the whole society,' the agency quoted Mr Kiet as telling parliament on Saturday.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Johannesburg broker jailed for fraud MR Greg Blank, a Johannes-burg stockbroker, has been sentenced to eight years in prison after conviction on 48 counts of fraud involving share-dealing irregularities. Mr Blank's trial, following crimes which netted him and others about R10m (Pounds 2.13m) in illegal gains, was the highest profile securities trial in Johannesburg in many years. Although many brokers welcomed the sentence, there was shock at its severity as the state had not called for imprisonment. The courts are determined to be seen to be taking a stern line against white-collar crime. Reflecting this, Mr Justice Cloete, the presiding judge, yesterday refused Mr Blank leave to appeal. Mr Blank's counsel will now seek this from the Chief Justice. Because Mr Blank pleaded guilty, no witnesses were called, preventing the proper airing of stock exchange practices that many had hoped for.</p>

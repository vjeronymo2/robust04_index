			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Takashi Yonezawa, Democratic Socialist Party </F> [DSP] secretary general, by unidentified SANKEI SHIMBUN  reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [SANKEI SHIMBUN] The minority ruling parties will  be forced into hard sailing in Diet management.    [Yonezawa] Actually, we have yet to feel that steering the  political situation is a very difficult task. Indeed, the  opposition and ruling parties are opposed to each other.  However, both sides share the common sense of value over policy  matters, including tax system reform, administrative reform, and  political reform. Therefore, we will do our best to reach a  mutual agreement.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is  planning to call for a no-confidence motion in the cabinet  immediately after the fiscal 1994 budget bills are approved.    [Yonezawa] It will pursue the party's interest at the  nation's expense if the LDP tries to call for a no-confidence  motion by saying unreasonable things. Dissolution of the Diet  and holding a general election under the current medium-sized  constituency system may kill political reform. We need to enact  the redistricting bills to introduce the single-seat system  during the current Diet session. After that, we can dissolve  the Diet and hold a fair and square election under the new  system, if necessary.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Do you think the cabinet will be dissolved  or will the cabinet resign en masse if a no-confidence motion is  submitted?    [Yonezawa] Many members of the LDP and the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] also hold the view that an election should  not be held under the medium-sized constituency system. I am  sure that a gap will be created within the LDP and the SDPJ if  the executive departments of both parties try to forcefully  approve a no-confidence motion.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Do you think a freeze has been imposed on  the activities of the "Kaishin" parliamentary group?    [Yonezawa] Party members and the Yuaikai, a supporting  group, had no objection to the idea of strengthening unity among  the ruling parties by forming the Kaishin. It may be easy to  dissolve the group. However, there is a possibility that a  dissolution may create discord among the ruling parties. We  would like to carefully study the possibility.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Some people pointed out the executive  department's responsibility.    [Yonezawa] We have to clarify our responsibility for the  consequence. There are many ways of assuming responsibility.  However, we will follow the general trend within the party.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] There is a movement within the DSP to  cooperate with the Japan New Party [JNP].    [Yonezawa] We are trying to cooperate with the JNP because  the JNP and DSP are close in terms of policy matters. Our  cooperation may serve as a means to calm down the confusion and  restlessness created over the "Kaishin" issue. We are scheduled  to have a policy meeting next week to give shape to our  cooperation.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] It seems that the issue of extending the  current Diet session will emerge over the issue of enacting the  redistricting bills and other matters.    [Yonezawa] The issue of extending the Diet session may  develop into a major controversy depending on when the  redistricting bills will be submitted.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] How do you think the tax system reform will  be concluded?    [Yonezawa] At each important stage, we need to explain the  contents of discussions among the ruling parties to the LDP and  the SDPJ. We should maintain our stance of listening to their  opinions. We can listen to their opinions while we are still  discussing the issue or after we map out our plans. Another  method we can adopt to enact tax system reform bills is to form  a joint council composed of members of the opposition and ruling  parties.    [SANKEI SHIBMUN] Do you think actual figures, including tax  rates, should be clarified in the bills?    [Yonezawa] I think we should clarify figures as much as  possible. The best way is to include actual numbers in the  bills.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Over the issue of North Korea's suspected  nuclear arms development, some people are talking about the  possibility of introducing new laws to deal with emergency  situations and about the right of collective self-defense.    [Yonezawa] They are obsessed with words without considering  the gap with reality. It is a matter of course for the  government to be prepared for an emergency no matter what the  case may be.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Will the ruling parties form a new new  party [shin shinto] to help each other in an election under a  new system?    [Yonezawa] The best way for us is to agree on policy matters  and to put up joint candidates rather than trying to eliminate  each other. Many SDPJ members think the party has to change.  We should attach more importance to forbearance than to  cleanliness. We need to unite together.</p>

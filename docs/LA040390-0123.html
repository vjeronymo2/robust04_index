			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUFFALO RAPID TRANSIT SERVICE SET TO RESUME WITH NEW FUNDING PLAN  </P> <P> Erie County lawmakers Monday night agreed on a complicated funding package that  ended a two-day shutdown of bus and rapid transit service in New York state's  second-largest city.  </P> <P> Transit officials said buses and light rail rapid transit cars were expected to  resume normal operations this morning.  </P> <P> The four-year plan, which would mean $11.7 million in total aid in its first  year, was approved by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority's Board of  Commissioners after a private meeting that lasted more than an hour.  </P> <P> Erie County Executive Dennis Gorski said the plan included an "infusion" of $1  million from the city government, $750,000 from New York state from a gross  receipt tax, and the rest from part of the county's 8% sales tax and a  "rearrangement of certain other monies for the NFTA so they could be stable."  </P> <P> Unlike an earlier arrangement that was considered but not acted upon by the  NFTA, the plan approved Monday did not include severe service cuts nor the  layoffs of about 125 employees.  </P> <P> There was no immediate indication that the package would include a fare  increase that had been discussed earlier.  </P> <P> On Monday, the second day of the transit shutdown, 135,000 commuters got around  on bicycles, car pools and their feet.  </P> <P> The biggest problems were reported in city high schools, where absentee rates  soared to near 60%.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLOGNE, REAL MADRID LOOK IMPRESSIVE  </P> <P> All too often when big-name soccer teams visit the United States for a series  of exhibitions, the players treat it as a holiday.  </P> <P> Not so on Thursday night at the Coliseum. Cologne of West Germany and Real  Madrid of Spain, even in defeat, turned in performances worthy of their  position as two of the leading clubs in Europe.  </P> <P> The West Germans looked particularly impressive -- or at least motivated --  coming back from a goal deficit to defeat a Central American all-star team,  5-1, in the first game of a doubleheader before a lively crowd of 44,592.  </P> <P> The crowd was so lively, in fact, that several hundred fans invaded the field  before the start of the nightcap to mob Hugo Sanchez, who stars for both his  club team, Real Madrid, and his national team, Mexico. It took at least 15  minutes for order to be restored.  </P> <P> The game lived up to its billing, with Mexico winning, 3-1, on goals by Gonzalo  Farfan in the 15th minute, Ricardo Pelaez in the 30th and Zaquino in the 66th.  Real Madrid's goal was scored by Sanchez in the 28th minute.  </P> <P> In the opener, Cologne took the initiative from the start, with forward Uwe  Rahn's shot flashing just wide of the right post in the first minute. But it  was the Central American team that scored first.  </P> <P> An excellent move by forward Raul Chacon on the right wing resulted in teammate  Sergio Rivera, from Guatemala, firing the ball past German goalkeeper Volker  Diergardt in the 12th minute. Undeterred, Cologne came right back, with Rahn  again just wide on a shot a minute later.  </P> <P> The West Germans tied the score, then took the lead, with three goals in an  11-minute spell midway through the first half.  </P> <P> Hugo Perez, the El Salvador-born U.S. national team player, came on in the  second half for the Central Americans and, although still showing a lack of  match fitness due to recovery from a broken leg, nevertheless underlined once  again why he should not have been left off the U.S. World Cup squad.  </P></p>

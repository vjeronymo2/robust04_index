			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Candover increases net assets by 2.9% CANDOVER Investments, an investment trust specialising in management buy-outs, achieved a 2.9 per cent increase in net assets over the six months to June 30, slightly ahead of the 2.4 per cent rise in the FT-A All-Share Index over the same period. Mr Roger Brooke, chairman, said that in the short term he did not expect to record increases in Candover's net assets at the levels possible in the mid to late 1980s. Net assets rose to Pounds 56.2m, against Pounds 54.5m at December 31 and Pounds 52m a year earlier. Net assets per share were 251p compared with 244p at December 31. Problems in achieving realistic prices for new buy-outs, two large flotations of buy-out companies and the raising of a new Pounds 37.5m fund led to a rise in the proportion of net assets held as cash or short term deposits to 40 per cent. Pre-tax profits rose by 4 per cent from Pounds 2.17m to Pounds 2.26m. This was due largely to an increase in management fees resulting from the raising of the new fund. Earnings per share rose to 6.81p from 6.69p. The interim dividend is raised to 3.75p (3.5p). Despite a generally difficult climate for disposing of companies, Candover floated both Kenwood Appliances and Anglian Group with substantial capital gains. It also has a little less than half of the Pounds 319m fund it raised in 1989 still available for investment. There was little competition from trade buyers for the buy-outs backed by Candover but it was often difficult to persuade corporate vendors that the price being offered for their company was realistic, said Mr Stephen Curran, chief executive. Candover made three new investments in the six months. The largest was in the buy-out of Gaymer Group from Allied-Lyons with an investment of Pounds 15.6m with the others being in British Technology Group and Orion Publishing Group.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Council contracts out tax collecting COLLECTION of local taxes and the payment of benefits is to be contracted out to the private sector by East Cambridgeshire district council, in the first successful competitive tender for a local-authority white-collar function. The council sought competitive tenders for the collection of poll tax and business rates - and council tax when that is introduced next year  - and the payment of housing benefit and poll tax benefit. The contract, worth Pounds 3.5m over five years, has been awarded to Capita Group from this month. The council's 23 revenue collection and benefits staff have chosen to transfer to Capita, and the service will continue to be provided from the existing premises. If service targets are exceeded, Capita will be paid a performance bonus. If standards are not met, their fee will be reduced. Capita already works under contract for more than 20 local councils in chasing up poll tax payments by phone, but this is the first contract involving the entire revenue collection and benefits payment service. Competitive tendering is due to be extended to a wide range of council professional and technical services under legislation passed in the last parliament. Details of the scope of such contracting out and the timetable are due to be announced soon, after officials have considered more than 500 submissions on a consultative paper issued last autumn.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Enigma behind Tories' variations THE IMAGES emblazoned on the walls behind Mr John Major and his colleagues at Conservative central office yesterday morning were for once positive. The blackened tax 'bombshell' at the heart of his party's onslaught on Labour's economic strategy had been replaced by a soft-focus photograph of a young schoolboy working happily in the classroom. On the opposite wall was a poster illustrating the steep rise in home ownership delivered by three successive Conservative governments. Mr Major was joined by Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke - two of his campaign 'A' Team - to spell out the brighter future promised by a fourth electoral triumph. The important subtext was that Labour would wreck it. It was the message that Mr Major has been trying to convey since his weekend inquest into the faltering Conservative election effort. The aim was to respond to the judgment of party canvassers that wavering voters need positive encouragement to vote Conservative as well as further cause to shun Mr Neil Kinnock. A few hours later Mr Heseltine played a starkly different tune. The television cameras were invited to the marginal London constituency of Dulwich to hear the environment secretary deliver the bluntest attack of the campaign so far on Mr Kinnock's leadership. The headline on his press release - 'It's the biggest load of Kinnocks I have ever heard' - reflected the tone of a vituperative attack on Mr Kinnock. The sudden lurch from the positive to the negative came as no surprise to those following the Conservative election effort. Nor did it inspire confidence that the party has mapped out a plan for the final phases which will succeed in revitalising a hitherto lack-lustre campaign. So far the strategy pursued by Central Office has projected confusion rather than clarity. It has left the impression that a carefully pre-drafted blueprint has been cast aside in favour of violent tactical swerves. Labour entered the fray with a single theme - time for change  - and has pressed it since with the relentless professionalism which comes from 13 years in opposition. The Conservatives started with several tunes but have seemed unsure from day to day which to emphasise, which to discard. Senior ministers talk one day of the need for more 'positive' campaigning, the next of how the party needs to take a more aggressive line in attacking Mr Kinnock. The caring Conservatism for the 1990s at the heart of Mr Major's election manifesto was relegated to the background within days of the election announcement. Initial embarrassment about the party's past quickly gave way to a campaigning style of which Mrs Margaret Thatcher fully approved. Mr Major - the prime minister who had planned to stand aloof from the fray to capitalise on his popularity - began sprinkling his speeches with bloodcurdling attacks. By last weekend that was all judged too negative - until, that is, Mr Heseltine's latest speech signalled that the campaign had run full circle into a new round of attacks on Mr Kinnock. Those running the campaign have answers for the critics. Winning an election in the midst of recession was never going to be easy. Nor could the image-makers have been expected to forge a seamless link between 11 1/2 years of Thatcherism and 16 months of Majorism. The Conservatives cannot erase so recent a past. Mr Major is inexperienced and Mr Chris Patten has to run both the general election and his own campaign in Bath. The strategists argue also that day-to-day tactical adjustments have not shifted the party from the ground on which it decided from the outset it would fight the election - taxation, economic competence and leadership. Whatever other issues have grabbed the headlines since the campaign started, it has returned repeatedly to tax. Nearly two-thirds of the voters have been persuaded that Labour would take more from their wage-packets. The evidence of 1983 and 1987 confirms that in the privacy of the polling booth, tax ranks much higher in most voters' minds than they are prepared to admit to the opinion pollsters. The Conservatives insist that this and the other familiar tunes on Mr Kinnock and the economy will play well for them between now and April 9. But with the opinion polls now moving decisively against them they can no longer afford to sound like an orchestra without a conductor.</p>

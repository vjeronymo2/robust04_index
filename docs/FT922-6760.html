			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Moscow reacts to Turkish threats on Armenia RUSSIA yesterday moved swiftly to signal its support for the republic of Armenia following Turkish threats of military intervention in its conflict with Azerbaijan. Yesterday Mr Gennady Burbulis, Russian president Boris Yeltsin's top aide, General Pavel Grachev, the new defence minister, and Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, head of the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States, flew to Yerevan, Armenia's capital, for talks with the republic's leaders on the status of its seventh army based in Armenia. The conclusion of a treaty permitting the stationing of Russian troops in another state would be the first such agreement since Russia decided to form its own army last month. It would also send a clear signal to Turkey and Azerbaijan that Armenia is in Russia's sphere of interest. The talks come just two days after Mr Turgut Ozal, the Turkish president, threatened to send introops after reports-denied by Armenia - of the entry of Armenian soldiers into the Azerbaijani enclave of Nakhichevan, situated between the borders of Armenia, Turkey and Iran. Marshal Shaposhnikov warned two days ago that such intervention could 'create a third world war'. However, yesterday, Mr Burbulis said he 'ruled out' a Turkish intervention. There are also fears the broader conflict between Armenia (supported by Russia) and Azerbaijan (supported by Turkey) over the Armenian-dominated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh could escalate into a regional conflict. Mr Yeltsin and Mr Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, are due to hold talks in Ankara on Monday. Reuter adds from Baku: Commonwealth border troops near the Turkish frontier have been put on alert after a night of fighting between Azeri and Armenian forces around Nakhichevan. The Turkish foreign ministry said Armenian units were firing on Nakhichevan from their side of the border.</p>

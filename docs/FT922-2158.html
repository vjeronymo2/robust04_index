			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (22): Lost calls mean lost business - In Brief A COMPANY with an average sales revenue of Pounds 25 per call, losing only ten calls a day through operators being busy or absent, will have lost a potential of Pounds 5,000 in a month and Pounds 60,000 by year-end. The recognition by the business community of the importance of effective call-management to their service performance - and hence their profitability  -is reflected in the growth of the automatic call distribution (ACD) marketplace. Philips Business Systems, says that service-led companies - which now account for 59 per cent of Britain's total Gross Domestic Product - face potential revenue losses of millions of pounds a year because they answer the phone inefficiently. ACD systems reduce waiting times and spread the workload more evenly among operators. Apart from giving call-traffic flexibility, they also generate valuable management information for such service-led businesses as banks, airlines, travel agencies, hotels, booking agents, mail order and credit companies. Mr Stewart Judd, senior policy adviser at the Confederation of British Industry, says that as the UK's economy becomes increasingly meshed in the information age, 'many businesses have become more dependent on the speed and effectiveness with which they answer queries and provide quotations, demonstrating that the organisation meets the highest standards of quality and service.' Research by Philips shows that a business handling more than 200 calls a day would normally recover the cost of installing an ACD system within six months while increasing the productivity of phone operators by around 30 per cent. The type of companies that benefit most from these systems are: Where there is a group of people mainly taking incoming calls. When customers want a service, not a person. Where there is a need for performance indication. When there is a need to balance the call-load. Where incoming calls generate revenue. Restructuring assignment in Bulgaria TOUCHE ROSS, the UK management consultants, has been awarded an Pounds 880,000 contract to assist in the redevelopment of the telecommunications market in Bulgaria, The project, part of the European Community's PHARE programme to fund reconstruction in central and eastern Europe, will be carried out in conjunction with the Danish Telephone Company. Touche Ross will make a financial review of Bulgarian Post and Telephone Company and project its performance over the next five years. Their findings will be passed on to the European Investment Bank and the World Bank. The consultants' tasks are also to assist the Bulgarian telecommunications authority to set a new tariff structure and to put in place a new, commercially-orientated financial management system to replace ageing and inadequate practices, allowing the Bulgarian company to monitor its performance in the new commercial environment. Fax costs not well controlled THIRTY-ONE per cent of respondents to a survey of FT Top 500 companies have increased their usage of fax systems over the last year, despite the recession. And 91 per cent believe that fax machines have helped to increase their productivity. Regular fax users among the FT Top 500 companies and the US Fortune 500 companies now send an average of 40 documents a day, with UK companies receiving an average of 61 documents a day. These are some of the main findings of a Gallup international survey of fax usage, commissioned by Pitney Bowes, a leading independent supplier of fax machines. Fifty per cent of UK users have thermal fax machines: among respondents who do not have a plain paper fax, 29 per cent wanted such a machine (53 per cent in the US and 32 per cent in Canada). The survey also shows that costs of faxing were not well-controlled - 'while fax usage has increased considerably, operational costs are not being controlled,' says Meredith Fischer of Pitney Bowes. 'Thermal paper, for example, is relatively expensive, tends to fade and has to be copied if it needs to be kept. At about 1.7p per copy for paper and toner, that can add more than Pounds 950 a year per machine.' In the UK, 94 per cent of transmissions are made during normal business hours, with 27 per cent likely to sent in the morning at peak charge rates - despite features such as delayed transmission which enables non-urgent documents to be sent at off-peak rates. Frustration over 'faxlock' FRUSTRATION arises in many offices when staff try to send fax messages to busy fax machines - a problem sometimes known as 'faxlock' which can prove expensive in terms of lost orders and business opportunities. But with computer fax systems, the fax message does the queuing, not the expensive office worker. Ascom Telecommunications of Camberley, Surrey, have made a cost comparison between sending faxes manually versus computer-faxing. Even assuming that the machine is not busy with an out-going or incoming message, it can take about 10 minutes to send a fax manually, once it has been prepared. So, if the salary of the sender is Pounds 10 an hour, each fax can cost Pounds 1.60 in manpower alone - and any business sending 25 faxes a day will waste Pounds 40 a day or Pounds 10,000 a year. Buying more fax machines is the easy palliative for 'faxlock,' but it does not address the underlying problem, says Peter Champion of Ascom - 'the answer is staggeringly simple: let the computer itself send the fax . . . instead of printing it out on paper, and then having expensive people queue up to feed it into the fax machine.' Phone system for small businesses A TELEPHONE system suitable for small offices and business has been launched by BT - the '2+8' system, offering two lines and up to eight extensions was trialled on a wide range of businesses such as doctors' practices, dental surgeries, farms, dairies, print shops, leisure centres and homes for the elderly. While offering the benefits of a large 'start-of-the-art' switchboard, the easy-to-use '2+8' is a fraction of the cost of larger systems - prices start at Pounds 445, although a typical 2+8 system with lines, four extensions and a 'systemphone' (which allows users to take advantage of advanced features) costs Pounds 862, plus VAT. Ann Brosnan, BT's voice products manager, says: 'The price of the 2+8 and the fact that it can be used with ordinary telephones mean that a customer can go from having no telephone at all to having the best on the market without any significant investment. 'The aim is to give users real freedom as to how they set the system up  - whether they want to buy, rent or lease.' Features of the flexible system include universal line access (for fast call-making and taking by any extension); operator control; a dedicated line; intercom calls, using the systemphone; and hold/transfer/enquire facilities.</p>

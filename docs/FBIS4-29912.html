			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held at  the Grand People's Study House in Pyongyang on June 20 to  introduce the book "Korea I Saw Again 40 Years After" written by  Cuban woman lawyer Candelaria Rodriguez.    In his speech at the meeting, Kim Chin-pom, vice-chairman of  the Committee for Cultural Relations With Foreign Countries,  said that Cuban woman lawyer, the author of the book "Korea I  saw Again 40 Years After", impressively wrote what she saw,  heard and felt during her revisit to Korea 40 years after she  visited Korea as a member of an international fact-finding team  during the fatherland liberation war (June 1950- July 1953) and  exposed to the world people the bestial atrocities committed by  the U.S. imperialist aggressors against the Korean people.    He expressed the hope that this book would help the  revolutionary people of the world to have a clearer  understanding of the validity and invincible vitality of the  socialist cause for its rich, truthful and revolutionary  contents and for its diversified, concise and vivid method of  expression.    Candelaria Rodriguez, the author of the book, spoke next.    Noting why she wrote the book, she said:    "I have come to write this book in order to inform the world  people, even a little, of the true looks of Korea which rose  like a phoenix from heaps of rubbles and has completely changed  its appearance startling the world people under the wise  guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    In his speech, Han Pong-chan, deputy director general of the  Foreign Press Group, noted that the book in Spanish was  translated and published in French, Chinese, English and Russian  and disseminated among foreigners. This book, he added, will  greatly encourage not only the Korean people in their tireless  efforts to defend and further glorify the Korean-style socialism  centred on the masses but also the revolutionary people of the  world in their righteous struggle.</p>

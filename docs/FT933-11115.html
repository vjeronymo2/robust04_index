			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Day of turmoil in the ERM SEVERAL currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism were pushed close to their floors against the D-Mark yesterday, after the Bundesbank shocked the foreign exchange markets by leaving its discount rate unchanged, writes James Blitz. The Bundesbank's decision to leave its interest rate floor at 6.75 per cent came as a huge surprise to dealers, who had been led to think that an easing in German monetary policy yesterday would help France to cut its interest rates and ease the burden of recession. The decision immediately led to heavy selling of non-D-Mark currencies and concerted intervention by six ERM central banks on the most hectic day of currency trading for nearly a year. The French franc fell by a centime just after the news. Substantial intervention by the Bank of France and the Bundesbank held the franc to a London close of FFr3.417 per D-Mark, but it slipped as low as FFr3.4262 after ERM trading closed at 4pm. The Danish krone fell below its ERM floor against the Dutch guilder at one stage. By the close it was at DKr3.3900 to the D-Mark, fractionally above its ERM floor of DKr3.9016. The Belgian franc dropped to an historic low against the German currency, and was 122 basis points below the D-Mark in the ERM grid at the close of trading - destroying the informal 50 basis-point band that the Belgians had declared. Central bank intervention held the peseta and escudo above their ERM floors but, after official trading in the system had closed, the peseta was quoted as low as Pta82.4195, against a floor of Pta84.03. The dollar reaped the benefits of being a safe haven in a crisis, ending at DM1.7345 from a previous DM1.7200. In New York it closed at DM1.7395. There were different assessments in the main London dealing rooms about the level of intervention. One leading analyst said his bank had seen DM10bn of support for the French franc. He claimed to have seen gigantic intervention to support the peseta, to little effect. Other estimates were more modest - but there was general agreement that the intervention in support of the French franc had nearly matched the overall level of DM20bn seen last Thursday. The Dutch central bank was said to have described intervention to support the Danish krone as 'massive'. There was widespread belief that the ERM would shortly collapse unless there was a realignment of the system in the next few days. A dealer said the showdown could come today, after fund managers had decided what action to take overnight. But there was lingering concern about whether to sell the French franc. Some New York based hedge funds remained absent last night. One analyst wondered whether the Bundesbank had left instructions for an automatic cut in the discount rate if the franc hits its floor.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Business and the Environment: Union steps up fight on employee rights - Legal Briefs Unison, a UK public services union, will today appeal against a ruling by the Employment Appeal Tribunal on European employment protection rights. The appeal, arising out of an EAT ruling on the contracting out of services at Orsett Hospital in Essex, will decide whether the European Acquired Rights directive, which was translated into English law by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981, known as Tupe, applies in the case of Orsett. Tupe protects employees' jobs when the business they work for changes hands. Last August theEAT ruled that Tupe did not apply when the contract for cleaning the hospital came to an end and a new contract was awarded to a different contractor. The tribunal said something more was required to constitute a transfer than simply the fact that the same activity was being carried out at the same place (though by a different business). Unison's position was boosted recently when the European Court of Justice ruled that the European directive could apply to the contracting-out of cleaning services performed by just one employee. In direct contrast to the position taken by the EAT, the Court ruled that all that was needed for the directive to apply was that the contractor was carrying out the same type of work as that performed before the transfer.</p>

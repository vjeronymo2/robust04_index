			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / MFN Renewal for China: Mr Clinton eats humble pie in Asia - Why the US president caved in over human rights The Clinton administration came to office promising to put economics on the front burner of foreign policy and give Asia, the fastest-growing economic region, a focus at least equivalent to that enjoyed for decades by western Europe. But there was a gap between conception and execution that not even President Bill Clinton's Asian trip last summer and the first-ever Apec summit last November could bridge. Whatever its good intentions, the US remained at severe odds with both China and Japan, the two most important Asian powers. This week, Washington has twice made amends. On Monday it agreed with Japan to re-open trade negotiations on terms that remain ambiguous in the extreme but which certainly have broken a painful impasse. On Thursday, Mr Clinton said he would renew China's most favoured nation trading status without reference to its human rights record. Earlier this month, Mr Winston Lord, the subtle undersecretary of state for Asian affairs, wrote a memorandum to his boss, Mr Warren Christopher, outlining what he saw as a real problem. An essential passage ran as follows: 'A series of American measures - threatened or employed - risk corroding our positive image in the region, giving ammunition to those charging we are an international nanny, if not a bully. Without proper course adjustments, we could subvert our influence and our interests.' Mr Clinton himself acknowledged that 'course adjustment' very frankly on Thursday evening. Difficult though it was for him to lower the banner of human rights on which he had campaigned for the presidency and which formed the basis for his executive order coupling trade preferences and Chinese civil liberties, his concerns had to be balanced against other factors. 'China has an atomic arsenal and a vote and a veto in the UN security council,' he said. 'It is a major factor in Asian and global security. We share important interests, such as in a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and in sustaining the global environment. China is also the world's fastest growing economy. Over Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.3bn) of US exports last year supported more than 150,000 American jobs.' He even conceded the merits of the arguments of those who contend that economic and political progress are inter-linked. 'Will we do more to advance the cause of human rights if China is isolated, or if our nations are engaged in a growing web of political and economic co-operation and contacts?' President George Bush never put it better. Mr Christopher, perhaps the staunchest human rights advocate inside the administration, refused to admit that the strategy of last summer was misconceived. He argued in a television interview that at least it brought Congress and the administration together on China, ending years when both had been at 'loggerheads'. But he added, 'I think it was always difficult for the Chinese to do what we had asked', especially in releasing political prisoners. Philosophically, he went on, 'we'll be keeping steady pressure on through other instruments in a way that may cause them to make more progress in the future.' All Mr Christopher got on Thursday was a handful of modest sanctions on Chinese munitions, a Dollars 200m drop in the ocean of Dollars 40bn bilateral trade, and a few promises to spend a little more on human rights propaganda. It may be doubted that US companies will do much to enforce the 'voluntary set of principles for business activity in China' commended by Mr Clinton. The problem with Japan has been of an entirely different political dimension. The last two governments in Tokyo have been weak, whereas Beijing's has proved itself capable of thumbing its nose at the US. But trade pressure on Japan appeared to be producing diminishing returns. In arriving at pragmatic solutions, the administration found itself under growing pressure from a variety of powerful commercial lobbies in Washington and elsewhere. Britain insistently chipped in that a trade confrontation with China was bound to have a deleterious effect on the economy of Hong Kong in the run-up to the resumption of Chinese control in 1997. But the critical political calculation that made this spring different from last summer surely lay in the shift in sentiment in Congress, itself the target of much lobbying. Much as human rights advocates like Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, and Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi continued to press their case on moral grounds, many who had supported the executive order on China began to question the wisdom of its logic if it put American exports and jobs at risk. Whatever the threats of additional legislation from Capitol Hill, the political line-up on China now resembles that of the Nafta debate, where the coalition of labour and liberal interests, who voted for Mr Clinton in 1992, proved insufficient to stop free trade with Mexico and Canada. This realisation strengthened the hand of those inside the administration who have put much effort in the US export promotion drive, which has already produced dividends with large aircraft and telecommunications deals with Saudi Arabia and which eyes China greedily. Boeing, for example, could only describe as 'premature' reports that it was close to landing a Dollars 5bn-plus order by China. The treasury and commerce departments responded to the wishes of their domestic constituencies, with the former increasingly concerned that the impasse with Japan was disturbing international currency markets. Mr Robert Rubin, the self-effacing but influential head of the White House national economic council, was also reluctant to push China to the hilt. Whether the 'new Asia', which, with Singapore and Malaysia in the vanguard, has taken to lecturing the US on its own shortcomings, will respond to a clear shift in US policy remains to be seen. But the invitation, issued by Mr Clinton at the cost of ditching some old friends and eating some humble pie, is at least on the table.</p>

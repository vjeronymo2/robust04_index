			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Airbus wins Dollars 1bn Canada order Air Canada yesterday said it planned to buy up to 35 European Airbus A319 twin engine narrowbody airliners worth Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 950m) to replace its fleet of old McDonnell Douglas DC9 aircraft. The deal is a significant boost for the European consortium which lost out earlier this year to its two US competitors, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, in a Dollars 6bn Saudi Arabian civil aircraft order. Air Canada's decision is also a blow for McDonnell Douglas which had proposed to rebuild and re-engine the Canadian carrier's fleet of 35 DC9s to modern aircraft standards as a cheaper alternative to buying new aircraft. Apart from McDonnell Douglas, Boeing had also competed for the deal with its 737 twin-engine narrowbody airliner, while Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer controlled by Deutsche Aerospace, had also offered its Fokker 100 jet. Airbus launched its new A319 aircraft at the Paris Air Show last summer. The aircraft is a smaller 124-seat version of the 150-seat A320 twin engine airliner. Air Canada said its A319 cabin configuration would offer 112 seats. Air Canada said it intended to place firm orders for 25 A319 worth about Dollars 1bn and take options for an additional 10 aircraft worth another Dollars 400m. The A319 orders will turn Air Canada into the largest operator of Airbus aircraft in North America. The airline already operates 34 A320s and has also ordered 6 A340 long range widebody airliners.</p>

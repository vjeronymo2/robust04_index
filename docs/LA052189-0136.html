			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT: STUDENT TOURS OF THE SOVIET UNION  </P> <P> Independent travelers touring Europe on a budget can join economical  English-language tours into the Soviet Union through two Scandinavian youth  travel bureaus.  </P> <P> Between June and September the Scandinavian Student Travel Service will operate  6 to 13 night tours. The international programs attract people from a variety  of English-speaking countries.  </P> <P> Accommodations are provided in two- or three-bed rooms; meals and sightseeing  are included.  </P> <P> There will be seven departures for a six-night tour of Moscow and Leningrad. If  you join the program in Copenhagen, the cost is $695 U.S.; from Leningrad the  price is $405.  </P> <P> The programs usually fill up about three weeks before departure. You can make  arrangements through many European student travel agencies by contacting SSTS's  retail travel office, DIS Rejser, at Skindergade 28, DK-1159, Copenhagen.  </P> <P> Each summer Travela, the travel service of the Finnish youth hostel  association, offers weekly budget programs to Moscow and Leningrad. You can  contact Travela at Mannerheimintie 5 (about a block from the Helsinki rail  station). It takes at least a week to make visa arrangements.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> The travel service of the Danish youth hostel association reports that it is  operating a new youth hostel in Greenland.  </P> <P> The building, within walking distance of the international airport at  Narsarsuaq, is owned by the Greenlandic Sheep Farmers Assn.  </P> <P> It's a modern, Scandinavian-style building with four four-bed rooms, two  eight-bed rooms and a kitchen. Some tourist information also is provided.  </P> <P> It will open for the summer on June 20. When a staff person is not there, a key  is left at the airport.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> This summer, budget travelers will find 17 youth hostels and 29 hotels, homes  and schools offering low-cost sleeping-bag accommodations in Iceland.  </P> <P> Budget travelers on arrival in Reykjavik can head for the youth hostel at  Laufasvegur 41 in the center of the city. There are budget accommodations and a  travel service that can help make arrangements to visit other areas of the  island country.  </P> <P> For example, you can arrange a short bus trip, plus a three-hour ferry ride, to  Heimaey, one of the 15 volcanic Westman Islands.  </P> <P> Heimaey, with a population of 5,000, is Iceland's largest fishing port. It has  an intriguing, turbulent history. In 1627, 250 of its 500 residents were  carried off by African pirates.  </P> <P> In 1973 more than 300 homes were destroyed by a volcanic eruption. Residents  were moved off the island for a year and a television camera was placed on top  of a mountain beside the village.  </P> <P> After regular television programming signed off each night, a switch was  flipped and the displaced villagers were able to watch Mother Nature's  production. You can still see homes half-buried by the lava flows.  </P> <P> The cost of the round trip by bus and boat, plus a night at the Heimaey youth  hostel, is 111 German marks (about $62 U.S.).  </P> <P> At the travel office you can also buy a Circlepass (valid for travel in one  direction around the main island), plus vouchers for seven nights of hostel or  sleeping-bag accommodations for 404 marks (about $226 U.S.). This is only  available from June 1 to Aug. 31.  </P> <P> Another option is an Omnibuspass that allows travel in any direction for seven  days, plus seven vouchers for sleeping-bag accommodations. The price is 444  marks. You can buy the pass from May 15 to Sept. 15.  </P> <P> For more information on travel to Iceland, contact the Icelandic Tourist Board,  655 3rd Ave., New York 10017, (212) 949-2333.  </P></p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Arts (Openings): National Theatre Arthur Miller is one of those American artists who is as much honoured in Britain as in the United States. His works, like Stephen Sondheim's, do not always have to endure the perils of the commercial theatre here and several of them have found a place in repertory at the National Theatre. His latest, 'Broken Glass', receives its British premiere this week (first night Thursday). David Thacker directs.</p>

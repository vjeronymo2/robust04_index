Iliescu laid a  wreath in the Cemetery of the Martyr Heroes. The fact that the  president visited the military barracks in Lipovei Street, where  on 17 December 1989 13 young persons were murdered, was simply  an act of defiance. During Iliescu's meeting at the County  Prefect's Office, the building was "protected" by hundreds of  policemen and members of the riot police.    From the very beginning, while coming down the stairs of the  presidential plane, Iliescu declared that he had a special  interest, including a "personal" one (?!), in that town.  Romania's president was present for the second time in the  martyr city. His visit began with a classical working visit  [reference to Ceausescu's working visits in the country],  following every rule of such visits, at the first factory that  lay in Iliescu's way, namely the FILTY [as published] company.  Iliescu also hastily visited the Cemetery of the Martyr Heroes,  where he laid a wreath in a contemptuous silence. At the  military barracks situated in Lipovei Street, belonging to the  same unit which in 1989 December opened fire against the  demonstrators thus killing 13 young persons, the military had  the "honor" of personally meeting Ion Iliescu, the eminent  president. The current leader of the country passed without  even casting a glance at the heroes' mothers who had lined up in  front of the barracks. While Iliescu was chatting amiably with  the commanders of the unit, the bereaved mothers were crying at  the barrack gates and chanting: "Iliescu, don't forget,  Timisoara doesn't want you!" or "Let us put him on trial here,  in Banat!" and "Down Iliescu!"    The peak of Iliescu's visit was his meeting in the County  Prefect's Office building, which was surrounded, as it had never  been before, by the police and the riot police. The president  was almost one full hour late. Considering the visit as an act  of defiance against the dead and the wounded [in the  revolution], Traian Orban, who was wounded in the bloody  December, laid himself across the tram rails as a sign of  protest.    Inside the County Prefect's Office, which formerly used to  be  the headquarters of the PCR [Romanian Communist Party] Timis  County branch, the president met with close aides of the former  county secretary of PCR, Iliescu [sentence as published]. The  atmosphere of the meeting was strained. Realizing how  embarrassing the situation was, as the meeting was "populated"  by former PCR officials, many people who had been invited to  attend started leaving the hall.    As Iliescu's memories of the "golden age" are related too  much to Timisoara, the president did not have the necessary time  (and desire) to meet with that county's revolutionary  organizations. The presidential counselors promised them  separate talks. Now, in the evening hours, while our  correspondent is sending this report, the Prefect's Office  building is under siege by thousands of Timisoara citizens who  are booing to express their protest with respect to the  presidential visit.</p>

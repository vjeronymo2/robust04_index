			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mino Martinazzoli, secretary of the Italian </F> Christian Democratic Party, by Gianluca Luzi in Rome; date not  given: "`I Am Right; Victory in the Center' -- Martinazzoli  Drops Mediating Role"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Luzi] Senator Martinazzoli,  you said, speaking off the cuff, that "the message must not be  reduced to partisanship in politics," but I assume that you are  pleased about the pope's intervention at such a crucial moment?    [Martinazzoli] I have tried to keep my reading of this  message free from considerations of short-term interest or even  partisan interpretations. I am sure that the most accurate  interpretations are those that underline the European dimension,  which I think was the connecting thread and at the same time the  key to understanding the orientation of the message. Be that as  it may, taking proper account of the differences, this was the  approach of my own report to the assembly in July. I added in  that report that the corollary of all this was the  reconstruction of the national sense of community.    [Luzi] But in his letter to the bishops the pope also  addressed the Italian voters; that is, he intervened directly in  politics.    [Martinazzoli] The pope's viewpoint, which I obviously  share,  is, more or less, that this European building must not be  impoverished by the absence of a Christian mark of identity. In  my reading, precisely in order to remain faithful to this  exhortation, I reject any petty interpretation -- that is, the  idea of somebody else resolving for us the problems that we face  as a political force.    [Luzi] But almost everyone has interpreted the pope's  remarks  as an outright appeal for people to vote for the Catholic party.    [Martinazzoli] That does not mean that their interpretation  is correct. The appeal for people to believe that enhanced  unity -- not passive or forcible, but active and convinced --  bears witness to these duties is one thing; and to interpret the  remarks as saying that it is necessary to support one hypothesis  rather than another, is a different matter. Of course, the  challenge that I have set myself is to gather as much support as  possible, but I do not attack this claim to that message. I  would add that our endeavor -- which, through no coincidence, is  inspired by Sturzo -- must of course take account of the  contributions of the Catholic world, but it also aspires to  build a nonconfessional home inhabited by Catholics, but by  nonconfessionals too, who share the principles and the policies  that we are putting forward.    [Luzi] At the moment, however, the Catholic inhabitants of  this home, still under construction, seem very quarrelsome.  Bindi, Casini.... How will you make them get along?    [Martinazzoli] I am not only unenthusiastic about, but now  totally opposed to, the idea that the issues facing us entail  daily mediation between the assertions of the various sides.    [Luzi] Yes, but behind the verbal disputes there lies the  problem of alliances, of the choice of camp.    [Martinazzoli] I think that it is wrong to believe that in  Italy there is a clear and sharply defined polarity between left  and right, conservatives and progressives. For instance, the  scenario presented by "Milano Italia" with reference to a  certain opinion poll is of considerable interest. It shows that  our idea of a rotation not confined to the two most extreme  poles is correct. This, because it is emerging that a force  representing a program and a government leadership proposal  involving us and [Pact for Italy leader] Segni will win most of  the votes that do not go to the left-wing alliance.    [Luzi] But it will not be enough to govern with.    [Martinazzoli] But it will be enough to be able to draw on,  and not to betray, a whole political heritage.    [Luzi] Be that as it may, then the problem of government  alliances will begin.    [Martinazzoli] Of course. Not only after the elections, but  even now, during the pre-election stage.    [Luzi] So let us talk about alliances. You described Bossi's  latest turnabout as "interesting" and said that Berlusconi is  right when he says that the Left is competing with no rivals.  Will they be your allies, together with Segni?    [Martinazzoli] I was asked whether there was a danger of a  victory by a left-wing alliance, and I do not think that that is  a discovery of Berlusconi's. It is what many people hope for,  an obvious fact. But it raises certain questions. This,  because -- apart from the arrogance of Mr. D'Alema [Democratic  Party of the Left (PDS) Deputy Secretary], who tries to pretend  many things -- I think I perceive certain difficulties in  building this alliance. The PDS' separation from its history is  gainsaid by the encumbrance of Communist Renaissance. Then  there is Orlando's Rete movement, of which all you can perceive  is its extreme language. Are these insignificant problems?  Will they pass unobserved by the voters, who will have to  choose? I think not.    [Luzi] But that applies to your political adversaries. What  about your allies?    [Martinazzoli] It is necessary to have pride in your  proposal, and the conviction that it is an apposite one; the  rest is a matter for political calculations and maneuvering.  Let me give you an example: After the elections -- however  they may go, and whatever positions the political forces may  assume -- what could the League do in Parliament if it remains  on its own? I will not use the word "hegemony," which I do not  like, but I do say that a proposal that is made visible and  authoritative and that wins support, such as ours, is a force  with a great power of attraction. This is a political fact.  The aspect of how it is experienced, interpreted, and managed  belongs to the sphere of the dynamism of politics, to our  actions, to those of others, to everything happening around us.</p>

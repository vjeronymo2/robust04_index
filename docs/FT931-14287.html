			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German rate cut hopes move Frankfurt, Zurich BOURSES had another run yesterday at the frequently explored prospect of a German interest rate cut, Frankfurt rising and Zurich subsiding in consequence, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw its highest close for nearly four months, the DAX index ending 28.58, or 1.85 per cent higher at 1,573.13, its best since September 21. Turnover climbed from DM5.2bn to DM6.2bn. Technical and fundamental reasons were put forward for the rise, in addition to the initiative by traders who saw the possibility of a short term gain on the market, both on the interest rate theme and after the improvement in sentiment delivered by Siemens's better than expected figures last Thursday. Traders said that there was short-covering after Friday's stock options expirations and Allianz, frequently volatile in this connection, put on DM63 to DM2,057. Buying was also encouraged by the convincing DAX break through 1,560 and some illiquid stocks - notably the construction group, Hochtief, up DM55 to DM978 - exaggerated the underlying strength of demand. Among stocks which appeared on various brokers' buy lists last Friday, Daimler ended DM13.50 higher at DM564.00, BMW and Volks-wagen keeping it company with gains of DM10 and DM7.50, to DM499 and DM276 respectively. In chemicals. Hoechst extended its recent return to relative strength with a rise of DM8.40 to DM255.80. PARIS started the week strongly with activity noted in the finance and construction sectors. The CAC-40 index closed 10.46 ahead at 1,837.54 in turnover of some FFr2.8bn. Among the financials, Suez gained FFr9.20 to FFr278.30, Paribas put on FFr4.30 to FFr394.80 and Societe Generale improved FFr1 to FFr603 as investors continued to look forward to lower interest rates. Building stocks were also busy on expectations that infrastructure spending would be increased this year, a view partly borne out by news that the government planned to set aside FFr11.5bn for motorway construction in 1993. Bouygues, which stands to benefit, advanced FFr13 to FFr589. Alcatel rose FFr6 to FFr657 on news that it had won two contracts totalling FFr700m for telecommunications in Thailand and Pakistan. AMSTERDAM featured Daf which fell 15 per cent on weekend reports in the local press which again highlighted the company's financial difficulties. The group's shares closed Fl 1.25 lower at Fl 7.05 but off the day's low of Fl 6.80. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.7 higher at 98.4, helped by a strong bond market. The publishing sector built on last week's gains with Wolters Kluwer another Fl 1.40 ahead at Fl 86.60 and Elsevier up Fl 1.00 at Fl 124.30. Among financials, ABN Amro and ING both gained 40 cents to Fl 52.70 and Fl 57.60 respectively. ZURICH succumbed to profit taking in blue chips which left the SMI index down 16.4 at 2,084.6 with almost half the decline coming in the final 15 minutes of trading. The consolidation also reflects shifts in investment into other European bourses, particularly Germany, following the Swiss rally which began in early December. Bank stocks slipped with Union Bank down SFr4 to SFr885 and SBC easing SFr6 to SFr313. Concern that Nestle may soon announce a rights issue contributed to a SFr20 decline to SFr1,070. MILAN turned in another strong performance on the first day of the new trading account with investors encouraged by the approval for a referendum on constitutional reform and further consideration of the new fiscal incentives for the stock market. The Comit index rose 6.31 to 484.93 in hefty turnover which proved too much for the telematic continuous trading board, which ceased to operate an hour before the official close. Industrials led the advance with Fiat up by L151 to L4,390 before a further rally to L4,460 in after-hours trading. Telecommunications were also firm with Stet adding to Friday's advance. The shares rose by L8 to L2,028, and L2,120 in after-hours trading. BRUSSELS saw volatile trading in Arbed which rose to the day's high of BFr2,140 after breaching the BFr1,900 resistance level before closing up BFr135 at BFr1,995. The Bel-20 index lost 3.96 to 1,140.59 in turnover of BFr1.2bn. COPENHAGEN welcomed reports that a new government would be formed soon and the KFX index rose 3.66 or 4.8 per cent to 79.63 in turnover of DKr359m. STOCKHOLM saw strong activity in the banking sector help lift the Affarsvarlden General index by 6.8 to 933.8 in turnover of SKr678m. Among the banks, Handelsbanken's A shares gained SKr6.50 to SKr43.50. OSLO also firmed slightly on stronger oil prices and the composite index finished 1.49 higher at 386.52 in turnover of NKr152.6m. VIENNA improved with the ATX index closing 7.02 higher at 719.08. Leykam, the paper manufacturer, rose Sch9 to Sch231 on news late last week that it had established a joint venture in the Czech republic. ISTANBUL declined in late trading and the 75-market index closed 68.67 lower at 4,017.16.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- January 18                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open        10.30        11.00       12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1093.97      1092.79      1092.27     1091.23 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1166.27      1163.38      1163.36     1162.80  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00        14.00        15.00       Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1094.97      1096.77      1096.99     1097.15 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1163.68      1166.79      1165.98     1166.50  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jan 15    Jan 14    Jan 13    Jan 12     Jan 11  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1089.58   1076.93   1063.02   1071.43   1069.87 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1160.32   1154.08   1144.79   1152.84   1155.95  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1097.25; 200 - 1167.02 Low/day: 100 - 1089.92 200 - 1160.32.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

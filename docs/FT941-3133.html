			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Premier Oil slips by 33% Premier Consolidated Oilfields, independent exploration and production company, yesterday reported a 33 per cent fall in 1993 net profits to Pounds 10.1m, as planned maintenance programmes eroded production and low oil prices took their toll of revenues. Turnover at Pounds 45.9m was 18 per cent lower. Earnings per share fell to 1.84p from 2.76p. The impact of a 21-day maintenance shutdown at the onshore Wytch Farm field and the decommissioning of the Angus offshore field was reflected in last year's average production figure, which slipped to about 12,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent (including natural gas) from 13,888 b/d last time. But Mr Charles Jamieson, chief executive, said current production had recovered to 1992 levels and was set to rise to 20,000 b/d within two years. Cash balances stood at Pounds 47.2m at year end, with debt of Dollars 120m. Gearing was 50 per cent. The removal by the government last year of petroleum revenue tax relief on exploration and appraisal drilling was reflected in an Pounds 8.8m one-off exceptional charge. The amount relates to deferred PRT in prior years. Mr Roland Shaw, chairman, said that aside from the exceptional charge, the loss of tax relief on exploration expenditure had been 'offset to some extent by the lower PRT rate'. Analysts said the exceptional charge was the only surprise in the results, which were otherwise in line with expectations. Additional appraisal of finds enabled the company to boost its estimate of proven reserves by 15 per cent. Mr Jamieson said the low oil price environment had caused the company to focus on projects which could lead to an early payback. He said 75 per cent of the company's effort would be aimed at projects which could enhance short to medium term cash flow, with 25 per cent reserved for longer term exploration activity. COMMENT Cuba, Cambodia and Myanmar are just a few of the exotic though difficult locations which have appealed to Premier's explorers So far the strategy of going into difficult countries has worked well. Premier gets good terms and large stakes. If finds are made some of the stake is farmed out topay for development, leaving the company with a good chunk of the consequent production. But if oil prices linger at low levels it can only extend the strategy if the majors which operate many of its producing fields can continue to make significant cuts in their costs.</p>

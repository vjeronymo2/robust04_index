			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Arts: Same old message, but Politically Correct - Cinema in 1991 Time for the round-up of the year. This is the occasion on which a critic breaks open his memory bank only to discover that he has been robbed, probably sometime during the festive, low-security hours of Christmas Day. 'What films really stood out during 1991?,' someone asked me this Christmas over the dangerous third Martini. I was flummoxed. I scratched my coloured paper hat and caught a fleeting mental glimpse of all the movies I had seen during the year. Then it was gone. I had to return to my notes on sober Boxing Day to remember it all. Now they leap forth. All those multiple murderer films like The Silence Of The Lambs and Henry, Portrait Of A Serial Killer. All those new black films like Boyz N The Hood and Young Soul Rebels. All those feminist-agenda thrillers like Thelma and Louise and Misery, where women adopt the hunter-harrier roles usually played by men. But as one would expect from a palindromic year - '1991' reads the same backwards or forwards - a cinema trying to reverse itself ideologically kept finding that it was saying the same old things. Dances With Wolves essayed a reconstruction of the Western for the age of Indian Rights and ended by sending much the same sexist, racist messages as before under a 'politically correct' banner. (The gone-native hero is allowed to fall in love, but only with the tribe's one adopted white woman). And Thelma and Louise, Ridley Scott's brilliant trans-American action thriller, put two females at the wheel of the plot and was then accused of making them do the same thick-eared, screechy things that men would have done. That, of course, was part of Scott and writer Calli Khouri's point. Plus ca change in the age of political correctness, plus c'est la meme chose with a new dash of colour or cross-dressing. If Thelma and Louise was saved by self-awareness, that commodity was in short supply elsewhere. Nowhere did the radical resemble the dressed-up reactionary, with no irony in sight, than in the new black cinema. In New Jack City and Boyz N The Hood sexual and racial stereotyping stomped across our screens; and only Spike Lee's Jungle Fever wittily acknowledged that the same bigotries that flourish in the white community are alive in America's black community. Amid so much New Age tub-thumping accompanied by Old Age prejudices, many filmgoers warmed to the serial killers on view. Few of these even pretended to be 'brothers' or 'sisters' or paragons of political correctness. All they wanted to do was to kill you: or in the case of Anthony Hopkins's mesmerising Hannibal Lecter in Silence Of The Lambs, to eat you. How refreshing to have a group of characters who laid it on the line. So refreshing that Hollywood cannily attempted, on at least two occasions, to cross serial killing with political correctness. There was a box-office jackpot for Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves, whose hero knocked off more Normans in his time than Hannibal Lecter had non-vegetarian dinners. And in Terminator 2 Arnold Schwarzenegger walked about America serially clobbering every baddie in sight and earning Dollars 200m at the US turnstiles. But to these comic-strip hero-killers I preferred the higher complexities of the psychopath films: especially the terrifying human riddles posed by a movie like John McNaughton's Henry, Portrait Of A Serial Killer. This is the story of a plain affectless chap who goes around murdering people for - well, for what? Hardly, to judge by his joyless expression, even for the hell of it. If 'causeless' actions are the modern world's greatest moral challenge, then the most bracing feature of the cinema in 1991 was the demolition work done on the very idea of cause-and-effect: not just in the moral presentation of character but in screen storytelling as a whole. Which of us is the same after Twin Peaks? Even if we never saw David Lynch's TV serial, we read about its cult status and cuckoo stylistics. And we see its influence, or that of the aesthetic climate that produced it, in American films like Todd Haynes's Poison (bizarre interweaving of three movie-pastiche thriller tales) and Hal Hartley's Trust (young love, family strife and non-stop non-sequiturs); and also in European films like Patrice Leconte's The Hairdresser's Husband, a tale of l'amour fou with the stress on fou, and Jaco Van Dormael's gleaming Toto The Hero, a sort of revenge opera done as a comic strip. Today's audiences are learning how to meet multiple-choice aesthetic challenges that would have been unthinkable ten years ago. The success of a multi-style fantasy like The Fisher King - not so much a shaggy dog, more like several mongrels fighting in a sack - proves that. Meanwhile films of single-track moral momentum, even when done on an epic scale, begin to seem like yesterday's steam engines. Huffing and puffing towards their climactic messages, movies like The Bonfire Of The Vanities and Havana try to carry audiences to a destination they have been to a hundred times before and do not want to re-visit, thank you, even in a luxury dining car with all-star passengers. This suits Britain perfectly. We have no stars: they have all retired or gone into Labour politics. And we have no money with which to make British epics: it has gone into making other people's epics like The Last Emperor and Dances With Wolves. Instead we have a cottage industry that makes picturesque fixer-uppers: films like Anthony Minghella's Truly Madly Deeply, Derek Jarman's Edward II, Stephen Poliakoff's Close My Eyes, Peter Greenaway's Prospero's Books and Ken Loach's European Film Award winner Riff Raff. Much talent and variety. Should we mind that the results belong more on the small screen than the large? Or that the most beautiful and arresting film of the year, Derek Jarman's The Garden, was not even shot on conventional film: rather on a mish-mash of video and Super-8 and anything else Jarman could find in his odds-and-ends bin? The rules of film-making as we prepare to leave the second millennium AD are as follows: There are no rules. There are only brave artists trying, with any means at their disposal, to wean audiences from the old orthodoxies and the old expectations. My Top Ten for 1991. The Garden, Toto The Hero, Avalon, Riff Raff, The Fisher King, Thelma And Louise, Miller's Crossing, Jungle Fever, Mr And Mrs Bridge, Proof. ***** The first film of the New Year, as so often, seems like a summation of the previous year. Delicatessen (15, Metro, Gate, Screen on the Hill), a first feature by two French animators Jeunet and Caro, boasts a serial killer, a pixillated plot and a blithe disregard for anyone who likes to deal with one genre at a time. Old-dark-house horror jostles with sight-gag slapstick and with a gentle love story involving the evil butcher's pining daughter (Marie-Laure Dougnac) and the new male tenant (Dominique Pinon) who might or might not end up feeling the sharp edge of Papa's cleaver. Set in a fog-girt tenement house that could have been designed by Roland Emmett with help from Gustave Dore, the film's black humour has a manic charm. A virtuoso opening sequence - tracking shot through streets, close-up of cleaver being sharpened, tunnelling shot through house's intestines to face of a terrified man - renders us supple for the gymnastics of style and story that follow. We meet an old codger who lives in a waterlogged room teeming with snails and frogs. We see a boomerang clasp-knife bring horrible justice to its user. We watch two underwater lovers kiss in a flooded bathroom. And we experience a cacophony that turns to filmic poetry as the house's percussive sounds - a metronome, a creaking bed, a carpet being beaten - are swept up into a musical montage. If Delicatessen blueprints a new European surrealism, Bill And Ted's Bogus Journey (PG, Odeon West End) dusts off yesterday's American version. Last time around, our bubble-headed heroes (Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter) time-tripped through the universe meeting Socrates, Napoleon and Genghis Khan and wowing them with the wonders of Valleyspeak. This time they are just as appealing: visiting Heaven and Hell, defeating a cosmic conspiracy and meeting Death, who wields a Swedish accent and plays a mean game of Cluedo. As I was saying, simple down-the-line plots are beginning to look like yesterday's cinema . . .</p>

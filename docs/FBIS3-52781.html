Yesterday he stated that the  Russian Antonov aircraft, which is on hire to certain quarters  in Sudan, and whose Russian crew fled with it last week and  landed at Luxor Airport, had been carrying foodstuffs belonging  to the World Food Program from al-Ubayyid to Bahr al-Ghazal. In  a news conference he held in Cairo, he said that the aircraft  arrived in Sudan in accordance with a commercial contract with a  Sudanese commercial aviation company, and that the Sudanese  Government was not a party to the contract.    Brig. al-Tijani Khalifah denied the claims of the aircraft  crew, published by the Egyptian press, that Sudanese authorities  had been holding the aircraft. He said: We in Sudan did not  imprison any crew in Sudan. He pointed out that there were six  sets of foreign crews for air transport in the country.</p>

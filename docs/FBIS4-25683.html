			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cao Min: "Junior Civil Servants To Be Hired on Merit"] </F>   [Text] Lower-ranking civil servants are to be hired based  on their ability, the Ministry of Personnel has announced.    The ministry issued regulations yesterday requiring new  staff  below the level of section chief to be taken on the basis of  exam results.    However, the new rule which is immediately enforceable, is  not applicable to senior civil servants. They will continue to  be appointed by the higher authorities.    The aim of the new selection procedure is to select the most  able candidate for the government job, through fairness,  equality and competition, said Vice-Minister of Personnel Cheng  Lianchang.    The new members of staff will be recruited according to the  Provisional Regulations on the Employment of Civil Servants.  The selection procedure of civil servants has been under  discussion since 1988. The new regulations have been outlined  in nine chapters and 39 clauses.    Since 1949, most government staff have been selected from  college graduates or retired officers.    But this method of recruitment has failed to meet the needs  of the market economy, under which government administration  should be handled by professionals on an open basis, said Cheng.    The competitive recruitment system was first tested in 1989  when 144 civil servants were selected from 1,334 applicants on  the basis of their exam results. They were employed by the  Ministry of Personnel and six other ministries.    Since then, 63 departments from the State Council have  recruited 716 State employees from 11,611 applicants in the same  way.    And in the past four years, 29 provinces, municipalities and  autonomous regions have employed 71,000 government employees  from 470,000 people on the basis of exam results.    This method of selection has laid the foundation for the  implementation of the new recruitment code and the civil servant  system, said Cheng.    And the Ministry of Personnel hopes to have established the  new recruitment scheme within the next three years candidates  for civil servant posts have to sit a written and oral exam on  topics including political science, law, administrative  management and the handling of official documents.    Those who are selected will be put on probation for a year.    Applicants must be citizens below 35. Prison inmates who  have been deprived of their political rights will not be  eligible.</p>

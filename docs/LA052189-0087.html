			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OH SO ROTTEN  </P> <P> John Lydon (a.k.a. Johnny Rotten) claims a common misconception about him is  that he's nasty (Kristine McKenna's May 14 article, "The World According to . .  . John Lydon").  </P> <P> Then he goes on to insult Sting, Peter Gabriel and Bruce Springsteen, calling  them "compulsively greedy people" who hog the spotlight by participating in  benefit concerts. It's easy to see why so many people have that "misconception"  about Lydon.  </P> <P> LORI SHMULEWITZ  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments were submitted on a number of issues addressed in this section. The issue of whether JTPA funds should pay for tuition or supportive services in coordination with other payment programs was raised by some who recommended that clearer instructions be provided. The exact mix of funds should be determined according to the availability of each funding source for either training costs or supportive services, with the goal of making the program affordable and enabling the participant to successfully complete it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, commenters were concerned about the complexity of procedures needed to ensure compliance with sections 107(b) and 141(b) of the Act. The Department agrees with the need to streamline procedures. Accordingly, &sect;627.220 is revised to reflect the following changes:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;627.220(b)(2) is deleted, and &sect;627.220(b)(1) now directs the SDA to assist the participant early in the objective assessment, as appropriate, to establish eligibility for HEA, title IV financial assistance programs. In addition, &sect;627.220(b)(4) now emphasizes that participants may, but are not required to, apply for or access student loans or incur personal debt as a condition of JTPA participation. While the use of student loans to finance training or education is not prohibited and may be explored in the assessment process, loans should only be used if the participant agrees and is made fully aware of the responsibilities that the loan entails. Participation in a JTPA program may not be conditioned on applying for or using a loan. Finally, &sect;627.220(b)(4) clarifies the need for information sharing which must take place for any financial aid awarded after the participant enrolls in an agreed-upon program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The discussion of HEA student assistance programs in this provision raised a concern that title II participants may be required to access loans. The Department wishes to stress that this is not the case. Section 627.220(b)(4) emphasizes the importance of matching the participant with an affordable program. As a general consideration, individuals should not be required to incur debts as a condition of participating in JTPA programs. Indeed, better identification and coordination of funding sources and improved evaluation of the participant's ability to complete a program successfully as part of the ISS should address the need for personal indebtedness to finance JTPA participation. Thus, &sect;627.220(a) should not be construed to mean that loans must be considered resources for the purposes of this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reason for including HEA, title IV student loans in the information-sharing requirements is that in the past, some JTPA participants have been required or encouraged to take out loans to pay for their training without the knowledge of the SDA's. However, the new requirements for objective assessments and developing ISS's for participants mean that SDA's must take responsibility for evaluating and documenting the participant's financial needs and coordinated ability to pay for an agreed-upon training program before he/she enrolls in the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In fact, several commenters stressed the importance of evaluating all potential HEA funding sources as part of the development of the ISS and that these funding sources be identified and applied for while the ISS is being developed. See &sect;627.220(b)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since federal Pell Grant eligibility can be established before a student enrolls and a Pell Grant can be used at any participating institution that an eligible student attends, SDA's and SSG's should expedite the application process by providing application forms to individuals and providing assistance, as necessary, in filling out and submitting these forms. Although a few commenters were concerned that undue delays in the provision of services might result, it is important to note that Pell Grant eligibility guidelines are readily available, as is the application form for establishing eligibility, and the financial information required to complete the application is already required to ascertain eligibility for JTPA programs. Furthermore, the Department of Education makes funds available to participating schools before the start of the school year to pay eligible students. These funds can be accessed as soon as eligibility is documented, the cost of attendance (COA) is calculated, and enrollment occurs. Although a few commenters suggested that establishing Pell Grant eligibility might represent an administrative burden, the sequence described herein in fact streamlines the funding decision process for the JTPA delivery system and permits coordination of funding sources in the context of the ISS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of comments questioned a perceived inconsistency between Department of Education and Department of Labor guidance on whether HEA title IV or JTPA funds must be used first. The Department does not think there is any conflict with Department of Education regulations with regard to coordinating with JTPA funding decisions for tuition payments because of the flexibility in the use of the Pell Grant for tuition or other education related expenses. These JTPA regulations only require that, when a Pell Grant is awarded to a JTPA participant, JTPA funds cannot be expended on costs that already have been paid by federal Pell Grant funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter questioned the need for including the participant's agreement to the disposition of the Pell Grant in the contract with the school, since it is understood that the participant will sign off on the ISS, which includes information to be shared. Another commenter raised the issue of the Privacy Act as a reason why schools may not share information regarding JTPA participants with SDA's. To clarify the issue of participant agreement, the final rule includes the participant's agreement to the information-sharing process in &sect;627.220(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities struggle as buyers hold back THE LATEST bull run in London's equity market met its first check yesterday, when a new intraday peak was quickly lost, and by the end of the session the FT-SE 100 Index was barely able to hold on to the 3,100 mark, or Friday's peak close. Modest trading volume suggested that little stock had been sold, but the mood suddenly appeared a little less confident than last week. UK equities at first followed the trend in other European stock markets, and an advance of 14.5 points took the Footsie to 3,115.1. Share prices were also helped initially by further gains in British government bonds, where long-dated interest yields dipped to only just above 7 per cent. Falling bond yields have been providing support for equities, and the stock market reacted sharply late yesterday when bond prices were trimmed. Much of the session focused on the market's attempt to hold on to the 3,100 level, which was lost briefly early in the afternoon. With the market now evidently looking vulnerable to profit-taking, some strategists suggested that a convincing fall below 3,100 might provoke a significant setback. Marketmakers were still short of stock yesterday and quickly came in to buy at the day's low point of 3,096.6, and the market rallied to a close on the FT-SE 100 of 3,100.0, a loss of a mere 0.6 on the day. Further attempts to test the level of support for the 3,100 mark are believed likely this week, however. The picture was much the same across the full range of the market, with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index finally stand-ing a net 1.4 off at 3,511.9. Seaq volume fell away sharply to 476.1m shares, with non-Footsie stocks showing increased activity to make up about 63 per cent of the total. On Friday, Seaq volume of 529.2m shares was worth Pounds 1.25bn in retail value, holding up to recent daily averages. With autumn now overshadowing a stock market that has enjoyed a spectacularly successful August holiday month, analysts were focusing attention on the heavy list of company results now facing investors. The banking sector was dominated yesterday by interim figures from HSBC, although shares in the Hong Kong bank took the result calmly to close little changed. Tomorrow brings trading news from, among other leaders of UK industry, Reckitt &amp; Col-man, Rolls-Royce and Vickers. Few market strategists have raised their year-end forecasts for the Footsie during the latest upswing in share prices, and many now fear that UK equities could be due for a correction. At Salomon International, Mr Marcus Grubb said that the cheapest European equity markets relative to bonds appear to be France, Spain and Italy, rather than the UK. Any significant delay in Bundesbank easing, or a 'double-dip' in the German economy, could, he believes, prompt a sharp setback in equity markets. A negative factor for the market was a report that Norwich Union, the UK insurance group and heavy investor in UK securities, has turned bearish on secondary oil shares, of which it has been a strong holder. But this was counterbalanced yesterday by continued firmness in the pharmaceutical stocks, which have been attracting US investors again. But retail and consumer shares kept up their hopes for an early cut in UK base rates.</p>

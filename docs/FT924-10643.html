			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Bonn budget deficit likely to soar past 1993 target THE German government's budget deficit for 1993 seems certain to rise by several billion D-Marks above the forecast DM38bn (Pounds 15.3bn), in spite of strenuous efforts to find more savings, according to senior officials. The partners in the coalition remain clearly divided about the extent to which drastic cuts in spending must be found, and the extent to which the deficit can be allowed to rise. The 1993 budget is for DM435.65bn, and the DM38bn deficit is a slight reduction on this year's DM40bn. Although all are talking of 'drastic and painful savings', there is no consensus about where they should be made, or how great they should be. Chancellor Helmut Kohl himself warned on Wednesday that 'there is a gap between what we say and what we do.' While urging savings, he seemed to warn against making excessive cuts in the biggest areas of state subsidies - agriculture, coal mining and shipbuilding. Leaders of the Free Democratic party (FDP), the junior coalition partner, are calling for a savings package of at least DM10bn, and a regulation enforcing across-the-board cuts to achieve it. However Finance Ministry officials confirmed yesterday that Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU), is only proposing cuts to pay for inevitable increased spending, and not to take account of a certain drop in tax revenues. 'The savings package will be well below DM10bn,' one official said yesterday. 'The reduced revenues caused by slower growth next year have yet to be finally calculated, but they will be covered by an increase in the deficit.' Mr Kohl has warned that a 1 per cent drop in growth next year - already forecast by the Economics Ministry - will cost DM10bn in lower revenues. Of those, the central exchequer must bear the brunt of about half, the rest reducing the income of the 16 federal states. The Finance Ministry suggested yesterday that DM10bn would be the 'absolute maximum' of any drop in revenues for the central government next year, which would have to be added to the net borrowing requirement. The forecast slowdown in growth in western Germany - now put by the Economics Ministry at 1.0-1.5 per cent in 1993, and by the country's leading economic institutes at only 0.5 per cent - is also a key factor behind the increased spending pressure. Top political sources say the Federal Labour Office alone, responsible for paying unemployment benefit, needs an extra DM3bn. On top of that, there are a series of urgent new measures planned for boosting recovery in eastern Germany, due to be presented to the German cabinet next week. They will also add several billion D-Marks on the spending side.</p>

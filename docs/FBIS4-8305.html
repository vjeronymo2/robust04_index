			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 11 (CTK) -- The new Slovak  Government's intention to accelerate economic change cannot be  effectuated without an eye on the social fallout of reform,  Deputy Premier Roman Kovac told CTK.    "If we launch economic transformations such that the  population cannot hold out to the end, this social  unacceptability will put the brakes on economic reform once  again," he said.    About Slovakia's high (14.8 percent) unemployment, Kovac  said  that "especially disquieting is the large share of long-term  unemployment, which is threatening to become unemployability.  More than a third of the people without work are below the age  of 25. This is a very bad start to life."    He described the onset of a decline in unemployment in  districts where economic change is apparently happening faster  and strengthening the private sector as a springboard. The new  government's recipe for reducing unemployment comes from  understanding that the solution lies not with the Ministry of  Labor and Social Affairs, but with the economics ministries.    "The fastest method of eliminating unemployment lies in  developing small and medium businesses and the neglected area of  tourism, although this could suck up the work force like a  sponge," he said. "If we are able to start a system of  supporting small and medium businesses, we will hold  unemployment below the desired ceiling of 17 percent."    The system is to consist of simplified legal regulations,  clear rules for rapid privatization, easier availability of  credit, and tax breaks for businesses. This system should also  restore the confidence of foreign investors, whose interest in  Slovakia weakened last year, Kovac said.    The solution also lies in better preparation for the  restructuring of the economy so that companies can alter their  production plans rapidly, and in the launching of large  construction projects such as highways, the reconstruction of  the railways, the completion of the Mochovce nuclear power  plant, or a dam in Zilina, West Slovakia.    In the meantime, the government must keep alive the  educational and health care systems, which have reached a  critical condition because of "ill considered restrictions  without (properly) prepared systemic measures." The health care  system, threatened by debts of 50 billion Slovak crowns ($1.5  billion) from uncompleted construction projects and obsolete  equipment and 1.8 billion crowns ($54 million) for unpaid-for  medications and other materials, should be protected through  emergency financing at the beginning, but changes must be  adopted quickly, Kovac said.    "It is necessary to complete the privatization of pharmacies  and to set in motion the privatization of spas and the  activities of the health profession. This is possible only  under a relatively stable system of incentives.... I believe it  will be possible to introduce the new system as early as June or  July."    A compromise under preparation with the labor unions on  changes in the Tripartite (government, labor, employers) General  Agreement should also help preserve social peace, Kovac said.  But concluding talks with the unions depends on the views of  the International Monetary Fund concerning the new government's  economic program.</p>

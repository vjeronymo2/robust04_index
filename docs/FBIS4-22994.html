N. Alekseyev, Zoological Institute, Russian </F> Academy of Sciences, Saint Petersburg; UDC 591.522:576.895.421]    [Text] Since the time of publication of Ye. N. Pavlovskiy's  study [9] regarding the natural nidality of transmissive  diseases, it has been conventional to classify vectors as  primary and secondary. No consideration has been given  heretofore to the mutual influence of vectors on each other and  on the properties of pathogens that they carry in zones of  overlapping or noncoincidence of the territories of such  vectors. Among others, this applies to vectors of the pathogens  of tick encephalitis (TE) and Lyme disease (borreliosis): ticks  of the genus Ixodes (I. persulcatus and I. ricinus) of the  Palaearctic. On European territories there are both zones of  sympatry of their populations, and zones where circulation of  each of the aforementioned pathogens is spread by only one  species of the genus Ixodes, i.e. territories where the  populations of these species are completely allopatric in virtue  of the action of abiotic factors.    It is taken as established that the most active vector of  both the aforementioned pathogens on the territory of Russia is  the taiga tick I. persulcatus [7, 10] with territory totally  coincident with the region of prevalence of strains of the TE  virus that are virulent for man.    In some areas, e.g. in Moskovskaya Oblast, there are  territories where populations of I. persulcatus and I.  ricinus--vectors of borrelias (Borrelia burgdorferi)--are both  sympatric and allopatric. Studies of 482 ticks of both species  collected in this region in 1991-1992 have revealed that I.  persulcatus was infected with borrelias in 28.7 percent of  cases, and I. ricinus was so infected in 18.5 percent of cases.  The TE virus was never once isolated in a virusological study of  the same ticks. To ascertain the role of sympatry in spreading  circulation of Borrelia burgdorferi in ticks of the species  Ixodes, all data of occurrence of I. persulcatus and I. ricinus,  as well as borrelias in them, were plotted on a map of rayons of  Moskovskaya Oblast. As we can see from Fig. 1, the occurrence of  I. ricinus is relatively uniform in this region, whereas  findings of I. persulcatus are confined to its northeastern  half. It was to this region that nearly all cases of detection  of borrelias were confined, i.e. almost all of them were in the  zone of sympatry. All cases of detection of TE, which is spread  mainly by taiga ticks, are also confined to this region (VI on  Fig. 1). Taken together, this suggests that not only are cases  of isolation of pathogens from taiga ticks and people associated  with the major role of I. persulcatus, but isolation of  borrelias from I. ricinus sympatric with this tick also depends  on the presence and behavioral specifics of the primary vector:  the tick I. persulcatus.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-83A>      Fig. 1. </FIG>        Table 1.

Plus--presence of infected ticks;  plus-minus--presence of both infected and uninfected ticks;  0--absence of concrrent species; infection of ticks was not  observed in 1988-1990.    In regions where both species of ticks were encountered  (Fig.  1), occurrence of the pathogen B. burgdorferi in I. ricinus  ticks clearly depended on the presence of I. persulcatus on the  same territories, both uninfected (more precisely not found to  be infected), and, in particular, infected. As can be seen from  Table 1, infected I. ricinus are found in zones of sympatry  8.7-9 times more frequently than where I. ricinus has no  concurrent species (p &gt;  0.999). Borrelias in I.  ricinus were isolated from allopatric populations in only one  out of 12 regions where it is encountered without I.  persulcatus, namely in the southwestern part of the region.  Conversely, in regions where I. persulcatus occurs alone, the  populations of this species of tick were infected with B.  burgdorferi in 50 percent of cases. The extent of infection of  I. ricinus in the sole allopatric population was 12.5 percent,  whereas it exceeds 30 percent in populations that are sympatric  with the taiga tick. The extent of infection of I. ricinus  reached a maximum (50 percent) in the most northerly  rayon--Taldomskiy Rayon (1 on Fig. 1)--where 80 percent of the  collected ticks were I. persulcatus and the rate of infection of  the taiga tick is close to maximum (about 40 percent). The rate  of infection of I. persulcatus is significantly greater than for  I. ricinus: from 44 to 1014 borrelias in 250 fields of view as  compared with 1-41 for I. ricinus. Clearly the taiga tick is a  more active and independent vector of borrelias, and the reason  that the vector I. ricinus when sympatric with the taiga tick  becomes a more active carrier, and apparently a vector of  borreliosis, is that I. persulcatus is present on the same  territories. Taken together, this suggests that the taiga tick  is the source of a more acarotropic and virulent pathogen for I.  ricinus. And this in turn suggests the hypothesis of existence  of two races, perhaps even subspecies, of borrelias carried by  different species of ticks: B. burgdorferi persulcati with the  taiga tick as host, and B. burgdorferi ricini with I. ricinus as  the vector. And as we can see from Table 1, transfer of the  former to I. ricinus is more easily accomplished than transfer  of B. burgdorferi ricini to I. persulcatus.    We believe that the transfer mechanism itself is linked to  changes in the behavior of infected individuals in response to  markers of the external environment, as occurs with ticks  infected with the neurotropic virus of TE [1-3], the more so as  B. burgdorferi is also neurotropic [11]. By using a T-shaped  olfactometer to separate ticks with respect to behavior in  response to the scent of poplar, it was established that more  than half of ticks of both species react positively to the scent  in cases where borrelias are subsequently found in them. And  only isolated infected individuals reacted negatively.    Positive responses to scent were somewhat more pronounced In  I. persulcatus, which may be due to their more massive infection  and the greater effect of the pathogens on their nervous system.  It cannot be ruled out that more active intermixing of ticks on  hosts within plant communities in which isolated plants are  attractants for infected individuals constitutes a basis for  more active proliferation of borrelias among vectors in their  zones of sympatry. The epidemiological significance of this  factor must be taken into consideration, as secondary specific  vectors in such zones play a much greater role than on  territories that are only endemic with respect to their own  species. Such are the patterns of coexistence of vectors in  zones of permanent sympatry.    However, the phenomenon of sympatry may also be temporary in  cases where man brings in the three-membered parasitic system in  its entirety into a territory with secondary vector, thereby  temporarily upsetting the normal existence of allopatric  populations. The territory of Crimea, where only I. ricinus is  encountered, was free of TE in consequence of ancient man-made  transformation of the environment [5]. Favorable conditions were  maintained by the absence of a virulent pathogen in spite of the  presence of hosts for ticks, and vectors of the western variety  of TE: Ixodes ricinus. This was the situation until July of  1980, when the first patient was reported with antibodies to the  antigen of the TE virus of the far eastern strain Sofyin 181.  The antibody to TE of this strain has been identified in birds,  mouse-like rodents and humans, and the TE virus is from ixodid  ticks [4]. By the mid eighties, the TE clinic had already noted  the western variety of the disease. Hence a nidus of TE has  developed again in Crimea with a strain of the virus of far  eastern type that is gradually losing its initial highly  virulent properties, apparently because 34 wild pigs were flown  in from Primorskiy Kray in 1957 to reestablish the species that  had disappeared during wartime. The pigs were not exterminated  and were trapped during the peak of activity of I. persulcatus  ticks in active nidi of TE. When they were released in a game  reserve, they created a temporary sympatry of the two Ixodes  species together with a reservoir of the pathogen. The I.  persulcatus rapidly perished, having formed an ephemeral  population for the Crimean climate, and thenceforth the virus  was circulated by I. ricinus alone, gradually spreading over the  territory of the mountain forest region of Crimea, losing the  properties of the highly pathogenic eastern strain of the TE  virus due to the new vector and milder climatic conditions, but  remaining antigenically close to the initial far eastern strain.  Temporary ``hand-made'' has given rise to a stable nidus of TE  in an allopatric population of vectors of the western variety of  TE: Ixodes ricinus.    The foregoing draws attention to the importance of the  phenomenon of sympatry (even temporary) of carriers and vectors  of more virulent strains (races, species) of pathogens with  vectors that are secondary for operation of nidi of transmissive  diseases, and assessment of their danger for man.

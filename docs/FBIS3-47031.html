			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The idea of setting up a quadrilateral economic  conference for promoting free trade has cropped up among Japan,  the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The four countries have  begun studying the idea with the Japanese Foreign Ministry  playing a leading role. They are expected to hold the first  working-level meeting as early as mid-1994. It is likely that  the proposed conference will be in the form of an unrestricted,  loose consultative organization to study issues such as  quadrilateral cooperation on economic policies and what the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference ought to be  like.    The idea is based on a report worked out in 1992 by the  Japan-Mexico Committee Toward the 21st Century--which was  established by the governments and private sectors of the two  countries. Concrete details of the idea will be discussed from  now on. The idea has been formulated with the enforcement of  the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] taken into  consideration. Moreover, there are concerns about the U.S.  attitude of giving priority to bilateral talks other than  multilateral talks when trying to solve trade issues.    The Japanese Government intends to make the quadrilateral  conference a "stage for multilateral dialogue and consultations  to enhance economic cooperation and study ways of dealing with  trade disputes." However, the government has no intention of  producing a free trade zone like NAFTA that could be  discriminatory against nonmember nations.    As the first summit meeting of the APEC was held in November  1993, cooperative relations within the Asia-Pacific region have  strengthened. However, Japan and the Association of Southeast  Asian Nations (ASEAN) have expressed concern that NAFTA will  lead to a bloc economy. Although Malaysia has proposed the idea  of establishing the East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC), the  United States and other countries, which are excluded from the  idea, have opposed it. In this way, discord still remains  within APEC.    Because it is certain that Japan will play a leading role if  the economic conference is established, the idea is likely to  arouse the interest of neighboring countries.</p>

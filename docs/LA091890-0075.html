			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CITIES SOFTEN THEIR UNDERCOUNT CHARGES;  </P> <P> CENSUS: LOS ANGELES AND OTHER METROPOLITAN AREAS, HOWEVER, STILL CONTEND THAT  THERE ARE SERIOUS ERRORS. ORANGE COUNTY HAS RAISED NO CHALLENGES.  </P> <P> After complaining that preliminary 1990 census figures grossly underestimated  the growth of their populations over the past decade, officials in many big  cities -- including Los Angeles -- say that census counts may not be quite as  far off as the critics originally alleged.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, officials in Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and other  metropolitan areas continue to say that there were serious errors in the Census  Bureau's population count, which could cost local governments seats in Congress  and hundreds of millions of dollars in federal assistance.  </P> <P> In an official challenge forwarded to Washington late Monday, Los Angeles  officials said they had turned up 49,513 more dwellings than the 1.3 million  units counted by the Census Bureau. While that difference of 3.8% could  translate into thousands of people and millions of dollars in government aid,  the figure is well below the 10% housing underestimate Los Angeles officials  had originally predicted.  </P> <P> As it stands, the Census Bureau has put the city's 1990 population at 3.42  million -- 15% above the 1980 level. But the challenge over housing units, when  translated into residents, could bring that figure up by 123,783 -- a total  about equal to the population of Pasadena.  </P> <P> "The possibility of missing anyone who resides in the Los Angeles area can have  a devastating impact on the federal funds we may receive to provide needed city  services," Mayor Tom Bradley said from Frankfurt, West Germany, while on a  mission to promote tourism.  </P> <P> During the remainder of this week, cities and towns across the country will be  scurrying to complete formal responses to the initial census figures.  </P> <P> In Orange County, no governmental agency has so far challenged any of the  preliminary census counts.  </P> <P> After the 1980 census, Santa Ana officials complained that upwards of 50,000  residents -- most of them Latino newcomers living in the shadows of society --  were left uncounted. But the city launched a massive effort to encourage  residents to cooperate with the census, and officials say the 1990 count  practically exceeded their expectations.  </P> <P> William Bellamy, U.S. Bureau of the Census district director in Orange County,  said other large cities in Orange County also have appeared satisfied with the  Census Bureau's preliminary counts. The only city in Orange County that has  indicated it was taking a hard, second look at the preliminary figures is  Westminster, but no challenge has yet been mounted by that city, Bellamy said.  </P> <P> By the end of last week the Census Bureau had received formal responses from  4,341, or 11%, of all local governments, but not all have formally challenged  the census numbers.  </P> <P> "We've actually received a lot of letters here accepting our counts, telling us  we were right in the ball park," said Denise Smith, an official in the Census  Bureau's regional office that covers all of New England and Upstate New York.  </P> <P> In Houston, a week before the deadline, officials were finding the local review  of housing units much closer to the census count than they had expected.  Nonetheless, city officials were challenging the Census Bureau's contention  that Houston has 1.61 million residents and essentially has not grown since  1980.  </P> <P> In Philadelphia, officials were disturbed but not surprised by the census  conclusion that population has eroded over the past decade, with city dwellers  fleeing in ever-larger numbers to the suburbs. While officials there thought  the census count was off, they also acknowledged that their numbers were not as  different as they had thought. Based on earlier estimates, city officials said  the census had overlooked as many as 97,000 dwellings. In fact, the post-census  review of building permits and other records showed that the census undercount  was closer to 67,000 units, said Barbara J. Kaplan, executive director of the  city Planning Commission.  </P> <P> In a few places, officials continued to say the numbers would be as bad -- and  in some cases, worse -- than anticipated. In Chicago, a week before the  deadline, the difference between the census count and the local review was  "large and growing larger," said Susan Weed, a community development  demographer.  </P> <P> New York's deadline is also later this week, but officials there continued to  be outspoken in their criticism of the preliminary census count of 600,000  fewer residents than the city had a decade ago -- a situation that officials  say is preposterous, given their large homeless population and the city's  economic growth.  </P> <P> At a hearing in Washington last week, Barbara Everitt Bryant, the director of  the Census Bureau, responded sharply to the New York officials in her first  public statement since the agency released the preliminary 1990 counts last  month.  </P> <P> If New York's population did not drop, she said at the hearing, "Why did the  school enrollment drop by 54,000? Why do the moving vans show more people going  out than coming in?"  </P> <P> The bureau has until mid-October to assess the challenges, at which time it  will begin preparing a final gross count of the population, due on the  President's desk by Dec. 31.  </P> <P> While these operations and last-minute efforts are under way to correct the  preliminary census count of 245.8 million, census statisticians will be  evaluating what is known as the post-enumeration survey, a statistical survey  analyzing how well the regular census did in finding such hard-to-count  residents as immigrants and inner-city residents.  </P> <P> Los Angeles, New York and other cities and states, along with civic and civil  rights groups, filed a lawsuit after the 1980 census seeking to force a  statistical correction of the 1990 census based on this study. Although the  lawsuit is pending, the commerce department did agree to conduct the study to  make an adjustment possible, if the Secretary of Commerce decides it is  necessary.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Finland Learning Submarine Hunting </F> in Sweden"]    [Text] Finland and Sweden are going to study possibilities  of establishing closer cooperation regarding signal lights and  sonar scanning in antisubmarine warfare [ASW]. Joint training is  also something Finland would like to discuss.    Within two weeks a group of Finnish experts -- among them  Commander Juha Rannikko, chief of the ASW Office on the Naval  Headquarters Staff -- will go to Sweden in order to discuss with  their Swedish colleagues what forms of closer cooperation could  be achieved.    Swedish naval sources refused comment on this matter, which  can be seen as involving a sensitive area.    Lieutenant Colonel Soren Trygg of the Swedish Defense  Staff's  Naval Command stated in response to a direct question from  [Swedish news service] FLT that he "is prevented from commenting  on this," and refused to give any further information on the  issue.    The background to this is that the Finnish and Swedish naval  chiefs in discussions held in 1992 and 1993 came to agreement on  studying the possibilities for developing cooperation and  exchanging experiences "in analysis and operations for passive  and active sonar systems."    Finland would like to have access to the Swedish Navy's  advanced training simulators, equipment which Finland lacks.    "We will first and foremost look at the simulators that the  Swedish Navy has. We are even considering acquiring similar  equipment ourselves. Another alternative we discussed is whether  we could be allowed to train our own operators on the Swedish  equipment," said Rannikko in a telephone interview with the FLT  news service.    On the other hand, said Rannikko, it is not a question of  any  active cooperation between Sweden and Finland in hunting foreign  submarines.    Rannikko refused to comment on how many Finnish military  personnel would be involved in such possible training in Sweden.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / The Balkan disease: West Europeans may not be immune, as the Slovenia-Italy dispute shows If there is one indisputable success story in post-communist central Europe, five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it is surely Slovenia. I think of Slovenia as 'the one that got away'. It was part of Yugoslavia, but succeeded in extricating itself at the price of a phoney war lasting one week, in which only eight of its people were killed. Since then, its leaders have been at pains to explain, to anyone who will listen, that Slovenia is not a Balkan country. It is, they tell you, a central European country: normal, peaceful, a showcase of transition to democracy and the market. Already 60 per cent of its foreign trade is with the European Union, and that will rise to more than two-thirds when Austria joins the EU in two months. Per capita income is higher than that of Greece or Portugal. Like the Czech lands, Slovenia was formerly in the Austrian part of the Habsburg empire, whereas Croatia, like Slovakia, was in the Hungarian part. It may not be pure coincidence that Slovenia and the Czech Republic are the two central European countries identified by the European Commission as likely to be ready for EU membership by the end of the decade. Certainly Slovenia, with its lush Alpine scenery and evident prosperity, feels like a southward extension of Austria, only with much lower prices. British ministers will have heard all this ad nauseam in the past two days, as they have been entertaining the Slovenian prime minister, Mr Janez Drnovsek. Slovenia's leaders have an obsessive fear that their achievements are not recognised in the west. They react instantly to any implied hint that Slovenia is still in the 'Balkan' or 'former Yugoslav' category. Ironically, in its haste to escape from the Balkans and join western Europe, Slovenia has tripped up on a dispute of what might be considered the 'Balkan' type, only with a west European country. What would be a typical Balkan conflict, in the sense in which Slovenes and west Europeans use that term? One in which ethnically defined states make claims on each other in the name of kinsfolk living the 'wrong' side of a frontier. One in which the crimes of people long since dead are called in evidence to justify an alarmist interpretation of the behaviour or intentions of people wearing the same state or ethnic labels today. And, perhaps, one in which inter-state quarrels are exacerbated by domestic power struggles, as some politicians raise nationalist slogans to advance their cause, while others fear losing popularity and influence if they resist. All those elements are present in the dispute between Slovenia and Italy. Its roots lie deep in the more unpleasant episodes of 20th century European history, when nation states in the grip of totalitarian ideologies tried to set their exclusive stamp on lands where different identities had long coexisted and overlapped. The eastern coast of the Adriatic was such a land. For centuries its ports and fishing villages had a Roman or Venetian culture, while the shepherds and farmers of the overlooking hill country spoke south Slavonic dialects - but goods, ideas and vocabulary were freely exchanged between the two. Only in the 19th century did the difference become political, as Italian nationalists laid claim to the area and the Habsburg authorities countered by encouraging education in the Slav vernaculars. After the first world war, Italy, as a victor power, annexed the Istrian peninsula. Soon afterwards Mussolini came to power and set about ensuring its Italian character with all the tact and subtlety for which he was famous. In the second world war the wheel of fortune turned. Italy was defeated. Tito's partisans triumphed and incorporated the area into Yugoslavia, except the city of Trieste, from which the western allies evicted them. In 1954 the great powers converted de facto control into de jure sovereignty. Italians living in what became Yugoslav territory were given the choice of accepting Yugoslav citizenship or moving to Italy. Most of them moved, preferring democracy among their kith and kin to life in an alien and unsympathetic communist state. Altogether some 350,000 Italians left Istria after 1945: roughly 60 per cent from the Croatian part and 40 per cent from the Slovenian. In 1983 Yugoslavia agreed to compensate them for the property they had left behind. Slovenia, as a successor state, is happy to continue its share of the payments. But Italy now refuses to accept compensation, arguing that Italians should have the same rights given to Slovenian citizens - to claim back property taken from them by the Yugoslav state, and to bid for publicly owned real estate when it is put up for sale. Slovenes fear being bought out of house and home by superior Italian (and German and Austrian) purchasing power. They also see the Italian request as an attempt, egged on by neo-fascists in Silvio Berlusconi's government, to reopen the postwar borders: a dangerous precedent for Europe as a whole. Italy is now blocking the opening of negotiations on an association agreement between Slovenia and the EU until the bilateral dispute is settled. Last month Slovenia sent a lame-duck foreign minister to negotiate, then repudiated the compromise text that he brought back. Which side, one is tempted to ask, is behaving in a more 'Balkan' manner? But perhaps that is the wrong question. The right question is whether west Europeans are justified in thinking themselves immune from 'Balkan' reflexes  -or whether, if they do not find better ways to treat it, they will not gradually fall victim to the Balkan disease themselves.</p>

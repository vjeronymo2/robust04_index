			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Lords deal blows to education bill The government warned that it would call on the Commons to overturn blows dealt yesterday by the House of Lords to its policy of higher-education reforms. The Lords approved by a two-vote margin an amendment to the education bill to ensure that schools act in partnership with universities when training postgraduate teachers. Peers also carried a linked amendment stipulating that schools involved in the initial training of teachers must be accredited by an appropriate higher-education body. Universities had already forced the government to withdraw another part of the bill restricting student unions to a narrow list of core activities. Opposition spokesmen said the entire bill should now be withdrawn. Viscount Eccles, a former education minister, and Lord Beloff, an academic, were among Conservative backbenchers who joined Labour and Liberal Democrat peers in supporting the partnership amendment, which was carried by 123 votes to 121. Assurances by Baroness Blatch, education minister, that only schools judged suitable would be allowed to provide school-centred courses for postgraduates failed to satisfy the critics. She claimed there was no real difference between the government and opposition peers over the need to provide for high standards and high-quality teaching. Lord Judd, Labour spokesman on education in the Lords, who moved the amendment, suggested that the qualifications of those who enrolled on school-centred courses would be of limited value. He feared the emergence of 'tinpot' certificates associated with one local school. Lord Eccles warned that if schools providing such courses did not have a real working partnership with universities, the status of teachers would not be improved. 'So long as teachers are considered beneath other professions, we are not going to get our education right,' he said. Lord Judd hailed the incorporation of the schools-universities partnership amendment in the bill as 'a wonderful result for a civilised approach to education', while Lord Russell, a Liberal Democrat peer, described it as 'a substantial damage-limitation exercise'. Labour claimed that the amendment would have a serious impact on ministers' plans to allow schools to run teacher training courses on their own. Shadow education secretary Mrs Ann Taylor said it 'tears out the heart of the bill'. She added: 'After the embarrassing climbdown over student union reforms, there is nothing left to argue about. John Patten (education secretary) should withdraw this divisive and unnecessary bill immediately.' Mr Don Foster, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said: 'Given widespread opposition to the government's proposals on teacher training, now is the time for them to admit defeat and withdraw the entire bill.' Professor Peter Mortimore, director of London University's Institute of Education, commented: 'To cut higher education out of the equation is wrong and denies the students the chance to gain the skills not only to do the job but to improve and reflect on it and also to see what life is like outside that school.'</p>

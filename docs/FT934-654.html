			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: J Billam warning Shares in J Billam, the specialist engineer, fell 50p to 219p yesterday as the company warned of a downturn at its Aircraft and Sheet Metal Engineers subsidiary. A number of restructuring expenses had been incurred which could lead to a reduction of up to Pounds 100,000 in full year profits. The two other offshoots were trading in line with expectations and directors expect to maintain the final dividend at 3.1p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by David </F> Stahlavsky; place and date not given]    [Excerpt] [David Stahlavsky] Prime Minister, our  government, in the process of correcting the wrongs of the past,  has gone quite far. One problem still remains to be solved:  compensation to the victims of fascism. You indicated at  Jachymov that the solution is at hand. How far is the temporal  horizon of this solution?    [Klaus] Naturally, this matter has two components. One  component is the political sphere: What kind of a signal it is,  what sort of a decision it is, from both the internal political  point of view and the foreign political one. The second thing  is the technical aspect of this compensation. I think that,  basically, we have gone quite a long way in the technical  aspect. One indeed has to understand it not as compensation.  We always translate these words into mitigation of wrongs  because compensation somehow implies the feeling that something  is in the ratio of one to one. As to all the restitution and  rehabilitation claims, they are never in the ratio of one to  one. We all know this very well. One cannot compensate for one  minute's stay in a concentration camp by anything. I know this  very well. That is why we say mitigation of wrongs. That is  why I also think that it should be [word indistinct], where the  wrongs were greatest, and it should not apply to the group of  those in enforced labor who, no doubt, we all consider a smaller  group, where smaller wrongs were committed. So what we could  manage from our means on a temporary basis is to do with the  greatest wrongs.    From the internal and foreign political viewpoints, it has  its important aspect and we are very well aware of it, and I  repeat and say clearly and distinctly that, from our point of  view, it does not mean at all diminishing or giving up claims  toward the German side in these matters. It is simply our own  personal responsibility toward our fellow citizens who are  fairly old now, and I do not think one can put it off much  longer. [passage omitted]</p>

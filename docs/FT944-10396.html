			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Two left in Spanish phone race Last minute withdrawals in the contest to enter the Spanish mobile telephone market have narrowed the field to two consortia, which will deliver their bids on Monday. The licence, to be awarded before the end of the year, is the first significant step in a deregulation process that, over the next three years, will introduce cable television and end Telefonica's monopoly as a national basic telephony operator. The latest defections include Repsol and Gas Natural, the two leading Spanish energy companies, and the US operators BellSouth and GTE. A rapid realignment leaves two consortia. One has Air Touch of the US and BT of the UK as its technological partners and is backed by Banco Santander and Banco Central Hispano as principal shareholders; the other groups the UK's Racal Vodafone and Germany's Veba with Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and retail chain Corte Ingles and media group Prisa among other partners.</p>

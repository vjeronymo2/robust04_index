			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The New York man accused of being the subway vigilante who gunned down three  youths he suspected of mugging him asserted his innocence, calling his arrest a  case of mistaken identity. Clemente Jackson, 21, has consistently denied he was  the gunman who called out "Remember me?" before shooting three youths he  believed had mugged him the day before at the same Brooklyn subway station.  Speaking at a Manhattan news conference the day after he was freed on $2,500  bail, Jackson described his ordeal as a "nightmare," and asserted police had  arrested the wrong man June 22. Justice Michael Pesce reduced Jackson's bail  from $50,000 after five witnesses testified that the suspect was on Long Island  the night of the shooting, said Nancy Young, a spokeswoman for the Brooklyn  district attorney's office.  </P></p>

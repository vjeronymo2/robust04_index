			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIBERIA REBEL LEADER HURT IN CRASH  </P> <P> Rebel leader Charles Taylor suffered minor injuries in an auto accident,  delaying his departure for peace talks with a rival rebel chief and an envoy of  President Samuel K. Doe, a rebel official said Friday.  </P> <P> Tom Woewiyu, Taylor's spokesman and defense minister, said the accident  occurred as the rebel chief prepared to leave Liberia for talks Monday in  Banjul, Gambia, on how to resolve Liberia's eight-month civil war.  </P> <P> The accident was not serious, but Taylor returned to the Firestone rubber  plantation clinic for treatment and to arrange new transport, Woewiyu said from  Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The plantation is 35 miles southeast of Monrovia.  </P> <P> Woewiyu did not say when Taylor would leave Liberia for Banjul.  </P> <P> The meeting was announced Thursday by Gambian government sources. Word of the  talks could lead to further delays in the deployment of a six-nation West  African force charged with halting the fighting.  </P> <P> In a related development, U.S. Marines Friday flew about 360 Indian refugees  from Liberia to Freetown, capital of neighboring Sierra Leone. A U.S. Embassy  spokesman in Freetown told reporters that the Marines had evacuated about 700  people in the past week, mostly foreigners, and would continue evacuating the  capital this weekend.  </P></p>

The headquarters will include members of the Federal  Interior  Ministry, the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service, the Federal  Prosecutor's Office and the Federal Committee for Emergencies,  as well as Moscow officials.    As is known, terrorists from the Vozmezdie (Retribution)  group have demanded that the Yakutsk authorites hand over to  them US$500,000 and 500 million rubles at Yakutsk Airport on  February 4. The terrorists threaten to explode the city's life  supporting installations if their demand is not met.    Experts of the Russian Interior Ministry believe that the  threat of the explosion is no more than a bluff since the  criminals need only money. Moreover, competent bodies together  with army specialists are carrying out operational measures to  locate and defuse any possible explosive devices.    The Trans-Baikal regional centre of the Federal Ministry for  Emergencies has been put on red alert. Rescue teams are on  board an aircraft at a Moscow airport, ready to take off for  Yakutsk any time.</p>

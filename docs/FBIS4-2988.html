			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bill Wang] </F>   [Text] Washington, April 14 (CNA) -- Taiwan is expected to  buy some 200 patriot missiles, similar to those used by the  US-led alliance in the 1991 Persian Gulf war against Iraqi Scud  missiles, informed sources and the producer of Patriots said  Thursday [14 April].    A spokesman for Raytheon Co. told CNA that "we expect Taiwan  to buy Patriots, but we are still waiting for word from the  Taiwan Government in order to finalize the deal."    He said that negotiations for the sale have been going on  for  sometime, and there are still some differences to be ironed out  before a final deal can be reached.    Informed sources here said that the two sides have yet to  agree on the price of the missiles and other matters.    The sources said that the patriot air defense system  batteries Taiwan plans to purchase will be an improved version  of the Patriots used in the Gulf war.    According to the US Defense Department, after studying the  missile's performance in the war, the US Army and Raytheon have  made both hardware and software improvements on the system aimed  to increase accuracy.</p>

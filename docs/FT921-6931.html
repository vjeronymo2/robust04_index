			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: Nordstrom turns in 11% fall in profits to Dollars 40.9m NORDSTROM, the Seattle-based group once seen as a star in the US retail sector but which has stalled recently, yesterday reported an 11.7 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profits to Dollars 40.9m after tax. This compared with Dollars 46.3m seen in the same three-month period, to end-January, a year earlier, and was scored on sales up by 8.4 per cent at Dollars 978m. The final quarter's figures leave Nordstrom with a Dollars 135.8m net profit for the year, against Dollars 115.8m in the previous 12 months. Earnings at the pre-tax level were Dollars 217.2m for the year (Dollars 178.3m), and Dollars 64.1m (Dollars 70.1m) for the quarter. The fashion speciality retailer conceded that the retail environment had been difficult, and that the fourth quarter had been weaker than originally anticipated. It blamed this on December's performance in particular, and maintained that sales in southern California were proving especially 'challenging'. The company has 68 stores in nine states at present, biased towards the West Coast. It expects to open another three 'full-line' stores this year - in Minnesota, New Jersey and Maryland - and two clearance outlets.</p>

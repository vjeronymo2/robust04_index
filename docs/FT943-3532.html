			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Crimea president lifts blockade The president of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula lifted his blockade of parliament yesterday but the two sides appeared to be far apart in resolving a struggle over who is to run the pro-Russian region. After reopening the parliament, President Yuri Meshkov announced that he had agreed to Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma's 'zero option' compromise of withdrawing the decrees that closed down the parliament in return for the assembly rescinding a law trimming the president's powers. But members of parliament, locked out of their building for two days, are still objecting to the zero option. 'I appeal to deputies to start talks tomorrow. An agreement has been reached,' President Meshkov said in a two-minute address to parliament. 'I am prepared to meet you to work out a solution to the constitutional crisis.' He then walked out of the chamber, giving deputies no chance to question him. President Meshkov issued decrees on Sunday denouncing parliament as corrupt, suspending its activities, calling for a new constitution and taking control of local radio and television.</p>

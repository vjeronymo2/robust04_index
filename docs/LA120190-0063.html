"We had young students, older people, Vietnam vets, church  people, doctors, women's organizations, environmental groups."  </P> <P> She said parents of soldiers now in Saudi Arabia expressed fears that their  children might come home in body bags.  </P> <P> The coalition wants people to call or write letters and postcards to President  Bush and their congressmen, telling them to bring the troops home, allow the  sanctions time to work and reduce American dependence on oil, she said.  </P> <P> Demonstrations and concerts such as those held in the 1960s and '70s to protest  the Vietnam War, are being planned, Davis said.  </P> <P> Protesters plan to gather at noon Sunday on the steps of the main Ventura Post  Office, 675 E.

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / International Company News: Paramount now switches to Viacom The board of Paramount Communications last night recommended shareholders accept a new offer for the company from cable group Viacom rather than a rival bid from QVC Network which directors had previously endorsed. The board's switch will not decide the outcome of the five-month, Dollars 10bn takeover battle, since shareholders are free to accept whichever offer they wish and both bidders have until February 1 to raise their offers. But it gives Viacom a at least temporary psychological advantage. Paramount agreed to merge with Viacom last September and continued to recommend its offer until December when, after pressure from the courts, it switched sides and advised shareholders to accept a then-superior QVC offer. Viacom this week made a fresh offer worth about Dollars 9.8bn, below QVC's Dollars 10.2bn offer. But a significant number of investors prefer the Viacom bid as it offers more cash and has a mechanism guaranteeing the value of the shares offered to Paramount stockholders. Mr Martin Davis, Paramount chairman, said last night the board decided, following analysis from its legal and financial advisers, that the aggregate consideration in the Viacom offer represented the best value available to stockholders 'at this time'. However, he said the board was prepared to 'revisit its recommendation' if further bids were received. Meanwhile, Paramount is terminating its merger agreement with QVC and reviving its previously agreed one with Viacom.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CANYON TAKES ADVANTAGE OF SECOND CHANCE  </P> <P> Canyon High School wrecked Santa Ana Valley's hopes for an automatic Southern  Section Division III playoff bid with a 16-7 upset of the Falcons Thursday  night at Fred Kelly Stadium.  </P> <P> The loss dropped Santa Ana Valley to fifth in the Century League and ended the  Falcons' hopes of tying Orange (2-1-1) for third.  </P> <P> Their only hope of advancing is the one wild-card berth in the 16-team draw.  </P> <P> With just under nine minutes to play and Santa Ana Valley leading, 7-6, the  game's pivotal play came on fourth down and 11 when Canyon's Greg Lawrence  shanked a 41-yard field-goal attempt.  </P> <P> But officials flagged Santa Ana Valley (4-4-2, 1-3-1) for an unsportsmanlike  conduct penalty on the play, giving Canyon (4-6, 2-3) a first down at the 12.  </P> <P> "I've never seen a call like that," Santa Ana Valley Coach Dan Castanon said,  "The official told me that one of our linemen was trying to disrupt Canyon's  snap count."  </P> <P> "I tried to explain to him that on kicks, teams don't even use snap counts. The  holders just use hand signals to the center."  </P> <P> Canyon Coach Loren Shumer still made it interesting, settling for a 23-yard  field goal. MICHAEL ITAGAKI  </P></p>

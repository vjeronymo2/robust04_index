			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Lloyd Thompson rises 21% LLOYD THOMPSON, the London market insurance broker, yesterday reported pre-tax profits up 21 per cent to Pounds 17.4m for the year to June 30. Brokerage income rose 13 per cent to Pounds 41.1m and other operating income rose to Pounds 6m, compared with Pounds 5.8m last year. Earnings per share increased by 20 per cent to 14.8p. Mr Ken Carter, chief executive, said: 'We're delighted with what we have achieved. We have maintained our record of 20 per cent growth ever since we went public in 1987, when conditions have been about as bloody as they could be.' He said the performance was due primarily to the increase in brokerage, the benefits of a stronger dollar, and further cost controls. About 80 per cent of the company's brokerage fees are generated in dollars, at an average exchange rate of Dollars 1.64 against Dollars 1.75 last year. The expense ratio fell from 76 per cent to 72 per cent during the year, and the average number of employees rose from 339 to 349 during the period. The directors recommended a total dividend for the year up 20 per cent to 6.7p (5.6p), including a final of 4.7p. Marine brokerage expanded 7 per cent to Pounds 17.4m, and non-marine by 16 per cent to Pounds 11.8m. Reinsurance brokerage rose 20 per cent to Pounds 12m. Mr Carter said the company planned to concentrate in the future on energy, casualty and international insurance business. 'We will also continue our hair-shirt philosophy with regard to cost control,' he said. He said Lloyd Thompson had net cash deposits of more than Pounds 30m, against Pounds 25m last year.</p>

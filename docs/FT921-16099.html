			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Outlook bleak for US retailers FOURTH-QUARTER earnings prospects for US retailers have been hit by figures showing disappointing sales for many chains in December, including the critically important pre-Christmas period. The figures provide further evidence that US consumer confidence remains depressed and is unlikely to provide an engine for recovery from national recession in the immediate future. Shares in many retailing companies dipped on Friday following the release of the figures, moving contrary to a rise on the day of almost 30 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. An index of year-on-year sales at leading retailers, compiled by brokers Alex Brown &amp; Sons, gained just 1.8 for the month, against expectations of 3 per cent, and on an inflation-adjusted basis fell 1 per cent. However, the misery was not equally shared. The Gap, a fast-growing clothing chain, produced a 14 per cent year-on-year increase in sales on a 'same-store' basis  - that is, sales from stores which have been open for more than a year. Including new stores, sales jumped 30 per cent to Dollars 2.34bn (Pounds 1.28bn). Wal-Mart Stores, a rapidly expanding southern cut-price chain, saw a 26 per cent rise in overall sales to Dollars 5.86bn, though this was trimmed to 5 per cent on a same-store basis. But traditional department store chains fared less well. Sears, Roebuck  - the largest US retailing group  - saw a 1.8 per cent drop in same-store sales, while overall sales fell 2 per cent to Dollars 3.81bn. JC Penney produced a 0.1 per cent increase in same-store sales and a 1.4 per cent rise in overall sales, to Dollars 2.44bn. Analysts said weak sales, combined with strong price-cutting over the past month to attract Christmas trade, would probably mean lower fourth-quarter profits for several large retailing groups. The poor retailing climate, which is expected to continue well into this year, will also increase the threat of bankruptcy hanging over some large and many small chains. Last Friday saw Seaman Furniture, the largest furniture retailer in the north-eastern US, file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection by the courts, blaming a 'severe and prolonged recession' in its markets. The north-east has been particularly hard hit by recession. Seaman was the subject of a 1988 leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg, Kravis &amp; Roberts (KKR), the biggest of the US buy-out investment groups which emerged in the 1980s, and had to undergo a financial reconstruction the following year because of debt repayment difficulties. Earlier in the week Zales, the largest US jewellery chain, announced plans for a restructuring, including the closure of 400 of its 2,000 stores and the cessation of payment to creditors. Its creditors want to have it placed in involuntary bankruptcy. Ratner returns to UK, Page 13</p>

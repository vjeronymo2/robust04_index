			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> President Bush recommended a 3.6% pay raise for 1.6 million white-collar  federal employees, higher than the 2% he originally requested. In a message to  congressional leaders from his vacation home in Maine, Bush said the larger  increase is necessary to attract qualified people to government service, but  added that budget constraints prevent him from backing the 28.6% raise a  federal commission said was needed to make federal and private-sector pay  scales comparable. The 3.6% raise would be effective Jan. 1, 1990, for all  non-postal workers earning $82,500 a year or less. Bush is expected to extend  the increase also to senior executives.  </P></p>

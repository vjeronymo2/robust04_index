			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Lesson for Israel THE HISTORY of the past 15 years suggests that Israel's latest onslaught against southern Lebanon will again fail to achieve its main objective. In 1978 and 1982 Israel tried, at immense cost both to itself and to the people of Lebanon, to rid that fractured country of hostile guerrilla forces. The extent of those failures can be measured by the intensity of this week's renewed offensive. This time Israel wishes to achieve a huge movement of population from the south. Latest estimates indicate that some 200,000 people have been driven from their homes. The villages and towns they have evacuated are being subjected to heavy shelling with the aim of making them uninhabitable. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, believes that the mass of refugees will create pressure on the governments of Lebanon and Syria to curb the guerrilla activities of Hizbollah, the radical Shia faction, and its Palestinian allies. Mr Rabin is as misguided about this as he was in December when he ordered 415 Palestinians to be deported from the occupied West Bank and Gaza. That action, and this week's more extreme military assault, not only threaten the faltering Middle East peace process but also play into the hands of those most opposed to it. More damaging still, the punishment being inflicted on the civilians of Lebanon invites comparisons with what is happening in Bosnia. The forcible movement of entire populations, in defiance of international appeals, is not only morally indefensible but must also increase suspicions among Moslems that the West is at best indifferent, at worst hostile to them. This is a propaganda gift to radical Islamic movements and governments, particularly Iran, which since the 1982 invasion has sustained and armed Hizbollah under the guise of aiding a national liberation movement. It has been having similar success in the other occupied territories, where Hamas is increasingly challenging the influence of the more moderate Palestine Liberation Organisation. The lesson for Israel appears to be that the harsher its response to security challenges, the greater will be the radicalisation of the populations it is seeking to control. And it is precisely those populations which will ultimately decide the fate of the peace process. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, will shortly begin another visit to the region, aiming to move peace negotiations forward. For that to happen, Israel must be persuaded to make an explicit commitment to withdraw from the territory it occupies, in return for peace treaties with its neighbours. It is the only way to reverse the increasingly dangerous radicalisation of the region.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Booker drops to Pounds 91m following catering setback BOOKER, the food distribution and agribusiness group, suffered its first fall in profits since 1980 with a pre-tax outcome for 1992 down from Pounds 103.9m to Pounds 91m. The shares fell 29p to 410p. The bulk of the fall was caused by problems at Booker Fitch, the catering food service business, which made a small loss at the pre-tax level. It had taken on new business some of which was unprofitable, and had neglected its existing operations. Trading conditions were poor anyway as fewer people ate out. Booker does not disclose profits for the activity, but analysts estimated that it made between Pounds 12m and Pounds 13m the previous year. New management has been installed and Booker is ending unprofitable contracts. The food distribution division saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 57.2m to Pounds 46.9m. Agribusiness profits were little changed at Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 20.7m), while fish and prepared foods made Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 18.4m). Mr Jonathan Taylor, chief executive, said that 1992 was 'a good year to have behind us'. He said the emphasis had been on cutting costs. Although the pre-tax figure was in line with expectations, the market was surprised by a Pounds 23.7m (Pounds 31.9m) extraordinary debit and a rise in gearing from 71 to 95 per cent. Group sales were Pounds 3.4bn (Pounds 3.3bn) and operating profits were Pounds 109.6m (Pounds 122.8m) boosted by profits of Pounds 4.4m from acquired businesses and including Pounds 5m (Pounds 1.7m) from discontinued businesses. Restructuring in the US, where the chicken and turkey breeding business lost significant market share, cost Pounds 12.9m, but this was offset by a Pounds 17.1m profit on sale and leasebacks. Earnings per share fell 16.3 per cent to 30.4p (36.3p). A maintained final of 14.25p is proposed to give an unchanged total of 21.75p. Under FRS 3 pre-tax profits were Pounds 67.9m (Pounds 63.6m) mainly because the extraordinary item moves above the line. COMMENT Booker chose a bad day to release these results but even so it demonstrated once again its capacity to disappoint. A year ago forecasts had been for Pounds 115m pre-tax. There are some encouraging signs; a return to profits in the turkey and salmon businesses, good performances from the Portuguese cash and carry operation and the prepared foods side. But the main problem of poor trading conditions in UK food distribution combined with management errors will take some time to come right. Forecasts of about Pounds 98m suggest a p/e of 13, and the thinly covered yield is 6.6 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English  on 10 April in the Business Times Supplement on page 6 carries a  full-page advertisement from the Transitional Executive Council  [TEC]. The Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 11 April on  page 11 carries an almost identical full-page advertisement,  omitting the last two sentences. The text is as follows:    "A message from the TEC to all public servants  including members of the security forces in South Africa, the  TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states and the  self-governing territories    "In less than three weeks' time South Africa will be  participating in a unique and historic event: the elections of  26/27/28 April 1994.    "It is in the interests of all South Africans that this  crucial and important phase of the South African transition to a  non-racial and non-sexist democracy be peaceful and successful.    "This election will relegate past differences to history and  usher in a new era of hope, reconcilliation and prosperity for  all South Africans.    "At the same time the TEC is aware of:    "-- The increasing concern among public servants, including  members of the security forces, about their future, pensions and  salaries.    "-- Strikes and rumours about strikes.    "-- Concern about promotions and job security.    "The TEC has already taken concrete steps to address these  concerns and problems:    "1. Public servants are being made aware of the provisions  of the Constitution of South Africa which comes into effect on  27 April 1994. In terms of section 236 of the Constitution, a  person who was immediately before 27 April employed by any  department of state (including a police force), administration,  military force or other institution performing government  functions shall continue in such employment. Furthermore, there  is clear and unambiguous provision that --    "(a) the terms and conditions of such employment shall  continue to apply;    "(b) the pensionable salary or pensionable salary scale of  such a public servant shall not be reduced; and    "(c) there shall be a Public Service Commission which shall  exercise its powers relating to public administration fairly,  impartially and independently.    "2. Although the Constitution comes into operation only on  27 April 1994, the TEC has, on the basis of the provisions of  the Constitution guaranteed all public servants their jobs,  salaries and pensions.    "3. Certain steps have already been taken by the TEC in  preparation for the implementation of the Constitution: a task  force of the TEC was appointed to deal specifically with the  concerns of public servants and to co-ordinate the participation  of all public servant organisations in the preparation for  rationalisation of the various public services.    "4. This task force has already intervened in specific  instances to assist in restoring normality and addressing  concerns of public servants.    "5. Where necessary, as in the case of the concerns of  members of the South African Police and Correctional Services,  the Management Committee of the TEC will meet organisations of  public servants to address problems.    "The is convinced that the elections cannot and must not be  postponed. It is vital that the elections proceed in an  effective and organised fashion, without any disruption.    "Public servants are essential to the success of the  elections.    "Your dedication to serving our country and your skills are  indispensable to a successful transition.    "In the interests of a peaceful and democratic future for  our  country.    "The TEC urgently appeals to all public servants    "a) to accept the assurance from the TEC that their future  is secure after 27 April 1994 and that in the meantime any  urgent problem will receive the necessary attention;    "b) to give their full support and participation to the  administration and security of the election; and    "c) to take part in the process of rationalisation of the  public services, to accept responsibility for ensuring a  democratic and peaceful transition, and to refrain from any  action, particularly strike action, which can benefit only those  who want to disrupt the elections.    "A successful election will lead to a stable country and an  effective government that can, as a matter of urgency, attend to  the concerns and problems of public servants.    "The TEC calls on all public servants, including members of  the security forces, to play their part."</p>

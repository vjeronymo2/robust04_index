			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- Comrade Kim Chong-il,  Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, sent the 70th  birthday table to General Kim Ki-ok, a lecturer at the  Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum, who is the first  hero of the Airforce in Korea.    Born a son of a mountain-side tiller before the liberation,  he learned how to operate airplanes at the Pyongyang School  after the country was liberated as he desired and grew to be a  full-fledged flying commander.    In the fatherland liberation war, he brought down with his  propeller plane seven enemy aircrafts including two B-29s and  two jet planes and damaged four planes.    He became the first hero of the Airforce in Korea for his  exploits in battles on July 15, 1950, twenty days after the  start of the Fatherland Liberation War.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Amir Tahiri: "Three Years After Desert Storm: A </F> Stick-Only Policy Not Likely To Be Any More Effective Than a  Carrot-Only Policy"]    [Text] It has been three years since the end of the war to  liberate Kuwait, and still people in Iraq and in the region are  yet to find the peaceful atmosphere that many anticipated as the  inevitable consequence of that war.    There is no doubt that Iraq carries the major burden of  suffering. Kuwait, though still trying to recover from the  impact of an exceptionally brutal occupation, has succeeded in  healing a lot of its wounds. It has also corrected many of its  past mistakes, if not all of them. It has also abandoned its  past comedic radicalism, learned the value of humility, and  reformulated its policies to reflect the realities of its  existence.    As for the neighboring Arab states, they have learned many a  lesson of the shock generated by the invasion and the consequent  liberation of Kuwait. Experience has moderated their usually  seraphic view of international life.    They have come to realize that they live among neighbors  that  are particularly dangerous and that security cannot be achieved  solely through appeasement and check diplomacy.    Iran, on the other hand, has failed to exploit the  opportunity afforded by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to regain  its appropriate place in the [community of] nations. Iranian  strategy remains a function of fiery slogans that exclude any  rational analysis of the situation.    The principal loser, as we already mentioned, has been Iraq.  It continues to live under harsh restrictions imposed on its  national sovereignty. Part of its land has been taken away,  ostensibly to create a "secure haven" for the Kurds. Iraqi air  space is largely off limits to Iraqi flights and the Iraqi  Government is unable to access its frozen assets abroad.    More importantly, Iraq is unable to engage in common  commerce, including the exportation of its oil and the  importation of goods other than medical and food supplies.    Is it not time, then, to scrutinize the events in Iraq and  its environs and then inquire if current policies should be  maintained without modification?    There are endless stories of the misery, deprivation, and  despair that beset the people of Iraq as a result of  international sanctions. We cannot shrug off those accounts as  the manufacture of Saddam's infernal propaganda apparatus,  because they originate with such trusted institutions as UNICEF  and Physicians Without Borders, as well as with independent  relief organizations. One must therefore take these accounts  seriously.    And that brings us to the question of sanctions, since we  should never forget why they were imposed in the first place or  which of them should remain in place and for how long.    Some people, including the Kuwaitis who suffered, want the  sanctions to continue until Saddam Husayn is toppled. Such a  position, though understandable, has no justification, because  Saddam's overthrow cannot be a fitting United Nations political  objective, at least not according to the resolutions adopted so  far by the international Security Council.    That is a matter for the Iraqi people; and even then it  would  be difficult for us to fathom how a starving people that are  forced to spend most of their time trying to survive would have  the power to topple such a particularly abominable regime.    Worse yet, the sanctions have prevented the fractured  opposition from working to solidify its ranks, embark on a  viable strategy, and offer a real alternative. The opposition  has pinned its hopes on the mistaken belief that sanctions would  destroy Saddam, therefore allowing his opponents to ride a red  carpet into Baghdad.    A second reason cited for maintaining the sanctions is to  compel Iraq to abide by cease-fire stipulations and [to respect]  Security Council resolutions.    That is a sound and justifiable view. Still, one cannot  dismiss [the idea of establishing] some sort of correlation  between the scope and intensity of the sanctions on one hand,  and the degree of Iraqi compliance on the other. In other words,  if there is Iraqi compliance with 50 percent of the conditions,  should not the sanctions be proportionately reduced?    There is no doubt that Baghdad has done all it can to evade  compliance. It is also obvious that Iraq is far from fulfilling  all of its commitments.    The nuclear aspect has been dealt with, but Iraq continues  to  conceal a major portion of its chemical and germ arsenal. It  also continues to be evasive, not only on the issue of borders  with Kuwait, but also on relinquishing all claims against its  neighbor.    That may be reason to keep some of the sanctions, at least  until Iraq fulfills all of its obligations, but the stick-alone  policy is not likely to be fruitful, and neither is the  carrot-alone policy.    One should put one's self in the shoes of the Iraqis. They  have no incentive to honor their commitments because it is their  belief that they will continue to suffer the full [burden of]  sanctions whether or not they comply with UN resolutions. In a  region where international policy is considered to be nothing  more than a series of conspiracies, it is not inconceivable for  the Iraqis to believe that they are victims of an international  conspiracy.    The time has come to review Iraqi performance over the past  three years, in its entirety, in order to determine whether or  not changes in current policies toward Iraq are warranted.</p>

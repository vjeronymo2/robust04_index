			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The Australian market picked up fractionally at the end of last week and has moved a little higher again so far this week. The Wool Corporation's market indicator, which ended before Christmas at 509c, slipped to 500 before recovering on January 20 to 509c again. These tiny changes were accompanied by an improved clearance to the trade, with only 7% passed in on January 20 compared with 25% on the uncertain first day. It is difficult to find any response in the amount of trade processing and manufacturing sectors around the world.</p>

The CDC  said 71,099 Americans died of the diseases in 1986, the latest year for which  complete statistics are available. The toll does not include lung cancer  deaths. Although men's death rates remained higher than women's, the rate for  women was catching up. The male death rate went up only 15% from 1979 to 1986,  but the female rate went up 80%.  </P></p>

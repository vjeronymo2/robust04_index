Other Matters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Environmental Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332. The FONSI is available for public inspection and copying from 7:30 to 5:30 weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20401. HUD will review all applications and their proposed activities in accordance with the environmental requirements of 24 CFR part 50.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Federalism Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the provisions of this NOFA do not have ``federalism implications'' within the meaning of the Order. The NOFA implements a program that provides positive sports, cultural, recreational, educational or other activities designed to appeal to youth as alternatives to the drug environment in public and Indian housing, and makes available grants to PHAs and IHAs to help them implement these activities. As such, the program helps PHAs and IHAs to combat serious drug-related crime problems in their developments, thereby strengthening their role as instrumentalities of the States. Further review under the Order is also unnecessary since the NOFA generally tracks the statute and involves little implementing discretion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Family Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official for Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that the provisions of this NOFA have the potential for significant positive impact on family formation, maintenance and general well-being within the meaning of the Order. The NOFA implements a program that provides positive sports, cultural, recreational, educational or other activities designed to appeal to youth as alternatives to the drug environment in public and Indian housing, and makes available grants to PHAs and IHAs to help them implement these activities. As such, the program is intended to improve the quality of life of public and Indian housing development residents by reducing the incidence of drug-related crime and should have a strong positive effect on family formation, maintenance and general well-being for PHAs and IHAs selected for funding. Further review under the Order is also not necessary since the NOFA essentially tracks the authorizing legislation and involves little exercise of HUD discretion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

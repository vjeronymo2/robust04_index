			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark weakens on forecast THE DOLLAR showed a new bout of strength against the D-Mark yesterday after a group of independent German economists predicted that there will be zero per cent growth in Germany in 1993. The report, by the 'five wise men' who give independent advice to the German government, led to immediate speculation that the Bundesbank will have to ease monetary policy more quickly than it wishes, writes James Blitz. After a sharp fall against the D-Mark on Friday, the dollar received a boost from Germany's grim economic news, rising nearly 2 1/2 pfennigs on the day to a close of DM1.59 at the end of European trading. In afternoon trading in North America, the dollar continued its progress, reaching DM1.5947. In recent weeks, foreign exchange dealers have started to believe that the anticipated cut in German official rates may not take place before the New Year after all. However, the report by five leading economics professors hired to give the German government independent advice has encouraged speculation that the Bundesbank may have to lower the Discount rate, currently at 8.25 per cent, next month. The dollar's progress was partly compounded by another set of US economic data suggesting that economic recovery may be underway. Industrial production in October was up 0.3 per cent, while recent indicators have shown a sharp rise in monetary growth, suggesting that bank lending is on the increase. However, the increasing gloom on Germany's economic prospect was the dominant news in all currency trading, and triggered another bout of strength for the French franc against the German currency. The franc peaked at FFr3.367 from a previous close of FFr3.373. The move was also helped by the Bank of France's decision not to reduce its key lending rates for the third time in two weeks, contrary to the market's expectations. The lira also appreciated against the D-Mark, closing at L853 from a previous L854.6. Again, the spotlight was on sterling as the one seriously weak currency in Europe. The pound fell 1 1/4 pfennigs against the D-Mark to close at DM2.4150, and 3 cents against the dollar to a close of Dollars 1.5195. Opinion remains divided on where the pound goes from here, now that the Autumn Statement has been delivered. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, was yesterday sticking to the view that the pound should remain above DM2.40, because of the incipient weakness of the D-Mark. However, he believes the political uncertainty created by the arms-for-Iraq scandal is a new and unsettling factor for sterling. 'If the political side gets worse, we'll have to jettison our economic views and accept that politics can drive us away from the economic fundamentals,' he said.</p>

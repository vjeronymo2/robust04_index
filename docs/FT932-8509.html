			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / The Danish Referendum: Bountiful EC set to harvest farmers' vote - Denmark's countryside bears witness to Brussels subsidies THE Danish countryside, bathed in brilliant sunshine, looked as picture-perfect yesterday as the country's political parties liked to portray it in their stirring television campaigns for the referendum on the European Community's much-battered Maastricht treaty. The rolling fields and woodlands of Sjaelland wore a hundred shades of spring green, splashed with the vivid yellow of oilseed rape, the EC's most fashionable subsidised crop. Red and white Danish flags flew over many of the typically immaculate farmsteads, not because it was a special day but because it is a popular Nordic custom to fly the national emblem. In fact, if you looked closely, there was a blemish. Here and there, a weed-ridden, untended field testified to that other EC farm policy, the set-aside scheme, which pays farmers not to till some land in an effort to curb overproduction. Nor are Denmark's farmers as pleased by the prolonged spell of warm weather that has had Copenhagen's street-side cafes and bars overflowing with happy customers this month. The rape crop has grown to only about two-thirds of its normal height at this stage of the season and a repeat threatens of last year's drought-hit low harvest. But in Dalmose, a small farming village 95km southwest of Copenhagen, there was at least anecdotal evidence that neither the recent painful adjustments of the EC's agricultural policies, nor the weather, would break the loyalty of Denmark's farmers to a Community that has been bountiful to them since the country joined in 1972. In the first referendum last June, when Denmark voted narrowly to reject Maastricht, most farmers voted Yes. Smiling at the suggestion that she had voted No this time, Mrs Karen Petersen, a farmer's widow, replied: 'Of course not. We farmers here will all vote Yes.' At the polling station in the village school, Mr Niels Pedersen, the official in charge said that by mid-morning, the number of those who had already voted was ahead of last year at the same stage, suggesting, he said, a big overall turnout. The ballot papers were simple. Startlingly so, given the complexities of the Maastricht treaty itself, and the subsequent 'opt-outs' granted to Denmark by its EC partners in Edinburgh last December so that its embarrassed leaders could go back to their people for a second poll. Voters, who, after two campaigns, were proclaimed credibly enough by Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen to be the best informed on the subject in the EC, simply had to place a cross in the Yes or No box. The only reference to what they were voting on was a notice at the polling station entrance stating blandly that it was a referendum on parliament's approval of 'the Edinburgh decision and the Maastricht treaty'. Most campaign-weary Danes, whether they voted Yes or No, must have one thing in common this morning: a heartfelt wish that there will be no more referendums on Europe for a long time to come. All except the schoolchildren. As most polling stations are in schools, the Maastricht kerfuffle has to date meant two extra holidays for the majority of pupils.</p>

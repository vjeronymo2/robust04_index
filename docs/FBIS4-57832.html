			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] William Lacy Swing, U.S. ambassador in  Port-au-Prince, has denounced the Emile Jonassaint government's  intention to halt the flood of Haitian refugees leaving Haiti.  Swing said: It is an illegal government. Its decisions will not  be acknowledged by the international community.    Mr. Swing, who just returned to the country after  consultations with his superiors, asked the Haitian military to  take the necessary measures to ensure that citizens' rights are  respected, while reaffirming that the establishment of democracy  is the top priority in the case of Haiti. [passage omitted]    According to Ambassador Swing, the United States has pleaded  for a marked increase in the civilian mission in Haiti in  response to the Haitian people's expectations and to see to it  that their rights are respected. Let us recall that according to  what he has said, Colin Granderson, who is in charge of the  civilian mission, intends to deploy the mission throughout the  country in the near future.</p>

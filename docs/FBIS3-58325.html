			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ian Graham, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] President Bill Clinton was today urged to demand  that the IRA stopped exiling people from Northern Ireland  before lifting the ban on Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams  entering the United States.    The Families Against Intimidation and Terror [FAIT] handed  in  a letter at the American Consulate in Belfast pressing the  president to make any lifting of the ban conditional on Mr.  Adams using his influence to stop the terrorists banishing  people under threat of death.    The organisation urged Mr. Clinton to write to Mr. Adams  "asking him to use his considerable influence with the IRA to  have this practice stopped and the existing expulsions lifted,  so that those living in exile may return."    It asked him to bring the plight of those exiled by the  terrorists to the attention of the Senate "urging them to lift  the ban on Mr. Adams as a matter of urgency, as soon as the  Republican movement lift the expulsion orders on Irish men and  women."    In the past year alone FAIT has dealt with 35 cases of  forced  expulsion involving 63 people -- 28 individuals and seven entire  families.</p>

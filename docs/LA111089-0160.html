			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> BACKERS GET BEHIND 'CENTRAL PARK' MOVE  </P> <P> Supporters are already joining a campaign launched this week by city officials  to promote a proposed bond issue that would raise $20 million to buy 120 acres  of farmland and convert it into a "Central Park."  </P> <P> At a Wednesday private dinner hosted by city officials and attended by 110  guests, San Juan Citizens for Open Space was begun under chairperson Marlene  Draper, a 12-year city resident and a member of the Capistrano Unified School  District Board of Trustees. She is joined by two city planning commissioners,  Gil Jones and Wyatt Hart.  </P> <P> The general-obligation bond scheduled for the April, 1990, ballot requires a  two-thirds vote to pass.  </P> <P> "Almost everybody in the room supported it," Draper said of the group that  included representatives from local youth sports organizations, senior  citizens, historic preservationists and farming families.  </P> <P> In a recent telephone poll of 400 registered city voters, 85% said they would  like to see the land retained as open space. Sixty percent said they would  support a bond if the payments were no more than $10 per month, Mayor Gary L.  Hausdorfer said.  </P> <P> As proposed, the 20-year bond would create average payments of $5.83 per month  for homeowners and $2.29 per month for mobile home owners, Hausdorfer  explained, adding that business property owners would also be assessed.  </P> <P> At a Thursday press conference to announce the bond, a developer in escrow on a  portion of the targeted property said the landowners, John and Roger Swanner,  would not complete the sale because they are waiting for the outcome of the  April special election.  </P> <P> "We're in a holding pattern," said Cody Small, president of Costa Mesa- based  CMS Development, which is the only developer in negotiations on any part of the  area. The company has plans to create two-story office buildings on a 40-acre  site fronting Camino Capistrano, Small said.  </P> <P> The Rev. Robert H. Schuller's Crystal Cathedral Ministries in May spent $5  million to buy a 77-acre ranch next to the proposed park. The ministry plans to  create a 40-acre cemetery and a 16-acre care facility on the site, which  adjoins its 93-acre Rancho Capistrano in the northern tip of the city.  </P> <P> After several thwarted attempts by city officials to raise money through  federal, state and private channels, it was decided that the bond issue would  be a last-resort method to generate enough money to purchase the farmland and  to convert it by 1992 into playing fields, a community center and an orange  grove.  </P> <P> "Most kids have never been close enough to an orange tree to see an orange on  it," Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer said recently. WENDY PAULSON  </P></p>

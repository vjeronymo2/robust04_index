			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Demand for credit behind 35% advance at Cattle's A STRONG performance from its consumer credit business helped Cattle's (Holdings) report a 35 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30. Mr Eddie Cran, chief executive, said the pre-tax rise, from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 5.2m, showed the demand for short-term credit was as strong as ever. 'The are a significant number of people who cannot get loans from the banks but are in need of credit.' The rationalisation of Compass Credit with Shopacheck, pushed the new division's pre-tax profits up Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 5.2m. More than 60 shops were closed cutting the total to 155. The level of bad debts continued to decline. The insurance division increased profits to Pounds 400,000 (Pounds 300,000) and losses at the hire purchase and leasing division were halved to Pounds 300,000. Earlier this year the group floted 55 per cent of Rosebys. The net surplus arising from the disposal amounted to more than Pounds 4m, of which Pounds 1.2m was credited to extraordinary profits. Overall turnover fell from Pounds 113.9m to Pounds 102.2m. Earnings per share rose to 3.16p (2.43p) and the interim dividend goes up to 1.6p (1.5p). Net borrowings were reduced from Pounds 76m to Pounds 57m, representing gearing of 150 per cent.</p>

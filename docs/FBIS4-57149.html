			<p>BFN     [Text] Cesar Quintino Rosales, minister of transport and  communications, has reiterated emphatically that student fares  are fully valid. He added that the subsidy granted to  transportation workers to guarantee this benefit will be  maintained to support students.    When leaving the Council of Ministers, the minister of  transport and communications denied a newspaper report published  in a Caracas daily on an alleged elimination of the subsidy.    [Begin Quintino Rosales recording] In response to a report  published in last Tuesday's press regarding an alleged  elimination of the subsidy to student fares, the Ministry of  Transport and Communication expressed emphatically the following:    The subsidy to student fare will be maintained as an  incentive to support students. With this declaration, the  government ratifies and maintains firmly the commitment signed  last March to preserve the current system until the last day of  July, and later replace it by a form of payment more  transparent, equitable, and clear.    Additionally, we state our strong opposition to blackmail  and  illegal measures of coercion, violence, and public order  alterations, which result in loss of life among our youths. [end  recording]    Meanwhile, given the surprising announcement of a new  transportation strike by the Single Union of Independent  Vehicles for next Monday, the faction of councilmen of the  Social Christian Party, Copei, asked the leaders of said union  to reflect on the consequences of the strike. We consider,  Councilman Moises Benaim said, that the situation of the country  demands greater tactfulness at the time of making decisions,  such as leaving Caracas once more without transportation,  following an action in which the population displayed their  civic behavior. People could react negatively if they are  pressured and made to suffer by leaving them without service, he  added.    [words indistinct] a Chamber of Deputies Financial  Commission  led by Legislator Gonzalo Perez has appointed a subcommission to  begin an investigation on the 50-percent discount on the student  fare. The announcement was made by the very deputy, in  statements to our reporter Vinicio Sanchez.    [Begin Perez recording] Engineer (Maya Ortega) and Carlos  Sindoni have today come to the subcommission I preside to ratify  their report. These former officials of the Ministry of  Transport and Communications, who have to do with the  directorate created to subsidize transportation for students,  have ratified the Ministry of Transport and Communications has  made timely payments for many years to transportation workers  not offering this service. They stated they presented their  report to the Rafael Iribarren, former deputy minister of  transportation and communication, to whom they presented 12  folders. Those 12 folders were requested by the Financial  Commission and they have not been forwarded by the Ministry of  Transport and Communications.    They also expressed Eng. Iribarren's report on student  subsidy is a gimmick, adding he has acted irresponsibly. The  former officials noted Iribarren dismantled the operating  structure of this subsidy at the Ministry of Transport and  Communications, adding this is why today there are no controls.  We will process all these reports, and next week we will talk  with Eng. Rafael Iribarren to hear his account of the events.  [end recording]</p>

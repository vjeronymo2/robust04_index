			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> DIAPERS PUT DAMPER ON CAREERS  </P> <P> Women doctors on medical school faculties often feel held back by the  responsibilities of raising children, although most are happy with their  careers, according to a survey.  </P> <P> Women make up 19% of medical school faculties nationwide -- up from 13% two  decades ago -- although they have been slow to crack the top ranks of the  academic world.  </P> <P> A survey of 558 of these women, all under age 50, found that nearly two-thirds  had children. About half of those had delayed starting families until they were  in their early 30s and had finished medical training.  </P> <P> Although the majority said they were satisfied with their careers and the  decision to have children, 78% felt that their families had slowed their job  advancement.  </P> <P> "We believe that it is possible for women to combine motherhood with a  fulfilling career in academic medicine, but it is difficult, and most such  women believe that motherhood slows the progress of their careers," the  researchers wrote.  </P> <P> The survey was conducted by Drs. Wendy Levinson and Susan W. Tolle of Oregon  Health Sciences University and Charles Lewis of UCLA. The results were  published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  </P></p>

William Condori, finance secretary for the Special  Federation  of Tropical Region Peasant Workers [FETCTC], told PRESENCIA:  ``We absolutely and energetically reject this proposal, and  will not allow its implementation and the eradication of our  coca plantations.''    He explained that the ``zero option'' the ``gringos'' are  proposing calls not only for the eradication of the so-called  excess coca plantations, but also plantations intended for the  ``traditional'' use of the leaf. In other words, ``they want  the to eliminate coca completely, so that not a single plant is  left.''    According to Condori, the U.S. proposal allows 18 months for  the total eradication of excess coca plantations and 48 months,  or four years, ``to put an end to the coca myth.'' He added:  ``To put an end to the coca myth is to end our culture, and  that is out of the question; (the North Americans) will have to  finish us off first.''    The peasant leader explained that this new ``offense''  directed at coca farmers has been fully analyzed, and it has  been decided that it is just ``another approach'' aimed at  provoking the peasants, fostering violence, and militarizing  coca-producing areas in order to eradicate coca plantations by  force. ``There is just no other way,'' he said.    Condori recalled that in the past the North Americans had  devised a ``low-intensity war'' which failed, adding that ``this  onslaught will fail as well, because eradicating coca  plantations means leaving thousands of Bolivian families without  sustenance.''    He emphasized that the peasants are not against drug  enforcement. ``Drug trafficking is a different issue. The  repression is aimed at coca farmers, not against the drug  traffickers, and less still against the big fish who walk in and  out of the U.S. Embassy. The target of the repression are the  Bolivian peasants who cultivate coca,'' Condori emphasized.    He pointed out that coca farmers have declared U.S.  Ambassador Richard C. Bowers ``persona non grata,'' and  reaffirmed that the settlers in Chapare are organized to oppose  ``not only the zero option, but any other kind of repression  that will take away our sustenance.''</p>

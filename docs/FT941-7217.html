			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Regent Inns plans expansion of pubs Regent Inns yesterday announced plans to expand its pub operations by a third following a sharp increase in half-year profits. Regent, a former business expansion scheme company which came to the market last year, said its strategy had been underpinned by a 70 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.03m (Pounds 604,000) in the six months to January 1 this year. Mr Chris Watson, finance director, said: 'Our aim is now to open 12 new pubs a year, and the size of the portfolio should increase from 33 to 44 by June this year.' The group, which raised Pounds 6.16m in a share placing and open offer last April, said the current expansion programme would cost Pounds 6.8m in total. Further acquisitions, designed to secure 80 outlets for the group over the next five years, would be funded from an unused Pounds 7m bank loan facility and existing cashflow. Although the half-year figures were boosted by a Pounds 41,000 gain on the disposal of fixed assets, the increase was mainly because of better trading conditions at its sites in London and the home counties. Mr Watson said that average turnover per pub was now 14 per cent higher than a year ago. This resulted in increased turnover of Pounds 7.16m, against Pounds 6.48m. Earnings per share came out at 5.8p (5p). Mr Watson said the interim dividend of 1.75p (2.25p) represented a third of the anticipated annual total. It was in line with company policy to pay such amounts progressively.</p>

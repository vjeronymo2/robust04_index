			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Maria Helena Tachinardi] </F>   [Text] Acting Foreign Minister Roberto Abdenur has told  this newspaper that the Brazilian Government hopes to be able to  announce "a formula for bolstering scientific and technological  cooperation between the two countries," before U.S. Vice  President Al Gore's visit to Brazil on 21 March. "It is a major  signal from the United States," he added, without giving further  details.    Itamaraty and the Science and Technology Ministry are  working  together on the issue. Science and Technology Minister Israel  Vargas told this newspaper: "We may be able to reactivate the  scientific and technological cooperation agreement between  Brazil and the United States." The two countries signed a  document for an extension of the agreement about three years  ago; they could not agree to sign a new agreement because the  United States imposed a clause that, at that time, could not be  accepted. The clause dealt with the need to preserve  intellectual property rights. The two countries are now having  problems in that area.    Al Gore will disembark in Brasilia at around 1830 [2130 GMT]  on 21 March. He will be coming from Buenos Aires, where he will  open a conference on telecommunications sponsored by a United  Nations specialized agency, the International Telecommunication  Union. He will stay in Brasilia only until midnight on Monday,  after fulfilling of a six-hour agenda. He is scheduled to meet  with President Itamar Franco upon his arrival. The agenda  includes issues like the hemispheric summit meeting, which is  scheduled for the end of the month in Washington, an initiative  that the Brazilian Government considers "a catalyzer of the new  phase in the relations between the United States and Latin  America," according to Abdenur.    At the U.S. Embassy, Al Gore will meet with the Brazilian  community ("town meeting") [preceding two words in English] to  address several matters. The idea is that Gore should meet with  local leaders from various sectors. He will then meet with  Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who will host a dinner in Gore's  honor. The formal conditions of the dinner have yet to be  established.    Abdenur believes Brazil-U.S. relations "are marked by an  unprecedented level of convergence, which does not mean there  will not be divergencies in some areas." Abdenur added that the  North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), among the United  States, Mexico and Canada, reflects an "improvement in the value  of Latin America in the eyes of the United States," because it  opens the possibility for the future expansion of the commercial  agreement.    The same day Al Gore is in Brasilia, Itamaraty will welcome  the foreign ministers of 12 Rio Group countries and Portuguese  President Mario Soares.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ilyas Frayj, Bethlehem mayor and member of </F> the Palestinian National Authority, in Bethlehem, by Fawzi  al-Jundi, in Cairo; date not given; from the "Dialogue From  Afar" program--recorded]    [Text] [al-Jundi] As a member of the Palestinian National  Authority, can you tell us about the current situation,  particularly in the fields of economics and services in the  self-rule areas? Can you brief us on the efforts currently  being made in preparation for starting the work of the  Palestinian National Authority?    [Frayj] In fact, the economic situation in Jericho, Gaza,  and  the occupied West bank is very bad. The economic structure is  largely crippled. Unemployment is high and exceeds 40 percent.  The volume of monetary liquidity is limited. Despite this, we  are making the necessary preparations to establish Palestinian  Authority and offer the necessary services to all sons of our  people. The people are looking forward eagerly to brother  president 'Arafat's arrival in Palestine. As members of the  Palestinian National Authority we will take the oath of loyalty  to Palestine and to do our national duty.    [Al-Jundi] What is the proposed date for taking the oath and  for president 'Arafat's arrival in the self-rule area?    [Frayj] We expect president 'Arafat to arrive before the end  of June. We are awaiting his arrival impatiently. Naturally,  after his arrival the oath of loyalty will be taken.    [Al-Jundi] Several statements were made in Israel recently  on  the issues of Jerusalem and the possibility of president 'Arafat  visiting East Jerusalem. Obviously, there is Israeli opposition  to this visit.    [Frayj] Israel consistently declares on all the media that  it  ensures freedom of worship and of visiting the holy places for  prayer. This applies to Jerusalem and to the Christian and  Islamic holy places there. Brother president Yasir 'Arafat has  a right to say prayer in al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and to  visit Christian holy places in Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Israel  declares that it ensures freedom of worship, so this should  apply to all believers in the three holy religions. Brother  Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] is a Palestinian Arab and a Muslim  believer.    [Al-Jundi] Regarding the Palestinian establishments in  Jerusalem, they will continue their activities in the coming  phase. However, the Palestinian Authority clearly intends to  establish others in Jerusalem operating in coordination with the  Palestinian Authority in the self-rule areas. Can you brief us  on the situation?    [Frayj] The Palestinian Arab establishments operating in  occupied Arab Jerusalem will continue their duties and offer  services normally. Israel has warned against setting up  political establishments in East Jerusalem. The Arab  establishments in Jerusalem deal with services and studies and  draw up plans to serve the citizens.    [Al-Jundi] Will the establishments in Jerusalem be annexed  to  the Palestinian National Authority?    [Frayj] I believe that these establishments should continue  their work. When we assume our duties as Palestinian National  Authority contacts will continue between us and the Palestinian  establishments wherever they may be, inside or outside the West  bank.    [Al-Jundi] After the meeting held in Paris recently by the  international committee that is coordinating aid to the  Palestinians, approximately $42 million will be granted to the  Palestinian National Authority to begin its work. Do you  believe this sum is sufficient for a start, or have you received  specific promises for additional funds?    [Frayj] First, we thank all countries that offered aid,  particularly Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait.  The $42 million has been earmarked to be paid as salaries and  costs for police and employees in Gaza and Jericho, who number  over 12,000. Another meeting will be held in July to reconsider  the aid. We hope that this meeting will result in funding of  more than $100 million. We are in dire need of financial  support to begin our work as the Palestinian National Authority.    [Al-Jundi] Has the Palestinian National Authority specified  the sums needed in the coming phase within the framework of an  overall plan for reconstruction and development in Gaza and  Jericho?    [Frayj] We have plans and assessments that we submitted to  the World Bank, the European Common Market, Japan, and other  donor nations. We need considerable financial support to  establish an effective National Authority and create jobs for  the unemployed and improve medical, educational, and municipal  services.    [Al-Jundi] We thank you and welcome you over the waves of  the  Voice of the Arabs Radio.    [Frayj] Thank you.</p>

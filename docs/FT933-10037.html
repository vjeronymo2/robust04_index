			<p>930806 FT  06 AUG 93 / Gummer confirms guidance review MR JOHN GUMMER, the environment secretary, has confirmed in a letter to Mr Jack Straw, his Labour shadow, that the government is re-examining its guidance to the Local Government Commission. Mr Gummer's plans to put the review on a voluntary basis by requiring councils to opt in were vetoed last week by Mr John Major, the prime minister. Mr Gummer's letter, however, makes clear that changing the criteria for reviewing the counties remains a serious option. He said: 'We are re-examining our guidance to the Local Government Commission. I can assure you now that there is no question of abandoning the review.' A decision is not expected until September.</p>

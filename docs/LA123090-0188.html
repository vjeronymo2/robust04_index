			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WIZ OF A FILM  </P> <P> Thanks, NBC, for "The Dreamer of Oz: The L. Frank Baum Story" (Dec. 10).  </P> <P> We felt this rich, moving, quality production was TV at its best-the caliber of  a Hallmark Hall of Fame program. (John) Ritter's performance was excellent. My  wife still has a lump in her throat.  </P> <P> George J. Sweikis, Alta Loma  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS Correspondent Evgeniy Belovitskiy] </F>   [Text] Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk June 15 TASS--Five foreign spies  were exposed and arrested in Russia in 1994, including an agent  recruited by the British Secret Service, according to Director  of the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service Sergey Stepashin who  visited the Sakhalin region in the Far East.    "Only this year there were five detentions of rather  important recruited people, including by the British Secret  Service", he told TASS on Wednesday adding that this proves that  his service, which emerged after the collapse of the notorious  KGB, is gradually reviving in its counterintelligence activities.    As far as the fight against organised crime is concerned,  Stepashin urged "extreme measures" and said that certain human  rights violations are inevitable as mafia is becoming very  strong. However, he stressed that "there will be no serious  violations although certain mishaps are possible".    He added that law enforcement agencies will work to defend  the rights of the absolute majority of people and not of those  "who believe that the law is not for them".    Stepashin said that a real gangland war had begun in Russia.  This is a war "of mafia clans, a war without rules when  criminals use the latest means of human destruction". In such a  situation extreme measures are necessary as "other ways of  struggle do not exist".    The Counter-Intelligence Service is going to sign a  share-power and cooperation agreement with the Interior Ministry  in the near future. Stepashin said four joint orders are being  drafted which will share the powers and tasks of both agencies  and promote their cooperation.    The KGB and interior Ministry were always at odds in Soviet  years arguing about who is the most important. Stepashin  believes this should no longer happen. "It is time to end the  contrapposition between the two agencies which is rooted in the  past".    He added that the "serious results" of the joint work of his  agency, the Interior Ministry and the prosecutor's office will  be known in four-six weeks.</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE'S FEELING GOOD ABOUT BASEBALL AGAIN  </P> <P> Just when you think the grand ol' game is heading to the dogs, an article about  the likes of Chuck Essegian and Little Red warms my heart like the spring sun  warms the grass at Vero Beach.  </P> <P> Can we send a copy to every current major league ballplayer to remind them of  what it takes to be a big leaguer? There's a little bit of Little Red in all of  us, no matter how old we are. Thanks, Mr. Essegian.  </P> <P> BILL PIKE, Carlsbad  </P></p>

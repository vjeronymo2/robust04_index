			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / France nudged down path to growth: Balladur's cautious but skilful prod for the economy The French economy, according to Mr Gerard Longuet, the minister for trade and industry, is on a razor's edge. 'Now it is necessary to give a small push to send us on to the side of growth,' he said in a radio interview last week. On Sunday Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, announced the push. The measures he conjured up to revive the struggling economy were numerous and, in several cases, innovative. Car owners, for example, will be offered FFr5,000 (Pounds 560) from the government if they trade in vehicles over 10 years old to buy a new one. The aim of the measures is to encourage French households to save less and spend more, and to curb an unemployment rate of 12 per cent and rising. But the prime minister's very resourcefulness demonstrated the dilemma his government faces in combining these goals with its commitment to anti-inflationary policies and a target of reducing the budget deficit to FFr300bn this year. The limited room for manoeuvre forced the government to choose its targets carefully. The motor vehicle and property sectors, worst hit by recession and described by the government as 'motors of the economy', were singled out for special treatment. In addition to the FFr5,000 allowance for potential car-buyers, the government will raise from FFr75,000 to FFr100,000 the annual amount by which companies can write down the value of their cars. The measures apply to all makes, but French manufacturers stand to benefit most as, according to Mr Balladur, three-quarters of company cars are French-made. In property, the government said it will cut from 6 per cent to 5.25 per cent the rate on deposits paid into savings schemes designed for house purchases. The aim is to encourage individuals to spend, rather than save, such deposits, FFr5,000 will not buy a new car, and the cut in returns in property deposits will not spark a run on estate agents. To reinforce the measures, the government said it would ease rules on employee profit-sharing schemes, which represent about FFr80bn. Employees will be able to spend their deposits before the usual five-year limit if they buy cars or spend at least FFr20,000 on property improvements. The measures aimed at curbing unemployment were also targeted. Mr Balladur said he would accelerate rebates of value added tax to companies if they create jobs or take on more apprentices. The outstanding amount of VAT rebates is estimated at FFr40bn and companies will receive FFr30,000 for each job they create in the first half of this year. The government will also extend from June until the end of the year the availability of state aid of FFr7,000 for each apprentice taken on. The various measures will provide help to the sectors concerned. The car industry, which saw sales in France fall by 18.3 per cent last year to just 1.72m vehicles, welcomed the measures. 'They are strong enough to persuade those hesitating,' said Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman of Renault, who predicted that the effects should show from the beginning of March. But for the broader economy, the effectiveness of the measures is less clear. 'Because the measures are targeted they are also limited,' said one economist in Paris. 'There are still substantial obstacles to a marked and general upturn in growth,' he said, describing the government's forecast of a 1.4 per cent rise in gross domestic product as optimistic. One such obstacle is the continued rise in unemployment. Mr Balladur claimed progress, pointing out that whereas the number of unemployed rose by 200,000 in the first half of last year, it increased by just 100,000 in the second six months. Figures published yesterday showed a rise of just 4,300 in December, which kept the rate of unemployment stable at about 12 per cent. But the trend is still upwards, and most economists predict several more months of increasing joblessness until unemployment stabilises. Consumption will continue to be depressed by the threat of unemployment and by the weak purchasing power of the 3.29m people out of work. In addition, many industrialists believe that interest rates, particularly short-term rates, remain too high. Overnight borrowing costs have been reduced to about 6.4 per cent, but with annual inflation of just 2.1 per cent, real interest rates remain relatively high. 'Economic activity has never revived without low short-term interest rates,' said Mr Ernest-Antoine Selliere, vice-chairman of the Patronat, the French employers federation. He called for further cuts in borrowing costs to support the country's fragile recovery. Monetary policy is now out of the government's hands. But the newly-independent Bank of France, eager to establish its anti-inflationary credentials, has shown little inclination to move quickly on lowering interest rates. According to Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Brothers, the central bank's emphasis on the stability of the French franc and its decision to set only a medium-term target for M3 suggests 'a bias towards monetary tightness both in 1994 and 1995'. Such a strategy is consistent with Mr Balladur's own belief in the need to create the conditions for long-term non-inflationary growth. When he reached into his bag of tricks on Sunday, he knew there would be no magic solution to France's economic problems.</p>

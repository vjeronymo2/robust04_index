The Speaker is responsible for house proceedings and routine  preparation of questions for debate and for representing the  Duma in relations with the President, federal and regional  bodies, as well as with parliaments of other countries and  inter-parliamentary groups.    He also represents the House in any conciliatory procedure  envisaged by the country's constitution.    The House rejected a proposal from Kiril Ignatyev of the  Russia's Choice faction calling to delete a clause on the  Speaker's function of preparing questions for debate.    The Duma has also reached agreement on how to elect Speaker  of the House. The deputies rejected the option of a secret  ballot, settling for the Council of Factions' proposal for two  rounds of voting to be held instead.    The names of two candidates who enlist more support than  others in a straw vote will next be put forward for a secret  ballot.    The Duma has now begun nominating candidates for the post.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Italy announces terms of Y450bn euroyen offering The Republic of Italy's long-awaited euroyen offering will consist of three tranches, of Y125bn of three-year, Y200bn of 10-year and Y125bn of 20-year bonds, the Italian Treasury said last night. The three-year tranche is likely to carry a coupon of 3 7/8 per cent, the 10-year tranche a coupon of 5.0 per cent and the 20-year tranche a coupon of 5.5 per cent, market sources said. The deal, due to be launched early this morning, will be lead-managed by Daiwa, with Nomura as joint book-runner on the three and 20-year tranches. The three-year tranche is targeted mainly at Japanese retail investors, while the 20-year tranche hopes to find demand among Japanese institutional investors, Daiwa said. Daiwa hopes that the 10-year tranche will excite some interest among Asian investors outside Japan and among European investors. The offering, the third time Italy has tapped the yen market this year, is likely to complete its foreign borrowing programme for 1994. The Hellenic Republic is also rumoured to be close to launching its global dollar offering, which is expected to focus on the five-year area. Joint-lead manager Salomon Brothers was last night unable to comment on the size and terms of the offering. With market attention occupied by the outcome of the US Federal open market committee meeting and by a series of new US economic statistics, there was little new issuance in the eurobond market yesterday. In the Dutch guider sector, Asfinag, the sovereign Austrian financing authority, launched a Fl 300m offering of eight-year bonds, priced to yield 20 basis points over Dutch government bonds. About Fl 150m of the offering was bought by Dutch institutions, lead manager ABN Amro said, with Belgian retail investors also showing some interest. The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate Austrian schillings. In the dollar sector, Sampo Corporation launched a Dollars 50m offering of seven-year bonds offering a coupon of 2.75 per cent and callable after five years. Japan's Electric Power Development Company is rumoured to be poised to tap the dollar sector with a Dollars 300m offering of five-year bonds, IBJ is said to have the mandate to lead the deal. In the Luxembourg francs sector, the Republic of Portugal launched a LFr2bn offering of bonds due January 2005, lead-managed by Kredietbank.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 10 TASS -- The question of U.S.-Russian  command-staff drill at the Totsk grounds, the Orenburg region,  remains open.    The State Duma has requested President Yeltsin to revise the  drill expediency, bearing in mind "the Russian social-economic  situation and progress towards civic peace". On the eve of  signing the Civic Accord Agreement, the president said he  understands the Duma's concern and recommended the defence  minister to hold additional consultations with the U.S. side  with due account of "the stand of Russian law-makers and the  public".    The presidential statement provoked diverse reaction both in  Russia and abroad. Chairman of the Duma defence committee and  member of the Choice of Russia faction Sergey Yushchenkov is  sure the decision on holding the drill is an "exclusive  prerogative of the executive power, which has nothing to do with  the State Duma," and the president's stand "testifies to the  weakness of the executive power and its poorly-considered  actions".    In his turn, presidential press secretary Vyacheslav  Kostikov  explained Yeltsin's stand with his striving for foreign and  domestic political decisions to help the consolidation of civic  accord. He denies the president's concessions to "certain  forces", or, the more so, a certain cooling of the Russian  leadership to the United States.    Chairman of the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko told  ITAR-TASS that "any politician should strive for increased  combat readiness of the armed forces, and all means are  important in this respect, including a possibility to interact  with other armed forces". In his opinion, the drill should be  held, and forces outraged with "the Yankee stepping on Russian  soil" should understand "the Yankee is not an occupant but an  ally".    Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev thinks the same. "The  drill must be held to bring the two peoples closer together if  we really want to become partners and avoid the return to the  cold war. The Totsk drill is symbolic," it will include only 200  servicemen on each side and a small quantity of materiel.    The aim of the drill is to practice the organization of  joint  peace-making posts in separation, evacuation of wounded and  delivery of humanitarian aid. "We must hold the drill for the  sake of those we are striving to protect by our peace-making  operations," said Grachev.    Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council  Lieutenant-General Valeriy Manilov thinks the drill can be held  on the area of the Russian Western Group of forces or on the  Pacific coast. In his words, the question will be revised and  all conclusions and proposals will be used in the final decision  with due account of the public opinion.    The last word is to be said by the president.</p>

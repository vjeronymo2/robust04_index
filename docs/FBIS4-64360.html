			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [RITZAUS Bureau report: "Liberals Answer Back"] </F>   [Text] The Social Democratic Party [SDP] today does not  have a policy on Europe. The prime minister is trying to paper  over the inner split by acting as if everything can continue as  before. This is chasing away the young people from his party.  But what is worse: This is also costing Denmark influence in  Europe.    This was said by former Foreign Minister Uffe  Ellemann-Jensen  (Liberal Party) in a comment on the attack SDP Chairman and  Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has directed against the  Liberals' Europe policy in a letter issued by the LO [National  Labor Confederation] in which he calls the Liberals the main  enemy to the SDP in late summer's election for the European  Parliament.    Ellemann-Jensen characterizes as "pure nonsense" the prime  minister's assertion that the Liberals are pulling out of the  National Compromise and are seeking a "United States of Europe."    "The Liberals want the European Union [EU] to become a body  for cooperation among independent states, and we are observing  the rules of the game in the National Compromise. But we want it  made possible for the people to rescind the Danish reservation  [opt-out] to cooperation in the EU through a new referendum, and  we are working to get a majority for this," said  Ellemann-Jensen.    He claims that Europe has changed itself since the National  Compromise was arrived at almost two years ago, and that today  there is far greater need for establishing cooperation in  defense and refugee policies.    "This is seen in the entirely relevant events in the former  Yugoslavia and in Russia. Today the peace in Europe is in  danger, and we cannot defend the peace by sticking our head in  the sand," said Ellemann-Jensen.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Serious river pollution cases decline THE NUMBER of serious river pollution incidents in England and Wales fell by 41 per cent to 386 last year because of 'tough and rigorous control measures', the National Rivers Authority said yesterday. In its annual report the pollution watchdog said the total number of pollution incidents in 1991 had been 22,469 - an increase of 8 per cent on 1990. It blamed the rise in the total number of incidents on a 12 per cent jump in the number of times sewage was reported to have leaked into rivers. The NRA, created in 1989 ahead of the privatisation of the water and sewerage companies of England and Wales, has won a reputation as a confrontational regulator. It carried out 356 prosecutions in 1991, and secured a conviction in 90 per cent. Fines against offenders ranged up to Pounds 200,000. Of the 'major' or serious reported incidents in 1991, a quarter were from farm pollution, a quarter from sewage, 22 per cent from industrial, 20 per cent from oil and the rest unclassified. 'Major' incidents are defined as those where there could be a persistent effect on the water quality or where the conditions of licences for discharging are breached. One of the main reasons for the drop in major incidents was that the number of serious farm pollution incidents fell 60 per cent from 239 to 99. The Severn Trent region of the NRA covering central England, which includes much agricultural land, had the highest proportion - 22 per cent - both of total incidents and serious incidents.</p>

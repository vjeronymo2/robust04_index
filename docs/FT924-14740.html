			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / GA to buy Canadian group from the Pru GENERAL Accident, the Perth-based composite (general and life) insurer yesterday announced that it has agreed to acquire the Canadian non-life insurance business of the Prudential Corporation, the UK life and financial services group, for CDollars 165m (Pounds 74m). The deal, the biggest overseas acquisition by a UK insurer for some time, signals the improving financial health of insurance companies such as GA which are relatively free from exposure to loss-making domestic mortgage indemnity business. Prudential is keen to focus on life assurance and financial services business. It said on Tuesday that its reinsurance subsidiary, Mercantile &amp; General Re, was prepared to lose its share of the general reinsurance market in search of higher margins. Prudential hopes to distribute some CDollars 25m in capital from the company before the sale, leaving CDollars 140m to be directly payable by GA. GA is raising money for the deal through an issue of 13.5m ordinary shares, which will be placed with institutional investors at 488p. The issue has been fully underwritten by Hoare Govett and J. Henry Schroder Wagg. The London market marked the shares of GA up 5p to 510p. 'From GA's point of view I think it makes a lot of sense,' said Mr Paul Hodges, analyst with James Capel, the securities house. Pru closed unchanged at 259p. Mr Barry Holder, general manager finance at GA, said the price represented a discount to net asset value of about 10 per cent and was a 'good deal' for shareholders. GA is now the biggest insurer in the Canadian market with a market share of about 8 per cent, said Mr Holder, who said that Canada had been a 'profitable market' for GA. The acquisition also helps GA diversify its Canadian business geographically. GA's existing operations are heavily oriented towards Ontario, while the Prudential earned nearly half its premiums in Quebec. Separately, GA is still negotiating with the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society over the acquisition of 216,000 home insurance policies underwritten by Municipal Mutual Insurance, the local authority-owned insurer which ceased writing new business last week.</p>

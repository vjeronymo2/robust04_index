			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: EXPERIMENTAL ON-CAMERA REPORT CARDS MAKE GRADE  </P> <P> And now: the video report card.  </P> <P> In an effort to keep parents better-informed about the academic progress of  their offspring, San Diego State journalism professor Don Sneed sent home  videotapes assessing the work and work habits of each student in his fall class  on critical and editorial writing.  </P> <P> Sneed decided that the regular report card carrying only a letter grade is too  skimpy and only increases the alienation felt by tuition-paying parents. "In  college there is no such thing as a teacher-parent conference," he said.  </P> <P> Fifteen of 20 students in Sneed's Journalism 425 class volunteered to be part  of the video report card experiment. Their parents received an individually  tailored tape of 25 to 30 minutes in which Sneed, seated in his back yard in El  Cajon, offered a critique of their son's or daughter's performance.  </P> <P> Feedback from an accompanying questionnaire was upbeat: 100% of the mothers and  88% of the fathers liked the video idea. Among the dissenters was a father who  upbraided Sneed for criticizing his daughter's use of mathematics in a story  she wrote about the county marshal's budget.  </P> <P> "He said that one criticism negated everything good in the report card, and he  told me his daughter got straight A's in high school math," Sneed said.  </P> <P> Sneed says he will use the video report cards again if the students are  amenable, the class is small enough and his wife again agrees to do the camera  work. Of course, if video report cards spread to the lower grades, certain  behavioral patterns will be altered.  </P> <P> The classic excuse given by students for the disappearance of their report card  before scrutiny by their parents -- "The dog ate it" -- might have to be  updated. Stay tuned for: "I erased it, by mistake. Honest."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drawing the Line  </P> <P> In a dispute between management and a labor union, you might figure the  business-oriented Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce would side with  management.  </P> <P> As a matter of philosophy, that may be true, but when philosophy stands in the  way of political access, look for philosophy to give way.  </P> <P> Case in point: the chamber booked the restaurant at the new Hyatt Regency Hotel  in Sacramento for a gala breakfast March 28 as part of an annual two-day  lobbying trip. The breakfast is meant to give 30-plus chamber leaders a chance  to meet informally with the county's legislative delegation.  </P> <P> As soon as the invitations were mailed out, Assemblyman Peter Chacon notified  the chamber that he, and possibly other Democratic legislators, would not  attend because it would require crossing a picket line by members of the  Restaurant and Hotel Workers Union Local 47.  </P> <P> The chamber last week sent amended invitations announcing that the breakfast  has been shifted to the Capitol Restaurant, where the employees are already  represented by Local 47.  </P> <P> </P> <P> High-Pressure Pitch  </P> <P> The folks who run the San Dieguito Water District are not happy with a Cardiff  plumber who distributed 100-plus flyers warning homeowners that water pressure  has increased ominously in recent years.  </P> <P> "This kind of pressure can cause considerable damage to your house," say the  flyers. " . . .Think of the mess you may have to live in, while carpets and  padding are removed and damage to furniture as well."  </P> <P> Alarmed water customers have called both the city of Encinitas and the water  district demanding an explanation. "Old people are afraid their pipes are about  to burst," said water district office manager Beth Stone.  </P> <P> Stone and other officials say pressure has not increased, and they offer what  they say is a watertight explanation: Unlike districts that use pumps, the San  Dieguito system is strictly gravity flow and, at last report, Newton's law of  motion and gravity (F=ma, or Force equals mass times acceleration) is still in  effect.  </P> <P> For doubters, the city is offering free pressure tests.  </P> <P> The issue has also been turned over to the San Diego County Sheriff's  Department. (The flyers offer to install a pressure regulator for $85.)  </P></p>

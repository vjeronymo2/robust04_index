			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Reginaldo Silva in Luanda on the </F> "London Last Minute" program; italicized passages recorded]    [Text] Luanda, the Angolan capital, has been in darkness  since 2 April, following an attack on Cambambe Dam. The  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA,  rebels have been blamed for that attack. This latest operation  by the UNITA forces occurs at a time when military clashes are  intensifying in Cuanza Norte Province. The government forces  appear to be determined to wrest the city of N'dalatando, the  capital of Cuanza Norte Province, back from UNITA's hands.  Reginaldo Silva, our correspondent in Luanda, provides the  details:    [Silva] The Angolan capital has again been deprived of  the power supplied by Cambambe Dam, which lies slightly more  than 180 km southeast of Luanda. The UNITA rebels have been  accused of carrying out a major sabotage operation involving the  Luanda-Cambambe powerlines on 2 April. The exact extent of the  damage is not known yet.    Official sources have said that at least four pylons  near the actual dam were blown up. However, damage appears to  have been far more extensive and pervasive than that and the  results of the attack have already become visible: Luanda is  partially in the dark and its residents are facing added and  serious problems that will likely not be resolved in the short  term.    Alternative power supply sources include two gas  turbines and a number of generators around Luanda, but they will  probably be good for little more than 50 percent of the city's  needs in a rotating system. The power supply company has  already made its usual calls for consumers to use available  power as sparingly as possible.    That sabotage operation occurs at a time when various  sources have reported fierce clashes to be under way in Cuanza  Norte Province. Cambambe Dam is in that province and  N'dalatando, the UNITA-held provincial capital, is seen as the  major target for the government forces.    The UNITA radio station has quoted UNITA sources as  saying that the government forces have embarked on an offensive  to recapture N'dalatando. The first such offensive failed  recently, but new operations are under way aimed at that target.  Though Cuanza Norte Province has always been beset by  considerable tension, it is curious to note that the powerlines  linking Luanda and Cambambe Dam had so far not been one of  UNITA's military targets. The Angolan capital had in fact  enjoyed a stable power supply for many months now. Observers  feel that such power supply stability can be explained by a  tacit accord between the two warring factions, because Cambambe  Dam also provides power to the city of N'dalatando. Thus,  Luanda's power supply would have been assured as long as the  capital for Cuanza Norte Province also received it. Indications  are that the tacit accord has been terminated and the next few  days do not seem likely to bring any positive developments  concerning peace for Angola.    The intensification of military clashes in Angola precedes a  UN Security Council meeting on that country scheduled to be held  within the next two days. It is expected that the UN Security  Council will issue a new resolution at a time when the Lusaka  peace talks have ground down to a complete deadlock. This  afternoon, we interviewed Afonso van Dunem Mbinda, the Angolan  ambassador to the United Nations. We asked him what the Angolan  Government would have liked to see the UN Security Council  resolution include.    [Mbinda] Our government would like to see that  resolution include the following passage: That the UN Security  Council has already decreed sanctions against UNITA. The second  package of sanctions has not come into force yet because the UN  Security Council has deemed that this is not the right time yet  for imposing additional sanctions. I believe that was an  opinion voiced by the UN Security Council some months ago.  However, in view of UNITA's inflexibility and its failure to  abide by the resolutions and recommendations of the UN Security  Council, it is our belief that conditions are in place for new  measures to be taken against UNITA.    The additional measures alluded to by Angolan Ambassador to  UN Afonso van Dunem Mbinda include, notably, the freezing of  UNITA funds abroad and the imposition of restrictions on the  movement of its representatives outside Angola. Seeing that the  imposition of such sanctions has been put off on several  occasions, we asked the Angolan ambassador to the United Nations  why he thought such measures might be approved now.    [Mbinda] This is a problem we have had with the UN  Security Council. In all its meetings so far, the UN Security  Council has been lenient about the introduction of additional  sanctions against UNITA. Thus, everything hinges on the UN  Security Council itself. We believe, however, that the UN  Security Council has become so disappointed that it will take  the necessary measures this time.</p>

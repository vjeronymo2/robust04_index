			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "China, Too, Paves Data Superhighway"] </F>   [Text] China is speeding up the construction of its own  information superhighway -- the Three Golden projects.    Ji Tong Communications Co Ltd, a shareholding company set up  last September, is in charge of the Golden Bridge and Golden  Customs projects.    Golden Bridge will be a national public economic-information  network linking 500 cities and more than 10,000 information  resources including large enterprises, institutes and government  departments.    Ji Tong will soon start construction of the network's main  centre and branch centres in 20 large cities, said Lu Shouqun,  president of Ji Tong.    Golden Customs, whose goal is paperless foreign trade, will  be in operation before the end of the year, he revealed.    Ji Tong is co-operating with Great Wall Computer Group Co  and  IBM Corp of the U.S. to conduct pilot works for the Golden Card  project in 10 coastal cities, which aims to replace cash with  electronic money -- credit cards.    Lu said Ji Tong will also co-operate with the Ministry of  Radio, Film and Television to build and operate multimedia cable  TV networks.    The cost of building this information infrastructure will be  enormous. Lu said Ji Tong will raise capital through various  channels, including foreign funds.    Ji Tong is also actively seeking cooperation with foreign  firms, he said.    It has established a $30 million joint venture with Bell  South Corp, an American regional telephone company, to engage in  telecommunications and cable TV network projects.    Ji Tong signed an agreement with IBM to set up a multimedia  information network research and development company to provide  technical support for the Three Golden projects.    The investment for the joint venture's first stage is $10  million. Both sides will inject more money in the future.    Ji Tong has two more joint ventures, with companies from  Malaysia and Hong Kong.    Each day Ji Tong deals with five to eight multinational  corporations eager to participate in building China's ambitious  information networks.    Lu said the government hopes the Three Golden projects will  stimulate the development of domestic information and  electronics industries.    China will import some equipment but most will be supplied  by  domestic manufacturers and joint ventures.    Foreign companies with high technologies are welcome to  co-operate with domestic producers.    Ji Tong will choose some large and medium-sized State  enterprises to set up its production bases, Lu said.    Lu will soon go to the United States, Germany and France to  inspect their progress in developing information superhighways.</p>

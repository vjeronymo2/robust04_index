			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 9 (AFP) -- France plans a rapid boost  to its forces in Sarajevo by redeploying a battalion of 800 men  in the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR], Foreign Ministry  spokesman Richard Duque said here Wednesday [9 March].    The move was being made as a matter of urgency to help  implement a Security Council resolution on restoring essential  public services in the Bosnian capital, he said.    France has more than 6,000 troops in former Yugoslavia,  forming the largest UNPROFOR contingent. Half are in Bosnia,  including 2,400 at Sarajevo.    The redeployment to strengthen the French units in and  around  Sarajevo was also announced by government spokesman Nicolas  Sarkozy after the weekly cabinet meeting.    He made the point that it was not a question of increasing  France's UNPROFOR strength but of carrying out a redeployment.    French troops in Sarajevo meanwhile cleared away the last of  the landmines and other defences dug in in 22 months of war at  the Brotherhood and Unity bridge linking the Serb district of  Grbavica to the rest of the city.    The French moved in a month ago when the current ceasefire  took effect. The bridge still remains out of bounds to  civilians however, in the absence of a political agreement  between Bosnians and Serbs on restoring normal traffic.</p>

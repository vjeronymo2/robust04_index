			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Muted Moscow May Day RED SQUARE, traditionally a sea of red banners and rallies on May Day, saw an extraordinarily low-key version of the workers' annual celebration. Yesterday's proceedings were devoid of long speeches and were over in record time, confirming the break-up of Communist supremacy. Key Politburo members, such as Mr Vladimir Kryuchkov, KGB chief and Mr Boris Pugo, interior minister, remained at the foot of Lenin's mausoleum, leaving only President Mikhail Gorbachev on top with trade union speakers. The leadership line-up on the mausoleum used to be scanned by Kremlinologists for signs of any shift in the balance of power. Last year, as political opposition began to flourish, Mr Gorbachev abruptly left the podium after being booed. The only link with the past yesterday was the mass of security men who kept spectators from the mausoleum. The march through Red Square, involving a few thousand well-dressed workers and a brass band, was organised by Communist-controlled trade unions instead of by the party. Gone were complacent banners proclaiming the party's greatness. Instead the marchers sought to convey to Mr Gorbachev their recipes for economic reform (or hyperinflation) and their discontent over recent price rises. The most ferocious party stalwarts to be seen came embarrassingly from its loony fringe. A few hundred people carrying portraits of Josef Stalin called for a people's court to try the country's leaders and condemned the idea of market reforms. 'No to privatisation. The Counter-Revolution will not succeed,' said one banner. Another called for the country's leading economists, such as Professor Stanislav Shatalin to be put on trial for allegedly obeying the 'diktat' of the International Monetary Fund. In Leningrad, the most eye-catching feature was a march by conservative nationalists who displayed anti-Semitic banners. One banner accused President Gorbachev and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader, of being frontmen for international Jewish capital and said they should be tried for treason. Another suggested that Mr Yeltsin should run for president of Israel.</p>

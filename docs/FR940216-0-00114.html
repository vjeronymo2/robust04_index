			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA also intended that these per-gallon/average elections could be changed subsequent to the gasoline leaving the refinery or import facility, so that if gasoline that was intended to meet a particular standard on a per-gallon basis is discovered, subsequent to shipment, to violate the per-gallon standard, the refiner or importer could change its accounting records to switch the gasoline batch to the average standard category (provided the gasoline meets the per-gallon minimum or maximum).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has reconsidered this approach, and now believes that refiners and importers should be allowed to use either the per-gallon or the average standard for each parameter, but that parties may not use a combination of per-gallon and average standards for any parameter during any single averaging period. This per-gallon versus average election must be made separately for each refinery and for each importer or oxygenate blender. Under this revised approach, for example, a refiner could elect to meet the benzene standard per-gallon and the toxics emissions performance standard on average for all reformulated gasoline produced at a refinery, but once these elections are made, they would apply to all reformulated gasoline produced at that refinery for the entire averaging period for these parameters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is making this change from the proposal because it is concerned that under the proposed approach nationwide average levels for regulated parameters would not achieve the levels of the average standards. For example, the average standard for benzene is set at 0.95 wt%, because, among other factors, EPA estimates that this level is at least as stringent as the benzene level that would exist in the absence of averaging. EPA is concerned that under the proposed approach for electing per-gallon versus average standards the nationwide average benzene levels in reformulated gasoline would be greater than the 0.95 wt% average standard for benzene. This result would be contrary to the intent of the Clean Air Act and EPA's goal that averaging should result in average parameter levels that are no less stringent than would occur in the absence of averaging.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 211(k)(7)(C) of the Act provides that benzene and oxygen credits may not result in average levels for these parameters that are less stringent than would occur in the absence of using any benzene or oxygen credits. EPA has viewed this constraint on the use of credits as appropriate to employ for all reformulated gasoline parameters that may be met on average, including parameters other than oxygen and benzene, that averaging should not result in average parameter levels that are less stringent than would occur in the absence of averaging.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, section 211(k)(1) of the Act directs EPA to promulgate reformulated gasoline regulations that require the greatest achievable reductions in VOC and toxics emissions, taking into account cost, health and environmental impacts, and energy requirements. EPA has concluded that if refiners were required to meet the reformulated gasoline standards on a per-gallon basis only, that refiners would produce gasoline with properties equal to the standards plus ``margins-of-safety'' necessary to ensure the gasoline in fact meets the per-gallon standards. EPA also has concluded that the added flexibility afforded regulated parties through an average VOC or toxics standard results in the ability by refiners and importers to achieve more stringent standards when met on average than is possible when standards are met per-gallon, and the magnitude of this greater stringency is at least equal to the margins-of-safety that would be used with per-gallon standards. As a result, in implementing section 211(k)(1) EPA intends to establish requirements that will result in reformulated gasoline having VOC and toxics properties that in practice are at least equal to the per-gallon standards plus the margins-of-safety (which is equal to the average standards).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In implementing these two statutory provisions, EPA intends that reformulated gasoline should have VOC and toxics emissions performance properties, and benzene and oxygen content properties that, regardless of whether credits or averaging are used, are in practice at least equal to the more stringent properties refiners would achieve if only a per-gallon standard were allowed. The level of these more stringent properties is at least equal to the per-gallon standard plus any ``margin-of-safety'' refiners would employ if only per-gallon standards were included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result, EPA proposed and is adopting standards for average compliance that are more stringent than the standards for per-gallon compliance. Moreover, the differences between the proposed average and per-gallon standards reflect EPA's estimates of this per-gallon ``margin-of-safety'' for each parameter. The relationship between margins-of-safety and average standards is discussed more fully in the 1992 SNPRM, at 57 FR 13457&hyph;13458.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is concerned that if refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders can elect per-gallon versus average standards on a batch-by-batch basis, the levels of parameters in practice will not, on average, be approximately at the level expected if only a per-gallon standard were applied (equal to the per-gallon standards plus the margins-of-safety), but rather will on average be closer to the per-gallon standards. EPA believes the proposed approach would have this result because of the ability of refiners and importers to elect to use the per-gallon or the average standards separately for each batch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

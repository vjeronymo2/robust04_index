			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, April 27, RIA -- Vitaliy Churkin, special  representative of the Russian president in former Yugoslavia,  will no longer "actively participate" in Bosnian settlement.  This high-ranking Russian diplomat told newsmen today that his  place in the contact group established to step up UN peacemaking  efforts in Bosnia will be occupied by Aleksey Nikiforov who has  "direct experience" of work in former Yugoslavia. The new  contact group, which comprises Russian, American, French,  German, and british officials, heads for Sarajevo April 28.  "I'll maintain links with it and, probably take part in its work  from time to time" said Mr. Churkin. But he is going to focus  his efforts on Russia's possible affiliation to NATO's  partnership in the name of peace program.    Western diplomats watching developments in former Yugoslavia  do not rule out that Mr. Churkin's departure at such a  responsible moment may be connected with his recent harsh  statements regarding the Bosnian Serbians who angered them very  much.</p>

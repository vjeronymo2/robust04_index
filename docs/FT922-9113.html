			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / International Company News: Lec fails after stock market collapse LEC, maker of bathroom products and kitchenware, yesterday filed for protection with the Tokyo District Court, marking the first failure of a listed Japanese company since 1986. The Tokyo-based company, with outstanding borrowings estimated at Y25bn (Dollars 188m), was apparently a victim of stock market speculation since its core business was profitable. But the stock market collapse had created huge appraisal losses. Meanwhile, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which suspended trading in the stock on Thursday, is investigating unusually large turnover of Lec shares earlier this week and is also seeking information from the company on why it was not informed earlier about the filing. Lec, listed on Tokyo's second section, is the first listed company to fail since Kokko Steel Works collapsed in August 1986, and its court application yesterday was seen as a symbol of the still serious financial problems facing some manufacturers who diversified into stock speculation. The Lec failure also raises questions about the willingness of Japanese banks to prop up all of their troubled clients. Bank officials have indicated that they are willing to back traditional customers, unless those companies' problems stem from stock trading. Founded in 1957 and listed in 1985, Lec is one of Japan's largest makers of plastic kitchenware, bronze sculptures, candle stands and bathroom goods. Sales for the fiscal year just ended were forecast to rise about 35 per cent to Y30bn, but revenue was not enough to cover the appraisal losses and depreciation charges. The company had forecast a pre-tax loss of Y640m, but, until yesterday, was confident that an upturn in the Japanese economy in coming months would enable it to avoid a court filing. About 2 per cent of the company's production was exported, and foreign investors hold about 0.6 per cent of its stocks. Nippon Housing Loan, Japan's top-ranked home loan institution, revised its current profit estimate downwards by 87.5 per cent to Y770m from Y6.01bn for the year ended March 1992. The company now estimates that it made a net after-tax loss of Y6.49bn for the year, from a previously-estimated Y3.04bn profit.</p>

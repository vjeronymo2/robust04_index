			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> HOUSE VOTES FEDERAL FUND FOR OIL SPILLS  </P> <P> The House, responding to the Alaska oil spill, approved legislation setting the  liability of those who cause spills and creating a $1-billion federal fund to  ensure full environmental protection and compensation. The measure, adopted 375  to 5, would limit the liability for those who cause spills and authorize use of  the federal fund to pay for cleanup costs and damages above the liability  ceiling. The fund would be financed by a special tax on oil. The Senate already  has approved a similar bill, setting the stage for a House-Senate conference  committee to work out differences between the two chambers. The House bill  would create a comprehensive federal liability system to ensure sufficient  money is available to conduct speedy and thorough cleanups and to promptly  compensate fishermen and property owners.  </P></p>

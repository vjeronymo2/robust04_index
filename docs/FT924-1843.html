			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Road cash rules will change RULES ON allocating money for local road and transport schemes in England will be changed to enable councils to submit joint bids for big projects, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said yesterday. The move follows an agreed approach in deciding transport priorities for next year from seven local authorities in the west Midlands. Two of the authorities' top four priorities - but not the Midland Metro - will go ahead next year. Mr MacGregor told MPs he would start consulting local-authority associations about bringing in the new arrangements in time for spending bids in 1994-95. They are intended to allow some flexibility between the local grant allocated for capital spending on roads and that for public transport. The flexibility will be confined to less than half of the transport grant in the first year, not least because of restrictions in the legislation. The chance to submit joint bids is most likely to be taken up in areas where more than one authority is involved, such as Tyneside. County councils' priorities as highway authorities tend to remain within their own boundaries. The announcement came as Mr MacGregor gave details of how the Pounds 1.047bn for capital spending on local roads in 1993-94 would be spent. Some Pounds 473m is already earmarked for existing commitments, but 41 significant schemes will be started at a cost of Pounds 93m. Bridge works and structural maintenance on main roads account for a further Pounds 310m. Among the largest schemes to proceed is the Blackwater Valley route in Hampshire and Surrey, costing Pounds 57m. Mr MacGregor said the settlement 'demonstrates the government's priority of maintaining strong capital investment' and emphasised the help it would bring to the construction industry. Mr John Prescott, the shadow transport secretary, welcomed the move to allow joint bids from local authorities. The British Roads Federation said that the government was contributing directly only Pounds 440m in grant, and that local authorities would have to find more than Pounds 600m from their own resources or from borrowing if the programme was to be realised.</p>

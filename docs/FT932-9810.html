			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Observer: Lesson from Vienna One calculation seems to have been overlooked during Monday's sometimes acrimonious debate about the imposition of VAT on British fuel bills. How much extra will it cost if higher fuel bills force more freezing pensioners into state-subsidised nursing homes earlier than planned? Presumably, a statistically minded chap like Peter Lilley, secretary of state for social security, has asked someone to add it up. If he hasn't then he ought to have a word with his opposite number in Vienna. It seems that the socialist city fathers of Austria's capital have concluded that the most economical policy of all is to provide free heating for old age pensioners. Admittedly, Austria is a colder place than Britain and probably has a better social safety net. Even so the argument still sounds applicable to the UK. Given that fear of winter cold was driving an increasing number of OAPs into local nursing homes, the Viennese authorities concluded that it would be worth providing old people on low incomes with free district heating and home insulation. If, by so doing, they could keep these old Viennese in their flats for just two additional years rather than seeking permanent shelter in nursing homes, the programme would pay for itself. In practice, the Viennese are staying an additional five years in their flats compared with the period before the free heating began. UK nursing home care is more limited and less plush than in Vienna, but it would be surprising if the addition of VAT to heating bills - if not fully reimbursed for OAPs - did not lead to a corresponding rise in nursing home care and end up perhaps costing the exchequer more than the tax it will yield.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls below 19,000 as Hong Kong drops 3.8% The sharp decline on Wall Street overnight and further weakness in consumer electronics shares depressed investor confidence, and the Nikkei 225 average fell below the 19,000 level for the first time since February 18, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index lost 158.73 at 18,962.99 on arbitrage unwinding prompted by lower futures prices, and profit-taking by foreigners and individuals. It opened at the day's high of 19,052.01 and hit a low of 18,905.48 as selling overwhelmed small-lot buying by financial institutions and investment trusts. Individual investors who had bought shares on margin were also forced to unload their holdings. Volume rose to 315m shares from 176.6m. Traders said public funds bought around 20m shares in the afternoon session. The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 9.46 to 1,502.92 and the Nikkei 300 shed 1.83 to 275.82. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.14 to 1,228.56. Sony, the consumer electronics company, continued its decline on selling by overseas investors and the issue ended Y120 lower at Y5,110, falling for the third consecutive day. Other high-technology shares were also weaker, with Matsushita Electric Industrial off Y10 at Y1,520 and TDK down Y120 at Y4,570. Brokerage issues declined on fears of lower earnings due to the prolonged weakness of the stock market: Nomura Securities was down Y20 to Y1,910 and Nikko Securities Y10 to Y1,020. Smaller brokers, which depend heavily on stock market commissions, were also hit - Sanyo Securities fell Y12 to Y477 and New Japan Securities Y15 to Y645. Banks, which rely on unrealised share holdings as capital, lost ground, Industrial Bank of Japan slipped Y10 to Y2,720 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y10 to Y1,680. Telecommunication stocks were lower. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which reported that its interim recurring profits plunged 66 per cent, receded Y13,000 to Y843,000 and Japan Telecom Y7,000 to Y983,000. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 228.26 to 21,103.78 in volume of 24.7m shares. Roundup The reverberations from Wall Street's overnight setback were felt throughout the region. HONG KONG dropped 3.8 per cent on heavy foreign selling, particularly by US investors clearing their books ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend and, to a lesser extent, by Japanese investors ahead of today's holiday in Tokyo. The Hang Seng index lost 354.81 at 8,948.43, the biggest one-day fall since a 465-point drop on March 21, as local investors joined the sellers during the afternoon. Provisional turnover rose to HKDollars 4.7bn after Monday's HKDollars 2.4bn. An analyst said the market slide came amid rumours of changes in Morgan Stanley portfolio weightings. Mr Byron Wien, Morgan Stanley's US strategist, confirmed yesterday that he had raised the cash element of his US equity only portfolio from 3 per cent to 15 per cent on Monday. He added that his contribution to the volatility in Hong Kong was 'another example of the law of unintended consequences'. Property issues were sold as investors discounted the effect of further interest rate rises on the property market. Sun Hung Kai fell HKDollars 3.75 or 6.9 per cent to HKDollars 51, Henderson Land HKDollars 2.80 or 5.8 per cent to HK45.80 and Cheung Kong HKDollars 1.60 to HKDollars 34.40. The H-share index of mainland China stocks listed in Hong Kong retreated 79.46 or 6.2 per cent to 1,206.23. SINGAPORE was bruised by relentless selling by institutional funds, in response to weak regional markets, the Dow's overnight fall and rises in prime rates by major local banks. The Straits Times Industrial index dropped 51.94 or 2.2 per cent to 2,270.05. The index, which at one stage fell through the psychological support level of 2,250, recovered on bargain hunting towards the close of trading. Large losses sustained by shipbuilders weighed on the broader market. Keppel fell 70 cents to SDollars 12.00 and Sembawang Corp 40 cents to SDollars 10.70. BANGKOK just avoided closing below the 1,400 support level, bouncing to 1,402.38 in the last minutes of trading, down a net 37.78 or 2.6 per cent. Turnover swelled to Bt9.5bn. The most active stock was Bangkok Bank, off Bt6 at Bt200 after foreign selling. KUALA LUMPUR extended its losses, the composite index finishing 19.20 or 1.8 per cent down at 1,026.18. Volume was 109.9m shares, with Amalgamated Industrial Steel accounting for 15 per cent of them. AIS, which on Monday announced the acquisition of three integrated timber companies for MDollars 1.1bn, fell 65 cents to MDollars 5.05. TAIPEI saw early gains reversed by mid-morning selling, but paper and cement shares posted slight rises. The weighted index lost 59.35 at 6,345.27, off a low of 6,332.69. Turnover was a thin TDollars 30.9bn. Brokers said some industries, including paper, textile and steel, were expected to recover in 1995 and had already been the focus recently of bargain hunting by trust funds and long-term investors. An easier cement issue was Lucky Cement, whose TDollars 5bn investment plans in Vietnam were made public yesterday. It dipped 20 cents to TDollars 30.30. SEOUL finished lower for the fourth straight session after aggressive institutional selling of primary blue chips wiped out minor early gains. The composite index lost 10.38 at 1,106.70, having pulled back from a high of 1,120.64. Brokers said the market was pressured by concerns about tight liquidity and they thought it unlikely that a 2 percentage-point expansion for foreign share ownership next month would have much impact on prices. Korea Mobile Telecom went limit down for the sixth session in a row, declining Won12,000 to Won571,000. MANILA fell 1.5 per cent in line with the regional trend. The composite index saw a low of 2,850 before closing 44.84 off at 2,854.95. Analysts remarked that foreign fund managers had diverted money to other markets since equities in Manila were now thought to be too expensive. The drop in PLDT in New York by almost Dollars 1.50 signalled a weak opening, and caused its domestic shares to lose 25 pesos at 1,320 pesos. The commercial and industrial sector tumbled 80.15 to 4,212.35, the property group shed 2.57 to 109.95 and mining fell 155.78 to 5,115.03. SYDNEY closed sharply lower, hit by a firmer Australian dollar. The All Ordinaries index dipped 31.8 or 1.7 per cent to 1,877.7 and turnover was ADollars 491m. Brokers said the higher currency helped to underpin the bond market. Among the actives, BHP shed 38 cents to ADollars 18.54, CRA 16 cents to ADollars 17.02 and WMC 17 cents to ADollars 7.18.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STUDY DETAILS CHILD INJURIES IN TRUCK BEDS  </P> <P> Children who ride in the back of a pickup truck are often thrown from the  vehicle and seriously injured, but California and most other states do not  require that they be protected, pediatric researchers said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "A kid traveling in the back of a pickup truck is an unguided missile," said  Dr. Phyllis Agran, an associate professor of pediatrics at UC Irvine College of  Medicine who has monitored children's injuries at local hospitals for more than  10 years.  </P> <P> Children are much more frequently ejected from pickups than adults, even in the  absence of a collision, Agran said. Often they fall out when the truck  accelerates, swerves or goes over a speed bump.  </P> <P> Dr. George Anthony Woodword, an associate professor of pediatrics at the  University of Utah School of Medicine, agreed.  </P> <P> At a national conference of pediatricians Wednesday, he presented a study  involving 40 children who were injured when they fell or were thrown from a  pickup. "Thirty-eight percent of the injuries occurred in non-crash events," he  reported.  </P> <P> Noting that national sales of compact pickup trucks increased 300% from 1980 to  1986, Woodword said legislators and the public need to recognize the danger and  take steps to protect children.  </P> <P> Agran noted that in California, dogs must be harnessed when riding in the back  of a truck, but there is no legislation that directly addresses people riding  in a truck bed. However, children under 4 must be restrained at all times in  cars and trucks.  </P> <P> Woodword spoke at the Anaheim Hilton and Towers Hotel, where more than 3,000  pediatricians from the American Pediatric Society, the Society for Pediatric  Research and the Ambulatory Pediatric Assn. met for scientific discussions this  week.  </P> <P> Agran attended the meetings but did not present her research here. However,  co-researcher Diane Winn gave a report on the UCI project to the American  Trauma Society in Washington last Thursday, and she and Agran described their  results Wednesday in an interview.  </P> <P> The UCI study covered children taken to 10 Orange County hospitals after falls  out of trucks from 1980 to 1989.  </P> <P> Of these, 201 children were injured while riding in the cab of the truck, 89  while riding in the back, Winn said. Four of those children died after they  were thrown from the truck bed in a crash.  </P> <P> She noted that 24% of the children were injured when there was no crash;  rather, they fell out when the pickup swerved, turned a corner or sped up.  </P> <P> Enclosing the back of the truck does not ensure that children riding there  won't be injured, she added; 25% of injuries involving children riding in back  occurred in enclosed trucks -- sometimes when they were ejected from the back.  </P> <P> Woodword reported similar results -- children "banging around in the back of  the cab. Twenty-seven percent of our patients were injured like that -- five of  those very seriously, with head injuries, internal injuries."  </P></p>

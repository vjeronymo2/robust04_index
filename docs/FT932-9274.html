			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Realignment in Iberia THE REALIGNMENTS by Spain and Portugal on the day that the Banque de France made its sixth reduction in interest rates since election of the new government confirms the emergence, since last September, of two sharply delineated monetary tiers in the European Community. The Maastricht treaty had to be obscure on this point. Markets have been less bashful. Yet being in the second tier need not be disastrous. The good reason for bewailing this lowly status is fear that the opportunity will be wasted. Should it not be, however, those in the second tier will make life for those in the first tier more uncomfortable than it already is. A two-tier EC will be full of contention. It would be wrong to blame these realignments on the forthcoming Danish referendum. A more plausible explanation is the after-shock of the first one. But even that earthquake revealed Europe's structural flaws more than it caused them. By undermining the credibility of the move to economic and monetary union, the Danes forced people to look at the economic fundamentals. What they then found has been graphically described by the staff of the International Monetary Fund: 'Actual achievements in convergence among ERM countries  - although significant  - were neither durable nor deep enough to justify assuming complete fixity of exchange rates. Losses of competitiveness, large fiscal deficits not yet under control, weaknesses in financial sectors, sharp cyclical differences, and divergent mixes of monetary and fiscal policy across counties (in the wake of German unification) were each vulnerable elements.' Political costs 'Vulnerable elements' imply vulnerable countries, with Spain in that category. A country which needed relatively high interest rates, because its inflation had not converged on the best European levels, long had one of the strongest currencies in the system for precisely that reason. The peseta's strength was an illusion that depended on the assumption that realignments were in the past. Once events had destroyed that assumption, markets challenged the strength of the peseta, which was realigned by a cumulative total of 11 per cent in September and November of last year. Now it has been realigned by another 8 per cent, the result being a total devaluation of 20 per cent. Politically, this latest depreciation seems certain to damage the re-election campaign of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, who has carried fidelity to the ERM and the Maastricht treaty before him like a standard. The government has been caught out in what electors may judge a lie. The damage would be still greater if this realignment were not to forestall early pressure for another. The plight of Portugal's government is less serious, because its government can blame this second devaluation of the escudo on its bigger neighbour, just as Ireland blamed the UK. Conflicts sharpened Economically, with inflation down to an annual rate of 4.6 per cent, Spain in deepening recession and today's report on employment  - leaked yesterday by the finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga  - showing the number of unemployed up 253,000 in the first quarter of 1993, to 21.7 per cent of the labour force, short-term interest rates have to fall. Overnight interest rates at 16 1/2 per cent and three-month interbank rates only a little lower are unsustainable. If the depreciation does allow interest rates to fall sharply, however, and Spanish firms take advantage of the devaluation, without conceding higher wages, the chances of a non-inflationary recovery look good. While beneficial for Spain, that development would sharpen conflicts in Europe. Once again, a recession-bound France is faced with a significant loss of competitiveness against an important European trading partner. The conclusion of the European Community's analysis of the ERM has been that it needs to be managed better. That is unquestionably true. Operation of the system must avoid repeated damage to the reputation of governments, along with enrichment of speculators at the expense of taxpayers. But more fundamental changes will be needed if attempts to restore monetary order and political harmony to Europe are to succeed.</p>

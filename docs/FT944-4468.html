			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Technology: Worth taking the trouble - Roland Adburgham on technical advice for small companies The most difficult thing we face,' said John Emanuel, managing director of the consultancy Pax Technology Transfer, 'is mind-set: 'I've got my car, my holidays - I don't want the trouble'.' He was telling a seminar about the common response of directors to the idea of using technology to expand their businesses. His view was echoed by other specialists who feel that many UK companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), are too wary of technology transfer. 'There is a strong disinclination to change in this country,' said Ian Harvey, chief executive of British Technology Group. The seminar was at TransTech International, a fair organised in Cardiff last week by the Welsh Development Agency and partly funded by the European Commission's Stride programme, which aims to strengthen the innovation capabilities of SMEs in assisted areas. The fair sought to encourage companies to benefit from technology transfer. 'Innovation, or particularly technology transfer, is vital to long-term industrial health and growth,' said Harvey, stressing it was as important for service companies as for manufacturers. 'Technology transfer is not a zero-sum game. It is an international game of mutual benefit to the players.' He had a caveat. 'Technology is often the key to innovation, but it is only part of the total mix.' Two basic approaches were outlined. A business could license out its own technology, earning fees or royalties. Alternatively, it could license in, or buy the rights to, technology from academic institutions or companies and organisations. 'Companies need to scour the world for the technology they require - often it need not and should not be developed in-house,' Harvey said. While Harvey added that larger companies needed their own research and development base, Anne Powell, of the Academic Industry Links Organisation, observed: 'R&amp;D costs for SMEs often look extraordinarily high.' She stressed the value of collaborative research. 'Universities are still a very much under-used resource as far as UK companies are concerned.' Donal O'Connor, of the Licensing Executives Society in Britain and Ireland, agreed R&amp;D had many uncertainties. 'For small-to-medium companies, often the buying-in of technology and expertise is better than doing one's own research.' Paying a royalty of 5 to 10 per cent of a product's sale price might seem high, but it could be minimal compared with the cost of an R&amp;D department. He said technology transfer 'is used much more often by large companies than small, but in my view is more useful for small companies.' He outlined the basic steps of technology acquisition as: identification of need; sourcing and assessment of technology; negotiation of the licence; and financing the deal. In the search for suitable technology, O'Connor advised, much could be done in-house: through contact with government and support agencies, trade literature, patent searches, trade associations, innovation centres and venture capital firms. SMEs, despite constraints on management time, should initially do much of their own technology sourcing to enable them to understand the process. But Emanuel felt companies always needed help in seeking ideas and strategic partners, with help from consultants. A searcher might need to identify a couple of hundred projects before shortlisting 10 to 15 for board discussion. Typically, the time taken to reach a licensing agreement is six to 18 months. Roland Whaite, of the UK Patent Office, said much duplication of research could be saved by looking at patent disclosures - Hitachi, he mentioned, employed about 150 staff to search patents continuously. If people did not examine patents, they ran the risk of missing much information which was not published in any other form.</p>

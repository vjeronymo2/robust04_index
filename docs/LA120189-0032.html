			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE;  </P> <P> FESTIVAL IS OVER, BUT SOVIET ACTS WILL KEEP ON COMING  </P> <P> Mayor Maureen O'Connor did not welcome Don Hughes as part of the official  Soviet Arts Festival when he presented the Red Army Chorus and Soviet rock star  Vladimir Kuzmin, but no matter. The Red Army Chorus pulled in an audience of  16,000, Hughes' largest ever in San Diego; Kuzmin signed an exclusive contract  with Hughes' organization, International Attractions, and the promoter intends  to keep the exchange going with more Soviet fare through next year.  </P> <P> The next event in the hopper is the high-jumping Soviet Acrobatic Revue at the  Old Globe Theatre this Tuesday through Dec. 17. Hughes recently opened an  International Attractions office in Moscow to facilitate other Soviet  attractions. Coming up next year are:  </P> <P> * The Rustavi Company, a group of Georgian singers and dancers, at Symphony  Hall Feb. 27-March 4.  </P> <P> * The Obraztsov's Moscow Puppet Theatre at the Old Globe Oct. 16-28.  </P> <P> * The Koslov Youth Dance Ensemble of Moscow, a group of 49 child folk dancers,  to be presented from September to November at a venue to be announced.  </P> <P> Combine those with the Old Globe's independent production of Fyodor Abramov's  "The House," the Maly Drama Theatre of Leningrad show scheduled for 1990 or  1991, and San Diego shapes up to be the Soviet performer's home away from home.  </P> <P> Hughes also plans to present the Moscow Boy's Choir in 1991, as well as the  Peking Opera and the Peking Acrobats. He is also working on other attractions  from the Soviet Union and other nations in the Soviet Bloc.  </P> <P> Hughes said he has no problem attracting acts from the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "The ambition of every Russian performer is to work in the States," he said.  "It is the absolute dream. I have people call me in New York and say, 'I don't  believe it, I'm in America!' "  </P> <P> Hughes' involvement with acrobats goes back to 1974, on the heels of near  disaster. He was presenting Stephen Sondheim's "A Little Night Music" while  living in Johannesburg, South Africa. The show opened to critical raves, but  the audiences never materialized. He canceled the show before the run in the  theater was scheduled to end and figured it might take him a year and a half to  recoup his losses.  </P> <P> Then a stranger named Ken Hai called and asked Hughes if he wanted to book his  show. Hughes said yes, and soon the Taiwan Acrobats arrived, filling up the  house through the end of the run.  </P> <P> Hughes took the Taiwan Acrobats to the United States, where he decided to  settle himself. He hired Hai, who now runs his Asian division. Hai checked out  the Soviet Acrobatic Revue, and when he told Hughes that "the Soviet acrobats  are just as good as the Chinese acrobats, that was good enough for me," Hughes  said.  </P> <P> Hughes once asked Hai why he called him that day in South Africa.  </P> <P> "I told him, 'You have turned my life around, you know,' " Hughes said. Was it  Hughes' reputation that prompted the call? His track record? The fact that he  had an empty theater starving for an act?  </P> <P> Hughes said Hai told him: "I looked in the Yellow Pages and your office was the  nearest one to my hotel."  </P> <P> It came as no great surprise to anyone -- especially not the principals  involved -- that Harris Goldman, executive producer at Starlight Musical  Theatre since October, 1988, officially quit as of Tuesday.  </P> <P> The words seemed friendly enough on both sides as Marshall Lucas, president of  Starlight's board of trustees, spoke of his great respect for Goldman, and  Goldman spoke of wishing Starlight well, but it was hard to miss the relief  between the lines as Lucas and Goldman reached a final agreement on buying out  the rest of Goldman's three-year contract, which was to expire Oct. 3, 1990.  </P> <P> Goldman will continue as a consultant at Starlight and will be involved in  union negotiations while he explores other opportunities in the performing arts  in San Diego.  </P> <P> Lucas has assigned the interim job of acting business manager to comptroller  Steven Bevans while Starlight searches for a replacement to Goldman.  </P> <P> That search will be preceded by some soul searching on the part of the  organization, according to Lucas, as Starlight, with the help of a committee of  executive producers, reevaluates what sort of producer it wants, both for their  own needs and in light of what is happening in the rest of the country.  </P> <P> "I have a tremendous amount of respect for Harris Goldman, but maybe we weren't  ready for some of the things he wanted to do," Lucas said. "We are going  through tremendous growing pains, and, while we're meeting with success, we  still have to keep the flavor of Starlight as we move into the '90s and do  shows that people have never seen before."  </P> <P> There's no rush to fill Goldman's post; the 1990 season is already in place and  the theater is dark until May 23, when Stephen Sondheim's "Follies" will open.  </P> <P> The new appointment might not be made until April or May, Lucas said. More  important than filling the seat is determining just what Starlight wants from  the person in it.  </P> <P> "We could bring in Hal Prince and it could be a problem. Or Tommy Tune. It all  depends on what our needs for the future are," Lucas said.  </P> <P> PROGRAM NOTES: Local composer Max Branscomb will give a workshop production of  his new musical, "JFK," about President John F. Kennedy, at Southwestern  College Dec. 8-9 in the Arena Theatre at Mayan Hall, Chula Vista. Admission is  free. . . .  </P> <P> The Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company will give a benefit performance of "Hay  Fever" on Nov. 11 for children with cancer and their siblings as part of its  second Future Audience program. . . . Rumor has it that additions to the  executive staff at the Gaslamp are imminent. . . .  </P> <P> The La Jolla Playhouse will announce Jan. 3 whether it has raised the requisite  money to ensure a 1990 season. Raising $500,000 by Dec. 31 is the goal. . . .  </P> <P> Look for some familiar faces in the Old Globe's "Uncle Vanya," opening the 1990  season Jan. 11-Feb. 18. The cast includes Richard Easton ("Waiting for Godot"  and "Measure for Measure"), Lynne Griffin ("The School for Scandal"), Richard  Kneeland ("Waiting for Godot" and "Breaking Legs"), Jonathan McMurtry ("Waiting  for Godot" and "Measure for Measure") and Byron Jennings ("Coriolanus") . . .  </P> <P> Auditions for the California Young Playwrights Project at the Gaslamp Quarter  Theatre are Saturday. Call Larry Hogue at 232-6188 to set up an appointment.  </P></p>

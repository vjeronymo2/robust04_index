			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: US gains offset by Japan's losses Wall Street was determined last week to retrieve what it had lost in reaction to Mr Clinton's tax plans the week before, and even the bombing of the World Trade Centre on Friday could not prevent US equities posting a 2.2 per cent gain. The Nomura Research Institute Europe is not impressed. It stands by a massively under-weight recommendation for the US market, says it is more than fully priced for 'good news' and that failure to break into new high ground after the drop in US long bond yields 'provides the clearest sell signal yet seen'. Japan's 0.6 per cent decline was the main reason why the FT-Actuaries World Index was limited to a 1.0 per cent rise in local currency terms. Some observers are waiting for a slump in Tokyo when the fiscal year ends, investment books close and balance sheet ratios are set for the banks at the end of this month. NRI Europe takes the contrary view. It says the deflationary impact of the rally in the yen will push the authorities towards further moves, 'this time massive', to reflate. A full one percentage point cut in the discount rate, and a Y20,000bn (Dollars 170bn) fiscal package would clearly not hurt the equity market, say the researchers: 'On the contrary, we suspect that the market is (finally) going to deliver the coup de grace to the bears by staging a sharp rally up through 20,000.' The week's worst performer was Mexico, extending a period of relative weakness this year. Market professionals blame worries over prospects for the North American Free Trade Agreement and interest rates, the latter reflect-ing a national trade deficit which has increased five-fold since 1990. In Europe, opinion gained strength towards the end of the week that a reduction in key German interest rates was again imminent. France, which advanced 2.2 per cent last week, is especially interest rate-sensitive.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change   % change in                  % change in local currency**    sterling** US Dollars**              1 Week  4 Weeks   1 Year   Start of  Start of    Start of                                           1993      1993        1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      +1.44    +7.14   -19.79     +6.60     +11.24      +4.55 Belgium      +0.21    +2.34    +1.47     +7.74     +12.59      +5.82 Denmark      -1.55    -1.99   -19.43     +8.78     +15.00      +8.09 Finland      +3.60   +13.44   +10.45    +16.63      +8.98      +2.44 France       +2.25   +11.54    +1.19     +8.05     +13.82      +6.98 Germany      +0.50    +7.67    -5.61     +9.87     +15.34      +8.41 Ireland      +3.69    +5.32    -8.59     +9.57      +6.34      -0.05 Italy        +2.94    +7.27    +1.90    +18.80     +17.18     +10.13 Netherlands  +1.05    +5.29    +5.88     +7.29     +12.44      +5.68 Norway       -1.31    +0.46    -6.88     +1.90      +7.10      +0.67 Spain        -0.13    +2.01    -8.19    +10.39     +14.27      +7.39 Sweden       +0.55   +11.46   +19.12     +6.13      +2.19      -3.96 Switzerland  -0.47    +1.23   +13.71     +1.90      +4.12      -2.15 UK           +0.75    +2.15   +12.99     +1.50      +1.50      -4.60 EUROPE       +0.88    +4.81    +5.31     +5.46      +7.59      +1.12 Australia    +1.22    +5.80    -3.46     +3.69     +11.51      +4.80 Hong Kong    +3.63   +11.78   +28.45    +15.58     +23.10     +15.70 Japan        -0.62    -1.24   -15.48     -1.66     +10.70      +4.04 Malaysia     +2.31    +6.20   +14.08     +5.71     +11.81      +5.09 New Zealand  -0.70    +5.24    +0.29     +2.39     +11.02      +4.34 Singapore    +1.32    +1.90    +3.61     +4.50     +10.84      +4.19 Canada       +0.42    +3.88    -6.67     +1.91     +10.34      +3.70 USA          +2.18    +0.98    +6.83     +1.68      +8.18      +1.68 Mexico       -4.00   -10.56   -15.10    -14.94      -8.95     -14.42 South Africa -1.63    +0.02    -7.00     +5.32     +20.33     +13.09 WORLD INDEX  +1.03    +1.56    -0.51     +1.92      +9.00      +2.45  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on February 26th 1993.

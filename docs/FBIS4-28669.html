			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Vice Minister Tsutomu  Tanaka of the Economic Planning Agency [EPA] said Friday [10  June] the Bank of Japan's [BOJ] quarterly economic survey  released earlier in the day reflected steady progress toward  recovery of the domestic economy.    Tanaka told a news conference the survey, known as Tankan,  was a "big plus factor" for the domestic economy and the agency  hopes the government's stimulus measures will lead to  full-fledged recovery.    He cited sluggish capital investment plans by medium and  small enterprises as a minus factor which can be traced to  growing investment overseas by manufacturers.    Tanaka said the central bank report was one of the factors  for judging domestic economic trends and that the agency will  take all such factors into account in making its own assessment  of the economy.</p>

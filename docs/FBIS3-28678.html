			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii said Tuesday [8 February] that Japan's ruling coalition  struck a 6 trillion yen tax cut deal by taking his ministry's  position on the issue into consideration.    The ministry had urged that a tax cut proposal be combined  with a revenue-boosting step to finance it.    Fujii told reporters that Tuesday's agreement was not based  solely on the ministry proposal, but did take it into account.  He also said the whole amount of the tax cut will be funded by  deficit-covering bond issues.</p>

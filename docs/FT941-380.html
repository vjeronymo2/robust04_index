			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Tibbett &amp; Britten tops Pounds 24m Tibbett &amp; Britten Group, the distribution company, reported a sharp increase in sales and profits, mainly because of a full-year contribution from Silcock Express, the car distributor it bought at the end of 1992 for an initial Pounds 31.2m. Tibbett's pre-tax profit rose by 64 per cent to Pounds 24.2m in the year to December 31, while sales increased by 56 per cent to Pounds 360m. Mr John Harvey, chairman, said the group had also enjoyed significant underlying growth. Earnings per share rose by 37 per cent to 37.4p (27.3p). Of that increase, two thirds was due to Silcock and one third to organic growth. The group on Monday further increased its involvement in the motor industry by agreeing to pay Pounds 15.4m in cash for Toleman, a lossmaking UK car distribution company. Depending on its performance, Tibbett may pay up to a further Pounds 2m for Toleman, which in 1992 made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.4m on sales of Pounds 35.8m. Silcock will integrate its operations with Toleman to provide a more effective service for Ford UK, its largest UK customer, which has promised to grant the combined operation a long-term rolling contract on a prime supplier basis. Mr Harvey said that although the trading environment was challenging, there was a high level of inquiry in all the group's markets and 1994 promised to be another lively year, offering substantial organic growth potential. A final dividend of 9.7p makes a total for the year of 14.2p (11.8p). COMMENT A 12p drop in the share price to 813p seemed a grudging response to figures which were in line with expectations. There may have been some concern over the ending of several contracts, but some changes are inevitable and the group was very upbeat about the level of recent inquiries. Just as impressive was the achievement in lifting net profit margin from 6.4 to 6.7 per cent at a time when there is widespread concern about pressure from food retailers - even if they now only account for about 20 per cent of group activity. Forecast profits of Pounds 28m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 19. The shares are not cheap at this level, but the group's track record and growth prospects justify the premium rating.</p>

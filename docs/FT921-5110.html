			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / SIB bows to life companies' lobbying: Plan to require sales agents to disclose policy charges is dropped THE Securities and Invest-ments Board has bowed to pressure and withdrawn plans to require life assurance sales agents to disclose their own companies' charges to customers. Such a move would have made it easier for consumers to shop around. Instead, the SIB, the City's chief investment regulator, will announce next week that sales agents only have to tell customers the average cost of similar policies sold by all insurance companies and make projections about how much those charges will offset investment returns over the life of the policy. Consumers thus will have no easy basis for determining whether they are purchasing the product of a high-cost or a low-cost producer. The rules are part of a review of the disclosure regime required for life insurance companies and others, such as unit trust companies, who sell retail financial products. The SIB has been under pressure from the UK's largest insurance companies, which mainly sell 'with profits' policies, to back off from its original plan to make each company disclose its own costs. The with-profits companies have persuaded the SIB that it would be impossible to guess what costs will be many years into the future. The SIB is also believed to have backed away from one of its more controversial plans to require companies to spell out costs simply in pounds and pence, expressed as either a reduction in investment return or as a reduction in premiums paid. Instead, it has agreed a formula that will satisfy some objections of the insurance industry which urged that costs simply be expressed as a percentage. The new rules, however, will offer some aid to consumers by requiring companies to tell prospective customers how much of their premium payments they will lose if they cancel within the first five years of a policy's life. The rules will also require sales agents to disclose the so-called 'cross-over point' - the year in which a policy holder can expect to get back all premiums paid, albeit without any investment income, if the policy is terminated. Because sales agents receive their full commission when a policy is sold, policyholders are charged selling costs in the early years of their contract. This 'front-ending' of costs means that holders of 20-year endowment policies must pay premiums regularly for seven to 10 years before they are entitled to a 100 per cent refund, according to figures compiled by Lautro, the self-regulatory body for life assurance and unit trust sales agents. The new rules on disclosure are part of a wide-ranging package of reforms currently under review by both SIB and Lautro. The review follows a judgment by the Office of Fair Trading that life assurance companies' failure to tell prospective customers how much they are being charged was anti-competitive. Consumers, however, will be offered some basis for comparison by new rules which will require companies to disclose so-called surrender values of policies, showing just how much of each year's premium is retained to cover sales costs in the early years of a policy.

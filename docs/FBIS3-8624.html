			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with General Rasim Delic, chief of </F> general staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, in Split, by Mihat  Kulender, in Sarajevo, on 12 March--live or recorded]    [Text] Our producer (?Mihat Kulender) talked to Army  General Rasim Delic about the talks so far.    [Kulender] Mr. Delic, the talks concern the principles of  military organization in the future federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. What were the concrete decisions reached so  far?    [Delic] On 11 and 12 March, I had a meeting with General  Roso  in the Dalmacija villa here in Split, from where I am speaking,  in the presence of General Galvin. One of the aims of the  meeting was to create conditions for organizing a joint army of  the future Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. During a constructive  discussion over these past two days we found solutions to all  problems linked, above all, to a transitional period. Namely,  [word indistinct] was to first fully examine whether the Zagreb  agreement of 23 February this year was implemented in its  entirety. We came to a conclusion that a great deal has been  done and that the work is nearly completed. The aim here was to  create conditions for the overcoming of certain problems and the  setting up of initially a shared and then a united command of  the future federation, in accordance with the constitutional  [word indistinct], which are expected to be passed and which  will be signed by these three representatives, in our case by  Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency.    In any case there were not too many controversial issues.  Details of this agreement are being prepared. We are expecting  to sign it any minute now, after which a joint press conference  will be held.    [Kulender] What was the general atmosphere during the talks?  The information media have been optimistic.    [Delic] One should say that the talks, even compared to the  Zagreb talks on the cease-fire agreement, were even more  constructive and the atmosphere was more relaxed. Every issue  was examined from the aspect of the interests of both sides and  above all in the interest of the future federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. I can say that, starting with the welcoming  ceremony and all the honors bestowed on the representative and  commander of the Bosnia- Herzegovina Army by the state  authorities, i.e., the army of the Republic of Croatia, an  atmosphere was created for conducting the talks in the most  natural and best possible way and this is exactly what happened.    [Kulender] The talks were also attended by U.S. President  Bill Clinton's special military envoy, General John Galvin.    [Delic] Yes, he was present. His presence was extremely  important because he is a man with a rich military experience  who made appropriate suggestions regarding the organization and  functioning of such an important institution as the army. It is  certain that this is a form of guarantee, a fact that gives  backing to this agreement to be signed.    [Kulender] Mr. Delic, thank you for this conversation. In  case we failed to ask you something you would wish to comment  on, please go ahead.    [Delic] There is not much to add, but it should be said that  this agreement covers many issues of vital importance to the  army. All these issues certainly cannot be enumerated and  commented in such a brief conversation. In any case, my best  regards to your listeners, and I could say that we have  established the dynamics for the further elaboration of this  document because we shall not remain on the present text--we  shall elaborate in the near future and come up with concrete  solutions that should be implemented in the field as was the  case with the implementation of the Zagreb agreement.    [Kulender] Thank you, Mr. Delic.</p>

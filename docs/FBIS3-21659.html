			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] At the Police Department at  1400 on 9 December, Police Lieutenant General Kowit Phakdiphum,  the commissioner of the Narcotics Control Bureau [NCB], said  that there have been reports that Hong Kong police officials  arrested suspected narcotics traffickers on 8 December. Among  those arrested was a Thai, Major General Thanat Phakpadiphat,  who is assigned to Supreme Command. [passage omitted]    When asked if Maj. Gen. Thanat's name is on the list of  suspected narcotics traffickers, Lt. Gen. Kowit said that his  name is not on the list. Because this was an American arrest  warrant, Hong Kong police officials will have to extradite the  suspect to the United States. The United States will state its  reasons and show us what evidence it has later on. As for the  details about this case, all that he knows is that prior to  this, American police officials arrested two Thais on 6 December.    A report stated that Maj. Gen. Thanat was arrested at 1200  hours on 8 December along with a first lieutenant who serves as  his aide. But after being questioned, the first lieutenant was  released because he was not involved. Before the arrest of Maj.  Gen. Thanat, U.S. DEA officials arrested Mr. Michael Woo, a Thai  Chinese, and Miss Saowani, surname unknown, and seized 30 kg of  heroin. During the interrogation, Mr. Woo implicated Maj. Gen.  Thanat, who was later arrested.    When Maj. Gen. Thanat went to pick up his share of the  money,  $20,000, he was arrested. A news source said that besides Maj.  Gen. Thanat, the United States has also issued a warrant for the  arrest of Mr. Lee Chin Hung, a Yunnanese Chinese who works for  Khun Sa. American officials asked the Thai Police Department to  find and arrest this suspect, because it had been learned that  he was hiding in Thailand. At 1300 hours on 9 December, NCB  officials arrested Mr. Lee at the Chanphen Restaurant on Rama 4  Road, Bangkok. He will be extradited to the United States for  further handling of the case.    General Wimon Wongwanit, the Army commander-in-chief, talked  about the arrest of Maj. Gen. Thanat, a CRMA Class 9 officer  assigned to Supreme Command who was arrested in Hong Kong on  charges of being involved in narcotics-trafficking activities.  He said that he has been informed that the person arrested  really was a soldier, but just because he is a major general  doesn't necessarily mean that he serves in the Army. But  regardless of which unit he is in, if he violated the law, he  must be dealt with in accord with the law. He said that  officials acted correctly in arresting him. Those in the  military must know that if they break the law, the military will  not protect them.    Lieutenant General Anuson Kritsanaserani, the director of  the  Information Office, Supreme Command, said that he has received a  report on the arrest of Maj. Gen. Thanat and that he has  reported this to General Prasoet Sanrut, the deputy supreme  commander. He does not yet know the details, but the Thai  consulate in Hong Kong has been asked to investigate the matter.  If he did commit a crime, he must be dealt with in accord with  the law.    Lieutenant General Chettha Thanacharo, the 1st Army Region  commander, said that those who violate the law must bear the  consequences. The only thing is that we must wait for the  verdict. He said that he just learned of this. According to  military regulations, the matter must be handled in accord with  the law. Discipline must be enforced very strictly, because he  is a soldier. "According to military regulations, if a soldier  breaks the law, he must be dealt with very harshly. His crime  cannot be covered up. He must be punished severely. We must see  what his intention was. Maj. Gen. Thanat is a good person. It's  hard to believe that he was involved in something like that."  [passage omitted]</p>

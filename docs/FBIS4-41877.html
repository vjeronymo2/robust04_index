			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Golts: "Crisis Nearly Over, Talks </F> Begin"]    [Text] The Korean peninsula crisis seems to have passed.  Moreover, the current shifts in relations between the two Korean  states, and also in relations between the DPRK and the United  States, inspire hope that the situation on the peninsula will be  finally extricated from four decades of deadlock.    It has just been announced that agreement has been reached  on  holding a first-ever meeting between the leaders of the DPRK and  South Korea. It was simultaneously reported in Washington that  a third round of talks between the DPRK and the United States  will begin in Geneva on 8 July. Judging by statement by the  White House press secretary, American diplomats are geared up  for serious work.    "Talks will continue until such time as they are  productive,"  she said. Particular importance attaches to the fact that  Washington has acknowledged that the DPRK nuclear program has  been frozen.    So we can heave a sigh of relief: A situation fraught with  almost the danger of war has now been successfully defused. It  is time to ponder the lessons of what has happened. The main  one, in my view, is that the world community has to accept that  the world contains and will obviously continue to contain states  which are highly different from each other in terms of system  and ideology. And it is absolutely senseless to attempt to  change them with the help of threats and sanctions. Because the  result could turn out to be the opposite of what you wanted.    Thus, like it or not, the only road is the broadest possible  communication with these states at all levels. It is necessary  to destroy the myth that "external forces" are threatening their  countries' independence. It is not through threats but through  consistent dialogue that these countries can be integrated into  the world community. It seems that trial and error has brought  this realization to even those who only yesterday were counting  solely on sanctions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev -- Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn  Landyk, has informed a UNIAN correspondent that a telephone  conversation took place on 22 February between Acting Prime  Minister Yuhym Zvyahilskyy and representatives of the Turkmen  Government on the matter of the suspension of the gas supply  from Turkmenistan to Ukraine.    Following the Ukrainian side's reasoning that: "No one has  done this before. If God has given you gas, it is not worth  abusing this," a preliminary accord was reached on selling  60,000 tonnes of wheat to Turkmenistan to credit the debt and  payment by Ukraine of $50 million of the 150 million debt.  After this, it is likely that the supply of gas to Ukraine will  be resumed.</p>

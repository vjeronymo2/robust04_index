			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / BAA to double airport investment to Pounds 1.4bn BAA, the privatised UK airports group, yesterday announced plans to double capital spending to Pounds 1.4bn over the next three years after reporting a 13 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 322m. Revenues rose 15.3 per cent to Pounds 1.1bn in the year to March. The strong performance coupled with a proposed one-for-one scrip issue helped push up BAA shares 11p to 949p yesterday. Although income from regulated airport charges was virtually flat at Pounds 368m, reflecting the Civil Aviation Authority's price control formula, net retail income rose by 7.6 per cent to Pounds 328m with passengers spending on average 5 per cent more in airport shops. Retailing is increasingly becoming a prime source of income for BAA and is expected eventually to overtake revenues from regulated airport charges. The big increase in capital spending reflected the need to cope with expanding air travel in the UK. 'By the turn of the century, we are expecting nearly a third more people to fly through our London airports than at present,' said Sir John Egan, BAA's chief executive. Passengers using BAA's airports increased 5.6 per cent last year to 82m, with 71.5m using the three London airports of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. Sir John said passenger traffic was continuing to grow by around 5.5 per cent this year, confirming the economic recovery. Overall, BAA is forecasting annual growth of around 4 per cent until the end of the century. Sir John argued that Heathrow's planned Terminal 5 was 'vital' for BAA, the UK aviation industry and the UK economy. He said recent estimates suggested that more than 180,000 jobs were generated by economic activity at Heathrow airport. BAA was confident it could finance its ambitious investment programme from its own cash and borrowings. 'Our key ratios have continued to improve, with interest cover rising to 4.8 and gearing falling to 28.5 per cent,' said Mr Nigel Ellis, finance director. 'We will ensure that we have the capacity to build Terminal 5 without the need for a rights issue.' However, he said cash flow, which was positive last year, would be negative this year with the higher capital spending. Debt is expected to start rising. BAA is proposing a final dividend of 11.25p, giving a total for the year of 18p, a 12.5 per cent increase on the previous year's 16p. Earnings per share rose 12.7 per cent to 47p (41.7p). The company is also proposing to introduce a scrip dividend to allow shareholders to take their dividend payments in shares instead of cash. Lex, Page 20; Capital spending details, Page 22</p>

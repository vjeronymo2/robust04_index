			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> B-17 BOMBER FLYING IN FOR AIRCRAFT MEET  </P> <P> Don't be alarmed if you see a giant bomber flying over Ventura County today.  Its mission is peaceful.  </P> <P> The B-17, one of about 10 of the planes still in existence, is flying in from  Visalia to help kick off the Camarillo Experimental Aircraft Assn.'s swap meet  and aircraft display at the Camarillo Airport.  </P> <P> The four-engine bomber will be escorted by a Camarillo-based Navy SNJ, which,  like the B-17, was used extensively during World War II. The planes are  scheduled to rendezvous over Fillmore at 11:30 a.m. and fly in formation to the  airport, where they will be on display through the weekend.  </P> <P> The B-17 is being supplied by the Confederate Air Force, a nonprofit historical  group. About 13,000 B-17s were built in the late 1930s and early 1940s, but  today only about 10 remain capable of flying. GARY GORMAN  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY REQUESTS INSPECTION REPORTS ON COLLAPSED AWNING  </P> <P> Almost two months after a heavy, department-store awning collapsed in a busy  shopping center, narrowly missing a group of lunchtime shoppers, the city  building department is making its first formal requests for the store's  building inspection records.  </P> <P> Pete Lopez, the city's chief of structural inspection, said he sent letters  this week requesting the records from five different sources, all of which were  connected in some way to the store's construction in 1977.  </P> <P> Through those records, city officials hope to identify the special inspector  who may have approved faulty welding that caused the 2-ton, concrete-and-metal  awning above the main entrance to the Robinson's department store in La Jolla  to collapse.  </P> <P> Although no one was injured when the awning crashed onto the sidewalk at  University Towne Centre June 15, Fire Capt. Al Macdonald said the incident had  the makings of a "major disaster."  </P> <P> City officials later determined that faulty welds, combined with the ravages of  wind and weather, caused the collapse. What they could not find, however, was a  series of periodic inspection reports that should have been included in the  city's building file for the project.  </P> <P> In an interview last month, Lopez said the city does not keep such records,  which are routinely done by city-certified, independent inspectors, because  filing them would be "a monumental task."  </P> <P> Later, Lopez said city officials receive progress reports every two weeks  during construction, plus a final report, and all of those records should be  included in the building files.  </P> <P> The Robinson's reports, Lopez said, could not be located because they had  either been lost or misfiled.  </P> <P> "We file any document that we have and microfilm it," Lopez said. "That's the  policy now, and that was the policy then.  </P> <P> "I knew what the procedure was, but knowing the procedure and verifying whether  the procedure is carried out are two different things," Lopez said.  </P> <P> This week, Lopez directed letters to Robinson's officials and also to the  architectural firm that designed the building, the construction firm that did  the work, the engineering firm that oversaw development, and the company that  supplied the inspector for the project, he said.  </P> <P> Lopez said he requested the records by telephone from Englekirk &amp; Hart  Consulting Engineers, the project's engineering firm, last month. The firm  responded by sending the city a copy of one special inspection report covering  only part of the project.  </P> <P> That report was signed by Robert Lakin, an inspector who apparently died last  year, Lopez said.  </P> <P> But, with only one report available, city officials could not determine how  much of the work Lakin had personally inspected, said Richard Christopherson,  the city's director of building inspection.  </P> <P> "He may have been filling in for the regular inspector that day, or he may have  done the whole project," Christopherson said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, City Councilman Ron Roberts has requested that the city manager's  office prepare a report on the Robinson's incident specifically and the  building department's record-keeping procedures in general.  </P> <P> "When you have a failure and a file disappears, that concerns me," Roberts  said. "That's a major screw-up if they can't even find out who the special  inspector was."  </P> <P> Although Roberts said he hoped to hear the report at the Sept. 5 meeting of the  Public Services and Safety Committee, one of the committee's staff members said  the councilman would have to formally request the report at that meeting.  </P> <P> That might mean that the city manager's report would not be heard by committee  members before November, said Raquel Beltran, a legislative specialist for the  committee.  </P> <P> "This is getting awful messy," Roberts said. "The deeper we get into this, the  worse it stinks."  </P> <P> Roberts said he was puzzled by the fact that the building department was only  beginning to make formal inquiries for the records this week.  </P> <P> "I don't know why they've waited," Roberts said. "It's been several months. I  thought they had concluded their investigation."  </P></p>

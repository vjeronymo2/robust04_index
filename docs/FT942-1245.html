			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / State sell-offs boost for Latin American economies Latin American government privatisation of state enterprise and moves to lower import barriers and deregulate business have had an immediate benefit on productivity in the region, according to a study published today. The assessment of Latin American productivity by the management consultancy McKinsey, found that privatisation, in particular, had provided a striking example of the potential for productivity improvements. It argues that the efficiency improvements seen to date in Latin America suggested that multinational companies 'should look at Latin America as a growing region where their knowhow can be transferred in a profitable way'. The wave of acquisitions of local companies by foreign multinationals 'points precisely in this direction', the report said. Productivity improvements were significant in two of the four industries it studied: telecommunications and steel. In the most marked improvement, the productivity of telephone workers in Argentina doubled from 1989 to 1993  - to 66 per cent of US levels. However, the report also concluded that in three of the four industries, labour productivity was very low. This was in part the fault of inefficient management, described as a 'bottleneck' in the process of achieving productivity gains. Management was often overly hierarchical, reflecting a bureaucratic rather than a managerial approach. 'In steel, productivity averaged 37 per cent of the US level, 31 per cent in the food processing industry and 29 per cent in the retail banking industry,' it said. It noted particularly poor performance in the Argentine banking industry  - at 19 per cent of the US level  - and in the Colombian steel industry at only 15 per cent. In general, state-owned industries were significantly less productive than their privatised counterparts. 'State-owned banks in Brazil pay their employees almost three times the private sector levels, but their employees are only half as productive as private sector banking employees. 'The Dollars 10bn difference in wages is equivalent to the amount the country pays as interest on its foreign debt,' the report said. There was one exception: Colombia's state-run telephone company, where workers were as productive as those in the US.

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Final quarter puts seal on strong year at JP Morgan J. P. Morgan confounded Wall Street sceptics with record trading income during the final quarter of 1993, setting the seal on a strong year for the US bank. Income from trading in financial markets reached Dollars 606m, compared with a previous record of Dollars 520m in the second quarter of last year, as Morgan profited from trading in the emerging country debt markets. Many had projected that the previous record, set during a time of instability in European currency and interest rate markets, would be hard to match. The trading performance helped push net income in the last three months of the year to Dollars 392m, or Dollars 1.92 a share, and for the year as a whole to Dollars 1.72bn, or Dollars 8.48. Both figures were at the high end of analysts' expectations. Morgan reported post-tax profits of Dollars 221m, or Dollars 1.10 a share, for the comparable 1992 quarter, and Dollars 1.13bn, or Dollars 5.66, for whole of 1992. Two factors held net income for the period below the third-quarter level in 1993, when it had reached Dollars 468m, or Dollars 2.30. The bank took a Dollars 120m pre-tax charge to cover property and relocation costs. Also, revenue described by the bank broadly as 'other non-interest income' was Dollars 129m lower due to the boost given to the previous period from a big investment gain. Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman, singled out risk management and emerging markets as two businesses which had seen 'notable increases' in demand. For the year as a whole, trading revenues reached Dollars 2.01bn, up from Dollars 959m the year before, when Morgan took losses from trading mortgage-backed securities. Corporate finance revenue rose to Dollars 532m from Dollars 439m, credit-related fees to Dollars 224m from Dollars 214m, investment management fees to Dollars 464m from Dollars 377m, operational service fees to Dollars 491m from Dollars 409m and other non-interest revenues to Dollars 406m from Dollars 164m. By contrast, net gains from investment securities fell to Dollars 323m from Dollars 388m. Net interest revenues rose Dollars 64m to Dollars 1.77bn, and it took no provisions for credit losses during the year, compared with a Dollars 55m charge in 1992.</p>

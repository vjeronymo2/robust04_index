			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARIEL SHARON FOR PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL;  </P> <P> WARRIOR THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF ARIEL SHARON BY ARIEL SHARON (SIMON &amp;  SCHUSTER: $22.95; 556 PP.; 0-671-6055-0)  </P> <P> "Who's afraid of Arik Sharon?" an Israeli news magazine asked a few years ago.  It answered its own question: "Everybody."  </P> <P> In his autobiography, "Warrior," Ariel (Arik) Sharon, whose career as soldier  and politician spans the history of modern Israel, struggles to overcome his  reputation as a single-minded zealot who is ready to take the world to the  brink of war -- and beyond -- to achieve his vision of Israel's national  destiny. The man who then-Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger once called  "the most dangerous man in the Middle East" presents himself in this book as a  reasonable individual who, if the responsibility comes his way, can lead the  nation to a lasting peace with its Arab adversaries.  </P> <P> Make no mistake, this is a political document. Sharon, who was forced to resign  as defense minister in 1983 after a blue-ribbon commission determined that he  bore "indirect responsibility" for the massacre of Palestinian civilians in the  Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps south of Beirut, is actively maneuvering to  become Israel's next prime minister. The autobiography must be considered part  of a concerted campaign to refurbish his image, both inside Israel and abroad.  </P> <P> Israel's next general election is not scheduled until 1992, but under the  country's parliamentary system, it could come earlier. Sharon clearly intends  to become a major contender for the post now held by Prime Minister Yitzhak  Shamir.  </P> <P> Few Israelis are neutral when it comes to Sharon. He is widely feared and even  hated, especially by persons on the left of the country's political spectrum,  but also by some people who generally share his political outlook. At the same  time, he may be the most popular leader among the growing segment of the  Israeli population that supports the right-wing Likud bloc.  </P> <P> In the autobiography, ghostwritten by David Chanoff, Sharon seems to have three  purposes. First is to give his own spin to the many controversies he has been  embroiled in since his early days as a soldier in the Haganah, the Jewish  militia that fought and won Israel's War of Independence in 1948. Second is to  even scores with his Israeli political adversaries, especially Labor party  leaders like former Prime Minister Shimon Peres and former Army Chief of Staff  Chaim Bar Lev. And third is to assure foreigners -- and especially Americans --  that he is not dangerously motivated by blind hatred of Arabs.  </P> <P> "(T)hough Israel is a Jewish nation it is, of course, not only a Jewish  nation," Sharon writes. "We live here with minorities, with Druze, Bedouin,  Circassians, and especially with (Palestinian) Arabs. . . . I begin with the  conviction that Jews and Arabs can live together. I have repeated that at every  opportunity, not for journalists and not for popular consumption, but because I  have never believed differently or thought differently, from my childhood on."  </P> <P> There is, of course, no suggestion that Sharon would ease Israeli terms for  peace. He makes no apology for his hard-line views or his determination to  assure the country's security. But he is not a racist and he wants everyone to  know that. Some of Sharon's more enthusiastic supporters are, indeed, anti-Arab  bigots. And, despite his own apparently sincere conviction that Jews and Arabs  can live together, there is nothing in this book to change the minds of those  who back Sharon because they expect him to drive a hard bargain.  </P> <P> Ever since Sharon, as defense minister, led the Israeli army into Lebanon in  1982, American policy makers have been nervous about the possibility that he  might someday become prime minister. Sharon has been trying for years to  overcome that American concern, using such techniques as off-the-record dinners  with American opinion makers in posh New York restaurants. Although Sharon is  frequently critical of U.S. government policy, he realizes that U.S. support is  vitally important to Israel's survival.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Sharon provides plenty of raw meat for his hawkish supporters in  Israel. From young soldier to defense minister, Sharon participated in all of  the wars and most of the armed skirmishes that have marked Israel's  strife-filled history. He describes the conflicts in considerable detail,  making it clear that, in his view, there is no substitute for aggressive and  audacious tactics that emphasize maneuver and attack. And he heaps scorn on  some of Israel's best-known political and military leaders when he concludes  that they acted less boldly than they could have.  </P> <P> Along the way, the account sometimes varies from what has become the generally  accepted historical record. As a general and as defense minister, Sharon's  decisions were often controversial. This is his version of reality and it is  not always shared by others who participated in the battles.  </P> <P> For instance, Sharon maintains that he did nothing wrong in ordering troops of  the Lebanese Falangist militia to mop up Palestine Liberation Organization  guerrillas who, Israeli intelligence reports indicated, were hidden in the  Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps following the PLO's evacuation of Lebanon.  </P> <P> He said the Lebanese Christian forces were told to make sure they did not harm  civilians and that he expected them to comply with those orders. Sharon said he  was at home on his ranch in Israel when he first heard reports that the  Falangists were engaged in indiscriminate killing of women, children, old men  and other noncombatants.  </P> <P> "(N)o one had batted an eye at the idea of sending in the Falangists; certainly  no one had in any way anticipated the events that occurred that night," he  wrote.  </P> <P> However, a three-member commission, headed by Chief Justice Yitzhak Kahan of  the Israeli Supreme Court, decided that Sharon was indirectly responsible for  the killings because he knew, or should have known, that the Falangists would  take revenge on Palestinian civilians for the assassination earlier in the  month of the Falangist leader Bashir Gemayel. Despite Sharon's protest that no  one could have foreseen the massacre, many witnesses told the commission that  it was common knowledge that the Falangists were bent on revenge and, given  their place in the history of Lebanon's bloody communal strife, there was a  high risk of atrocity.  </P> <P> There is much in Sharon's book that will outrage his many enemies. His  narrative is a continuous recitation of past battles, both military and  political -- most of them won, a few of them lost. But the reader will be  hard-pressed to find a single instance where Sharon admits to even the  possibility that he may have been wrong. By Sharon's account, Israel prevailed  when it listened to him and foundered when it did not.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Sharon's story parallels Israel's story. He recounts the names  and events that formed the modern Jewish state. He is scathing in his treatment  of longtime political foes like Peres and Bar Lev, apparently concluding -- no  doubt correctly -- that anyone who would be offended by that criticism has been  lost to his cause anyway. But he is often flattering in his description of  Israeli heroes like David Ben Gurion, Menachem Begin and Moshe Dayan, possibly  hoping to place himself in the same class with the nation's popular founding  fathers. As for his potential rivals for leadership in the Likud -- Shamir and  Deputy Prime Minister David Levy -- Sharon hardly mentions them at all.  </P></p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                   Pyongyang appears to be trying to grant the IAEA just enough  access to its nuclear sites to prevent the collapse of U.S.-DPRK  talks, a strategy that may be aimed at retaining maximum  bargaining leverage with Washington.                                       END SUMMARY     Although Pyongyang media have not yet commented on the outcome of  the IAEA inspection team's just-completed visit to North Korea,  the South Korean news agency Yonhap on 16 March cited IAEA  spokesman Hans Meyer as saying that although the IAEA inspection  team was allowed to inspect North Korea's seven declared sites,  it was not permitted to examine every item on its original  agenda.  Similarly, Seoul's  KBS-I radio the same day cited the  IAEA team as reporting that compared with past inspections, there  had been "improvement" in inspection activities allowed during  the IAEA team's latest visit.  However, the team could not  extract enough samples to prove definitively whether or not North  Korea had diverted nuclear materials for uses other than what it  had declared, according to the radio.     Not surprisingly, Pyongyang is pursuing an equally minimalist  strategy in its talks with South Korea.  Pyongyang radio on 16  March accused Seoul of attempting to obstruct upcoming DPRK-U.S.  high-level talks by blocking progress at the latest round of  inter-Korean talks.  According to the radio, at the latest round  the North adhered to its "reasonable" insistence that the sides  issue a joint communique declaring their basic intent to realize  an exchange of special envoys at an early date.  Pyongyang radio  also asserted that the South had refused to accept the North's  version of a draft agreement on procedural matters and claimed  that Seoul is "deliberately" creating difficulties, bent on  "putting the brakes" on DPRK-U.S. talks, tentatively set to start  in Geneva on 21 March.     Pyongyang seems to be calculating that by making limited  concessions at the North-South talks, it can cast the South in  the role of obstructing the planned talks with Washington.  For  example, according to Pyongyang radio accounts of the 16 March  meeting, the North Korean chief delegate juxtaposed the North's  "broad-minded and epoch-making" willingness to lift four demands  that North Korea previously advanced in the talks to the South's  "sanctimonious" rejection of North Korean proposals.     Interest in Foreign Trade     Despite its stance on IAEA  inspections and North-South contacts, Pyongyang also seems to be  tempering its hardline stance by carefully signaling that its  long-term goal is to reach a peaceful settlement of the nuclear  issue.  To this end, the North Korean news agency KCNA waited  until 15 March--the day a Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a  threatening statement about U.S. preconditions on DPRK-U.S.  talks--to publicize a set of free trade zone regulations that had  been adopted on 21 February.  The regulations concern the  operation of foreign businesses within North Korean free trade  zones.  Similarly, the next day KCNA reported on regulations,  also adopted on 21 February, for the implementation of the tax  law on foreign enterprises.  Both sets of trade regulations  presuppose an influx of foreign investment into North Korea, an  event not likely to occur without a peaceful resolution of the  nuclear issue.     Implications     Pyongyang media treatment of recent developments  concerning the nuclear issue suggests that the North Korean  leadership may believe that it has already given Washington  enough incentives so that it would not be willing to risk the  heightening of tensions on the Korean peninsula by breaking off  U.S.-DPRK talks.  Pyongyang appears to be trying to retain as  much of its "nuclear card" and control over the inter-Korean  issues as possible in order to enhance its position at any future  bilateral negotiations with Washington.

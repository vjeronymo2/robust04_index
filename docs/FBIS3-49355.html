Mr. Bogoev sees two possible ways to  resolve the scandal. One way is to invoke the effective  legislation and above all the Constitution. To this end, at  least one-quarter of the total number of MP's should move to  impeach the president. To be carried, such a motion requires  the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the national  representatives. The Constitutional Court will then be asked to  rule whether the head of state had violated the Constitution,  the presidential adviser noted. The second way is to resolve  the current conflict by the "fade-out method," of which there is  a strong probability, Mr. Bogoev said. If the National Assembly  Committee on National Security takes up the matter, things will  by all means take a fade-out course because the committee does  not have the competence of the Constitutional Court and will  wait for the scandal to subside. This is convenient because,  without a settlement in substance, the matter could always be  brought up again, the president's adviser observed. He  explained that Dr. Zhelev's decree regulated the internal rules  of procedure of the office of the president.</p>

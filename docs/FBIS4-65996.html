			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 25 (AA) -- Defense Minister Mehmet  Golhan, currently in Brussels for the NATO defense ministers  meetings, on Tuesday [24 May] said that it should be made clear  that Russia's policy toward the former Soviet republics is not  approved of.    Stressing that developments in Russia should be carefully  evaluated, he said that although the Soviet Union has  disintegrated and the Warsaw Pact split up, the Russian  Federation has not lost its importance in the view of security.    "The alliance should think of more practical ways to bring  up  responsible ties with this country," Golhan said.    Golhan also stressed the importance of inciting the Central  Asian republics to join a Partnership for Peace agreement set up  by NATO and former East-bloc countries, saying the joining of  Russia to this agreement is a satisfactory development.    Defense ministers from allied countries on Tuesday welcomed  a  statement by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev that Russia  would sign up for Partnership for Peace without setting special  conditions.    Golhan also said that Turkey has close historic and cultural  ties with Balkan countries, stressing the importance it gives to  Bosnia-Herzegovina's sovereignty, independence and territorial  integrity.    He expressed Turkey's concern over a potential risk which  results from the spreading of weapons of mass destruction, such  as biological and chemical weapons, in its neighboring regions.    Golhan also said that during the NATO meetings all kinds of  international terrorism activities were condemned and called for  an effective antiterrorism fight which constitutes a threat to  international relations.</p>

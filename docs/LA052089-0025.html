			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> TRACEY ULLMAN PUTS HER BEST SKETCHES FORWARD  </P> <P> Tracey Ullman fans will have a pleasant time with her one-hour special on  Sunday at 9 p.m. on Channels 11 and 6, a compilation of what she considers her  best sketches over the past year. Tracey Ullman detractors -- that is, those  who find themselves driven inexplicably morose in the face of excess cute --  won't have much to complain about either: The show is varied, well-paced,  bright and weightless enough to seem mercifully brief.  </P> <P> Ullman is not the subtlest of performers, and there is lacquered hardness about  her that thwarts her occasional attempts at pathos. But she's a keen observer  with a good ear, a comedian with exceptional performing skills, and a generous  ensemble player. (She gets a lot of help from Dan Castellaneta in a variety of  roles.)  </P> <P> Sketches include Ullman as a Valley Girl stopped by the CHP for drunk driving;  a singles type infatuated with a ventriloquist dummy; a nightclub singer, part  of an Edie-and-Steve-style sweetheart duo who travels to Japan with her husband  to meet up unexpectedly with his illegitimate son; a horny prison inmate who  wants to get it on with her pen-pal husband during a conjugal visit; and part  of a trio of brown-nosing executive trainees competing for a job.  </P> <P> Ullman is a dexterous and versatile entertainer. All she needs is a tough,  astute director to teach her change of pace and the capacity for thought. The  show highlights her skills without severely exposing her weaknesses.

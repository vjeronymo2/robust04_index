			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: New York Employment figures have developed a habit of spooking the Treasury market. A month ago, news of a 267,000 increase in non-farm payrolls for April wiped two points off the price of the 30-year bond. The bond had earlier tumbled one and a half points on news of a 456,000 increase in March (later revised to 464,000). The memory of those routs will make the markets nervous ahead of the May figures, due out on Friday. Most economists are expecting an increase in non-farm payrolls of about 300,000, with the unemployment rate unchanged from the previous month at 6.4 per cent. Anything higher would rattle the markets afresh. Last Friday, first-quarter GDP growth was revised up to 3 per cent (most observers had been expecting a downwards revision, to 2.4 per cent). Faster-than-expected employment growth would imply a pick-up in consumer spending, in turn leading to higher GDP growth in the current quarter. It may be less than two weeks since the Federal Reserve appeared to put the market out of its misery with a half-point interest rate rise, but the bond market is already getting another bout of the jitters. The National Association of Purchasing Management's May index, due on Wednesday, will set the tone ahead of the employment numbers.</p>

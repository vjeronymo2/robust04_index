			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Singapore may face shortage of staff SINGAPORE'S financial sector looks set to remain a strong part of the buoyant south-east Asian economy, according to a survey by the Singapore Institute of Banking and Finance. However, bankers fear growth could bring staff shortages, writes Christine Moir. The sector has grown at an average of 20 per cent a year for the last five years, twice the rate for the economy as a whole. Last year, its growth was 22 per cent compared with an average for the country of 8.3 per cent, and it employs 4.2 per cent of the labour force. According to a survey of 292 financial institutions by the IBF last autumn, employment in foreign exchange and treasury functions, and investment management (the sectors with the strongest economic growth) is likely to increase by 6.6 per cent a year over the next three years. Demand in futures and options trading, retail banking and computer services will be similar. Top salary scales have reached international levels; the IBF survey assumes average top executive salaries equivalent to USDollars 950,000. Mean salaries for the sector are about USDollars 24,000, nearly three times the average wage in Singapore. At the other end of the scale, basic clerical staff receive about USDollars 8,000. This is insufficient to attract immigrants from other Asian centres such as Hong Kong, let alone international financial markets. Most senior financial sector executives expect business to remain robust, possibly outstripping the IBF forecast of staffing growth of 5.9 per cent, 3.2 and 3 per cent during each of the next three years.</p>

Name of Standard. Ada (FIPS PUB 119&hyph;1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Category of Standard. Software Standard, Programming Language. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Explanation. This publication is a revision of FIPS PUB 119 and supersedes that document in its entirety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This publication announces the adoption of American National Standard and the International Organization for Standardization Reference Manual for the Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC 8652:1994, as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). American National Standard and the International Organization for Standardization Reference Manual for the Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC 8652:1994, specifies the form and meaning of programs written in Ada. The purpose of the standard is to promote portability of Ada programs for use on a variety of data processing systems. The standard is for use by implementors as the reference authority in developing compilers, interpreters, or other forms of high level language processors; and by other computer professionals who need to know the precise syntactic and semantic rules of the standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.

Federal standards for high level programming languages permit Federal departments and agencies to exercise more effective control over the production, management, and use of the Government's information resources. The primary objectives of Federal programming language standards are: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _To encourage more effective utilization and management of programmers by insuring that programming skills acquired on one job are transportable to other jobs, thereby reducing the cost of programmer re-training; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _To reduce the cost of program development by achieving the increased programmer productivity that is inherent in the use of high level programming languages; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _To reduce the overall software costs by making it easier and less expensive to maintain programs and to transfer programs among different computer systems, including replacement systems; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _To protect the existing software assets of the Federal Government by insuring to the maximal feasible extent that Federal programming language standards are technically sound and that subsequent revisions are compatible with the installed base. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Government-wide attainment of the above objectives depends upon the widespread availability and use of comprehensive and precise standard language specifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Applicability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Federal standards for high level programming languages should be used for computer applications that are either developed or acquired for government use. FIPS Ada is one of the high level programming language standards provided for use by all Federal departments and agencies. FIPS Ada is suitable for use in programming and any applications for which there is no specific language available specifically targeted to that application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. The use of FIPS Ada is recommended for the following applications and situations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Those involving control of real-time or parallel processes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Very large systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Systems with requirements for very high reliability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Systems which are to be developed with reusable software packages. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _When it is anticipated that the life of an application will be longer than the life of the presently utilized equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The application or program is under constant review for updating of the specifications, and changes may result frequently. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The application is being designed and programmed centrally for a decentralized system that employs computers of different makes, models and configurations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The program will or might be run on equipment other than that for which the program is initially written. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The program is to be understood and maintained by programmers other than the original ones. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Earlier spokesman of the service Aleksey Kondaurov told TASS  that the total number of Russian counterintelligence officers  will amount to 75.000 which is 46 per cent less than before the  former Security Ministry was transformed into the Federal  Counterintelligence Service.    Stepashin said that besides counterintelligence tasks, his  service will, jointly with the Interior Ministry, fight  political terrorism.    "The president, the government and the parliament have to  know what's happening in the country. It is necessary to  predict also situations connected with political terrorism,  other actions aimed to overthrow the constitutional system", he  said.    This task will be partially solved by the Interior Ministry  and partially by the counterintelligence service, he added.    The main objective of the counterintelligence service, which  directly reports to the president, is to cut short foreign  spying and subversive activities against Russia, according to  Stepashin.    The service will have a department of counterintelligence  operations, of counterintelligence provision for strategic  objects, of military and economic counterintelligence.    At the same time the former Security Ministry anti-organised  crime department was transferred to the Interior Ministry, while  the investigation department became a part of the office of the  Russian prosecutor general. The former KGB investigation prison  in Lefortovo was also trasferred to the Interior Ministry. The  counterintelligence service, in its turn, nay get the "Alpha"  and "Vympel" commando units.</p>

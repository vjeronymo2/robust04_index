			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Fed intervenes again to support the US dollar The US Federal Reserve yesterday again intervened in the market to support the dollar, writes Philip Gawith. Traders said the Fed, which started to intervene as European markets were closing, was probably trying to underline its seriousness by getting the US currency to finish in New York above its Wednesday close. The Fed first bought dollars at DM1.5155 and Y97.90. On Wednesday it came in at DM1.4955 and Y96.10. The dollar closed in London two pfennigs up at DM1.5146, from DM1.4945, and at Y97.6050 from Y96.205. It ended in New York at DM1.5186 and Y97.735. The markets were very quiet before the Fed came in, with most traders waiting for the release of the US payrolls data today before making their next move. The thin conditions allowed the Fed to achieve a measure of success, in spite of the absence of any support from other central banks, save for the Bank of Japan. In Europe, the main mover was the Swedish krona, which fell back to close at SKr4.847 against the D-Mark, from SKr4,802. This was a reaction to an opinion poll showing that 52 per cent of Swedes would say no to EU membership. In the UK, the Bank of England dealt at established rates in its daily money market operations. This suggested that there had probably been no decision taken to lift interest rates at the monthly monetary meeting on Wednesday. Analysts agreed that Fed intervention had bought time for the dollar, without arresting the negative sentiment towards the US currency. A number of reasons were suggested as to why the Fed had intervened. These included: concern that a weak dollar would feed into US inflation; signalling disapproval of the level to which the dollar had fallen; and wanting to stabilise the currency ahead of next week's quarterly treasury refunding, and the mid-term congressional elections. Today the key focus will be the non-farm payroll. If it comes in above market expectations, and the Fed does not respond with a firm tightening of monetary policy, traders are likely to sell the dollar again. The market was again thick with explanations for dollar weakness. The most commonly heard is the fear that the Fed is moving too slowly to combat inflation. Also much mentioned is the US's large current account surplus, which is seen as creating a structural oversupply of dollars that can only result in dollar weakness unless offset by commensurate capital inflows. But according to Mr Paul Chertkow, head of currency strategy at UBS in London, these explanations do not wash. He said the US current account deficit, of around 2 per cent of GDP, is no worse than Germany's, but the D-Mark is appreciating. He also recalls that the dollar was a strong currency in the 1985-7 period when the current account surplus was closer to 4 per cent. Mr Chertkow said, instead, that the dollar's weakness is attributable to lack of confidence in the currency, and US assets, following the Clinton administration's policy of 'dollar debasement'. As a result, US assets were not bought, and the capital flows were insufficient to combat the size of the current account deficit. For this reason, he added, the issue of whether or not the Bundesbank participated in the intervention was irrelevant; 'the issue here is the US, whether the Clinton administration atones for the policy of debasement'. Mr Chertkow said the dollar had been driven lower by short-term players. Financial investors and corporates had been largely out of the market. The resultant illiquidity meant that the short-term operators had been able to exert disproportionate influence. He went on to say that institutional investors were underweight in the dollar because they were underweight in US assets. As a result, they were a potential source of follow-on dollar buying, should the Fed succeed in getting short-term speculators to start pushing it higher. Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan in London, said intervention had recently been conspicuously unsuccessful; 'Dollars 25bn of Bank of Japan intervention through the year has massively exceeded Fed intervention, without turning the dollar trend'. Tight bill conditions in the UK money markets saw three-month LIBOR rise to 6 5/32 per cent from 6 1/8 per cent. In its daily operations, the Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 635m of late assistance, after earlier supplying Pounds 406m of liquidity. The shortage was Pounds 1.25bn.</p>

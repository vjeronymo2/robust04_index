			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Arts: Today's Television Channel 4 is a British network with London headquarters. London is one of the world's great capital cities: its earliest buildings stood on the banks of the Thames before the Romans arrived. Thousands of plays, films and programmes have been made about London. So what do you suppose is the linking theme for Channel 4's special Christmas season? That's right - New York. They begin with Tall Stories (7.50), a short documentary about New York skyscrapers. At 10.00 comes RuPaul's Christmas Ball, RuPaul Charles being a black American drag queen and 'chanteuse'. Channel 4 asserts that 'his appearances on American chat shows have made him a household name'. Not in your house, perhaps, or mine, but in those of Channel 4 executives no doubt. 11.05 brings the first of four programmes looking at New York's 24-hour cable news service and that is followed by Straight Out Of Brooklyn (11.35) a movie about lives of violence and poverty in New York. Do you often find yourself with friends lamenting the paucity of American material on television?</p>

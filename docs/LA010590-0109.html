			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE COLLEGES;  </P> <P> SMITH MAKES MARK WITH FRESH START FOR HUSKIES  </P> <P> Safety Tommie Smith of the University of Washington football team has belied  the notion that freshmen should be neither seen nor heard.  </P> <P> The former Antelope Valley High standout was one of only three true freshmen to  letter for the Huskies this season, and Smith concluded his first campaign by  making the first interception of his collegiate career in the fourth quarter of  Washington's 34-7 win over Florida in last Saturday's Freedom Bowl at Anaheim  Stadium.  </P> <P> The game capped a season of change for Smith, who reported to the Huskies as a  strong safety, but was moved to tailback when fall camp opened. A cartilage  tear in his left knee and subsequent arthroscopic surgery kept Smith out of  action until the fifth game of the season.  </P> <P> "When I got hurt, it gave me the time to get mentally ready to play," Smith  said. "I was laid back when I first came in. The time off helped me get my mind  straight and know what to expect when I got back."  </P> <P> When Smith returned, injuries had thinned Washington at strong safety, and he  was moved back to that position.  </P> <P> His collegiate debut proved to be a memorable one as he blocked a punt and  returned it for a touchdown against USC at the Coliseum. In all, Smith played  in seven games, almost exclusively on special teams, making eight tackles.  </P> <P> "As long as I'm playing, I'm happy," said Smith, who led Antelope Valley to a  28-22 victory over Canyon in the 1988 Southern Section Division II title game.  "I'm not picky about where I play."  </P> <P> Greener pastures: Brian Greenfield of the University of Pittsburgh, a former  standout at Notre Dame High, was the 17th-ranked punter at the NCAA Division I  level, averaging 41.7 yards a punt on 54 attempts.  </P> <P> In Pitt's second game, against Boston College, he had a punt of 66 yards, and  in the Panthers' victory over Texas A&amp;M in the John Hancock Bowl last week,  the junior averaged 42.4 yards for five punts, including a 54-yarder.  </P> <P> Greenfield, a converted soccer player, led the nation's junior college kickers  with a 45.9 average at Glendale in 1988.  </P> <P> Making their mark: Adonis Jordan of Kansas and Kenny Hicks of Stanford were  All-Valley basketball selections at Cleveland and Notre Dame highs last year,  but they never met on the court until last Saturday, when the Jayhawks defeated  the Cardinal, 83-61, for the championship of the Kansas tournament.  </P> <P> Though neither of them have played starring roles, Jordan and Hicks are getting  playing time in their first collegiate seasons.  </P> <P> Jordan, who averaged 18.5 points a game at Cleveland, is averaging 4.1 points  and 2.7 assists, while playing 13 minutes a game for the second-ranked  Jayhawks, who were 13-0 heading into Thursday night's game at Wichita State.  </P> <P> Hicks, who averaged 16 points in high school, is playing 10 minutes a game and  averaging 2.6 points for Stanford (8-1).  </P> <P> Warming trend: Kris Brodowski of Cal State Northridge didn't exactly scorch the  nets, but his three-for-five shooting performance against Biola on Wednesday  might have signaled the end of his shooting slump.  </P> <P> Brodowski had made two of 25 shots from the field in the Matadors' previous  four games.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-6 senior missed all nine of his shots against Cal State Hayward, all  four shots against Cal State Fullerton, was two for 10 against UC Davis, and  zero for two against Sacramento State.  </P> <P> Numbers game: With four seconds left in the semifinal basketball game of the  Cougar Holiday Classic on Dec. 28, the scoreboard read: Utah Valley 92, Canyons  89.  </P> <P> Canyons had the ball beneath its own basket and appeared to have a chance to  tie the score.  </P> <P> But the official scorer had Utah Valley leading, 92-88, and a Provo radio  station had the Wolverines ahead, 93-88.  </P> <P> Both coaches and officials conversed at the scorer's table to discuss the  discrepancy, but the 92-89 score was allowed to stand . . . for the moment.  </P> <P> Canyons, however, was unable to get off a three-point shot and time expired.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the official score will go in the record books as 92-88.  </P> <P> "That's what we're going to go by," Canyons Coach Lee Smelser said. "I had no  idea what happened on the scoring situation. It did open the door for us.  </P> <P> "The scorekeeper lost a point somewhere, but we still haven't found out where.  </P> <P> "All we know is we lost. The loss would have been much worse if we hit a  three-point shot at the end and then found out."  </P> <P> Hibernating: After a season-opening loss to Golden West College, the Canyons  women's basketball team reeled off a school-record 12 victories -- including a  win over El Camino, the top-ranked team in the state.  </P> <P> But with starters Dominique Ice (sore hamstring) and Dawn Coleman (flu)  suffering from injury and illness, that streak came to an end in last week's  Fullerton tournament with losses to Yakima Valley (Wash.) and College of the  Sequoias.  </P> <P> "It was good for us to lose," Coach Jeff Dunlap said. "We started to get  overconfident. We needed something to bring us down to earth and wake us up."  </P> <P> If those losses failed to do the trick, perhaps a 72-67 loss to Valley on  Wednesday did.  </P> <P> Staff writers Brendan Healey, Steven Herbert, Kirby Lee and John Ortega  contributed to this notebook.  </P></p>

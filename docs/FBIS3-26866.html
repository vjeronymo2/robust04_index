			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Keith Wallis] </F>   [Text] Construction of the airport railway has received a  major boost after the Mass Transit Railway Corporation [MTRC]  revealed international banks had pledged more than $12 billion  to help finance the 34-kilometre long link. The offers were  unsolicited and show the confidence finance houses have in the  project.    About 10 banks have offered to provide the cash which  represents more than half the $22 billion MTRC estimated it  would cost to build the airport and north Lantau railway in  1991. As a result there is likely to be more than enough money  to build the airport railway if China agrees to the latest  financing proposal to inject $60 billion in equity to the  railway and airport projects. as the airport's cost was  estimated to be $43 billion.    "The fact that financial institutions are willing to lend  this money even though Britain and China have still to agree an  airport railway financing deal shows how confident they are."  said Roger Moss MTRC's finance director. "When we tell them the  airport railway will make money they believe us because we have  proved to them in the past that our projections are correct."    He explained the offers had been made because of the MTRC's  extremely good connections but confirmed no loan agreements had  been made or signed. If MTRC takes up the banks' offers,  interest rates and payments would be negotiated as normal.    One of the banks involved is Banque Nationale de Paris which  refused to discuss its involvement. But other banks expressed  amazement at so much money being offered.    "The news is surprising because people have been talking  about the project in the market but have heard nothing  specific." said Wilson Wong Siu-wah, corporate finance manager  with ANZ Asia, who revealed there is pent-up demand to help  finance the railway. "The railway is very attractive because it  is a major project in Hong Kong. Generally banks do not like  long-term financing of 15 years or more and will only lend over  five to 10 years but the railway is an exceptional case backed  as it is by a quasi-government organisation."    His comments were echoed by another leading European banker  who believed that while "$12 billion is still a lot of money  even for Hong Kong," more than 100 finance houses in the  territory would be willing to commit themselves to the kind of  long-term financing needed for the airport railway. With that  kind of interest, the MTRC would be able to negotiate the best  deal available, he said.</p>

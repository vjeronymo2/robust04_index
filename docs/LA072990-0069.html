			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BELIZE NOTED  </P> <P> I read with interest the article on Belize by Bill Belleville in your June 24  Travel Section ("The Other Caribbean"). In March of this year, three couples,  including ourselves, rented a home on North Ambergris Caye.  </P> <P> For those who are considering spending some time on the Caye, I would like to  point out two important facts.  </P> <P> The Caye is divided by El Rio. South Ambergris, where the town of San Pedro is  located, has the shops, more hotels, restaurants and dive shops. North  Ambergris has fewer hotels, is more tranquil and water transportation to town  is provided.  </P> <P> The diving, snorkeling and fishing are indeed excellent. However, the swimming  is poor due to turtle grass and soft sand. Beautiful-looking beaches, but poor  for swimming.  </P> <P> Condos and houses are available on both sides of El Rio. Reservations should be  made as far ahead as possible for the best choices. Our three-bedroom, two-bath  home, with private dock and daily maid service, plus transportation to San  Pedro, was $200 U.S. per night. It was very well-equipped. Sundial Travel, 9430  Warner Ave., Fountain Valley, (714) 962-1176, handled our arrangements. For  information on houses and condos on the Caye, contact Mary Hawthorne (call  011-501-2531). She and her partner, Carlos, manage several of the nicer rentals  on the Caye, and were a great source of information and one of the prime  reasons our trip was so rewarding.  </P> <P> SARAH U.

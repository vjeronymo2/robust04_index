Is the  Russian President Healthy? An Impolite and Offensive Question  for Yeltsin That Has Troubled the Public All Week. How  Rhetorical Is It?"]    [Text] Yekaterinburg -- Lots of foreign and domestic news  agencies are now trying to learn from Sverdlovsk people who used  to know Yeltsin well whether the former first secretary of  Sverdlovsk CPSU Oblast Committee [obkom] suffered from any  chronic ailments. Put it this way -- among our circle, who were  once employed at the CPSU obkom special hospital, nobody saw  Boris Nikolayevich walking through the confusing corridors of  the hospital building on Working Youth Embankment with  prescriptions in his hand. I personally met his second and  third in command in this building -- everyone without exception  had to traipse round a dozen or so offices before they could get  their prescriptions filled! Boris Nikolayevich can be rebuked  for not paying attention to his health and not always finding  the time for compulsory checkups. But that is not our business,  it is the business of Yeltsin's relatives and doctors.    Admittedly, we would note that Boris Nikolayevich could have  been improving his health at the medical establishment in the  settlement of Izoplit, which was even more secret than the  clinic on the embankment.... But, strange as it may seem today,  the Sverdlovsk party nomenklatura's relationship with the press  was democratic, and I did manage to get a few urgent interviews  precisely in this "secret" medical firm, right at patients'  bedsides. Unfortunately, over the course of many years I never  saw Boris Nikolayevich here either. In the first half of the  eighties Yeltsin was so hard-working, demanding, and energetic  that he was more likely to drive any of his colleagues to  Izoplit through overwork. I recall that I met up at the  settlement with Viktor Makarov, a former "Uralkhimmash"  director, who had been taken ill inopportunely. During this  period Yeltsin was impatient about pursuing the idea of  fundamentally restructuring and modernizing this plant, and  insisting on automating old production facilities. He would tour  the shops himself with a good 100 plant directors and city or  rayon committee first secretaries trailing behind him....  Yeltsin sometimes set industrial enterprises such major and  fantastic tasks that anyone -- even the fittest director --  could have a seizure!    In the eighties, under Boris Nikolayevich, the Sverdlovsk  Oblast nomenklatura worked day and night, battling for the  oblast's identity to the last breath, without exaggeration.  Oblast Executive Committee Chairman Mekhrintsev and Deputy  Chairman Shkrebnev died untimely deaths. Top officials' concern  about model plants and villages was never noticed [as published]  in the capital, and was perhaps geared to gaining the Kremlin's  attention.... The more you built the more investment you got.  That was the way things were! I entirely share the view that  many responsive, hardworking, and reliable officials of that  time were stung by the innumerable visits to the oblast by  highly placed guests.... But you cannot touch the number one in  such circumstances! Any incautious behavior by a top man around  a dinner table even of dull clerks from Staraya Ploshchad could  result in his being sent to Paris or even Addis Ababa. There  had been other examples of this happening in the history of the  top Urals nomenklatura....    Now to turn to the question of "this matter." A secretary  with chronic ailments -- if such a person had existed -- would  never have gone to work in the Moscow City Committee. If some  people today are annoyed that Yeltsin was healthy enough to make  smart decisions, then in that case it is his opponents who are  suffering from hangovers. Nobody from Sverdlovsk who had been  through the Komsomol and party schooling would claim that Boris  Nikolayevich was sanctimonious about alcohol. His participation  in many youth and construction brigade festivities was a  tradition. But, as eyewitnesses will recall, the group of top  officials would never stick around until the bitter end. Boris  Nikolayevich, as a rule, instructed more junior party members to  look after the young people and ensure order at the festivities  -- and then hurried off to his own work. The good thing about  Yeltsin was that he did not lord things up at the celebrations,  but realized that the young people had earned the money  themselves, and, after the meal -- somewhat to the embarrassment  of the Komsomol members -- would leave a large sum on the table.  This purely ethical gesture would be copied by the other party  bosses.    Insofar as I recall, Yeltsin's entourage was not overfond of  people even hinting at going for a drink in the evening.  Aleksey Tsaregorodtsev, the former first secretary of the  Komsomol oblast committee, who was a Yeltsin aide, would get  angry if he thought there had been any drinking the previous day  and could quite justifiably ask: "Did you have to indulge last  night, guys?!" One talented man dismissed by Yeltsin as a  Komsomol obkom secretary for having attended a single party  literally a month after starting his career is today part of the  Urals industrial guard. The man turned out to be unusually  strong and was able to rehabilitate himself 200 percent after  Yeltsin's "punishment." But how tough was Yeltsin himself when  it came to the honor of a party worker?    Paradoxically, in the eighties the capital's opponents  rebuked the provincial Yeltsin for violating human rights,  including the rights of drinkers. Boris Nikolayevich stoically  supported and pursued throughout the Union the Seversk Pipe  Plant's initiative of "Collective Guarantees for Labor  Discipline!" -- this meant that if a single team member got  drunk or went absent, the entire collective would not get its  bonus! Lawyers from the capital's party apparatus hinted to  Yeltsin that neither the labor family nor a worker's personal  family should suffer, that alcohol dependency is a medical  rather than a party matter, that in this instance the cure  should be a private one rather than a party and state one....  Alas, it seems that in those days Boris Nikolayevich was more  consistently in favor of the anti-alcohol legislation than Yegor  Kuzmich [Ligachev].    I recall how I went into the office of V. Manyukhin, second  secretary of the CPSU obkom, with a freshly printed "dry" law.  Viktor Mitrofanovich, who was greatly concerned about the oblast  budget and the timely payment of wages, "assessed" the Staraya  Ploshchad initiative in terms which I had rarely heard even  among a small group of friends on a fishing trip.... Boris  Nikolayevich was silent at the time -- clearly he was more  subject to party discipline and was more cautious. Or perhaps  he felt slightly responsible for the fact that his own campaign  against drunkenness at work had been so distorted into the  Politburo initiative.    ...Who was the first to raise the subject of Russian  President Boris Yeltsin's "health"? Yeltsin's mother --  Klavdiya Vasilyevna -- was still in full health when we visited  her with foreign TV journalists. Yes, his mother was terribly  worried about her son's health, his mental balance, and the fact  that the Moscow climate did not suit him very much and he often  came down with colds. Klavdiya Vasilyevna was knitting woolen  socks for Boris Nikolayevich. The bottle of vodka which my  foreign colleagues had brought in order to talk in greater  detail with [Yeltsin's] younger brother Mikhail Nikolayevich was  requisitioned by me and placed in a briefcase. I told my  colleagues that Russians bring out their own bottles.... And if  Mikhail Nikolayevich wanted to greet you with alcohol he would  do so, if he did not -- tough luck!    Tea was served, along with jam from Klavdiya Vasilyevna's  kitchen garden. There were plenty of photographs of Boris  Nikolayevich as a child and a young man to keep the conversation  going....    And yet somebody was playing tricks! There is no other way  of putting it. Another team of journalists -- not the one that  was with KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. When I visited the team of  construction workers where Boris Nikolayevich's brother Mikhail  Yeltsin worked a few months later, I found him very angry.  Having trusted the West European press without having any  reliable local journalist intermediaries president, Mikhail  Nikolayevich later read some pearls of wisdom about the Yeltsin  family that had been concocted.    The sincere and very hospitable family found itself  described as "distant," "uneducated," "country bumpkins," and,  of course, "showing signs of alcohol dependency".... Quite  honestly, if such provocative attacks had been made by the  partners with whom I worked, Mikhail Nikolayevich would have  thumped me on the back of the neck with his concrete shovel. As  a result we stood on the roof of a unfinished house and agreed  never to give foreigners any more information on the Yeltsin  family!    ...Yeltsin was absolutely healthy when he left Sverdlovsk  for  Moscow. The last time I heard his happy, optimistic voice was  in the office of Viktor Kashpurov, the CPSU obkom's finance  chief, who was concerned about his boss' accommodations. In  practice these were telephone calls of farewell. Judging from  these conversations, Yeltsin's first days in Moscow were full of  energy and hope. Who was to know that there would be so many  suspicious people in the capital who are perhaps more sick than  the president!</p>

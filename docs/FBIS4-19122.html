			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "System Can Jeopardize PvdA-VVD-D66 </F> Coalition"]    [Text] The future of social security will become a tough  issue during the formation of a "purple" coalition (PvdA [Labor  Party], VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], and D66  [Democrats 66], without the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal]).  Both D66 and PvdA are opposed to the system the liberals would  like to implement.    This was revealed during last Sunday's radio debate between  the leaders of the four major parties. It was the politicians'  first direct meeting in the parliamentary elections campaign.    The D66 leader, Hans Van Mierlo, even stated that any  government agreement which provides for a system, is out of the  question. In such a system, employees would only receive a  basic allowance in case of unemployment or disability. They  would have to take out an additional insurance for themselves.    Van Mierlo and PvdA leader Kok had serious doubts about such  additional insurance. According to [VVD leader] Bolkestein,  however, such a system is perfectly feasible. He referred to  the situation of the self-employed. CDA leader Brinkman said  that employers and employees could reach agreements on  additional insurance plans during the Collective Labor Agreement  negotiations.    The D66 has been the strongest advocate of a "purple"  coalition for some time. The possibility of such a cabinet has  become greater, now that it has been suggested in CDA circles  that the party should go voluntarily into opposition if the  election results turn out to be as disastrous as anticipated by  the polls.    CDA leader Brinkman, however, rules out this possibility,  for  now: "It would be deplorable if we would create the impression  that we are preparing ourselves to be in the opposition."    For the VVD, discussing a "purple" coalition has become  "normal," Bolkestein says. He argues that both winners of the  next elections, most likely his own party and the D66, should be  definitely included in the new cabinet. He sees either PvdA or  CDA as a third potential cabinet member.    Within the PvdA, a "purple" coalition is not rejected  altogether. During a radio discussion, however, Kok referred to  the problems which can be expected with the VVD regarding the  future of social security. "I am mostly curious about the  differences between the policy proposals of the D66 and VVD.  There is definitely a difference between both liberal parties."  The PvdA leader is known to be more favorable to a cabinet  comprising the CDA, PvdA, and D66.    As could be expected, the party leaders were rather gentle  toward one another. The parties do not want to exclude each  other. Due to the expected election results, at least three out  of the four parties will be needed to form a cabinet which has a  majority in the Lower Chamber.</p>

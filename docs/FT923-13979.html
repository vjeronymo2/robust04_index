			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Leading Article: No squibs from SIB THE SECURITIES and Investments Board (SIB) yesterday confirmed what no one had previously doubted: there were serious deficiencies in the behaviour of the investment watchdog, Imro, in relation to the fund management companies in the late Robert Maxwell's business empire. SIB made the equally incontrovertible statement that the massive fraud perpetrated on the Maxwell pensioners reflected badly on the British corporate and financial system as a whole. The question is whether its moderate proposals for piecemeal reform amount to a credible response to the scandal. SIB's ultimate sanction under the 1986 Financial Services Act is to withdraw recognition of self-regulatory organisations. That is a draconian response which it has preferred to eschew. Instead it has opted for a clean-out at the top of Imro, proposals to strengthen Imro's organisations and procedures, and a review of this and that. These reviews will include one of its own procedures, in the light of SIB's failure to detect a shortfall in standards at Imro. Such a lapse had been predicted by countless observers long before the Financial Services Act originally came into force. SIB's new chairman, Mr Andrew Large, has also decided that a greater and more effective level of practitioner experience in the regulatory system is now called for. This seems an odd rejoinder to deficiencies at Imro, given that the two men departing the Imro camp - to their credit the only two to have accepted any real blame for the affair so far - were respectively a former leading light of the stock exchange and the former manager of one of Britain's largest pension funds. What has been missing at Imro, and in other self-regulatory organisations, is not practitioner input but the sense of mission and sceptical inquiry that pervades bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States. The absence of those qualities is rightly emphasised in the limited parts of Imro's own report on its performance that SIB's legal advisers have let it publish. To be fair to Mr Large, there are limits to what he can do about the inadequacies of pension fund regulation under his existing remit. The more important contribution on the nature and scope of future reform will have to come from Professor Roy Goode's committee and, ultimately, the government. Social services secretary Mr Peter Lilley's minimalist response to the Maxwell pensioners' plight inspires little confidence on that score. Nor did yesterday's performance in the Commons by Mr Norman Lamont, in which he denied, in effect, that earlier warnings about the inadequacies of trust law were relevant to the Maxwell case. Passing the buck is still the name of the game and it is not an edifying spectacle. The questions raised by the Maxwell saga about the effectiveness of the regulatory structure deserve better answers than they have received so far. A greater readiness to accept responsibility is also overdue.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Yogo Ito: "Assertion That Financing of </F> Plant and Equipment Funds on Same Level as Private Institutions"]    [Text] Looking askance at the loan slump of private  financial institutions, government affiliated financial  institutions are increasing their loan balance with low interest  financing as a weapon. In so far as it is a time when there has  been a lot of debate surrounding division of public and private  roles such as administrative reform, it is a situation where the  view is gaining prominence that government affiliated financial  institutions are suppressing private enterprise. However, the  government affiliate side has not changed its consistent  perception on functions that supplement private enterprise.  However, due to the expansion of loan limits that was  incorporated in the emergency economic measures, the market  feeling is that a crowding out of fund demand has been generated  for commercial banks.  <H3>  Plant and Equipment Funds Also Favorable for Private  Institutions </H3>   "We can't help being resentful about the fact that such a  one-sided view is rampant." A person in charge of business at a  government affiliated financial institution thus refutes the  point of the clamorous opinion that public enterprise has been  suppressing private enterprise in the aspect of loans.    Viewing the loan balance by business sector for the period  from June last year to June this year, according to the  "Economic Statistics Monthly Report" of the Bank of Japan, the  growth rate for plant and equipment funds was 5.8 percent of  city banks, 6.2 percent for long-term credit banks, and 5.6  percent for nationwide bank accounts. On the other hand, the  growth rate of non-facility funds was sluggish with a minus 2.0  percent for city banks, minus 0.5 percent for long-term credit  banks, and minus 0.9 percent for nationwide bank accounts.  Totalling plant and equipment funds and non-facility funds, the  growth rate was 0.6 percent for city banks, 1.5 percent for  long-term credit banks, and 1.2 percent for nationwide bank  accounts.    In other words, the refutation in the opening paragraph  views  as an issue the point that it does not clearly distinguish plant  and equipment funds and non-facility funds and only argues with  figures on a total basis where private financial institutions  are sluggish. On this point, the Japan Development Bank  summarizes the recent loan trends by saying, "if you consider it  from the point that the corporate desire for plant and equipment  investment is sluggish with the seriousness of the recession and  the circumstances that large corporations are actively procuring  funds by straight bonds, it is no exaggeration to say that loans  of plant and equipment funds by private financial institutions  are steadily increasing and are favorable."    The Japan Development Bank is completely specialized in  long-term loans of plant and equipment funds such as for big  projects or improvement of infrastructure, and does not make  short-term loans of working funds. The average lending period is  about 15 years. Consequently, it stresses that special factors  are at work, saying that "as opposed to repayments increasing  within a short period of time and increases in the loan balance  being small when the lending period is short like with the  private institutions, the aggregate balance is increasing for  the Japan Development Bank due to the long-term lending period."    Moreover, it emphasizes the point of developing functions  that supplement the private institutions in terms of quality,  saying that "by our bank financing projects whose profitability  cannot be measured precisely by private financial institutions,  the credibility of said projects rise also. If that happens, it  also is possible for the private institutions to participate in  syndicate groups. We are linked, so to speak, in producing  external results on the private institution side also."  <H5>  Zenith Age of Functions Supplementing Private Institutions </H5>   Regarding the cause for the sluggish loans of private  financial institutions, the analysis at the Japan Development  Bank is that "it is because compared to plant and equipment  funds, corporate needs for borrowing working funds are extremely  sluggish." Because they do not handle working funds, the Japan  Development Bank concludes that "basically, we are not batting  with the private institutions."    So, what about the Small Business Finance Corp. and the  People's Finance Corp. which have a relatively high loan ratio  of working funds for medium to small enterprises?    The loan balance situation for the Small Business Finance  Corp. was an increase of 7.5 percent over the previous year at  the end of fiscal 1992. Viewing several recent years, it was  similarly an increase of 8.8 percent for the end of fiscal 1988,  an increase of 19.7 percent at the end of fiscal 1989, and  increase of 11.0 percent at the end of fiscal 1990, and an  increase of 6.7 percent at the end of fiscal 1991.    Generally, in recessionary periods, the lending limit of  government affiliated medium- to small-sized business financial  institutions is increased by establishment of economic measures  to facilitated fund procurement by medium to small business. For  this reason, the loan balance easily has a high growth rate in  recessionary periods. However, the growth rate of the loan  balance actually was higher in the bubble era.    Moreover, the number of agency loans through private  financial institutions which have become "a kind of  characteristic in the aspect of supplementary functions to the  private institutions," (Small Business Finance Corp) was 2,729  in July, exceeding the 2,266 direct loans. In fiscal 1993 up  until July, there were 10,767 direct loans and 13,579 agency  loans. It is obvious that "viewing the numbers, the growth rate  of agency loans has been higher than direct loans." (same)    The Small Business Finance Corp. is self-confident saying  that "if we inherently were batting fiercely with the private  institutions, including working fund loans, agency loans would  not increase. However, since agency loans actually are  surpassing direct loans, can it not be said that right now is  the period when supplementary functions are operating most  skillfully?"    On the other hand, the People's Finance Corp. has less than  100 employees (commerce and service less than 50) and targets  petty businesses with capital less than 10 million yen. In so  far as this field is "difficult for private financial  institutions to handle aggressively considering the risk,"  (People's Finance Corp.) the Finance Corp. recognizes that  "intense competition with the private institutions is  impossible." Actually, the criticism from private financial  institutions about the People's Finance Corp. is not as strong  as that for the Japan Development Bank or the Small Business  Finance Corp.  <H5>  New Kindling </H5>   However, it is an undeniable fact that "historically in low  interest rate situations, the need for long-term, fixed rate  funds on the corporate side increases." (Small Business Finance  Corp.) On 21 September, the official rate dropped to an  historical low of 1.75 percent, but "it has been fully  considered that loan applications to government affiliated  financial institutions will rapidly increase in terms of a  refuge if the feeling of an end to the lowering of the official  rate has appeared with this." (long-term credit bank)    In addition, emergency economic measures have been  established and while some of the loan limits for government  affiliates have been further expanded, it can be said that the  possibility is great for the government affiliate share to  expand in a situation where the corporate desire for plant and  equipment investment recovers.    Furthermore, there also are cases where the expansion and  diversification of system financing has become new kindling. For  example, in order to expand "import system provision financing"  and "financing to promote investment in Japan," which have the  expansion of imports and promotion of foreign capital corporate  investment in Japan as objectives, the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry incorporated a loan amount of 65 billion yen  in its rough estimate request. These financing systems have been  implemented by the Japan Development Bank and the  Hokkaido-Tohoku Development Corporation under this, but with  regard to the import system provision financing, special  interest rates less than the long-term prime rate of 4.3 percent  have been applied.    With regard to project financing and infrastructure  improvement related financing, since adequate accommodation  cannot be made just by private financial institutions in the  aspects of risk and profitability, the significance of the  existence of the Japan Development Bank there is fully perceived  by the private side also. However, if it is financing with  foreign capital corporations as the objective, "it is a field  that can be fully accommodated by private financial  institutions." (long-term credit bank) The concern that "the  private institutions are being crowded out in demand for funds"  bears a touch of reality.    However, the Japan Development Bank considers the same  system  to be "based on national policy and we would like to deal with  it aggressively." They have no comment about crowding out.    A person in charge of business at a government affiliated  financial institution who criticizes the view that public  enterprise suppressing private enterprise on loans, shut the  door on it so to speak, saying "with regard to government  affiliated loans, it is a problem clearly of a different  dimension than the postal savings problem in the aspect of fund  procurement."    However, regarding fields which have inherently been  accommodated by private institutions, government affiliated  financial institutions have been aggressive in lending based on  expansion of the lending limit and system financing and as a  result, money transferred from the general account (subsidies)  are increasing and concern that it will invite an addition to  the public burden in the future probably cannot be denied. The  basis for a review and debate of public enterprise functions  lies here.</p>

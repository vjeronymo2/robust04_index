			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S CORNER  </P> <P> Such a fuss about the flag. After the Supreme Court ruled that burning it  during a political protest was legally protected free speech, George Bush came  on television to announce that he supports a constitutional amendment that  would override the decision.  </P> <P> In typical Bushian syntax, the President declared that "I just feel very, very  strongly about it, and perhaps I haven't been quite as emotional as I feel  about it. But I want to take this opportunity to say protest should not extend  to desecration of the unique symbol of America, and that is our flag."  </P> <P> What -- we're the only country with a flag now? Well, we know what he was  trying to say.  </P> <P> Many people did find the Supreme Court decision galling and absurd, though with  Bush attacking it, it begins to take on a certain appeal. At the press  conference, meanwhile, it was Brit Hume of ABC News who asked the smuggest and  most sarcastic flag question:  </P> <P> "Mr. President, in light of your renewed concern about the display of proper  reverence for the flag, I wonder if you think it helps the situation, sir, for  you and other political figures of both parties to make the flag the kind of  instrument of partisan politics that it was in your campaign last fall, with a  visit to Flag City and the tour of flag factories and flags at all the  conventions and so forth?"  </P> <P> Flash! Hume walks into a political convention and is shocked, shocked, to find  flag-waving going on there! Next thing you know, those rascally politicians  will be kissing babies!  </P> <P> It's ironic that Hume should be the one to ask that question. For one thing,  his network was the only one not to carry the press conference live. CBS, CNN  and NBC did. For another, ABC is the network that has tried the hardest to  appropriate the U.S. flag as its own corporate symbol.  </P> <P> At ABC News, they plaster the flag on news promos, newscasts and documentaries.  The opening logo for the "Burning Questions" series of special reports looked,  in fact, like a smoldering flag. Maybe if Bush gets his amendment through, ABC  News will go to jail.  </P> <P> It's just a thought.  </P> <P> Other national symbols besides the flag are regularly called into the service  of commercial concerns on TV. NBC News tried to make the Statue of Liberty a  kind of second NBC peacock. The statue was featured on the opening of "NBC  Nightly News" and on news briefs during the day. This seems to have abated.  </P> <P> Then there's Sure, the deodorant whose ads feature people with their arms  raised as a way of demonstrating the efficacy of the product. The commercials  usually end with a shot of the Statue of Liberty with her arm raised.  </P> <P> This is the same revered icon that Chinese students copied for their brave and  historic protests in Beijing's Tian An Men Square. They seemed to have shown it  more reverence than we do.  </P> <P> Then there are cultural treasures. Nobody in the world but me seemed appalled  when United Airlines purchased the rights to turn George Gershwin's "Rhapsody  in Blue" into a corporate jingle. Children will henceforth think of it not as  Gershwin's masterwork but as the song of the friendly skies.  </P> <P> Madison Avenue is no respecter of songs, no respecter of symbols, no respecter  of anything. They will use Mozart to sell detergent and Vivaldi to move  weenies. And they will use a national hymn like "America the Beautiful" to sell  carpet, as Sears has done.  </P> <P> The publishers of Cole Porter's music must really need the money for them to  have sold "I've Got You Under My Skin" for use by a toilet bowl cleanser. It is  now known as "I've Got You Under My Rim." A toilet sings it.  </P> <P> Every society has its symbols and treasures. If you watch enough television,  and most people watch too much, you will see most cherished symbols misused,  maligned or mangled. The only way to stop this would probably be to ban  television, and we can't do that, now can we?  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lausanne, Switzerland, Jan 7 (AFP) -- Swiss Justice  Minister Arnold Koller accused France Friday [7 January] of  setting back the fight against terrorism by refusing to  extradite to Switzerland two Iranians suspected of murder.    Koller said he was "disappointed and angry" about the French  decision to deport to Iran two men sought in connection with the  1990 murder near Geneva of the brother of an Iranian opposition  leader.    In an interview with the Lausanne newspaper NOUVEAU  QUOTIDIEN, Koller contradicted a statement by the French  European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure that Switzerland was  informed ahead of the expulsion of the two men on December 29.    Describing Lamassoure's remarks as "completely  incomprehensible," Koller reiterated that the decision came as a  surprise to the Swiss "who received no warning at all."    Koller said at the time of the expulsion of the suspects,  Mohsen Sharif Esfahani and Ahmad Taheri Khormabadi, Swiss police  were ready to take them into custody for their alleged  involvement of the murder of Kazem Radjavi, brother of Massud  Radjavi, leader of the People's Mujahidin, an armed group  opposed to the Iranian Government.    "The European system of justice is good," he said, "But it  is  necessary for it to be applied."    France's attitude to the case was "regrettable," he added.    "It is a question of solidarity between countries in the  fight against terrorism," he said, adding the fight should not  be abandoned even if this posed a increased risk to officials  and the public.    Koller said he hoped this case would be an exception and  urged other countries not to follow the French example, saying  it would "compromise the fight against terrorism."    He pointed out that despite "Iranian threats," Switzerland  had extradited to France two Iranians suspected of involvement  in the assassination of former Iranian Prime Minister Shahpur  Bakhtiar.    Evoking national security as a reason not to prosecute  terrorists could be justified in cases where there was a  considerable threat to public safety, Koller said, but he  insisted that it was better to confront terrorists.    The office of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has  said  that France had opted "for reasons of national interest" to  expel rather than extradite the men.    The Swiss Government is to discuss the issue at a meeting  next week but Koller said "it would not help anyone" for  Switzerland to take action against the French decision.</p>

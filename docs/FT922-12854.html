			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Monaco (5): Image of refined riches - The Art Market ONE by one the dealers trooped through the art deco portals of the Sporting D'Hiver in Monte Carlo to collect their green cards and take their seats for the start of Sotheby's sale of the Schlumberger collection. 'This is a very important sale,' said Princess Laure de Beauveau Craon, head of Sotheby's in France. 'It is our first real opportunity to test the market in 1992. There are pieces here at every level - from FFr22,000 all the way to a pair of Dubois console tables at FFr8m.' Princess Laure had no real cause for concern. However depressed the art market may have been in recent years, the success of the Schlumberger sale was sealed from the start when the first lot, a Louis XVI canape, sold for FFr85,000, more than double the price in the catalogue. Even the exquisite - and very expensive  - Dubois console tables met their target of FFr8m. Sotheby's, the London-based auction house, has dominated Monaco's art market ever since its first sale in the principality, the Dede Rothschild, in 1975. It now holds about 20 sales a year in Monte Carlo and has been joined there by most of its international competitors, including Christie's, its arch-rival. Monaco owes its role as an auction centre to Mr Peter Wilson, chairman of Sotheby's in the 1960s and 1970s. France houses some of the world's most important art and furniture collections. It is also a leading centre for dealers and collectors. But the French government then, as now, imposed rigorous restrictions on the sale of works of art and on their export out of France Even today it is virtually impossible for a foreign auction house such as Sotheby's or Christie's to hold a sale in France. The French market is in the grip of the Commissaires Priseurs, an arcane band of individuals who can only acquire their auctioneers' licences from someone retiring from the industry, subject to the justice ministry's approval. Some of the commissaires have banded together into partnerships. But their ability to finance large international sales is inhibited by additional restrictions preventing outside investors from owning more than 25 per cent of their equity. At the same time, the limitations on art exports make it difficult for the international houses, such as Sotheby's and Christie's, from taking pieces out of France for sale in London, Geneva or New York. The French government is not only able to exercise the usual right of pre-emption by buying any work sold in France at the 'hammer' price (the price agreed at the auction), but is entitled to buy anything bound for a foreign auction at the usually much lower minimum reserve price. This last restriction, as Sotheby's Mr Wilson shrewdly observed, does not apply to pieces sold in Monaco, where the French government must buy at the 'hammer price'. This means that, although anything sold in the principality may be whisked back to France, at least the auctioneer does not lose out financially. Mr Wilson saw Monaco, or rather Monte Carlo, as a solution to Sotheby's 'French problem', acting as a sales centre for French collections and as a local market for buyers in Italy and France. The Monegasque government was only too happy to oblige. Art auctions were completely compatible with the image of refined riches that Prince Rainier and Princess Grace were so eager to instil in the principality. They would be fun for the residents. They would also provide a new source of custom for the local hotels as the art dealers checked in and out for the Monte Carlo sales. Monaco is now established as an important international art centre, particularly for sales of French furniture, old master paintings, art deco and art nouveau. The big auctions attract professional buyers from all over the world, as well as local residents. However, as Mr Humphrey Burton, head of Christie's in France, noted: 'A great deal of business in Monaco is conducted by telephone bids. You don't find as many buyers in Monte Carlo as in larger centres like London or New York.' Over the years Monaco has hosted a number of significant sales. Christie's started in 1985 with its FFr40m Clore sale, selling the furniture collected by Sir Charles Clore, the British retailing magnate. Sotheby's staged its Florence Gould and Claud Cartier sales there. It has also chosen Monte Carlo for some of its more off-beat auctions such as last autumn's FFr1.6m sale of the collection of Memphis furniture amassed by Mr Karl Lagerfeld, the fashion designer, who lives in the principality. In the 1980s, Monte Carlo also made a name as a centre for classic car sales. Sotheby's set a world record for cars in the principality in 1990 when it sold a 1962 Ferrari 250 for FFr59m. But the car market has been in the doldrums for the past year or so and neither Sotheby's nor Christie's plans to hold motor auctions in Monaco this year. By contrast, the core of the Monaco market - French furniture and 19th century fine art - has remained relatively resilient, despite the depressed state of the international art world. 'These are traditional areas of our business which did not attract speculators in the 1980s, so have stayed stable since the market has become more difficult,' said Princesse Laure of Sotheby's. The big cloud hovering over the Monaco market is the prospect of France being forced to reform - and relax  - its restrictions on art auctions in line with those of other European Community countries after 1992. As soon as that happens Sotheby's, Christie's and other houses will transfer some of their Monegasque auctions to Paris. However the auctioneers are convinced that there will still be a role for Monaco. 'Clearly it will make sense for us to move some of our French sales to Paris,' said Princess Laure. 'The dealers are there. Almost all our French customers have one of their homes there. But we will still operate in Monte Carlo. It is a very special place.' Mr Burton of Christie's agreed. 'We would be crazy to sacrifice everything we have built up in Monaco on the Parisian altar,' he said. 'Monte Carlo will always play a part in the international art world. After all, it's fun to do business here.'</p>

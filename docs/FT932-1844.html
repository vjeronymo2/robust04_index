			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Letter: Thorp - doubts about Japan's needs and the plant's future (1) Sir, We would like to respond to the letter of Mr Kohji Kaneko, general manager of the nuclear power department of the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan, regarding Thorp (June 18). Actions speak louder than words. MOX fuel - a combination of plutonium and uranium fuel - would be the single greatest user in Japan of Thorp plutonium. If Japanese utilities really support reprocessing, why have they not taken any concrete steps to fabricate and burn MOX fuel in their commercial reactors? When the utilities say they support Thorp, what they are wanting is a return on their investment, not the product to be supplied by Thorp. It is a travesty to mislead the people of the UK into thinking that Japanese utilities need more plutonium. The reality is that Japan's plutonium utilisation programmes are so far behind schedule that they simply cannot absorb the plutonium Thorp will produce. In contrast with other commodities, plutonium is a material capable of being made into a weapon and cannot be stockpiled without risk. Whether the Japanese desire it or not, they will have to reduce supply in order to avoid a surplus. If Japanese demand for plutonium is low, Thorp will be a disastrously uneconomic plant to operate. What Japan needs to submit, and what the UK Foreign Office and parliament must obtain, are not merely 'we fully support Thorp' statements from Japan, but concrete data on the real demand - if any - that Japan will have during this coming decade for Thorp plutonium. This is also undoubtedly a matter in which the European Commission is an interested party.

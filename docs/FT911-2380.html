			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Observer: Try again Don't whisper it too loudly, but Britain's famous Triumph motorcycyle seems to be staging a comeback. What is more, although it is hard to remember how many attempts there have been at restarting the great British motorcycle industry, the latest low-key effort seems to have a better chance of success. John Bloor, a secretive Midlands businessman who has made his fortune in construction, has just started selling the new 1,200cc four-cylinder Triumph Trophy from his purpose-built factory in Leicestershire. Costing close to Pounds 7,000 a time, the 150mph machine is aimed at snatching back a fraction of a market dominated by the Japanese. The aim is to produce 15,000 a year and, while that might not sound a lot, BMW produces only 30,000 a year. The initial word from Britain's bikers is good. Graham Sanderson, deputy editor of Motor Cycle News, said: 'It is quite astonishing, better than we dreamed.' Whereas the rebirth of America's Harley Davidson was helped by import controls and US legislation, Sanderson thinks the Triumph should be able to stand against the competition on its own. Obviously long-term reliability has to be proven, and the group has only 35 dealers. Bloor is not a motorcycle man, and his autocratic management style has led to some staff turnover. Nevertheless, it sounds the sort of place where venture capitalists should be leaving their cards.</p>

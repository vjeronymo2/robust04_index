			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Power sector setback SHARES in the regional electricity stocks (recs) and the power generators (gencos) reeled under the impact of heavy selling pressure caused by recommendations put forward by the House of Commons Select Committee which has investigated the UK energy market. Utilities specialists said the market took fright at the committee's call for tighter regulation of the electricity distribution market, but pointed out that it would be up to Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, to decide on energy policy and that his decision would not be known until the end of next month when the Energy White Paper will be published. 'It has to be stressed that these are only recommendations, not policy decisions,' said an electricity specialist. What troubled the market, the specialist said, was a reference to excessive rates of return in the electricity distribution industry. The generators were hit by the inferenceof increased price regulation on the generation of electricity. Although closing well above the day's lowest levels both sectors ended sharply lower. Midland was the worst performer in the 'recs', closing 18 off at 440p, while London dropped 17 to 422p. Southern, the sector's only Footsie 100 representative, lost 17 1/2 to 17 1/2 p. National Power retreated 10 1/2 to 293 1/2 p, on 8.5m traded, and PowerGen 14 to 296p, after 10m shares changed hands. Gains in oils Oil shares were among the market's best performers, responding to news that two US senators had proposed a bill setting a Dollars 25 a barrel floor on domestically produced crude oil and proposing a tax on oil imports. The news drove oil prices sharply higher, with Brent crude settling around the Dollars 18.50 a barrel level. Analysts pointed out that such a move would transform BP's fortunes. Shell was also seen as a big beneficiary of any such move. BP closed 8 up at 245 1/2 p and Shell 7 up at 558p. But analysts said import tariff moves would attract massive opposition from non-oil producing states in the US and could also attract a windfall profits tax. Among smaller oil stocks, rumours that a predator, possibly Clyde Petroleum, could be stalking Premier Consolidated saw the shares move up 2 more to 27 1/4 p following turnover of 16m shares, the heaviest single day's business for many months. Defence stocks busy Overnight confirmation that Saudi Arabia will, after all, buy 48 Tornado aircraft as part of the Al Yamamah-2 contract prompted a sharp rise in British Aerospace shares and well as many other engineering/ electronics stocks seen as big beneficiaries of the deal. British Aerospace shares, a strong market in recent sessionsas the market began to anticipate such a deal, raced up to close a net 18 higher at 253p, their best level since July 1992. Turnover was a hefty 18m shares, the highest single day's business since last September when the group announced a restructuring. Specialists said the euphoria generated by confirmation of the contract may well carry BAe shares further ahead but emphasised the weakness of the group's balance sheet and the danger to the dividend. 'It's long-term good news but will not make much difference in the short term,' said one analyst. Other stocks to benefit from the news included GEC, which will provide the avionics for the aircraft, and moved up 6 to a 1992/3 high of 290p. FR Group moved up 12 to 263p, Smiths Industries 11 to 365p and Meggitt 4 to 98p. Rolls-Royce edged up 1 1/2 to 126 1/2 p and Lucas jumped 6 to 149p. Burton rights Market rumours were confirmed for a second time this week as stores group Burton followed in Asda's footsteps in making a big cash call. Burton's 1-for-4 rights issue will raise Pounds 163m and, like Asda, will be largely invested in store refurbishment. Although the timing took the market by surprise, analysts were supportive with even bears of the stock advising clients to take up the rights on the back of the group's recovery potential. The shares fell 2 1/2 to 72 1/2 p in turnover of 23m. Other money-raising exercise stories abounded. Allied Lyons was once again target for gossip that it would launch a 1-for-5 cash call at 525p early next week. Allied again strongly denied the story. Talk that Argyll Group is considering a convertible bond issue was heard, with the food retailer said to be looking to raise in excess of Pounds 100m. Rights issue hints were later heard around Unigate, off 7 at 314p, and United Biscuits, a penny adrift at 366p. An old and similar rumour hurt Rank Organisation, with weak figures from Rank Xerox and a large seller in the market adding to the negative sentiment. Despite later reports that the sale of some of its London hotels was imminent, the shares fell 29 to 688p. A profit forecast downgrade by one house in Tesco was said to have helped the shares tumble 8 to 259p. A placing of 2.5m shares at 126p in MFI Furniture, said to be done by Smith New Court, pinned the shares back 2 to 126p. News and information company Reuters rose 20 to 1,394p. It was buoyed by US buying, dollar strength and this week's announcement of a service to rival the stock exchange's screen-based system. Pharmaceuticals giant Glaxo rose 8 to 694p as a result of bear closing, buying to meet the selling commitments made during the account. With US investors increasingly realising that Hanson shares provided a better yield than cash as well as exposure to cyclical recovery, the stock improved 4 1/2 to 250 1/2 p. British Steel received support from one US house which upgraded its rating to a strong buy. Steel shares were up in the US and closed 2 higher in London at 73 1/2 p. Medeva picked up 4 at 219p as Nikko Europe moved to a hold from a buy. Selected Irish companies attracted interest on the belief that the country would leave the ERM at the weekend. Paper and cardboard group Jefferson Smurfit rose 10 to 275p and building materials group CRH was bought up to 226p before closing unchanged at 224p. the ERM.

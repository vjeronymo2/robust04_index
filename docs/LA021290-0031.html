			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOOD ETHICS MAKES GOOD POLITICS  </P> <P> There may not be any second acts in American lives, but occasionally you do get  one in politics. Tuesday morning, for instance, the curtain will go up on a new  installment in a drama called the City of Los Angeles Ethics Act. That's when  the City Council will reconsider its sorry vote of a few weeks ago to strip the  proposal of its public- financing provisions and gut much of what remained.  </P> <P> The conflict in this dramatic episode is between the public interest -- in the  form of enforceable new ethics laws, affordable public financing of campaigns  and reasonable pay for city officials -- and the council majority's  self-interest, which reflexively resists reform. In the first act, to put the  matter bluntly, self-interest triumphed. Now, the best way to restore the  public's battered confidence in the basic integrity of its local government is  to have the council itself set Los Angeles' ethical house in order.  </P> <P> The council will have a chance on Tuesday to reconsider measures that will do  just that: The first two -- the proposals for clear new conflict-of-interest  and disclosure statutes enforced by an independent ethics commission, and for  partial public financing of campaigns -- originated with a committee of  distinguished private citizens appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley. The third -- the  proposal to increase council members' pay from $61,522 to $80,000 by linking it  to the salaries of municipal judges -- originated with the lawmakers  themselves. In the original form, all three are meritorious. How the council  now chooses to combine these proposals in the charter amendments that must be  placed before the voters should not be decisive for anyone with a serious  interest in equitable, effective city government.  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles needs clear, commonsensical ethics, financial  disclosure and conflict-of-interest laws, and an independent body to enforce  them, as the citizens' commission originally proposed them. It needs what  cities like New York and Seattle already have: affordable public campaign  finance, which will reduce the pressure on elected officials to accommodate  themselves to special interests. It needs to pay its public officials a salary  at least roughly commensurate with their arduous responsibilities. It needs to  secure these things not only for its own sake but also because cities  throughout California are looking to the state's largest city for leadership on  these issues.  </P> <P> None of these steps will create a political Eden from which the serpent of  corruption is forever banished. There is, after all, no perfection this side of  the grave. But enactment of the commission's initial proposals on ethics and  public finance, along with equitable pay for public officials, will go a long  way toward reassuring reasonable people that their city government is honestly  doing the best it can.  </P></p>

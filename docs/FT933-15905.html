			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Mini-budget a mega-event for Hungary: Parliament votes today on a package vital to government finances HUNGARY'S conservative government is set to force through parliament today an emergency budget as unpopular as it is essential to bring wayward government finances into line. The vote is a crucial test of the parliamentary majority commanded by Mr Jozsef Antall, prime minister, in the wake of recent defections from his Hungarian Democratic Forum. Extreme nationalists led by Mr Istvan Csurka have broken away to form the far-right Hungarian Justice party, and restlessness among the Forum's two coalition allies has even led to speculation that the government could - like the Polish government - fall over the fiscal measures. But none of the three conservative coalition parties is ready to fight an election and the controversial proposal to increase VAT on food and other staples from 6 to 10 per cent is now expected to pass today's vote, giving the government a breathing space until autumn and possibly until elections slated for next May. The budget package aims to bring down the public sector deficit from last year's 7.3 per cent of gross domestic product to 6.8 per cent this year and 5.6 in 1994. But slippage is likely. Past budget forecasts have been notoriously over-optimistic, while social security has recently come under partial control of the ex-Communist unions who want pensions to catch up with inflation. Officials expect, however, that package will be approved and make possible a new accord with the International Monetary Fund, which suspended credits when Hungary's budget deficit careered through agreed parameters in mid-1992. Agreement with the IMF would allow Hungary to take up Dollars 700m in IMF facilities over 18 months and clear the way for World Bank credits to help restructure the most indebted companies and recapitalise the largest commercial banks after massive loan losses. With so much riding on the mini-budget, Mr Ivan Szabo, finance minister, says: 'If parliament rejects this, we might as well put up the shutters.' While the package may satisfy the IMF, it will not by itself right Hungary's public finances. Underlying the budget deficit is a 19 per cent decline in GDP between 1989 and 1992, and further stabilisation of government finances must await economic recovery. But Hungary's recession is in some respects only now impacting on the budget. Falling profits at the state utilities have induced the government to opt for a form of privatisation which lowers expectations of direct sales proceeds. The devastating impact of last year's bankruptcy laws on the capital strength of financial institutions is also only now becoming clear. Tax revenue from them was formerly a budget mainstay but this year the government plans to inject about Ft100bn (Pounds 720m) into the troubled banks in special bonds and in future the budget will have to service the debt. Most of all, however, the budget outlook depends on the timing of recovery. The government earlier predicted a rebound of 0-3 per cent. But the finance ministry now expects a decline of the same order. The main reason is recession in Germany and Austria, Hungary's two main trading partners. First quarter exports to developed countries dropped 30.5 per cent compared with 1992 and domestic demand cannot compensate. Mr Almos Kovacs, deputy state secretary at the Finance Ministry, says bluntly: 'For Hungary, growth without exports is impossible.' This leaves Hungary and its budget drafters, like everyone else in Europe, waiting for the Bundesbank.</p>

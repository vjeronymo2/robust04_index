			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fundamental revision of water charging is required Sir, Professor John Kay (Personal View: 'Clever trick but the cracks remain', August 16) pointed out that a large part of the water industry's present investment programme comprises environmental capital expenditure. Householders are not simply paying for water and sewerage services, as they are for gas and electricity supplies. They are also paying for purer water and cleaner rivers and beaches. In this respect water charging is fundamentally different from gas and electricity pricing. It is the principal reason why there are 'inflation plus' price limits for the water companies, as against 'inflation minus' for British Gas and the regional electricity companies. It is also the main reason for much larger inter-regional disparities in water charges than in the charges of other utilities. Water charges have to cover two separate sets of capital expenditure - to meet a growing demand and improve security of supply, and to produce environmental benefits. The former is the normal activity of a utility, similar to that of the gas and electricity industries. Environmental benefits, however, are 'public goods' (available to all, whether or not they have paid for them). Ideally, public goods should be tax-financed. But water charges contain a large compulsory element, because water is a natural monopoly with no real substitute and is also a necessity. If the environmental component of water charges is treated as a de facto tax it performs poorly in terms of accepted tax principles. There are arbitrary geographical disparities. Because most domestic water charges still depend on the former rateable values, their incidence is regressive. Rate rebates mitigated the regressiveness of domestic rates. There is no similar scheme for water charges. When rates were the local tax, the rate support grant system included an equalisation element to produce equal rate poundages for equal expenditure, in relation to need, across all authorities. The costs and finances of purer water and cleaner rivers and beaches should also be equalised nationally. Present arrangements produce pooling within each water company's territory. Different geographical and historical factors account for large arbitrary differences in individual water companies' environmental expenditure and water charges which are not compatible with principles of equitable taxation. Amendments to the 1989 legislation would be needed if water charges were to be split into two parts. The 'tax' component of water charges should be based on national equalisation of environmental costs and finances. It should also be related more closely to the ability to pay, via a rebate scheme. The charges for water utility services, on the other hand, could continue to be determined by Ofwat within the existing regulatory framework. Alan Holmans, Stephanie Holmans, London SE3 9BL</p>

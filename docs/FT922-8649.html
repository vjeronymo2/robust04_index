			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / EC splits over Brussels plan to boost revenue THE European Commission's plan to increase Community revenue by 35 per cent by 1997 opened a gulf between north and south yesterday, when foreign ministers of the Twelve began detailed negotiations on the so-called Delors II package. While these negotiations are still at an early stage, and a certain amount of posturing has to be discounted, the depth of disagreement could affect ratification of the Maastricht treaty, and complicate discussion of EC enlargement. The north of the Community, with Britain in the vanguard, strongly opposed the ambition of Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, to double structural spending on the four least prosperous member states - Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece. Ministers and officials from these states accused their richer partners of reneging on a deal which made the Maastricht treaty possible. The Delors proposals call for an increase in the EC budget from Ecu66.6bn (Pounds 46.62bn) this year to Ecu87.5bn in 1997, at 1992 prices. Half the increase would go to the south and periphery for regional aid and 'cohesion', to help them modernise their economies in preparation for monetary union later this decade. The rest is to finance farm reform, the EC's growing foreign policy commitments, and a sharpened research effort to strengthen industrial competition. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said an increase of more than 5 per cent a year in the EC budget was not justified. He complained that the Commission had put the 'cohesion fund' agreed at Maastricht into next year's budget, when the new treaty foresaw its introduction before the end of 1993. He added that the far bigger 'structural funds' - Ecu18.6bn this year and due to rise to Ecu29.3bn in 1997 under Commission plans - should not be increased. A rise of this size would give the southerners more than 90 per cent of their aid increase which 'is not an assumption justified by Maastricht', he insisted, in the UK's most uncompromising response to Delors II so far. The Netherlands asked for the EC Court of Auditors to report on use of the existing structural funds before any decision was taken. Germany, the EC's biggest net contributor, backed Britain on aid for the south, but signalled once more it would seek renegotiation of the rebate on UK contributions secured by former prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1984. A UK Treasury official said: 'We are not prepared to see any changes.' The rebate was worth Ecu3.3bn last year. Mr Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, Spain's foreign minister, said that while 'in Maastricht figures weren't discussed, aiming at minimalist figures (for cohesion) would be pure sarcasm'. He said it was 'not more documents, but more decisions' that were needed. 'We work on the basis of confidence, under which pacts are respected, therefore Maastricht has to be fulfilled.' Spain demanded a commitment to raise fiscal transfers to the south significantly as the price of agreeing Maastricht. Mr Fernandez Ordonez warned yesterday that the discussion on enlargement due to begin at the Lisbon summit in June would be held up until adequate future financing of the EC was agreed, a prospect now unlikely before the Edinburgh summit in December. Irish officials called yesterday for a push to get at least agreement in principle on Delors II at Lisbon. 'What is needed is a political decision, and for us the political decision was taken at Maastricht,' one official said. France, the other net contributor to the budget apart from Germany and the UK, is staying non-committal on Delors II until it sees how farm spending will affect its rich agriculture sector. The Community yesterday formally adopted rules on satellite broadcasting designed to pave the way for high-definition television in Europe, Reuter reports from Brussels. The directive, adopted without discussion by EC foreign ministers, requires all HDTV transmissions to use the European-developed HD-MAC standard. All other wide-screen broadcasts must use the D2-MAC standard, an interim step to cinema-quality HDTV. Editorial comment, Page 18 Denmark may next month block Mr Jacques Delors' renomination as Commission president, unless the latter publicly denies any intention of proposing a more powerful Community executive which would effectively eclipse the rotating EC presidency, writes David Buchan in Brussels. Denmark is upset that press reports of the Delors ideas might lead to defeat for the Maastricht treaty in Denmark's June 2 referendum. Mr Delors said yesterday he had personally made none of the suggestions attributed to him, though aides might have spoken out of turn.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / ICI profits plunge 52% in quarter IMPERIAL Chemical Industries yesterday reported a 52 per cent fall in first-quarter pre-tax profits to Pounds 198m. Turnover fell 12 per cent to Pounds 3.05bn. The chairman, Sir Denys Henderson, said: 'Our results reflect the recessionary conditions in many markets. The first half is likely to remain difficult but some modest improvement in demand is possible later in the year.' Most analysts had forecast an even worse outcome, so ICI shares rose sharply when the figures were announced. However, the price fell back later to close just 3p up at 1073p. Net profits after tax for the first quarter fell from Pounds 265m to Pounds 123m, giving earnings per share of 17.3p (38.1p). ICI Pharmaceuticals, whose strong performance during 1990 underpinned the results of the whole group, showed a surprisingly sharp fall in the first quarter of 1991. Trading profit fell from Pounds 144m to Pounds 88m and turnover was Pounds 324m, down from Pounds 367m the previous year. The company said the underlying pharmaceuticals business remained strong. The 1991 figure was hit by advance buying of drugs last year to beat price increases, and by the weaker US dollar. Turnover in paints fell from Pounds 417m to Pounds 362m, but the trading profit improved marginally - from Pounds 18m to Pounds 19m  - as the business cut costs. The quarter's only significant improvement was in fertilisers where trading profits jumped from Pounds 1m to Pounds 9m. ICI tried to sell the fertiliser business last year to Kemira of Finland but was blocked by the UK government on the advice of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Other agricultural products performed reasonably well. Trading profits in agrochemicals and seeds fell only slightly from Pounds 72m to Pounds 67m even though European sales were hit by cold weather in January and February. Worst hit by the recession were petrochemicals and plastics, which made a Pounds 6m loss, compared to a profit the previous year of Pounds 38m, on turnover of Pounds 538m (Pounds 601m). 'If there is one area where we see some concern about whether we have seen the bottom of the recession, it is petrochemicals and plastics,' said Mr Colin Short, finance director. 'There may be some way to go before we see the bottom there.' Chemical analysts say that plastics prices have fallen heavily during April. The profit margins of ICI and other international petrochemical producers are likely to be substantially worse during the second quarter of the year than during the first quarter. Even though ICI's results for the first three months were above market expectations, analysts were reluctant to upgrade their profits forecasts for the whole year. UBS Phillips and Drew is still going for Pounds 700m, BZW for Pounds 750m and Kleinwort Benson for Pounds 860m. ICI's pre-tax profits were Pounds 977m in 1990 and Pounds 1.53bn in 1989.

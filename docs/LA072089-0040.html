			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU CAN HELP!: ASSISTANCE FOR HER BEST SERVE  </P> <P> Lenore Handy of Fullerton has her eye out for another fiberglass serving tray  with Hawaiian design (flowers, leaves, ferns) that used to come in many colors  and measured about 8x14 inches. Can you come up with a source that will serve  Handy right, or will she either have to lei off giving luaus or just tray a  littler harder?  </P> <P> H. G. Wolfe of Glendale is looking for some 20-inch wooden coat hangers sold  under the Setwell label; they are the only type on which her coats hang  properly, but she can't find them. Can you help pin something on Wolfe, or will  her coats always have that hung-over look?  </P> <P> Ruth E. Jimenez of Whittier needs some aluminum-frame patio chairs that have  redwood slats instead of plastic webbing. Can you help put Jimenez's back-yard  furniture on a firm basis, or will she have to wonder whether her future as an  outdoor entertainer is already behind her?  </P> <P> Reader-to-Reader Help Line: Sally at (818) 286-9434 is looking for a galvanized  one-gallon watering can no longer available in the stores; it is 6 inches high  (not counting the handle), 8 1/2 inches long and 6 inches wide; the spout is  about 8 inches long. Please don't pour any more cold water than necessary on  Sally's already not-so-high hopes. . . . Lyla at (714) 855-1777 would like to  get hold of a Dressy Bessie doll; she claims it's great for kindergarten  children to practice buttoning and zippering. Please help add some zip to her  youngsters' education and improve their button-down minds. . . . Robert at  (818) 545-8579 wants to get his hands on an old-fashioned wooden top that is  activated by a string wound around it. Please get to the bottom of this and put  Robert on top of the world. . . . Ann at (213) 465-9685 needs an out-of-print  astrology book called "Sun Sign Revelations." It was written by a woman -- not  Linda Goodman -- with a Spanish surname. Please show Ann a small sign of  progress before she begins to see stars in front of her eyes.  </P> <P> Note: The Reader-to-Reader Help Line is only for one-time items or for products  no longer available in stores.

			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISNEY PROPOSES $1-BILLION PARK;  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT: ANAHEIM AND LONG BEACH ARE PITTED IN COMPETITION FOR $1-BILLION  PLUM. A MAJOR EXPANSION OF THE 35-YEAR-OLD ORIGINAL PARK ALSO IS IN THE WORKS.  </P> <P> Taking a look into tomorrowland, Walt Disney Co. said Friday it hopes to build  a new $1-billion theme park in Southern California in the next decade and  reinvigorate 35-year-old Disneyland with dozens of new attractions.  </P> <P> The proposed new park will pit Anaheim and Long Beach against each other in a  high-stakes game to become the Southland's premier tourist stop. But Disney  officials warned that without government assistance to solve traffic problems,  a new park would remain a fantasy.  </P> <P> The improvements at Disneyland, the nation's second most popular amusement park  after Walt Disney World in Florida, will begin immediately and be phased in  over the next 10 years. Company officials have described the costly expansion  and remodeling as the largest in the park's 35-year history.  </P> <P> "This is the '90s -- the decade we reinvent the Disney experience not just in  California, but worldwide," said Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief  executive, at a press conference Friday.  </P> <P> Eisner said the company's 10-year plan calls for the addition at the Magic  Kingdom of a slew of rides based on hit movies -- including "The Little  Mermaid," the "Indiana Jones" series, and the upcoming "Dick Tracy," giving  Disneyland a glitzier, Hollywood flavor.  </P> <P> He also detailed plans to add two new theme areas -- Mickey's Starland and  Hollywoodland, a major new area of Disneyland that will be a fantasy  re-creation of Hollywood Boulevard. The Tomorrowland section of the park also  will be completely redone.  </P> <P> Disney has been considering construction of a second amusement park in Southern  California for at least four years. Eisner said Disney wants to build the new  park in Anaheim near Disneyland or in Long Beach. But the project is contingent  on government cooperation to resolve traffic and parking problems.  </P> <P> "The problems are enormous with the infrastructure -- in terms of traffic  systems, exit roads, parking, the needed amount of land," Eisner said. "Without  the interest of citizens, the city council and the mayor (of either city), it  will never happen."  </P> <P> In an interview after the press conference, Eisner said there would have to be  some kind of governmental financial support "in things like infrastructure." He  noted that in France and Florida the company has been able to win concessions  on issues ranging from zoning to widening roads.  </P> <P> "We don't build highways," Eisner said. "Unless we have a partnership," the  project won't be built.  </P> <P> Whether Anaheim or Long Beach wins the new attraction "depends a lot on which  one wants us more," Eisner said. He estimated the cost of the new park could be  well over $1 billion and said the company hopes to begin developing it by the  end of the decade.  </P> <P> In Anaheim, a second park could be added on 40 acres already owned by the  company near Disneyland. There are another 30 undeveloped acres within  Disneyland in the so-called "backstage" areas. Eisner also said current parking  lots might be used, if alternative parking space could be found.  </P> <P> "Or we could use a combination of those areas," he said in an interview.  </P> <P> Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter enthusiastically endorsed the proposal for a second  theme park, and city officials there say they are prepared to arrange off-site  parking and transportation to a new facility if that's what it would take to  win the new park.  </P> <P> In Long Beach, meanwhile, Disney Co. officials met Thursday with city  officials, showing them drawings and slides of a nautical-theme park. Disney  now leases 55 acres -- where the Queen Mary and Spruce Goose attractions are  located -- and has an option to develop another 256 acres, now mostly under  water.  </P> <P> "It would obviously be ocean-oriented and an educational type attraction with a  nautical and water theme," said Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell. "We're excited  about the possibility, as long as the traffic and financial implications are  attractive."  </P> <P> Even so, Eisner was cautious in emphasizing that the second theme park is  desirable from the company's standpoint but far from definite.  </P> <P> "Unless we can solve the problems in California, the state as a Disney  destination is going to become less important as Florida becomes more  important," he said, referring to Disney's hugely successful 30,000-acre Walt  Disney World in Orlando.  </P> <P> In fact, almost two years ago, Disney scuttled plans to build a $611-million  theme park and shopping mall in downtown Burbank -- after 15 years and endless  discussions with city officials there -- when it determined estimated revenue  would not support the project.  </P> <P> Far more definite than a second Southland theme park are the company's plans to  spruce up and expand Disneyland.  </P> <P> In 1991, Eisner said, the Muppets will invade Disneyland with a Muppets stage  show. The park also will add a Young Indiana Jones ride, similar to one in  Florida in which the movie hero survives flipped jeeps, flash fires and rolling  boulders.  </P> <P> Two years later, in 1993, Mickey's Starland is scheduled to open, coinciding  with the corporate mascot's 65th birthday. The new theme area will feature a  birthday party show, a chance for customers to shake Mickey's hand, plus a  Muppet Movie in "Muppetvision 3-D." A "Little Mermaid" attraction based on the  hit film also will be added.  </P> <P> Tomorrowland -- with its outdated Mission to Mars ride -- will be completely  refurbished in 1994. While turnstiles will continue to click at the most  popular attractions -- Star Tours and Space Mountain -- new rides will include  two outer-space rides -- an alien encounter and Plectu's Fantastic Galactic  Review. A new, 3-D movie by film maker George Lucas, creator of the park's  Captain Eo ride, will be added, and an entire second story will be built, so  that skywalks will crisscross all of Tomorrowland.  </P> <P> An attraction based on the Dick Tracy movie will be added in 1996, giving park  patrons the chance to chase crooks through city streets in racing police  sedans.  </P> <P> Some of the most elaborate changes will happen in early 1999, with Disneyland  adding Hollywoodland -- complete with a white-lettered sign -- with four new  attractions: a Toon Town ride and Oversized Baby Buggy ride, both of which have  patrons careening through scenes from the hit movie "Who Framed Roger Rabbit."  </P> <P> Two rides planned for the new Hollywoodland are borrowed from Walt Disney  World: the Great Movie Ride, which lets customers travel through re-creations  of movie classics, and Superstar TV, in which selected patrons will be able to  appear in classic episodes of "I Love Lucy" or the Johnny Carson show.  </P> <P> Eisner, who joined Disney six years ago, declined to reveal the costs of the  additions, other than to say he hoped they would be financed by Disney's  earnings and that each attraction must meet its company-required return on  investment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DECADE OF EXPANSION  </P> <P> Walt Disney Co. plans the largest expansion of Disneyland in its 35-year  history during the 1990s.  </P> <P> 1991: Live Muppets show and daily parade to begin. Also: Young Indiana Jones  adventure ride.  </P> <P> 1993: Mickey's Starland to open for Mickey Mouse's 65th birthday. It will  include "Muppet-vision" 3-D movie and Little Mermaid undersea attraction.  </P> <P> 1994: Tomorrowland to be remodeled to include Alien Encounter ride; Plectu's  Fantastic Galactic Review, an outer space adventure show; George Lucas 3-D  film; sky walks crisscrossing the area, and scenes of Western countries in  Circle Vision 360.  </P> <P> 1996: Dick Tracy attraction, including a police car chase, to open. Patrons are  cast as extras in Dick Tracy film.  </P> <P> 1999: Hollywoodland to open -- a replica of Hollywood Boulevard in the '40s.  Also: Toon Town ride, with Roger Rabbit; Baby Herman's Runaway Buggy Ride, a  bumpy flight through hospital corridors; Superstar TV Theater, with TV stars  simulation. New theme park in Long Beach or Anaheim to break ground.  </P> <P> Source: Walt Disney Co.  </P></p>

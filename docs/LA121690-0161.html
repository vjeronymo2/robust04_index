			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUCKING FIRM P-I-E TO CLOSE, SELL OFF ASSETS  </P> <P> Ailing P-I-E International announced Saturday that it will shut down the  nationwide trucking corporation within three weeks and begin liquidating  assets.  </P> <P> U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George L. Proctor approved the plan in a brief hearing  after P-I-E's attorney said a weak economy and less-than-projected revenues  over the last five weeks made the outlook bleak.  </P> <P> "There was no light at the end of the tunnel," attorney Steve Busey said. "The  company determined there was no real prospect of a successful reorganization."  </P> <P> P-I-E has been struggling since it and parent Olympia Holding Corp. filed for  Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization two months ago, listing debts of $237  million and assets of $169 million.  </P> <P> Prior to the filing, P-I-E operated 230 terminals and employed 3,500 workers,  800 of them at the company's Jacksonville base.  </P> <P> After two months of scaling down -- with the elimination of 1,500 jobs and 69  terminals Friday -- P-I-E now employs about 2,000 people and operates about 100  terminals. Cuts were expected to continue through P-I-E's final weeks, Busey  said.  </P> <P> Proctor last month granted P-I-E the operating funds to stay in business  through Saturday, but he said the company would have to demonstrate benefits  for the company and its creditors to get any more money.  </P> <P> Under the court-approved liquidation plan, the company would continue to  operate under Chapter 11 during the two to three weeks it takes to deliver the  remaining freight in its warehouses.  </P> <P> Then a court-appointed trustee, scheduled to be named by Proctor Dec. 29, will  supervise the liquidation of the company's assets.  </P> <P> The liquidation plan comes after weeks of pressure from anxious creditors,  including Fidelcor Business Credit Corp. P-I-E owes Fidelcor $39 million.  </P></p>

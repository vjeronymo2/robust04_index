			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PETITIONS LACK ENOUGH SIGNATURES;  </P> <P> AGOURA HILLS COUNCIL RECALL EFFORT FAILS  </P> <P> An effort to recall four of the five Agoura Hills City Council members failed  Tuesday, falling short of the number of petition signatures that were required  to force a special election.  </P> <P> Robert Kasic, a developer and leader of the recall movement, said the group had  gathered only 1,934 signatures, well short of the 2,237 valid signatures that  were required. Tuesday was the deadline that concluded a four-month period in  which the petitions were circulated.  </P> <P> Targeted for recall were Mayor Darlene McBane, Mayor Pro Tem Vicky Leary and  council members Fran Pavley and Louise C. Rishoff. The group did not seek to  oust Councilmember Jack W. Koenig.  </P> <P> Recall proponents blamed the four councilwomen for Los Angeles County's closure  of Medfield Street in August. They also accused the four of favoring the Old  Agoura neighborhood over other areas of the city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Videos Shown  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Kasic and recall proponent David Chagall showed videotapes they  said demonstrated that the four councilwomen and their supporters illegally  thwarted petition-gathering efforts. The tapes show the councilwomen and  supporters approaching people and speaking to them outside supermarkets as  recall proponents tried to get them to sign the petitions, sometimes  successfully. The group will turn the tapes over to the district attorney's  office and will ask for prosecution, Kasic said.  </P> <P> Leary said Tuesday that she, Pavley, Rishoff, McBane and supporters went to the  supermarkets merely to tell their side of the story. Residents had told them  that recall proponents were trying to mislead people into believing that the  petitions were about improving traffic, not about recalling the council, Leary  said.  </P> <P> The fact that the recall movement fell short of the required number of  signatures shows that it lacked substantial support in the community, Leary  said.  </P> <P> Some who circulated the petitions were hired by the recall movement and were  paid 50 cents to $1 per signature, Kasic said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Movement Criticized  </P> <P> Leary characterized the movement as a developer-backed effort to take control  of a council that had enacted strict laws on issues such as oak tree removal  and developer fees to finance new streets.  </P> <P> "Just because I'm a developer, does that make me a criminal?" Kasic asked.  </P> <P> The recall effort was often emotional. In its final weeks, proponents charged  that council supporters assaulted them. Earlier, Rishoff filed a libel suit  against Chagall and Carole Dynda, another recall proponent.  </P> <P> Chagall, a free-lance writer, said recall proponents will field candidates in  the November city election, when the terms of Pavley, McBane and Koenig are set  to expire. Chagall said the group is unsure whether it will challenge Koenig  along with the others. John Ellis, an accountant and recall backer, is the only  announced candidate.  </P></p>

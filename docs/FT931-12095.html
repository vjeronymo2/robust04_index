			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / How to Spend It: Those burning ambitions. . . - Lucia van der Post with fireplaces which give a fresh focus to the home MOST people's images of fire centre around the ancient and traditional. All those stunning stage-sets, featured in the glossy magazines as the long, cold nights of winter draw in, nearly all centre on Dickensian images of olde-worlde fireplaces with surrounds that ape every period from Louis XV to Edwardian. Even the most technologically advanced of decorative gas coal and log fires seem to feel they need to look old-fashioned in order to appeal. Henry Harrison is an architect who wanted to offer his clients - and anyone else who was interested - a different aesthetic, a contemporary alternative. After all, a working fireplace not only offers warmth but it is a compelling focal point that adds definition to a room. His first venture into contemporary fire design produced the Platonic Fire - three separate designs called Socrates, Euclid and Plato. Each features a collection of what he calls geologs, based on geometric forms such as the sphere, the tetrahedron and the cube, all set in equally geometric chrome grates, complete with embers and gas controls. But Harrison felt that the Platonic series did not answer everybody's needs. There was a need for a fireplace design that was more acceptable to traditionalists, that looked slightly softer, but that did not simply imitate the log fire. He therefore came up with what he calls The Sands of Time series - two examples of which are photographed above. He uses black granite or slate surrounds to frame what he calls a 'mise en scene of architectural forms evoking memories of ancient cultures'. He has used classical references such as the Corinthian capital, the Doric column, plaques, relics and other bits of Greek entablature to replace the conventional logs. They are all cast in a fireproof material from moulds designed and made by Harrison and customers can choose any combination or arrangement that they like. They can also order a unique piece of sculpture if they prefer - in the same fire-proof material. Each fireplace is effectively a one - off. There is no need for a grate - the collection of architectural relics is arranged on a sand bed and would look as easily at home in a traditional surround as in one of Harrison's immaculately clean and simple ones. For the really adventurous customer Harrison has a new idea, - it just needs somebody with courage and vision to order it and the range will be on stream. It is based on using perspective in a Piranesi-like way and taking Piranesi elements such as columns, podia, eroded arches, statues and crumbling masonry and using them to create an architectural back-drop or stage-set in the fireplace. The elements can be arranged as the customer wishes and can be rearranged. Prices start at about Pounds 300 for the elements, excluding the surround. The Platonic Fire is available at about Pounds 640 plus vat, with its complementary surrounds starting at about Pounds 1,250. The Sands Of Time series costs around Pounds 1,000 (plus VAT) and that will include the supply and installation in Greater London.

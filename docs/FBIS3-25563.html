Reports reaching the Voice of  Resistance of the Black Cockerel news desk say that the acting  president will be meeting the French authorities to discuss ways  of overcoming difficulties currently facing oil exploitation in  the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  [UNITA]-controlled city of Soyo. No one knows what those ways  might be. What is known is that Soyo currently represents a  daily loss of $12 million.    To France, the paralyzation of Soyo prevents the payment of  the crude oil that had already been sold but not exploited. A  source in Paris has said that Luanda will be forced to use the  money it makes from Cabindan oil sales to pay what it owes  France, even if does so only in token symbolic installments.  That source was also doubtful about the Popular Movement for  the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party's [MPLA-PT] capacity to  repay part of its debt in the present conditions, with  everything looking set for war. That source added that the  MPLA-PT's debt is now in excess of $12 billion.    All this is happening at a time when mercenary deals appear  to be more difficult to enter into. The South African market is  disappointed, because the mercenaries who fought in Soyo in 1993  did not receive the money they had been promised in terms of the  contracts they signed, in addition to footing a very bloody  bill. Captain (Brooks), a former member of the South African  special forces, commanded the operation in Soyo in 1993 and he  saw his companions killed one by one in the Soyo jungle, now the  resting place of Commander (Piel Smit), a Rhodesian war veteran,  and Commander (Frank Taljaard), in addition to some 100  (?assorted) mercenaries.    So, the head of the Futungo de Belas Palace is faced with  these problems as he travels to France, a country that has  already made its position clear: It wants to assist the  mediators and help the economy become viable in a climate of  peace. This position was made public by the Paris Club last  weekend and, according to an African diplomat, it did not go  down well with the Futungo de Belas leadership. That diplomat  explained that Luanda wants to buy more war materiel and it has  not excluded the possibility of securing the services of some  French mercenaries, if it can get permission from the government  led by Francois Mitterrand. For all intents and purposes, this  is already the first defeat the Luanda warlord has suffered in  his visit to France. [passage omitted]    Paris wants war to stop in Angola, so it has made it public  that it will put pressure on Eduardo dos Santos to adopt more  flexible stands in Lusaka. In short, Angola's acting president  will not be received with the honors usually bestowed on a head  of state. In terms of the French Constitution, no election  candidate can be received as head of state. That is precisely  the situation of the man from the Futungo de Belas Palace. His  high-level contacts are to be few and far between. [passage  omitted]    French diplomats feel that this is not a good time for  acting  President Eduardo dos Santos to visit France, a diplomatic  country that does not like the fact that the MPLA-PT has been  stepping up the war in Angola.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Italicized passages recorded] </F>   [Text] [Correspondent Moti Amir] The IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] and the Prisons Service today released the last  Palestinian prisoner according to the Gaza and Jericho  agreement. Today, 170 Palestinian prisoners were released and  sent to their homes in the territories; another 160 criminals  are being transferred from Israeli prisons to the central prison  in Gaza; while 650 prisoners belonging to Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] and the Islamic Jihad were not released  because they refused to sign a statement declaring that they  will not resort to violence against the Gaza and Jericho  agreement and will remain within the boundaries of the autonomy  in Gaza and Jericho.    Brigadier General Yom-Tov Sami', head of the joint security  committee, said today: We have thus fulfilled our commitment  under the Cairo agreement, as all those who refused to sign the  declaration today are on the list of those who were to be  released.    [Sami'] Therefore, in general, if we add up all the  figures I mentioned, we arrive at more than 4,900 prisoners who  were released or listed as slated for release. Hence, the  security committee declares unequivocally, with the agreement of  the two parties, that Israel has thus fulfilled the Cairo  agreement, which stipulated the release of some 5,000  prisoners.    [Amir] Incidentally, the fate of more than 900 prisoners who  were not released because of their refusal to sign the  declaration will be discussed in the next round of negotiations  on the release of prisoners. Gen. Sami' made it clear today  that several categories of released prisoners have been agreed  on with the Palestinians. Only a small group of prisoners who  had been given short terms were allowed to return to their homes.    [Sami'] Prisoners belonging to one of the categories  on which the two parties agreed, based on the signed agreement,  will be returned to the area of the autonomy; that is, Gaza  residents will be sent to the Gaza Strip, and residents of  Judaea and Samaria will be sent to Jericho. This agreement  remains valid. We renewed the validity of this agreement last  Monday and once again today, just to be sure. None of the  parties questions this agreement.    [Amir] Samir al-Siqsiq, alias Abu-Hamis, the Palestinian  representative at the joint security committee, says that Israel  did everything it could to implement the agreement on the  prisoner release:    [Al-Siqsiq, in English] Had these 650 people from the  Islamic groups signed, they would have been released today. We  had all the arrangements ready for them. I think, in all  fairness, the Israeli side has tried to see that the agreement  be fulfilled.    [Amir] No released prisoners will be brought to Jericho  today  because none of the candidates to go there signed the  declaration, which is a prerequisite for their release.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Helicopter contract delayed A Dollars 2bn helicopter contract, for which the Franco-German Eurocopter consortium was a leading bidder, has been put off for a month following Turkey's row with Germany over military aid. The Turkish defence procurement agency decided over the weekend to put off the deal already tendered seven times. The contract was originally to co-produce 200 multi-purpose helicopters. However it was re-tendered in March to allow Turkey to consider the cost of immediate delivery, amid signs of worsening security in Turkey's Kurdish region. The latest delay follows last week's row with Bonn over Turkey's treatment of Kurds. Bonn suspended all aid shipments after allegations that Turkey used German supplied armoured personnel carriers against Kurdish demonstrators. Turkey's fleet comprises 160 helicopters, including six Sikorsky-made Black Hawks - the favourite to win the new contract. The government has long said it needs a new generation of rapid deployment helicopter to counter Kurdish insurgents in the mountainous terrain along Turkey's border with Iraq. The urgency was underlined this weekend when Belarus was invited to display its MI-24 HIND-D combat helicopter.</p>

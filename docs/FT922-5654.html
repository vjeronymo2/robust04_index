			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: European Parliament to raise Ecu1bn THE EUROPEAN Parliament hopes to raise Ecu1bn from the international capital markets to pay for its new Parliament Chamber, offices and secretariat in Brussels. The funds will be used to pay for three separate buildings which are already under construction: the Parliament Chamber building, due to be completed by the end of this year, and the Parliament offices and secretariat, due to be completed within two years. The form of the funding has not been decided yet, according to Richard Haycocks of Ernst &amp; Young, financial adviser to the European Parliament and to Societe Espace Leopold, the promoters of the building project. 'We are looking for an innovative structure at the lowest possible cost to the borrower' said Mr Haycocks, adding that the borrowing could take the form of a syndicated loan or international bond issue. In the case of a bond issue, a special purpose vehicle would be set up to own the buildings and act as the official borrower. The borrower would have a Triple-A rating. About 25 international banks have been invited to tender for the role of lead manager before Monday's deadline. The signing of the lease with the European Parliament in January was regarded in Brussels as an important victory for the city in the continuing war of attrition with France over where to hold the monthly sessions of the European Parliament. Espace Leopold contains a 1,000-seat 'hemicycle' which would be suitable for the full debates of the 518-strong Parliament, even taking into account possible expansion of the Community. The formal one-week sessions are currently held in Strasbourg, although for the rest of the month the Euro-MPs attend committee meetings and conduct all their business from Brussels.</p>

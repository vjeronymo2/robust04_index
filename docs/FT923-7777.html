			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Markets: Harold has a message for John - London Markets FIRST thing on Friday, the FT reported that the dividend yield on the FT-Actuaries All-Share index had closed the previous day at over 5 1/4 per cent. A few hours later, the government announced that retail prices had risen at just under 3 3/4 per cent in the 12 months to July. Taken separately, these two figures are unremarkable. The surprise lies in their juxtaposition. Subtracted one from another - to show the real, or inflation-adjusted, yield on equities - they reflect something that has happened in only a few months during the past quarter-century. On the basis of those numbers, UK equities this week are providing a real yield of over 1 1/2 per cent. As the chart shows, that level was achieved for a couple of months in the summer of 1986, and for a couple of years in the mid-1960s. Otherwise, real yields on equities have stayed well below that; indeed, for most of recent experience, they have been negative. By itself, that might be a mere curiosity. But periods of positive real yields appear to have usually been followed, in the past quarter-century at least, by a sharp rise in the stock market, pushing yields down in both nominal and real terms. So, does the current level of yields reflect one of those extraordinary buying opportunities that come along once a decade or so? You would not have thought so, to judge from the mood of the market for most of the week. As day followed day, each bringing a lower closing figure for the FT-SE 100 index, the gloom mounted. On both Tuesday and Wednesday, the FT-SE dipped at times below 2,300. Though it clambered back above that level on each occasion, Wednesday's closing figure of 2,303.1 marked the seventh successive day of decline, the longest unbroken fall since calculation of the the index began in 1984. The mood of the market was not the only reason for mistrusting the buying signal that the level of real yields might be thought to be providing. If you look at the chart, which stretches back to the early days of the All-Share index, there is one sustained period during which yields are consistently positive - from 1965 to the spring of 1968. The turn came in November 1967, when real yields peaked at 2 1/4 per cent. To anyone over the age of 40, those dates are indelibly engraved on the memory: they represent the Wilson government's years on the cross, the gruelling and ultimately unsuccessful struggle to cope with an overvalued currency. In November 1967, Harold Wilson gave in, and the pound was devalued. That very month, real yields started to fall. Then, as now, sterling was trapped in a fixed-exchange-rate system. Then, as now, the pound appeared over-valued against some currencies; and interest rates had to be kept up to defend it. If the analogy is a relevant one, then one risk is that this time high real yields may last until John Major follows Harold Wilson's example. There are a couple of important differences between the mid-1960s and now, however, and the events of this week illustrate them nicely. One is that some, at least, of big British manufacturing companies are coping better with this recession than with the slowdowns of previous decades. On Thursday, for example, the engineering group Glynwed reported half-year profits up 48 per cent, even though turnover was lower. If British manufacturers are better able to cope with high interest rates and a possibly overvalued pound than they were 25 years ago, dividend yields may not need to be quite so high as they were then. A second, perhaps more substantial, difference is that the ERM, unlike Bretton Woods, ties the UK to the D-Mark rather than to the dollar. British interest rates are now set by the Bundesbank, which keeps its attention focused single-mindedly on German inflation. When German inflation is unacceptably high, so are sterling interest rates. Lower German inflation would permit lower German - and British - interest rates, and allow ERM currencies to weaken against the dollar. They would offer John Major's contemporaries the sort of escape from high real yields that Harold Wilson's could only find in a formal devaluation. The really significant news on on Friday, therefore, was not the mildly encouraging inflation figures from the UK, but some much more surprising numbers from Germany. West German wholesale prices dropped sharply in July, the government reported, to a level 0.9 per cent below those of a year earlier, the first such decline for two years. The figures were accompanied by televised comments by Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank. He said he and his colleagues would re-examine German interest rate levels in a couple of months, a comment which the markets interpreted as ruling out a further rise in rates for the time being. Once markets had digested all this, they rallied across Europe. In the UK, gilts closed up a point, and the FT-SE finished at 2356.8, up 38.8 on the day and 6.7 on the week. Interest-rate sensitive stocks, such as retailers, were big gainers. A couple of other influences lay behind London's recovery of spirits. By Friday, it had become clear that big building societies were not going to follow the Skipton society's example and push up their mortgage lending rates, so fears of a further downward spiral in the housing market had abated. And on Thursday, industrial output numbers had been mildly encouraging, reflecting a rise of 0.4 per cent in both the first and second quarters. The pound was weaker still on Friday, closing at DM2.8150, probably the lowest since sterling entered the ERM. It was an ominous reminder of Harold Wilson's years of travail.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Aer Lingus faces state aid probe THE European Commission yesterday started a state aid inquiry into the Irish government's planned IPounds 175m (Pounds 166m) cash injection into Aer Lingus, Ireland's flag airline. The decision to query the package marks a hardening line in Brussels against attempts by member states to bail out their financially troubled carriers, and to chip away at the air transport deregulation legislation agreed last year. Mr Abel Matutes, EC transport commissioner, signalled last month that he was not satisfied with the cost-cutting measures Aer Lingus was taking as part of the three-year restructuring plan the state aid is linked to. The Commission is seeking 'more information in four main areas: The airline's plans for its ground-handling monopoly; Brussels is separately investigating refuelling and baggage-handling monopolies at airports across Europe. The extent to which Aer Lingus' obligation to stop over at Shannon airport on transatlantic flights is a cost impeding a return to viability. The competition implications of the state aid on the Dublin-London route. A commitment from Ireland that this will be the last state aid to the airline. Aer Lingus and Dublin have a month to reply to these queries before Brussels decides either to approve the aid or take the enquiry a stage further. During that period it may also start examining other aviation state aid cases involving plans to put more cash into Air France, Olympic Airways of Greece, and TAP, Portugal's flag carrier.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Threat that arises from complexity of new electricity meters Sir, David Lascelles' article on future electricity metering (Technology: 'Counting the cost', March 18) perpetuates the popular misconception that new electricity meters bring benefits to the end customer. That this is not so has already been demonstrated in the new 100kW market where, despite the installation of sophisticated electronic meters and communication channels, tariffs have been simplified. The mass of data generated by the new meters is ignored when charging the customer and is only required to calculate what the supplier should pay the generator. To replace existing reliable meters with high technology complex devices, purely to satisfy the accounting systems of the wholesale market, cannot be the way forward for the smaller industrial and domestic customer. The additional cost will in fact kill the competitive market and effectively maintain the present monopoly situation cloaked in pseudo competition. Who would benefit from this? Possibly those arguing for the complex solution. The proposals being suggested are equivalent to Kelloggs charging Sainsburys, not on the number of cases of cereal supplied to the warehouse, but on a count of the number of cornflakes consumed at the breakfast table.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Finnish News Service report: "Authorities Warn of Estonian </F> Swine Fever"]    [Text] Swine fever has been found on a farm in southern  Estonia. [Finnish] veterinary authorities consider the disease  also a threat for Finland. Swine fever is considered as one of  the most serious animal diseases. If swine fever were to spread  in Finland, it would mean an immediate halt in the export of  hogs and pork to countries of the European Union, the United  States, and Japan. Preventive measures against the disease and  destruction of infected animals would be of huge cost to the  pork industry. Swine fever is spread by infected animals from  which food has been made and by food remnants containing pork.  Authorities are reminding that meat and meat products may not be  brought from Estonia because of the danger of spreading the  disease to Finland. Travelers are limited to bringing a maximum  of 15 kilograms of canned meat for their own use.</p>

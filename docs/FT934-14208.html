			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / US Money and Credit: Doubts over strength of bull run JUST HOW low can US bond yields go? That question may be asked a lot on Wall Street over the coming week as the market dwells on a bull run which last Friday took the yield on longer dated issues down to levels not seen for a quarter century. For amid the euphoria, there are straws in the wind indicating that some corporate Treasurers and top money managers think long rates may be getting close to the bottom of the cycle. Last week's rally was pushed along by good inflation figures and weak retail sales statistics for September. The producer price index, unveiled on Thursday, rose 0.2 per cent during the month, while the consumer price index was unchanged. The consumer data, released on Friday, set off a flood of buying orders which pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond down to 5.78 by the close, compared with 5.85 per cent on Thursday and 5.92 per cent at the end of the previous week. The 10-year Treasury note ended the week at 5.16 per cent, its lowest since 1967. For now, the main forces working on the market seem to be benign. Inflation is subdued, with consumer prices rising at an annual rate of 2.5 per cent so far this year. Economic growth remains sluggish, with third-quarter GDP figures, due on October 8, expected to show a rise of around 3 per cent, with some further acceleration possible in the fourth quarter. The dollar appears to be on a gently firming trend and the political backdrop seems favourable. Mr Mitchell Held, of Smith Barney Shearson, says market psychology should be helped over the next few months by further budget deficit cutting initiatives, including the Senate's consideration of a balanced-budget amendment to the constitution. There is no apparent need for the Federal Reserve to change its policy stance - a perception which has stalled short-term interest rates while the long end has come sharply down, producing a much flatter yield curve, albeit one still on the steep side compared to past trends. The spread between the two-year note and the 30-year bond stands at around 200 basis points. The result is a broad consensus that the yield on the long bond has further to fall - possibly to around 5.5 per cent - and that the market may then oscillate for a considerable time within a band of between 5.5 per cent and 6 per cent before the interest rate cycle turns upwards. However, this picture could be upset by unpleasant inflation surprises. Analysts are already warning, for example, that October's figures are likely to be bad, in part because of the introduction of a new tax on gasoline. While mutual fund money pours into the market, other leading fund managers seem to be slowly trimming their portfolios, in the belief that it is better to narrowly miss the bottom than suffer when rates rise once more. Some analysts argue that a more sluggish performance over the past few weeks in interest-rate sensitive equity sectors - such as utilities and banking stocks - could be a sign of a bond bull market which is losing momentum.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / In search of a unifying threat: Nato has been unable to resolve its identity crisis, brought on by the collapse of the Soviet Union Nato is in trouble. It is divided over Bosnia, but that is not the reason. If there had not been Bosnia, there would have been something else. Nato is in trouble because it no longer knows what it is for. The west cannot say it was not warned. Back in 1987 it was told by Mr Georgy Arbatov, the Soviet Union's top Americanologist, 'we have a 'secret weapon' that will work almost regardless of the American response - we would deprive America of The Enemy'. The end of the Soviet Union in 1991 fulfilled that prediction well beyond its author's expectations. Technically, a defensive alliance has no need of an identified enemy, and indeed you will search the text of the North Atlantic treaty in vain for any mention of the Soviet Union. On paper, it is simply an agreement by a group of like-minded nations to come to each other's assistance if attacked, irrespective of the attacker. But no one in 1949, or for most of the ensuing 40 years, was in doubt where any attack would come from. So the disappearance of the Soviet Union and the withdrawal of Russian troops from central Europe have left western policymakers floundering to explain what the purpose of the alliance now is. Nato is no longer manning a frontline on the Elbe, which is now simply a river in the middle of one of its members. The problem was already apparent in July 1990, when Nato leaders gathered in London to state solemnly that they no longer regarded the members of the Warsaw Pact as adversaries. At the Rome summit of November 1991, Nato unveiled its 'new strategic concept', in which it assigned to itself four core security functions: 'To provide one of the indispensable foundations for a stable security environment in Europe.' 'To serve . . . as a transatlantic forum for allied consultations.' 'To deter and defend any threat of aggression against the territory of any Nato member state.' 'To preserve the strategic balance within Europe.' The lack of a clear direction was obvious. Only the third function has any concrete meaning, and that left it deliberately unclear against whom or what such deterrence and defence were now required. The other three are classic communique-speak. 'Strategic balance' is a meaningless concept unless one defines the forces that need to be balanced; while to define an alliance as a forum for allied consultations is tautological. A 'stable security environment' could mean anything or nothing. Probably it was intended to mean that Nato, by its very existence, provides a degree of security to others in Europe, and notably in central and eastern Europe, besides its own members. But that half-promise has raised expectations that Nato is so far unable to fulfil, and its attempts to fulfil them have led it into new problems. The security problems of central and eastern Europe are essentially of two types. There is the danger of ethnic conflict within or across state borders, of which Bosnia has become the archetype; and there is the fear of renewed Russian domination. (Lurking in the background is also the fear that Germany might one day revert to expansionism.) Both types of problem are acute in the former Soviet Union, where they overlap, since concern for ethnic Russians in the other republics is one of the main motives or pretexts for the reassertion of Russian influence. The ethnic problem is also acute in the western Balkans, but appears to be under control in Bulgaria. The situation of the Hungarian minorities in Romania and Slovakia is a potential source of trouble, but there seems little likelihood of that trouble taking a military form. In Poland and the Czech Republic there are no ethnic problems to speak of. And the Russian threat to central Europe, while still a vivid memory, has become fairly remote. If that threat were to become less remote, Nato is probably still capable of deterring it. There is a plausible argument that the four 'Visegrad states'  -Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia - should be admitted to Nato before the Russian threat reappears. This is unlikely to happen, however, for two reasons: it would be foolish to push the Russians gratuitously into a threatening attitude; and it would be even more foolish to draw a line that implicitly leaves some states such as Ukraine and the Baltics outside, for the Russians to do with as they please. Those reasons were eloquently explained by the Clinton administration before and during last January's Nato summit, which carefully fudged the issue by producing the so-called 'Partnership for Peace' programme, under which all east European states, including Russia, are encouraged to co-operate with Nato, with no overt discrimination between them. So European governments have been bemused in the past few weeks to find that same administration staging a confrontation with Russia, by announcing plans to speed up Nato enlargement. Although President Bill Clinton said on Monday that 'Nato will not automatically exclude any nation from joining', the Russians know that early enlargement would not include them. Mr Clinton's aim, presumably, is to distract attention from the row over Bosnia, and to provide the newly powerful Republican right with a rationale for carrying on with Nato that is likely to appeal to them. The trouble with this strategy, if such it can be called, is twofold: early enlargement would be offered only to those central European states that need it least; and any attempt to revive the Russian threat as Nato's raison d'etre, so long as the threat is not unmistakable, is more likely to divide the alliance than to unite it. West European governments can already be heard expressing caution, which will no doubt leave the Republican right even more disgusted with Nato than it already is. Of course, we should not be in that situation if Nato had shown itself able to deal with the other problem, that of ethnic conflict. But it has not. That is not a criticism of Nato as an organisation: Nato, like the UN, is a composite body which can only do what its member states will it to do. At the beginning of the Yugoslav conflict, there was a consensus that Nato had no role to play. It was, initially, an internal conflict in a non-member state. With the recognition of the successor states in early 1992, it became an international conflict, but the element of Serbian aggression was almost impossible to disentangle from the conflict among Bosnian citizens. Anyway, Nato has no mandate to defend non-members against each other. That is properly a matter for the UN, and it was only in an attempt to enforce UN resolutions that Nato did get involved in Bosnia, in support of a UN force furnished partly by Nato members. Unfortunately the mandate of the UN force was a hopeless mishmash of enforcement and peacekeeping. The peacekeeping role dictated a troop deployment that makes serious enforcement impossible, since UN soldiers are effectively hostages in the hands of the 'enemy' against which enforcement action would be taken. But that difficulty has only masked an even more awkward question: whether collective security can be made effective in this kind of conflict without deploying ground troops in a combat role. The US argument has been that Nato air power, combined with arms supplies, would redress the balance of forces against the aggressor and in favour of the victim. That may or may not be right, but in either case it falls far short of the commitment that Nato makes to the defence of its own members. The fact is that none of Nato's members, and perhaps least of all the US, feels sufficiently threatened by a Bosnia-type conflict to take the kind of risks in dealing with it that they were prepared to take during the cold war. Until they do perceive such a threat, the alliance will remain ineffective, and confidence in it will continue to ebb on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

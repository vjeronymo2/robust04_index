			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner by Julius </F> Gembicky; place and date not given: "Is There a Shadow  Intelligence Service?"]    [Text] Bratislava--Yesterday we published an interview with  Jaroslav Svechota about the suspected existence of a parallel or  shadow intelligence service, focusing on gathering information  about representatives of the government coalition. We were  proceeding from information provided by Ludovit Cernak, deputy  chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR],  to SLOVENSKY VYCHOD. Yesterday we asked Mr. Cernak for his  comment on the interview with Jaroslav Svechota.    [Cernak] I tend to stand behind what I say. That is also  why I tend to formulate my statements carefully. At that time,  I said in reply to a specific question: "You are on the right  track." Today I can only add a few words to my reply: "Explore  the matter further."    We also asked Interior Minister Pittner for his comment:    [Gembicky] Mr. Pittner, there are certain indications that  an intelligence agency engaged in the gathering of material  against representatives of the government coalition is active in  Slovakia. Can you confirm or deny this suspicion?    [Pittner] Such activity is inadmissible under the law. But,  because there exists a shadow cabinet, an adventurer could  perhaps be found to set up such an agency. However, this is a  matter to be dealt with by the Slovak Information Service [SIS]  and not by the Ministry of the Interior.    [Gembicky] The most charming thing about the whole affair is  that, according to these indications, Mr. XY, one of the leading  SIS officials, is supposed to be a collaborator in this private  agency. (We obviously gave his name to the minister, but we  cannot publish it for the time being.) It is probably not very  realistic to expect [SIS Director] Mr. Mitro's employee to  disclose himself....    [Pittner] I repeat that supervision of SIS is not within the  jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior. A special NRSR  commission has been established for its supervision, which is  chaired by Mr. Ivan Gasparovic.    [Gembicky] Would you consider it appropriate for us to turn  to him with these suspicions?    [Pittner] Certainly.    [Gembicky] So yesterday we sent a fax to NRSR Chairman Ivan  Gasparovic, who chairs the Special Supervisory Commission for  SIS, asking him to reply to the question of whether the  commission has availed itself of the information that one of the  leading SIS officials is working for a private intelligence  agency.    We will publish his reply as soon as we receive it.    We are thus taking seriously NRSR Deputy Chairman Ludovit  Cernak's recommendation: "Explore the matter further."</p>

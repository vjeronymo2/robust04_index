			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Toyota chief asked to head business group: Industry federation facing change Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, the scion of one of Japan's great industrial dynasties, has been asked to take over the Keidanren, the leading business federation and lobby group, from the end of May. Mr Toyoda, 68, chairman of Toyota, Japan's largest car maker, and currently vice chairman of the Keidanren, said yesterday he had been informally approached by Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, 79, the Keidanren's leader who is to retire. Mr Toyoda, on a business trip to Britain, will decide on his return. The change at the top of the federation comes as it is rethinking its political links as a result of the new Japanese government's campaign to weaken the so-called iron triangle of business, bureaucracy and politics that used to run Japan behind the scenes. Until recently, the front runner for the job was Mr Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, but he withdrew after a brain haemorrhage last month. His outspoken style, electronics background and position as head of a company founded after the second world war would have made a big change from the Keidanren tradition of choosing diplomatic leaders from older engineering industries. Mr Toyoda, appears on the surface to represent a continuation of the Keidanren's traditional distinguished style. But Mr Hiraiwa feels he would rejuvenate the organisation, said officials. Mr Toyoda is the son of the founder of Toyota Motor and the grandson of the man who founded Toyota Automatic Loom Works in 1926, the car group's predecessor. Known as a strong management leader, Mr Toyoda has spent almost all his professional life in the family firm, taking a break only to write a thesis on fuel injection.</p>

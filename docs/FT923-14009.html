			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / EC court refuses to block toxic waste THE European Court of Justice yesterday decided in a landmark ruling that EC member states may not refuse entry to hazardous waste under existing European law, although this allows them to block imports of general waste sent by their partners for dumping or recycling. This anomalous judgment may strengthen the argument of France, which is holding up long-delayed legislation on toxic waste transfers unless it commits member states to dealing with their own harmful waste within the near future. The Court was ruling in a case against the government of Wallonia, the French-speaking region of Belgium, which issued two general bans against waste imports in 1984 and 1987. The case was brought by the European Commission, after complaints by Dutch waste exporters. It has as its background the Belgian scandal of the Walloon village of Mellery, where imports of toxic waste to a local dumping facility had damaged the health of local people, mainly through water pollution. The Court said that a 1984 directive establishing a system for notifying toxic waste shipments, as well as EC treaty provisions on the free movement of goods, meant the Walloon executive was in the wrong. Waste constituted 'goods' in so far as it involves a commercial transaction, the judges ruled. But although Court and Commission officials were uncertain about the precise consequences of the ruling, it appeared to leave open a number of doors. The law, as it stands, still allows member states to ban specific shipments of toxic waste on health and environment grounds. For the same reasons, they can establish limits to toxic waste intake, a Court official said. It is still not clear, however, what these limits are. The Court nevertheless seems to affirm: that waste is not an ordinary 'good', and that its circulation can be banned provided the prohibition is not discriminatory; and that the Walloon executive's action is consistent with the Basle Convention on toxic waste transfers - signed by the EC in 1989. One Brussels lobbyist said that this implied support for the principle that waste should be processed as near as possible to where it is generated - and for the right of sovereign EC states to refuse entry to waste. The decision is likely to reinforce the case for self-sufficiency when the new waste regulation is debated again by the Twelve on October 20. It is also expected to raise more questions about the Community's role in protecting the environment. Spokesmen for Greenpeace yesterday accused the EC of promoting trafficking in hazardous waste, and called for fundamental reforms of the Maastricht treaty. They warned that Sweden, for instance, under current legal arrangements would be obliged to accept EC radioactive waste at its Forsmark facility. This would be from next year, well before Sweden is likely to enter the EC, because of the common market laws established under the European Economic Area set up between the Community and the European Free Trade Association of which Sweden is a member.</p>

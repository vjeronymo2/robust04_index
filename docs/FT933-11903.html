			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Latin American TV sheds parochial image - Television networks in the region have been converging WHEN Mr Ricardo Salinas Pliego, the new owner of Mexico's television networks Seven and 13 was asked how he would compete with Televisa, the country's large media company, he quickly turned to the subject of help from foreign partners, such as NBC, Telemundo, Fox, TV Globo of Brazil and Radio Caracas Television of Venezuela. A decade ago, Mr Salinas's reply might have seemed odd. Latin American television companies were parochial affairs, best known for their soap operas and lengthy coverage of presidential speeches. They bought plenty of programmes from each other, but each country's market remained distinct. However, television in the region has converged. The spur has been new technology which enables programmers to broadcast cheaply throughout the region, and the growing marketing clout of Televisa and TV Globo. It is possible to travel from Chicago to Buenos Aires and watch the same Spanish-language news; Brazilian, Mexican, or Venezuelan soap opera; or Cuban-American talk shows. However, the inter-change of programming is far from complete since programmes being beamed across borders still face both political and cultural problems. During the recent troubles in Guatemala, Televisa's Echo news programme, the main source of news, was briefly blocked by the government and its offices fired on by machine guns. Frank discussions of teenage sex and other sensitive issues by the Cuban-American talk show host Cristina, while perfectly normal in Miami, have caused some outrage in Mexico. Televisa, which has about 90 per cent market share in Mexico, is the main force behind the regionalisation of programming. It has bought stakes in leading television stations in Peru, Chile, and the US (through Univision) and half of PanAmSat, the satellite company in the Americas. In addition, it has production agreements in Argentina and Venezuela, and has formed a joint venture with TCI of the US, the world's largest cable operator, to promote cable and satellite television in the region. The alliances enable Televisa to earn about twice as much from selling its programmes as it makes from offering them in an open market, and keep potential competitors from selling programmes in its home market in Mexico. Thus, soon after Televisa bought its stake in Univision, the US network pulled a successful soap opera from Televisa's rival station in Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city. Televisa's stakes throughout the region are putting pressure on rivals to form their own alliances. Hence, Mr Ricardo Salinas's overtures to practically every Hispanic competitor of Televisa. The logic is that unless Channels Seven and 13 have access to the same variety of programming enjoyed by Televisa, they are unlikely to be able to compete effect-ively. Mr Salinas said that initially his two networks would have to buy in a lot of their programmes. He is unlikely to limit his buying to any single source, but rather seek links with several companies. Mr Joaquin Blaya, head of Telemundo, the US Spanish language network, is particularly keen to be one of those partners, in part to help his company compete against Univision, which he used to run before Televisa took its 25 per cent stake. The spread of cable and satellite television in Latin America has encouraged still more programme-swapping in the region. Although only about 3m Latin American homes are connected to cable or satellite, these are the richest consumers, most likely to buy new cars and consumer durables. As the cost of the technology falls, the market is expanding rapidly. Programmers who once would have ignored any one market as too small, can reach several with one transmission. With the Hispanic market in the US rising, companies such as Time Warner and CNN of the US have started to produce their own Spanish-language programmes. There are more than 20m Hispanics in the US, and in 10 years they are expected to be the US's largest minority. Recently, four US film studios and Multivision, Televisa's wireless cable rival in Mexico, launched a Latin American Spanish-language film channel, CineCanal while Miami-based International Television has created a cable channel specifically for Hispanic women. NBC and CNN are providing their Spanish-language news; and MTV is about to launch a pan-American Spanish-language version of its music and video programme.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev in </F> Bucharest by RIA NOVOSTI correspondent Vyacheslav Samoshkin  specially for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI; date of interview not stated:  "Pavel Grachev: Romanian Partners' Position Has Changed"]    [Text] Bucharest -- In late March Russian Federation  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev headed a Russian military  delegation in Romania on an official visit during which an  agreement was signed on cooperation between the two countries'  defense ministers. At the end of the visit he gave an exclusive  interview to your RIA NOVOSTI correspondent.    [Samoshkin] Pavel Sergeyevich, are you pleased with the  trip's results?    [Grachev] My very first talks with our Romanian partners  dispelled doubts as to the expediency of our visit. They  stressed that despite the stagnation in our relations over  several years they are ready and will seek to develop equal and  mutually advantageous relations along military channels so that  they can be as strong as at the time of the Warsaw Pact. At my  meeting with Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu this thought was  a leitmotif. At talks with prime minister Nicolae Vacaroiu and  President Ion Iliescu I was fully convinced that Romania has now  fundamentally revised its attitude toward Russia. I was frankly  told that Romania will seek cooperation with Russia on all  salients.    [Samoshkin] Romania officially sees the "partnership for  peace" program as its first step toward integration into NATO  structures. Russia has a rather different view of this program.  In that case how can they really find a common language?    [Grachev] Yes, indeed, Romania was the first to accede to  the "partnership for peace." But President Iliescu expressed an  interesting position. Yes, he said, we are for the partnership  on an equal basis with all states, including the NATO states.  In his opinion partnership for security should be implemented  by all countries, which fully accords with our approaches too.  And he also stressed the idea that, yes, we are seeking to be  integrated into NATO but simultaneously, all together, including  Russia. He sees NATO's transformation from a military-political  alliance to a political and peacekeeping one. President Iliescu  puts foremost partnership not in the military field but in the  economic field, that is first economic partnership for peace and  only then all its other aspects.    [Samoshkin] Abroad, including in Romania, the thesis of  Russia's special role in NATO and in the "partnership for peace"  has given rise to various interpretations. What do people have  in mind here?    [Grachev] All East European countries view the concept of  "partnership for peace" as an initial, transitional stage toward  integration in the NATO system. That will happen gradually, as  the military weapons we produce go out of commission, as new  military cadres are trained -- according to the NATO system --  and, of course, as the countries emerge from the economic crisis  to pay money for new weapons. Right now they are simply not  ready for this integration. And this stage will last 8-10  years. Our special role is that we will never simply be  integrated into NATO structures because our strategic missile  forces and nuclear weapons on ships in the air force mean that  we have a great army with powerful modern weapons. So that in  contrast to other neighboring countries for us the "partnership  for peace" is not a transitional stage.    [Samoshkin] Until recently Romania officially voiced  itself in favor of the withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army from  the Dniester region. How do you explain the fact that during  your visit this question was not touched on in any way by the  Romanian side?    [Grachev] I see in this a certain change in the approach  toward our bilateral cooperation. Why have our relations  declined? Because of the conflict situation in Moldova. You  remember that I was criticized here when I said that arms  deliveries were being sent from Romania to Moldova and the  Romanians accused us of supporting the Dniester region people.  On the basis of this conflict in Moldova our relations were  frankly destroyed. But now the position of our Romanian  partners has changed in that none of our interlocutors tried to  link our relations with the situation in Moldova, in particular  in the Dniester region. The implication is that they believe  this is the problem of a third country, that is Moldova....</p>

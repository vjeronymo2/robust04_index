			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / GKN calls for economic stability SIR David Lees, chairman and chief executive of industrial group GKN, yesterday urged the government to provide a more stable economic climate for business, and to make permanent the 40 per cent first-year capital allowance introduced for one year only in the Autumn Statement, John Griffiths writes. He told the Commons trade and industry committee that the UK had suffered two significant recessions in little more than a decade, unlike most competitor countries. This had made it considerably more difficult for productivity improvements to be made. Sir David said that in productivity terms, GKN's UK facilities were still bottom of the league table of its European plants, but were 'catching up quickly'. He acknowledged, however, that it would take a further three to five years before they were likely to match GKN's best continental European plants. He described as overstated a widespread view that the City and financial institutions were preoccupied with the short term. Sir David's plea for greater stability and extra support for business by extending the capital allowances on plant and machinery was supported by executives of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. It also called on the government not to allow sterling to strengthen significantly.</p>

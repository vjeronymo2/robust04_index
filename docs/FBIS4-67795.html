			<p>BFN     [Text] The minister of state for defense, Mr. Mallikarjun,  has asserted that India will not succumb to pressure from any  country to slow down its missile development program. Talking  to newsmen in Madras today, he said that Prithvi  [surface-to-surface missile] has been successfully tested and it  is for the technical experts to decide about its induction into  the armed forces.    Mr. Mallikarjun also expressed concern over the possibility  of a military imbalance in the region if Washington supplies  F-16 jets to Pakistan.</p>

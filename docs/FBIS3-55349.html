Instead, it will provide the opportunity to more  consistently  carry out the current policy and change just a few points of  emphasis, he said.    Laar said the government planned to pay special attention to  the tax reform and to putting the Tax Department to work. Laar  criticized the Finance Ministry, which in his words had delayed  reforms and in some cases ever "worked against them."    He said the Economics Ministry under the new minister was  expected to pay more attention to working out legislations.    Laar said he was sure that the ministerial changes were not  going to bring down the professionalism of the Cabinet. "The new  ministers have gained experience in politics, which will enable  them to come to better terms with the parliament," he said.    The prime minister declined to comment on whether or not the  other coalition partners -- the Moderates and the Estonian  National Independence Party -- had plans to replace any of their  ministers.</p>

These  ties were boosted during the 1993 Havana summit between PRC  President Jiang Zemin and Cuban President Fidel Castro.    During an almost two-hour interview with PRENSA LATINA, Wu  Jianmin, head of the Information Department of the Foreign  Ministry, spontaneously broached the topic of bilateral ties and  expressed his opinion of Jiang's November visit to the Caribbean  island.    "I was a member of the delegation that accompanied President  Jiang Zemin on his Latin American tour," Wu said, and stressed  that the visit to Havana and the talks between the two  presidents played a very favorable role for the development of  ties between the two nations.    "Cuba was the first Latin American country to establish  diplomatic relations with China and that is something we will  never forget," Wu said.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman added it is very important  for  Beijing to promote ties with Latin America because Latin  American countries are developing countries and relations with  them are based on equality.    My personal experience of the trip to Cuba and Brazil is  that  the talks were held within a friendly environment. The talks  were smooth and among equals, Wu added.    "That," Wu said, "is very important and it encourages mutual  relations because all barriers are eliminated through  understanding."    The head of the Information Department of the Foreign  Ministry assessed the state of economic ties between China and  the subcontinent, and recalled that the overall volume of trade  in 1993 was greater than $3.7 billion, 20 percent more than in  1992.    I see enormous potential in the development of our ties, Wu  said, and added "there is only one obstacle: a lack of knowledge  of each other's possibilities."    In Brazil, Wu said, I could tell they did not have this  information, and it is essential that we solve this problem so  we can take advantage of the opportunities and combine our  thriving economic development with the rich resources of that  nation.    The spokesman insisted there is a great outlook for  cooperation between the PRC and the South American giant, and  noted that "the same applies with Cuba, a country of 120,000  square km and 11 million inhabitants with very good natural  conditions for economic growth.    "A strong and vigorous cooperation force exists between  China  and Cuba," Wu said.    I believe the first step toward cooperation is getting to  know each other, learning about our respective situations, and  seizing the opportunity for joint development.</p>

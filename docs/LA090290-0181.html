He was killed instantly," a West Berlin police spokesman said of the accident  Friday night.  </P> <P> Hundreds of people have been hammering at the wall for months to take chunks of  it home as souvenirs.  </P> <P> It was the first known death around the Wall since East Germany's democratic  revolution in late 1989.  </P></p>

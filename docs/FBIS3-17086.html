			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On Tuesday evening in Moscow, Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin and Michel Camdessus, managing director of  the International Monetary Fund, signed a joint statement on  allocation to Russia of the second part of the systemic  transformation credit totaling $1.5 billion.    According to the document, the Russian cabinet accepts the  obligation to take into consideration the IMF recommendations on  the budget. Camdessus pledges to submit for consideration a  draft resolution on allocation of the second part of the  systemic credit to the board of directors of this international  organization.    In his interview with journalists, Russian Economics  Minister  Aleksandr Shokhin, who participated in the talks, explained that  the Russian Government obligated itself to prepare and forward a  package of legislative initiatives to the State Duma before  mid-April. The documents are aimed at revising and partially  suspending several presidential decrees and laws and government  resolutions, which lead to a growth on the expenditure part of  the budget, and at proposing concrete measures to fulfill the  revenues part.    According to Shokhin, the decision to allocate the second  part of the IMF systemic credit opens the way for Russia to  receive the so-called second rehabilitation credit of the World  Bank amounting to $600 million and grants opportunities to  restructure the foreign debt to be paid off in 1994.    Shokhin added that the draft budget prepared by the  government and forwarded to the State Duma already contains  foreign credits for 1994 totaling $2.1 billion.    Having signed this joint statement, the International  Monetary Fund in fact showed its approval of the government's  activity in the economic sphere, said Shokhin.    Chernomyrdin reported to journalists that he had discussed  the issue on the IMF credit during his meeting with Russian  President Boris Yeltsin in Sochi because, he said, it is "a very  serious issue."    For his part, Camdessus said that in the course of the  negotiations in Moscow he was convinced of the Russian  president's and government's resolution to pursue the course of  reforms.</p>

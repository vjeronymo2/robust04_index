The PDC communique pointed out "one can never choose one's  adversaries; reality determines them." This organization is  composed of liberals, social democrats, and Christian democrats.    This communique was issued in response to the decision by  the  Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly of the  People's Government to reject PDC participation in this dialogue  because its members do not number even "three dozen people" and  because, according to the committee, this group has worked for  the CIA.    The PDC called these accusations "false" and "useless" and  attributed them to sectors of the Cuban regime. The PDC "has  enough support and popularity inside and outside Cuba to play an  essential role (...) to bring about, without bloodshed, a  definitive end to the crisis facing the country." the communique  stated.</p>

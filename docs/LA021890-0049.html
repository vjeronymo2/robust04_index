			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> STATE TO AUDIT COMPTON'S SCHOOLS ON MEAL PAYMENTS  </P> <P> State officials announced that they will audit the Compton Unified School  District's program for feeding low-income children in an effort to determine if  the district used inflated figures in applying for state and federal  reimbursements for meals.  </P> <P> State and federal inspectors who visited the district in December said the  number of low-income meals reported at five schools may have been inflated as  much as 52%.  </P> <P> Their report said several children apparently were counted more than once, and  the district failed to provide proper documentation, such as welfare check  stubs, showing that several children were from low-income families.  </P> <P> As a result, the state Department of Education's audit division has been asked  by the department's Child Nutrition and Food Distribution Division to examine  the district's records starting this week.  </P> <P> Compton officials insisted, however, that they did not submit inflated numbers.  They said the inspectors misread the computer information that the district  uses to keep track of the number of children eligible to receive breakfasts and  lunches free or at reduced prices.  </P> <P> "There are some discrepancies in their findings," acting Supt. Elisa L. Sanchez  said.  </P> <P> Sanchez said the district has made remarkable progress in revamping a food  service program that was cited in the past for failing to provide wholesome  meals and keep its records in order.  </P> <P> Indeed, the report indicates that school meals in Compton meet federal and  state nutrition requirements.  </P> <P> George Nash, who runs the district's food service program, scoffed at the  report of inflated meals. "If we were doing 52% inflated, we wouldn't have any  idea where we were," he said.  </P> <P> Nash cited the district's November reimbursement check as evidence that the  district is not claiming it served meals to 30,000 low-income children. The  district was reimbursed $643,695 for serving 344,928 lunches and 115,278  breakfasts during the month, he said. That represents lunches for 18,154  children a day and breakfasts for 6,067, he said.  </P> <P> The inspectors, he said, wanted to see paper documentation, but the district  has spent the past two years transferring its information to computers. The  district's computer files show that all the children counted for meal  reimbursements are from low-income families, he said.  </P> <P> The dispute over meal counts may stem from the requirement that districts  choose 3% of the low-income families at random and demand further verification.  The additional documentation, such as welfare check stubs, must be kept on file  in the district, Nash said.  </P> <P> The district had not completed the 3% sampling when the inspectors arrived, and  the inspectors would not accept the computerized information as a substitute,  Nash said. Since then, he added, the district has completed the required  sample.  </P> <P> The dispute could cost the district thousands of dollars if it cannot persuade  the auditors, who are expected to spend four or five days in Compton, that the  computer files correctly reflect the number of children entitled to receive  meals free or at reduced prices. Last year, according to state records, the  district received $5.8 million in state and federal reimbursements for meals  served to low-income children.  </P> <P> Compton will have to return money to the government if the auditors confirm  that there are inflated meal counts, said Samuel L. Johnson, head of the audit  section of the Department of Education. The auditors, Johnson said, intend to  verify the eligibility of every child that Compton claims is deserving of a  free or reduced-price meal.  </P> <P> The report on Compton's food service program was compiled by inspectors from  the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Child Nutrition and Food  Distribution Division in the state Department of Education. The two agencies  inspect a district's food service program every three or four years.  </P> <P> "We have not had a situation like this in the last four or five years where we  have had to (follow up with) an audit," said Maria Balakshin, director of the  child nutrition division.  </P> <P> In one section of their report, the inspectors suggested that Compton's  computer files show that the district is claiming its low-income enrollment is  as high as 30,000 and that some children showed up three or four times in the  computer files. Total enrollment in the district, including district-run  preschools, is about 28,000, according to Nash and district reports filed with  the state.  </P> <P> Nash acknowledged that students' names may appear more than once in the files,  partly because families move often within the district, filling out new forms  that are entered in the computer. But at the end of every month the district  checks for duplicate welfare or Social Security numbers of students, and  deletes the duplicate entries, he said.  </P> <P> Since about 95% of the district's students qualify for these meals, district  officials decided two years ago to provide every child a meal rather than try  to sort out the few who can pay, school officials said.  </P> <P> But the meal count submitted to the state excludes meals served to children who  are not eligible for them, officials said.  </P> <P> A few other districts have the same policy, Balakshin said, although Compton is  the largest to do so.  </P> <P> School officials Sanchez and Nash said the food program improved significantly  after the district hired two companies in 1987 to handle the meals. Marriott  Corp. and National Business Services Enterprises Inc., a minority-owned  business in Washington, formed a joint company, United Food Services, to handle  the Compton contract. The company receives management fees of about $407,000,  Sanchez said.  </P> <P> The program's data, including inventory, has been put on computer, meals comply  with federal and state nutrition standards, and the overhead has dropped,  Sanchez said.  </P></p>

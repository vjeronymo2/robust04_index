			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Germany leads push for EC energy tax SIX EC member states, led by Germany, yesterday all but signed up to the European Commission's controversial proposal for an energy tax to combat global warming. They said that if measures including the tax were not in place by the year-end date the EC has set itself to ratify the Rio Climate Change Convention, 'ratification of the convention has to be reconsidered'. Germany, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark and Luxembourg made clear their conviction that, without the tax, meeting the EC commitment under Rio of stabilising carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by 2000 'is not possible'. Their joint demarche is recorded in the minutes to Monday's and yesterday's debate on climate change by between EC environment ministers meeting here. It will give added evidence to the current Danish presidency of the EC's new push to get the tax through, but risks a damaging north-south split in EC environmental policy. Denmark has called an extraordinary council of energy and environment ministers for April 23 in Luxembourg to discuss the tax and the EC's greenhouse gas strategy. The joint declaration of the six comes as the European Commission published details of each member state's programme to comply with the stabilisation target - showing that national efforts without the EC-wide tax would lead to a 3 per cent increase in CO emissions in 2000 over 1990 levels. The tax puts Dollars 3 (Pounds 2.10) on each barrel of oil equivalent, rising to Dollars 10 by 2000, and falling half on the fuel content of all non-renewable fuel and half on its carbon content. It is being strongly resisted by energy-intensive industries such as chemicals, steel and paper producers. The poorer southern countries oppose it, arguing that the richer northern countries which emit most CO should cut proportionately more. The UK is sceptical about any EC-wide tax and says it can meet the stabilisation target through its own efforts, including recently announced fuel taxes. Of the six countries that came out unequivocally in favour of the tax yesterday, Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Holland intend significant cuts in their 1990 emissions by 2000, while Italy and Luxembourg - like the UK - are aiming at stabilisation.</p>

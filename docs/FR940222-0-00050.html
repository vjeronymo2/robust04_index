			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Nextel Communications, Inc., Paging Network, Inc., and PageMart, Inc. (PageMart) maintained that under the notice and comment rule making procedures involved, the Commission may revise, modify, and even reverse its tentative conclusions based on the record developed in response to its solicitation for comments. BellSouth, PageMart, and Southwestern Bell Corporation also argued that it would be more equitable to charge pioneers in proceedings in which Tentative Decisions have been made if other licensees in the same service generally will be selected using competitive bidding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Commission concluded that it would be inequitable to apply any changes in the pioneer's preference rules to pending proceedings in which Tentative Decisions have been issued. The Commission found that notwithstanding that other licensees in the three proceedings at issue may have to bid at auction and pay for their licenses, preference applicants in these proceedings submitted their requests and publicly disclosed substantial detail of their system designs in reliance on the continued applicability of the pioneer's preference rules. The Commission stated that had the rules been different, these applicants might have structured their requests differently; or conducted research, development, and experimentation differently; or elected not to disclose detailed information about their systems. The Commission concluded that notwithstanding its legal authority to treat 2 GHz broadband PCS pending applicants differently than the 900 MHz narrowband PCS applicants and also to apply changed rules to pending applicants in the 28 GHz LMDS and 1.6/2.4 GHz MSS proceedings, to do so would be inequitable. Accordingly, the Commission decided to render final decisions on pioneer's preference requests in these proceedings based on the existing pioneer's preference rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. This action concluded the Commission's review of the pioneer's preference rules with respect to proceedings in which Tentative Decisions have been made. The Commission anticipates concluding its review of the pioneer's preference rules with respect to other proceedings in a separate Report and Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Ordering Clause <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7.

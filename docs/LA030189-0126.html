			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> US SPRINT REPORTEDLY SEEKING STAKE IN CABLE ACROSS ATLANTIC  </P> <P> US Sprint Communications Co., hoping to expand its role in the international  long-distance market, is negotiating to buy a stake in the first private  telecommunications cable linking the United States and Europe, industry sources  said Tuesday.  </P> <P> US Sprint hopes to acquire Private Transatlantic Telecommunications System  Inc., a privately held company based in McLean, Va., that is building the  transatlantic cable, called PTAT-1, in a joint venture with Cable &amp;  Wireless PLC, a British-based communications firm.  </P> <P> Analysts said the deal would significantly bolster US Sprint's international  presence.  </P> <P> US Sprint's linkup with Cable &amp; Wireless is a blow to New York-based Nynex  Corp., which has sought for two years to buy a 50% stake in PTAT-1.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Harold Greene rejected Nynex's request  for a waiver of the rules that restrict the Bell companies from offering  long-distance services. Greene oversees the Bell companies as part of the 1984  breakup of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.  </P> <P> Nynex could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> The domestic long-distance market is growing about 10% a year, but  international calling volume is increasing at a rate at least twice as large.  </P> <P> Analysts said US Sprint, a unit of United Telecommunications Inc., would  benefit by offering its customers connections to Britain and other parts of  Europe through Cable &amp; Wireless' Mercury Communications subsidiary.  </P> <P> In exchange, Mercury's subscribers would have access to the United States over  US Sprint's domestic fiber-optic network.  </P> <P> PTAT-1, the $600-million PTAT/Cable &amp; Wireless cable, will carry voice and  data calls in the form of laser-generated pulses of light on strands of glass  cable laid across the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.  </P> <P> It is the first transatlantic cable not built primarily by public phone  companies and will compete with TAT-8, a system owned by AT&amp;T and  state-owned phone companies in Europe, Canada and Australia. TAT-8 went into  service in December.  </P></p>

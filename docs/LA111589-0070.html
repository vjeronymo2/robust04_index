			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> A 60-MINUTE COMMERCIAL FOR PAUL MCCARTNEY TOUR  </P> <P> Didn't manage to snare tickets for Paul McCartney's upcoming five-night stand  at the Forum? Depending on your penchant for jealousy, then, you may or may not  want to watch "Paul McCartney: Put It There," a special on Showtime that  basically plays like a tempting 60-minute commercial for the tour, as if it  needed any more help selling tickets. It premiered Saturday and repeats today  at 1:05 and 10:05 p.m. (and again Nov. 21, 22 and 26).  </P> <P> This rockumentary, slavishly produced by McCartney's own company, is definitely  for fans only. (And how many people do you know who aren't?) It's possible, but  not easy, to pull an interesting interview out of McCartney, but whoever is  doing the questioning behind the camera here hasn't pulled much new out of  Macca; "John (Lennon) was such a monster -- it would certainly be hard to work  with anyone better" is the level of personal insight here.  </P> <P> Luckily, the weight of the show is with footage of the ex-Beatle's feisty new  road band, which includes ex-Pretender Robbie McIntosh on guitar, rehearsing  for the tour, and it does set the juices flowing. Few complete songs are found,  but look and listen for lengthy snippets of favorites ranging from "Lucille" to  "The Things We Said Today" to "Let It Be" to the special's title song, an  acoustic choice from his latest solo album, which has the fade-out from the Fab  Four's "Hello Goodbye" playfully tagged on the end.  </P> <P> The most teasing bit is some home-video footage of Elvis Costello in the  recording studio with McCartney, singing a rock 'n' roll rave-up version of one  of the songs they co-wrote for his recent "Flowers in the Dirt" album, "My  Brave Face." If only a bootleg of this complete rendition existed. Wishes,  wishes . . . .  </P> <P> A difference between this tour and the Stones' tour, for example, immediately  becomes clear: Unlike Mick and the boys, whose set list you could've guessed  without even showing up, McCartney wants to play songs from his current album,  a heartening thought. And fans who don't have the "Flowers" LP, which includes  some of his best work of the decade, may feel left out as he explains song  after song from it. Which, this being a commercial, is part of the idea. CHRIS  WILLMAN  </P></p>

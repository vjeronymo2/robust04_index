			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Arts: Today's Television Britain's two main terrestrial channels are, to put it kindly, looking increasingly like themed networks. To put it unkindly they look like channels for obsessives. BBC1 begins its evening schedule with the Australian soap opera Neighbours, offers some news and a fashion programme, then the British soap opera EastEnders followed by three comedy repeats - The Good Life, May To December and French And Saunders with only another blast of news to separate them. ITV begins with the news, then the British soap, Emmerdale, followed by five programmes about crime with only a blast of news to separate them: Inside Crime, 'a series investigating the problem of rising crime and meeting the people who have possible solutions' the half-hour police drama The Bill; The Cook Report, which promises to expose dishonesty; American television courtroom drama She Said No, about a rape case; and the Australian soap set in a gaol, Prisoner: Cell Block H. Bon viveur Keith Floyd is as good as ever in Far Flung Floyd today examining the cooking of East Malaysia.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [RITZAUS BUREAU report: "Domestic Politics Stole the Top </F> Billing From EU"]    [Text] Herning -- European Union [EU] Election 1994. The  Western European Union (WEU), the effort against unemployment,  and developments in East Europe were highest on the agenda when  a very vocally engaged crowd of around 1,000 middle Jutlanders  formed a living backdrop in Herning Convention Center on Monday  [30 May] for the first direct meeting between Liberal Party  Chairman Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Prime Minister Poul Nyrup  Rasmussen (Social Democrat), and the voters.    Gradually as the debate got under way the European issue  glided into the background, however. Comments about the election  for the European Parliament were few and far between, while the  lead-up to the Folketing election, the recovery, and  significance of the government's economic policy took by far the  most speaking time.    Rasmussen asserted again and again "that it's really going  well in Denmark." New jobs are being created, and businesses are  investing at a furious pace.    The optimistic tones provoked challenger Ellemann-Jensen to  warn against a next government -- after the parliamentary  election -- that would be bring about rising taxes to pay for  the paid leave scheme and loose fiscal policy.    When the Liberal Party chairman's favorite topic came up --  the issue of Danish membership in the WEU and Denmark's  security-policy placement in Europe -- it was given the same  importance in the debate as domestic issues.    The two leaders' widely differing views regarding in which  "tier" Denmark belongs was a sure winner among the audience in  Herning. While the prime minister found the hostile tone strange  and underlined that Denmark is always present where the vital  decisions are made, namely in the EU and in NATO,  Ellemann-Jensen -- amid boos from SDP [Social Democratic Party]  supporters -- painted a less positive picture of Denmark's  international position.    "Denmark ranks at the bottom of the fourth tier and has just  about isolated itself in Europe," he said.</p>

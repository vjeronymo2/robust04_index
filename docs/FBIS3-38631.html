			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas has demanded  that the zone north of Dhimokratias Avenue be removed from the  Varosha fenced-off area that will be placed under UN control and  be replaced with an area of similar size south of the fenced-off  area. According to Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC]  information, this was the evaluation of Robert Lamb, the U.S.  State Department special coordinator on the Cyprus issue. Lamb  met with President Glavkos Kliridhis today.    Based on CyBC information, Denktas' new demand concerns all  services necessary to the operation of the area that will be  returned, such as the Electricity Authority, the  Telecommunications Authority, the Municipal Market, the  warehouses, the packaging units, the Greek Famagusta High School  and its library, the stadium, and many hotels. The same reports  say that Lamb informed the Greek Cypriot side, which rejected  the new demand.    The Greek Cypriot side also insisted that a date be set for  the beginning of the second phase for the return of Varosha.  The measures provide that the first phase will begin 18 months  after the agreement is signed but do not determine the date for  the beginning of the second phase. [passage omitted]</p>

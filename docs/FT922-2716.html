			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Courts Charter still not ready THE Courts Charter, which is due to be discussed at the prime minister's six-monthly seminar on the Citizens' Charter on Friday, is not likely to be ready for publication before the end of the summer. The Lord Chancellor's department, which with the Crown Prosecution Service is responsible for drawing up the new charter guaranteeing standards of service and facilities for court users, said yesterday it was still at an early draft stage. The Lord Chancellor's Department is one of only a handful of government departments which has yet to publish information about standards of public service in its area as part of the charter initiative. The Justice Charter for Scotland, which sets out the standards of service which all users of the Scottish justice system can expect and what will be done if services do not come up to standard, was published as early as last November. The English charter is likely to be modelled on the Scottish version. It sets standards of service for the police, courts, prosecuting authorities and prison service and describes the action being taken to improve the quality of services. Yesterday Mr Michael Jack, Home Office Minister, hinted in a speech at a conference in London that the charter for England would also look for greater efficiency and economy in the criminal justice system. The system could be run on sound business principles without compromising its independence or integrity, he said. But the government was also seeking value for money - the best quality at the right price. These complementary approaches were not in any way at variance with the principles of justice. Expensive justice was not necessarily better justice. Dealing with cases in the Crown Court which could have been dealt with more quickly and cheaply in the magistrates' courts was a good example of decisions not being made on the most logical or informed basis, he said.</p>

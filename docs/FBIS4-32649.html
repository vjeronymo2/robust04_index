			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Dear listeners, our guest is Zoltan Gal, new  speaker of the Hungarian National Assembly. [passage omitted]  We have received several phone calls. One of the callers asked  about the law on former agents.    [Gal] I cannot say just now. The fact is that the law will  become effective from 1 July, but in my view it will be  impossible to implement because the parliamentary committee  elected by the previous parliament is not sufficient to start  work, since the law prescribes more than one committee. Nor do  I know when this parliament will have the time to select further  committees -- after a due selection process. This is one side  of the issue.    However, another reason why we should not hurry in this  matter is that I am convinced this law is unconstitutional and,  in practice, unworkable. It would be best if the Constitutional  Court could rule on this question as soon as possible -- as far  as I know the law has been referred to the Constitutional Court  -- because its ruling will be significant in resolving this  situation.</p>

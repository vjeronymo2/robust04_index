			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Small shops lead slide in optimism The latest distributive trades survey from the Confederation of British Industry shows that most retail sectors reported an increase in sales volumes in March compared with the same month in 1993. However, as has been the case in every month since July, reported sales were lower than had been expected at the start of the month. The CBI figures deduct the proportion of those who report a decline in sales from those who report an increase. The balance of retailers reporting an increase in sales in March was 12 percentage points, ahead of the 10-point gap reported in February, but well below the balance of 25 who expected an increase at the start of the month. Expectations for April have fallen. The balance of those expecting an increase in sales is now 14, the lowest figure since February 1993. Large retailers are much more upbeat about sales than small shops. The individual retail sectors which reported the strongest increases in sales in the year to March were booksellers &amp; stationers and grocers; declines were reported by chemists, furniture &amp; carpet stores and by hardware, china and DIY outlets. Although retailers report relatively modest growth, wholesalers say that sales volumes increased strongly in March. The balance of those reporting an increase in sales, at 49, is the highest since October. Among motor traders, the balance of those reporting an increase in sales over the same month a year ago was 22, much lower than in either February or January. The CBI survey covered 479 businesses and was carried out between March 10 and March 31.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Retail sales: grocers surge on as chemists flag  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual growth in volumes (reported) 1993-94                  Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All distribution +33 +35 +28 +32 +31 +21 +36 +38 +26 +33 +30 +30 +33 Grocers          +42 +24 +21 +43 +38 +37 +59 +25 +62 +60 +39 +40 +37 Specialist food   -3 -31 +49 +18 +13  +5 -14 -15 +10 +25 -26 -36  +4 Off-licences     -24 -26 -35 -35 -23  -3 +23 -41 -61 -42 +15 +19  +4 Clothing         +27 +24  -1 +40 +55 +59 +14 +51 +32 +29 +19 +17 +19 Footwear &amp; Leather          +37 +43 -55 +43 +55 +37 +84 +59 +12 +48 +38   0 +11 Durable household goods   +1 +23 +37 +10 +12  +3 -16 +13 -21 +17 +20  +6 +29 Furniture &amp; carpets          +40 +27 +34 +54 +31 +53 +17 +69 -29  +8 +18 +36 -38 Hardware, china &amp; DIY            +46 +29  +3  -5 +10 +14 +23  +5 +10 +29  -5 +12 -13 Confectionary    +36 +10 +20  +3 +13 +30   0  -8 +36 +22 -10  -1 +36 Booksellers &amp; stationers        +4 +47 +46 +37 +49 +22 +20 +50 +18 +48 +48 +17 +47 Chemists         -12 +44 +27 +44 +44 +37 +61 +16 +74 +83 +18  -8 -31 Other retail     +30  -6 +11  +8 +14  -3 +14 +19 +13 +25 -10 -38  -4 Motor trades     +29  +2  -2  -6  +8 +27 +15 +16 +14  -5 +50 +45 +22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: CBI  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Balance = per cent reporting an increase minus per cent reporting a decrease in sales compared with a year before  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

Speaking at Larnaca Airport shortly  before his departure for Athens, Van Den Broek again expressed  the European Union's multiple support for the  confidence-building measures, which he said are an important  step toward the achievement of an overall solution to the Cyprus  issue. The EU commissioner added that he has assured both  President Glavkos Kliridhis and Foreign Minister Alekos  Mikhailidhis that in case the confidence-building measures are  implemented, the European Union is ready to offer any help and  the EU commission will proceed in that direction with the  presentation of proposals to the EU Council of Ministers.    Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis said that Cyprus' movement  toward Europe has began and will end with its accession to the  European Union. Speaking at Larnaca Airport shortly before Van  Den Broek's departure, the foreign minister stressed that Cyprus  is working hard for its accession and has already proceeded with  a series of decisions in this direction. Mikhailidhis said that  the harmonization of Cypriot legislation with that of the  European Union continues at a quick pace. He added that Cyprus'  foreign policy will also begin to be in line with that of the  European Union. Referring to the talks he had with EU  Commissioner Van Den Broek, the Cypriot foreign minister  described them as constructive and comprehensive.</p>

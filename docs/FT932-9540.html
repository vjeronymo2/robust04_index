			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Loss at Simon will breach bank deal SIMON Engineering, over-shadowed by bad news for more than a year, yesterday announced it will incur a first-half loss in the six months to June 30, thereby breaching one of its banking covenants. The company confirmed the loss would breach a covenant on its US private placement borrowings which states that interest cover should be two times or greater. Simon's banks were being kept closely informed and were 'fully supportive'. No other covenants were in danger of being breached, the company said. Sir Philip Foreman, who took over as interim chairman last month following the death of Mr Roy Roberts, told Simon's annual meeting yesterday that the company's paper engineering and petroleum technology businesses had seen trading 'deteriorate materially'. He said Simon, which has reported profits falls since 1990, would incur a first-half operating loss. SG Warburg, the company's broker, changed its full-year forecast from a Pounds 12m profit to a Pounds 2m loss. Warburg also forecast Simon will pay no dividend. The dividend was sharply cut last year from 15.7p to 5p. Sir Philip also said Simon's borrowings have continued to increase, in spite of about Pounds 30m of proceeds from disposals. Gearing is thought to have gone past 100 per cent and net borrowings are thought to be nearly Pounds 110m, against Pounds 101.2m at the year end. The company's shares, which collapsed last year from 301p, yesterday fell 26 1/2 p, more than 25 per cent, to 73 1/2 p. 'The situation looks extremely serious,' an analyst said. Simon said its paper engineering business would report 'significant' first-half losses. Mr Derek Davies, in charge of Simon's process engineering division and responsible for a loss-making paper contract in Florida, has resigned from the company with immediate effect. Simon Petroleum Technology is also expected to incur losses because of recession and proposed changes to petroleum revenue tax which have affected North Sea oil exploration activities. Simon has four deep-sea vessels which are thought to be losing money rapidly. The US private placement, arranged in 1991, was for Dollars 125m (Pounds 81m) of loan notes with a fixed coupon of 9.32 per cent.</p>

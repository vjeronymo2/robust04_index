			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / World Trade News: Italian group wins Greek power contract A CONSORTIUM led by Ansaldo Gie, the Italian engineering group which is part of the Iri state holding company, has won the contract to build a new turnkey power station in northern Greece. The L550bn (Pounds 229m) deal is for the Aghios Dimitrios 5 plant at Kozani, about 100 miles from Salonika. The new coal-fired station will produce 350MW of electricity and 70MW in heat as part of a linked, long-distance heating project. The new plant, probably to be financed via an international bond issue by Greece's Public Power corporation, should be ready in four years. Ansaldo's share, worth over L300bn, involves turbines, generators and associated control equipment. Austria's Wagner Biro will furnish the boilers and a Greek company, Aegek, will be responsible for construction. Separately, Ansaldo Gie and Siemens of Germany have won a contract worth over L200bn for electricity generating equipment to complete one of the world's biggest hydro-electric power stations. Each company will supply five water turbines, generating a total of about 1,600MW, for the Yacireta plant on the Parana river separating Argentina and Paraguay. The new units complete a project, devised in the 1960s, which will generate a total of 3,100MW of electricity via 20 water turbines. The latest orders have come thanks to financial support from the Italian and German governments. The Italian Treasury is supplying Dollars 67.6m in aid and other financial assistance. Italtel, the Italian state-controlled telephone equipment group, has won an order worth L100bn to supply new digital telephone exchanges serving 400,000 new lines in Argentina. The contract, covering a four-year period, is with Telecom Argentina, the telecoms operator for the northern part of the country. The new Lnea UT exchanges will be used to extend capacity in Buenos Aires and the main urban centres in the northern area, including Cordoba and Rosario. The first 58,000 lines are to be installed by the end of this year, with the remainder completed by the end of 1996. The contract is part of a programme to modernise and expand telephone services in northern Argentina.</p>

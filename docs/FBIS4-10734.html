			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roberto Orozco B.] </F>   [Text] The CIAV-OAS [International Commission of Support  and Verification-OAS] today ruled out that groups connected to  the 3-80 Northern Front entered Honduran territory and engaged  in clashes with that country's Army.    Colonel Hernan Seaman, chief of the Honduran Army 9th  Infantry Battalion, informed international news agencies that  his troops engaged in heavy clashes with groups allegedly  connected with the 3-80 Northern Front in the area known as  Chilamates, 300 km east of Tegucigalpa. Two rebels and one  Honduran soldier, identified as Santos Armando Rodriguez, 21,  from the border town of Danli, were killed in this clash.    "There was no confrontation with any group of the 3-80  Northern Front, nor has any member of the 3-80 Northern Front  entered Honduran territory," CIAV-OAS Nicaragua Director Sergio  Caramagna told LA PRENSA. "All commanders, subcommanders, and  commandos of this rebel group are within the security zone,"  Caramagna added.    LA PRENSA tried to interview Jose Angel Talavera, also known  as commander "EL Chacal," chief of the 3-80 Northern Front, but  our efforts were fruitless.    "El Chacal" met yesterday with Government Minister Alfredo  Mendieta to discuss the problem with the Legislative Branch,  which questioned the executive's decision to incorporate members  of the 3-80 Northern Front in the police.    The Honduran Army is conducting offensive actions in  territory bordering Nicaragua to reduce crimes by criminal armed  gangs composed mainly of Nicaraguans who were linked to the  Nicaraguan Resistance.    In this regard, Honduran Army Chief General Luis Alonso  Discua has ordered reinforcements on the border with Nicaragua  and has ordered troops to respond "with strength against rearmed  groups entering the neighboring country."    Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo Wheelock, spokesman for the  Sandinist People's Army (EPS), told LA PRENSA the two armies  have met to coordinate actions that guarantee security in the  border areas of both countries. Wheelock termed these actions  casual operations at specific locations. However, he announced  larger operations will be conducted in the coming weeks.    The Nicaraguan and Honduran armies agreed last month to  fight  border crime because crime in general has increased in both  countries. In Honduras, particularly, gangs of Nicaraguan  criminals are violating that country's territory.    "Assaults, rapes, and robberies have increased at an  alarming  rate in southern Honduras, where another dangerous phenomenon is  also occurring: gun-running by civilians who are not connected  to gangs of criminals," Wheelock asserted.    "What is happening is that in Honduras weapons are sold at  good prices. This prompts Nicaraguans living near the Honduran  border to try to sell their weapons left over from the war in  that country. There are indirect gun-running activities," the  high-ranking military officer remarked.    For Wheelock, the fact the Honduran Army associates criminal  actions with groups of the 3-80 Northern Front is not an  important detail.    "What concerns us is that there is a tangible manifestation  of the crime. We have experienced gangs of criminals who  perpetrate their crimes in other parts of the country and  identify themselves as members of the 3-80 Northern Front, and  this is perhaps not true," Wheelock concluded.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Forecast of Pounds 50bn PSBR alarms City THE CITY gave a lukewarm reaction to the Budget, with some fund managers and brokers predicting that share prices would open sharply lower this morning. The chancellor's forecast that the public sector borrowing requirement will be Pounds 50bn next year caused concern. Mr Graeme Knox, managing director of Scottish Amicable's investment managers, said: 'Mr Lamont's Pounds 50bn PSBR forecast is horrific.' Mr Keith Percy, head of fund management at Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, said: 'The stock market will go down tomorrow. It is likely to be 50 points lower by 10am.' The forecast budget deficit prompted a fall yesterday of 1 1/4 points in the price of long-dated gilt-edged stock. However, sterling rose against the D-Mark, as currency dealers interpreted the chancellor's remarks as signalling there would not be interest rate cuts in the short term. Banks said they had no plans to increase their purchases of gilts in spite of the chancellor's decision to allow bank and building society purchases of gilt-edged stock to count towards the funding of the public sector deficit. Both Barclays and NatWest said that they had no plans to increase their purchases of gilts. Forecasts that share prices would fall today were prompted by the chancellor's decision to cut the tax levied on dividends, called advance corporation tax, from 25 per cent to 20 per cent. Because pension funds can reclaim this tax from the government, the effect on them of the tax cut is to reduce their income from holding shares, so some said that they might switch into gilts. On the basis of the new tax rate, the stock market's average gross dividend yield would have been 3.88 per cent last night, compared with the actual rate of 4.14 per cent. Analysts said that the stock market might also be depressed by the separate Budget proposal to classify dividends paid out of UK companies' overseas profits as 'foreign income dividends'. No tax credits would be available on these dividends, causing a further reduction in pension funds' income.</p>

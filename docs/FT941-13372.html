			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Religion teaching guide opposed New guidelines for religious education in the schools of England and Wales were released yesterday and met with strong opposition from both teachers and religious groups. Under the government guidelines Christianity should take up at least half of religion teaching time and would become a compulsory 'core' subject to be taken from the age of five to the age of 16. Time must also be found for pupils to cover the basic principles of Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Sikhism by the age of 16. Members of the Church of England General Synod warned that the proposals could lead to an 'educational disaster', while leaders of non-Christian faiths were alarmed that Christianity could overwhelm other faiths. Teachers predicted problems in implementing the curriculum and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers pointed out that 54 per cent of teachers had no formal qualifications in the subject.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Carl Gustaf Stroehm: "From Berlin Things Look </F> Different: The Neighbors in the East Have Moved Closer  Again--The German Challenge Is Central Europe"]    [Excerpts] With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the  collapse of the communist regimes, not only the "system of  Yalta" has burst asunder. Unnoticed by many, the order of  Versailles has also perished. Almost simultaneously with the  reunification of Germany and the independence of the Central and  East European nations, those two "supranational" states, which  one can call products of the 1919 world of Versailles, fell  apart: First multinational Yugoslavia, and a short time later  multinational Czechoslovakia.    With the reduction of Soviet (Russian) military might and  ultimately the splintering of the Soviet empire, a concept,  disapproved of and even tabooed for a long time, gained  prominence in the political debate: "Central Europe." In 1915,  in the midst of World War I, the great Liberal, Friedrich  Naumann, had presented "Central Europe," so to speak, as the war  goal of the Kaiser empire--whereby he called the idea of the  nation and the national state a democratic and liberal  achievement. He recommended that the Germans, becoming a nation  themselves, also advance the Slavic peoples and become the  advocate for the medium-sized and smaller nations of that region  which extends from the Russian western border to the German  eastern border.    Certainly, the preconditions have changed under which  Naumann  had developed his conception of Central Europe. But today's  generation, after a long and bitter hiatus, has again become  aware of the idea that the states and peoples of Central Europe  have common interests, a common history, and common future  opportunities.    This "center" of Europe extends east from Germany and  Austria  to Ukraine; north to the Baltic Sea region; southeast as far as  Hungary, Slovenia, and Croatia. In a certain sense, Bulgaria  also professes itself a part of this European center, although  it is a Balkan state. Romania, at least in its Transylvanian  region which until 1918 had been a part of the Danube monarchy  [Austria], tends in the same direction, although the French  influence is strong there. [passage omitted]    The San Andreas fault in California is often called a  rupture  line where there is increased danger of earthquakes. In the east  of Central Europe, there exists a historical-political San  Andreas fault line: a zone where different mentalities,  religions, and views of the state clash. In many cases, this is  not so much due to ethnic differences. The divergent outlook on  life has a much deeper effect. It leads to the situation where  Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats, or Muslim Bosnians, are  alien to each other, although they have been living together in  the same village for decades and speak almost the same language.  [passage omitted]    Until now, none of these nations had even been asked whether  they wanted to be a part of the Warsaw Pact or the communist  camp. It is a bitter irony of fate that, in certain regards,  they have no say today, either. The wish of the postcommunist  countries to be admitted into NATO with equal rights remained  unfulfilled. Instead, they were fobbed off with a cheap  substitute solution (which does not obligate the West to  anything), the Partnership for Peace.    When Western politicans assert that it will take a certain  time until these states are "ripe" enough to be truly admitted  to Western communities, the question arises: Does that time even  exist? Does Central Europe not run the danger of once again  being run over by developments?    The world historic stroke of luck for the Central European  nations consisted of the fact that, after the fall of the Wall,  the Soviet Union as an imperial power also disappeared from the  scene. For the first time in history, the center of the  continent was able to start organizing freely--without direct  power-political intervention by external powers. Even in 1990/91  it was foreseeable that Russia, as an insulted, humbled  superpower robbed of its trophies, in the long term would not be  put off with the role of onlooker and recipient of alms. The  West, however, plagued by irrational fearful visions of a  "disintegration" of the USSR (a disintegration that could not be  averted, anyway), had only one prescription at hand: support for  the Moscow central power against the "centrifugal" tendencies.  Even today, the idea still lurks in Western minds that the newly  created "ministates" from the Baltic to Slovakia are not really  viable, and hence "anachronistic."    In reality, the creation, recreation or independence of  these  states is of great importance, especially for the western part  of Europe. If the Russian area between St. Petersburg and  Vladivostok takes decades to consolidate, then the area west of  the Russian state border acquires a special, specific weight for  the continent's security.    Up to now one could form the impression that Western policy  was putting the cart before the horse: The FRG has expended  enormous amounts in aid to Russia which have disappeared in a  "black hole" without significantly consolidating the situation  or, for example, preventing the election success of the  Zhirinovsky party. Ukraine, on the other hand, came off almost  empty-handed.    Would it not have made more sense to first consolidate the  Central European area economically, and from there to approach  the "Russian question?" Instead, one concentrated on Russia and  in fact neglected the medium-sized and smaller states.    Regarding Germany, the question remains whether the problem  of "Central Europe" has even penetrated the consciousness of the  political class in Bonn. This lack is all the more astounding  since reunification resulted in a shift of the geographic (and  spiritual) coordinates. Although the Federal Republic of Germany  still carries the name it received during partition--it is no  longer identical with the state once ruled by Adenauer. The  focus is shifting from the Rhine to the Spree River, from a West  European setting to the center.    Thereby united Germany is again transformed into a "Central  European" power. In the longer term this means: The political  perspective is also changing. From Berlin the world looks  different from the vantage point of Bonn in the Rhine valley.  The neighbors in the East have suddenly moved closer, those in  the West (although this should not be seen as dramatic) are a  little farther away than before. The Germans have remained a  people of the European center--and if there is a "task" for them  at all, it lies in this center.    After World War I, and especially after World War II, this  central location was overlaid by other constellations--after  1945, by the partition of Germany. The fact that removal of the  partition at the same time also brought freedom for the nations  which until then had been "forgotten" behind the Iron Curtain,  only underlines the fact that Central Europe has a common fate.    Germans today are affected by events in the entire  postcommunist area more closely and, in part, more painfully  than any other (West) European peoples. The days when other  powers or authorities relieved us Germans of great decisions  (and risks) are over. But decisions approach us in inexorably  concrete form, such as the question whether Bonn sees the  priority of its foreign policy in the East with Russia, or with  the medium-sized and smaller states. The answer to that decides  everything. Preferential German-Russian relations can only be at  the expense of the interest of the smaller states. Vice versa,  if Germany becomes the champion of the Central European states  and their independence and security, then political conflicts  and opposing interests with the "great power, Russia" surely are  inevitable.    Should Germany not take up its Central European task and  opportunity, the consequences could be very negative--for the  Central European states as well as the Germans themselves. A new  power-political thrust by Moscow, be it against Ukraine or the  Baltic states, would place Germany in a difficult situation and  would deteriorate the political climate radically.    One can only hope that this time what so often had not been  achieved will succeed: the creation of a consolidated Central  European area that offers a bridge toward Russia--but at the  same time, protection against imponderables coming from Russia.</p>

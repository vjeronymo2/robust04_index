			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX report under the "In Brief" rubric: "They Are </F> Getting Ready for May Day"]    [Text] The Russian Federation internal troops "will be on  duty on a reinforced basis; however, there will be no order to  put them in full combat readiness" during the May Day  celebrations, stated Colonel General Anatoliy Kulikov, internal  troops commander, in a news briefing in Moscow yesterday. He  pointed out that being on reinforced duty means reinforced  security at a number of troop facilities to prevent seizures of  weapons and hardware. "No concentration of forces from the  other regions in Moscow is contemplated," the commander  underlined. In his words, internal troops would be enlisted  during the May Day celebrations to help the militia "as a  reserve at the point of permanent deployment, as well as in  separate regions in Moscow."</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: BCH cuts payout after profits tumble 37.6% Banco Central Hispano (BCH), Spain's second biggest bank, yesterday cut its interim dividend by 31.8 per cent from Pta110 to Pta75. At the nine-month stage BCH posted a 37.6 per cent fall in its pre-tax profits to Pta45.3bn (Dollars 349m) after putting aside Pta106.6bn in provisions, 33.7 per cent more than in January-September last year. The dividend move, which was welcomed by analysts and institutions, is an unusual step for a domestic bank. Ms Anna Macdonald of brokers Smith New Court said the cut had been expected. 'When a bank is losing deposits and loans it has no option but to strengthen its balance sheet.' BCH's decision comes as it is improving its core banking business. At the end of September it had raised operating profit by 17.5 per cent to Pta104.9bn and net interest income by 4.1 per cent to Pta235.3bn.</p>

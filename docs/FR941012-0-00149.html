			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above in the Major Issues section, OSHA is expanding the requirement on first-aid training to all employees. According to the WIR survey, more than one-half of all injuries occurred at cutting sites, that in most cases are remote from medical facilities and personnel (Ex. 2&hyph;1). Also as discussed above in the Major Issues section, OSHA is not requiring employers to provide the first-aid training. The employer can meet the requirements of the standard by assuring that employees he hires already have taken first-aid training. The employer can also meet this requirement by requiring any worker in his employ to take a first-aid training course from any organization in the community whose program meets the requirements of this standard. In addition, the standard does not require repeat first-aid training for workers who have received first-aid training previously, provided the training has met the content requirements of this standard and their first-aid certificate is current.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to first-aid training content, Appendix B specifies the minimum content of required first-aid training. This content list includes training in emergency situations that are most likely to arise in the logging industry, such as control of bleeding and shock, immobilization of injured persons, treatment of sprains and fractures, and treatment of contact with poisonous plants or animals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For several reasons, in the final rule, OSHA has specified the minimum first-aid training requirements rather than simply referring to programs provided by various organizations. First, the content list is in keeping with OSHA's goal of developing performance language standards. Second, the content list in Appendix B focuses on the types of situations that are most likely to occur in the logging industry and in remote work sites. General first-aid training programs may not thoroughly cover the kinds of situations found in the logging industry. Third, the content of training programs offered by various organizations may change and an element crucial to first aid in remote outdoor locations may be dropped. By specifying the minimum content, the standard places training organizations on notice as to what elements their program must include in order to meet the requirements of this standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, by expressing the first-aid training requirements in performance language, OSHA is providing employers with maximum flexibility. Employers will not have to research the Red Cross and MSHA training programs to see if a training program offered locally by another organization meets the requirements of this standard. In addition, by specifying the content, the standard leaves employers free to develop their own first-aid training program or rely on outside organizations to provide first aid training. Fifth, since the final standard permits employers to require their employees to take first-aid training rather than providing the training, it is important to provide employees with an understandable criteria for determining whether the training program they select meets the requirements of this standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (i)(7)(ii) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that each employee receives first-aid training at least every three years and receives CPR training at least annually. The proposed rule did not contain a similar requirement. Most first-aid training organizations require retraining at the above frequency in order to maintain a current certificate (Ex. 5&hyph;42). OSHA agrees with these organizations that it is necessary to refresh one's first-aid skills on a regular basis. Since these skills are not usually used on a daily basis, trained persons may become less able to render these skills over time without periodic refresher training. In addition, what constitutes the best first-aid techniques and procedures changes over time. Employees need to be retrained so their skills include the best and most current practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (i)(7)(iii) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that each employee's first aid and CPR training and/or certificate of training remain current. The proposed rule did not contain a similar requirement. OSHA believes this provision is essential given the inclusion of the exception in the final rule for previously trained workers. In addition, it is essential because employers can comply with the first-aid training provisions without actually providing the training themselves. In essence, this provision is similar to the provision in paragraph (i)(5) reinforcing that the employer is responsible for assuring that the employee can safely perform the job, even if the employer has not been required to actually provide the training. Regardless of whether the employer provides training or allows employees to take a first-aid program offered by another organization, the employer is still responsible for assuring that employees can render first aid properly if called upon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

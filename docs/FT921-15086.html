			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (13): Simplicity pays in a challenging year - Banking / Of the 68 banks listed in the FT500, 42 move down the rankings compared with their positions in 1990 FEW European bankers can recall a year as challenging as the past one, when many of them suffered big losses on loans while confronting a raft of strategic issues. Banks in the UK and Scandinavia were forced to make record provisions to cover the risk of loss on loans to companies and individuals. In France and Italy, fears escalated that their banks will soon face losses of a similar magnitude. Meanwhile, most European bankers were forced to face up to three key strategic questions: How should they broaden the range of services they offer? How should they take advantage of the single market to be formed at the end of this year in the European Community? Should they expand into eastern Europe? The problems faced by banks are clearly reflected in the FT500. Of the 68 banks listed in the table, 42 move down the rankings compared with their positions in 1990. Nonetheless, there is a net increase of five in the number of banks listed. Gota Bank, the Swedish Bank hit by loan losses, drops out. Two Dutch banks, Algemene Bank and Amro Bank, also lose their separate listing, because they merged to form ABN Amro Bank. The new merged bank is listed as number 84 in the league table and is the 15th biggest publicly-listed bank in Europe. Other newcomers to the FT500, in descending order of size, are: Banco Lariano, the Italian bank controlled by the San Paolo group Berliner Bank, the bank based in Berlin and part owned by the municipality; Safra Republic, the highly successful Luxembourg-registered private banking group, set up by the multimillionaire Mr Edmond Safra; Schroders, the UK merchant bank which specialises in corporate advisory services; Banco Toscana, the Italian bank controlled by Monte dei Paschi di Siena; Hambros, the UK merchant banking group offering a diverse range of corporate and personal services. It is also arguable that the Dutch financial group, Internationale Nederlande - which was formed in March by the merger of the insurance group Nationale Nederlande with the savings bank, NMB Postbank - should be regarded as a bank, though it is not classified in the FT500 as such. The creation of Internationale Nederlande was the most spectacular example of a trend which touched the whole of the European banking industry - the fusion of banking and insurance. Banks realised that many insurance products - especially life policies  - were in essence savings products and could therefore be slotted comfortably alongside their traditional banking products. At the same time, insurance companies recognised that banks' networks of branches gave the banks a competitive advantage in selling savings products. So a number of banks and insurance companies formed close links. In the UK, National Westminster Bank formed a joint venture with Clerical Medical, a mutual life company. Another British bank, Abbey National, bought a small life office, Scottish Mutual. However, other European banks, such as Deutsche Bank in Germany and Credit Agricole in France, have had a notable success by creating their own insurance operations from scratch. Meanwhile, there were no big mergers of banks across borders within the EC. Banks recognise that there is an opportunity to make incremental profits by selling services throughout the EC - taking advantage of the single European market - but to date they have tended to make only small acquisitions in other EC countries or have formed loose alliances with foreign peers. Barclays, the biggest UK bank, bought Europeene de Banque, the Paris-based private bank. Meanwhile, Dresdner, Germany's second biggest bank, and Banque Nationale de Paris, the second biggest French bank, began talks to form a link, with each bank taking a 10 per cent stake in the other. Nonetheless, for all their need to focus on long-term strategy, most European bankers had their hands full preventing the worldwide slowdown in economic growth from prompting unsustainable loan losses. A recession and property slump which has lasted four years prompted the Norwegian government to organise a rescue of its entire banking system. There is not a single Norwegian bank in the FT500, which reflects the degree of state ownership of the banks there and the sharp fall in their market values. Swedish and Finnish banks also plummeted down the rankings, as they made severe losses on loans to their property and finance sectors. Meanwhile, UK banks are about to enter their fourth successive half-year of record loan losses. UK banks have been making provisions to cover possible credit losses equal to more than 2 per cent of the value of their domestic loans - which is a rate of provisioning never seen since the banks started to disclose their profits. UK banks have been hurt because they granted far too much credit in the the mid to late eighties, both to companies and to individuals. There have been some spectacular collapses of big companies - the late Mr Robert Maxwell's private companies are the latest example. But in 1991, the decimation of small- and medium-size businesses did the most damage to UK banks' profitability. Analysts are concerned that French banks may be about to suffer big losses. Like their UK peers, they expanded their loan books by around 20 per cent a year in the late eighties and acquired significant exposures to the UK and US property sectors, now in recession, and to international companies with big borrowings. So where are Europe's stronger banks? They tend to be in Germany, Switzerland and Spain, where domestic markets have been fairly closed to outside competition, where economies have remained relatively buoyant and where banks have a conservative lending culture. Swiss banks have not had a happy experience when venturing overseas. In Spain, where the banking market was for decades wholly protected from any competition, there are signs that liberalisation may erode the astonishingly high profitability of the banks. So what is the lesson for bankers of 1991? Banks that have done best - such as Abbey National in the UK, Svenska Handelsbank in Sweden or Banco Popular in Spain - have concentrated on serving their traditional markets while keeping their overheads low. In other words, simplicity pays.</p>

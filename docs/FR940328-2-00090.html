			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the requirement of a sufficient market imbalance is a critical aspect of the pilot program. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  Such a requirement is necessary to ensure that stops are only granted, in a minimum variation market, when the benefit (i.e., price improvement) to orders being stopped far exceeds the potential for harm to orders on the specialist's book. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  To evaluate how this standard is being applied in practice, the Commission requests that the NYSE conduct another comprehensive quantitative analysis of market depth. In its next monitoring report, the NYSE should provide, in chart form, a comparison of the size of the stopped order to any quote size imbalance. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  The chart also should include the ratio of the size of the bid to the size of the offer. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  The NYSE should concentrate on orders for 2,000 shares or less, and should provide the requested information in the form of an average for all buy orders stopped, and then for all sell orders stopped, in that size range. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a discussion of the relationship between quote size imbalance and the likelihood of price improvement, see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , note 8. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In extending a comparable pilot program by the American Stock Exchange, the Commission placed similar emphasis on the critical nature of the sufficient size standard when stopping stock in minimum variation markets.

As part of its review, the NYSE determined how often such book orders were executed at their limit price by the close of the day's trading. The Commission does not consider that data to be conclusive, because it does not reflect the disposition of book orders in those circumstances (approximately half of all stops granted) where the stopped order did not receive price improvement. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> When stock is stopped, book orders on the opposite side of the market that are entitled to immediate execution lose their priority. If the stopped order then receives an improved price, limit orders at the stop price are bypassed and, if the market turns away from that limit, may never be executed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for book orders on the same side of the market as the stopped stock, the Committee believes that Rule 116.30's requirements make it unlikely that these limit orders would not be executed. Under the NYSE pilot program, an order can be stopped only if a substantial imbalance exists on the opposite side of the market. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , notes 10&hyph;14 and accompanying text. In those circumstances, the stock would probably trade away from the large imbalance, resulting in execution of orders on the book. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> infra, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 18. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Go Back to the Essentials of International </F> Coordination and Accelerate Efforts To Reduce the Surplus"]    [Text] In a sense, international coordination is a  mechanism for mutual interference in internal affairs. The  recent conference of G-7 finance ministers and central bank  governors became an occasion to demand that Japan boost its  domestic demand and reduce its surplus. It was a matter of  course that the Western countries should make strong demands on  Japan because Japan is still unable to extricate itself from the  worst recession in the post-war period, and its current accounts  surplus continues to grow.    The Hosokawa administration has no recourse but to go back  to  the essentials of international coordination, exert efforts to  expand domestic demand and open up the market, and reduce the  surplus. That should be Japan's option, and this will contribute  to an expanded equilibrium in the world economy.    Although the main item on the agenda of this G-7 meeting was  supposed to be aid to Russia, the Western nations' interests  were focused rather on the expansion of domestic demand and  surplus reduction in Japan. The G-7 made it clear that "this is  not a problem only for Japan and the United States" (according  to German Finance Minister Theo Waigel).    With regard to the focal issue of tax cuts, Finance Minister  Hirohisa Fujii said that these will not only be limited to one  year, but Japan intends to continue with tax cuts even beyond  1994. The recent Japan-U.S. summit broke down not just because  of the contention on numerical targets. The United States had  also perceived Japan's tax cuts to be limited to one year.  Fujii's statement on continuing with the tax cuts was, of  course, aimed at dispelling such a "misunderstanding." But the  question of why this had not been declared at the Japan-U.S.  summit remains. If Fujii's statement was a hasty deviation from  the original plan in view of the Clinton administration's  attitude toward Japan after the summit, then it was indeed a  clumsy act.    Some people might think that it is impertinent for foreign  countries to meddle even in tax cuts in Japan. However, time  and again, Japan has asked the United States to reduce its  financial deficits at past G-7 meetings. On the other hand,  Germany has consistently been asked to ease its monetary policy.  If policy coordination among the advanced countries is  indispensable for the world economy's development, then it is  important to listen to what foreign countries have to say.    However, the prerequisite for such coordination is to know  each other's economic management well. The Hosokawa  administration was incredibly inadequate in explaining Japan's  economic stimulation measures, while the Clinton  administration's lack of understanding was also appalling.    The attitude of the Clinton administration, which condemned  Japan's pump-priming measures as being ineffective from the very  beginning, was not any better, if not worse, than the Japanese  bureaucrats, whom the United States calls stubborn.  Unfortunately, the two countries cannot be said to have  narrowed such a perception gap at the recent G-7 meeting.    The Japanese monetary authorities wanted to work for stable  foreign exchange rates at the G-7, but it seems that the foreign  exchange issue "was not a focus of the discussion" (according to  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen). Under the floating  exchange rates system, monetary strategies do not work unless  accompanied by financial policy coordination and large scale  intervention [in the foreign exchange market]. The vague G-7  declaration, and rhetorical intervention by the monetary  authorities can only influence the information-oriented market  temporarily. After all, the foreign exchange rate reflects  economic fundamentals.    Looking at the fundamentals, for instance, the difference in  the economic climate and the gap between interest rates in Japan  and the United States, there will probably not be any rapid  appreciation of the yen despite the tension in bilateral  relations. Even the Clinton administration would like to avoid  any excessive appreciation of the yen because this may lead to  the depreciation of the dollar, and consequently, a rise in  interest rates.    Stability of the exchange rate all depends on whether Japan  will be able to correct the trade imbalance through the  expansion of domestic demands and market liberalization.</p>

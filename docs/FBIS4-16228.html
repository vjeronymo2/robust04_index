			<p>BFN     [Text] Chairman of the State Duma's Committee on CIS  Affairs and Relations with Russians outside Russia, Konstantin  Zatulin, believes that the State Duma must adopt a federal law  stating that the agreement on Russia's joining NATO's  Partnership for Peace program must be subject to ratification by  the State Duma. Adoption of such a law was initiated on  Wednesday by Chairman of the State Duma's Committee on  Legislation and Judicial Reform, Vladimir Isakov.    Zatulin said the majority of State Duma deputies supported  the idea. He announced that all participants in the hearings  agreed that given the present situation of "civil discord" the  NATO program should not be joined in a hurry. "Deputies were  dissatisfied with the fact that the program did not provide for  a special status for Russia and that the NATO members had taken  a tough stand saying that Russia did not differ from any other  participant in the program," Zatulin stressed.    Zatulin was certain that the CIS states must work out a  single position on joining to the NATO program. He expected  that the CIS summit planned for April 15 would discuss the  issue. Zatulin said the CIS states must work out a new defense  doctrine taking into consideration that all the relics of the  Cold War must disappear, referring not only to the Warsaw Pact  but also NATO.</p>

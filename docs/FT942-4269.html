			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Dollars 143m China purchase for Cathay Intl Cathay International Holdings, the China investment group, is to pay Dollars 143m (Pounds 95.3m) for 60 per cent of a company which will operate four toll bridges and a tunnel in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou (Canton). In its first infrastructure investment in China, CIH has signed an agreement for the project with the Guangzhou municipal government, which will guarantee a minimum return of 15 per cent per annum. The franchise lasts for 20 years. Mr Stephen Hunt, deputy chairman, said: 'Based on current projections, the toll systems must be improved to achieve the required returns, but the traffic volumes are already there.' CIH plans to fund the investment through a debt placement, which will be undertaken as soon as approval is given by shareholders and the Chinese regulatory authorities. The bridges and tunnel, which are the sole assets of the Zhujiang Road-Bridges and Tunnels Company, are already operating and CIH should be able to achieve profits as soon as the deal is signed, although it will have to invest in improved toll systems. Its partner is the city's municipal government. Mr Hunt said that under the agreement CIH had the right to cover any shortfall in revenues from its partner's 40 per cent share of cash flows. He was confident this would not be necessary. The return on assets is denominated in US dollars, so CIH should bear no currency risk, and the company can increase tolls if revenue targets are not met. CIH was formed last year from the reverse takeover of Stonehill. It has already invested in a hotel project in the city of Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, and a hotel and property development in Beijing. Under the agreement, CIH has the right to build and operate three further bridges across the Pearl River in Guangzhou. CIH also considered an investment in a number of municipal water plants in Guangzhou, but Mr Hunt said the company had decided not to go ahead with the deal.</p>

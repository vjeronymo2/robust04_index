			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra by </F> Stanislav Cervinka; place and date not given: ``The Czech  Republic Will Not Export Arms Into Countries Embargoed by the  UN'']    [Text] After his return from his 12-day visit to Syria,  Pakistan, and Iraq, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra  pointed to the key influence of these countries. In this  connection we asked him:    Cervinka: You stressed that the Czech Republic  does not export arms to Iran. Does this also apply to Syria and  Pakistan?    Vondra: The Czech Republic has not exported any  large volumes of military technology to these countries  recently. Spare parts for the previously delivered technology  is an exception. In the future, similar deals will be regulated  by applicable laws. Each and every deal will be judged  separately on the basis of this law. This law does not include  a list of off-limits countries. In no case will the Czech  Republic export arms to countries on which the UN has imposed an  embargo. In the case of other countries, the foreign policy  aspects of each and every deal will be considered.    Cervinka: How do you view developments regarding  the Czech Republic's claims in the Middle East?    Vondra: It is extremely difficult to assess such a  situation. The Czech Republic, as one of the successor states  after Czechoslovakia, inherited claims that had been established  in past decades due to the fact that Czechoslovakia, as a Warsaw  Pact member, supplied many developing countries with various  goods. Economic considerations, essential in foreign trade, were  either secondary or totally unimportant in such cases. Many  Third World countries still do not perceive past deals as normal  business, but as assistance provided to them by the then Soviet  bloc to maintain balance in the world, or develop their economy.  This does not mean, however, that the Czech Republic will waive  its claims. If we are to retain our chance of getting paid for  our claims in the future, we have to search for ways that will  encourage future cooperation that will be acceptable to both  sides. I am convinced that this is the situation in those  Middle East countries on which the UN embargo has not been  imposed. This cooperation, however, will not continue in the  spirit of the strategic intentions of the former Soviet bloc.</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> CARSON GOES APE TO AID CHIMP  </P> <P> Johnny Carson didn't monkey around when a zoo in his native Nebraska needed  help.  </P> <P> He donated $55,000 to give Reuben the chimp new digs.  </P> <P> Northeast Nebraska Zoo has only one chimpanzee, but the donation from "The  Tonight Show" host may be enough to acquire a female companion for Reuben as  well as build a permanent primate exhibit, zoo officials said.  </P> <P> The 7-year-old chimp is housed in a fortified mobile home at the zoo in rural  Royal, near Carson's hometown of Norfolk, but the monkey has grown too strong  for his quarters.  </P> <P> Construction should begin next week on a new enclosure.  </P></p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Optimism boosts retailers STORES group Marks and Spencer led a revival in high street retailer stocks as the sector responded to several factors to move ahead sprightly. Strong sterling encouraged confidence that the much-vaunted economic recovery was now showing through. Clothing retailers were also responding to figures earlier this week which indicated that womenswear sales in January had grown by 22 per cent and footwear by 23 per cent. M&amp;S jumped 10 to 359p in hefty turnover of 6.2m. Specialists said the stock was benefiting from talk in the market that February sales had been buoyant. Elsewhere, Argos added 7 to 305p, Burton Group 2 1/2 to 83p with 7.2m traded, Great Universal Stores 33 to 1665p, Next 4 1/2 p to 161p and Sears 4 to 102p. However, some dealers pointed out that stock shortages had been behind some of the rises and that technical corrections may follow.</p>

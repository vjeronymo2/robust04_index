			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LCE expanding core contracts THE LONDON Commodity Exchange yesterday an-nounced a further concentration of its effort on core contracts, with a planned expansion of trade in freight futures, grains and potatoes and the closure of poorly traded meat and soyameal contracts. A study by Landell Mills, commodities consultants, highlighted the international importance of the Biffex freight futures contract and found UK interest in grain and potato contracts as a hedge against changes resulting from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks and European Community farm policy reform. However, the study saw no prospect of developing the pigmeat, lamb and soyameal contracts, which have seen minimal trading this year. The exchange's main contracts will remain cocoa, coffee and white sugar. But it plans to promote the freight, wheat, barley and potato contracts, which came with the takeover of the Baltic Futures Exchange in 1990. Freight futures volume averages 192 lots a day, with wheat and barley at 272 lots and potatoes just 81. 'We want to get the exchange to be focused - to be a soft commodities and agricultural exchange,' said Mr Robin Woodhead, chief executive. 'To have a whole lot of contracts which were illiquid didn't make any sense.'</p>

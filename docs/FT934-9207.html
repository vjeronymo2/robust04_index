			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Trizec delays vote on plan for shake-up TRIZEC has delayed a vote on its CDollars 1.2bn (USDollars 926m) debt-restructuring plan to give securities holders more time to evaluate proposals made by the Calgary-based property developer. The company said yesterday that meetings to approve the plan, which were scheduled for December 7, will not be held until at least early-1994, and may be postponed well into the new year. Trizec initially hoped, when it published its proposals in August, to complete the restructuring by late-October. But Mr Derrick Tay, a lawyer who represents an informal committee of debenture holders, said yesterday: 'We cannot be rushed.' The seven-member committee includes representatives of Union Bank of Switzerland, Commerzbank, Westdeutsche Landesbank and Canadian institutions. Many of the debentures, however, are in bearer form, and their holders cannot be easily traced. Trizec has debts totalling CDollars 5.4bn. The plan is designed to relieve a heavy debt-servicing burden over the next two-three years by converting senior and junior debentures as well as preferred shares into common equity.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Russian money aids a bear market: Two years after the collapse of the Soviet Union a new breed of big spender is coming to London In Davos, Switzerland Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former Russian finance minister, observes that 'flats bought by Russians are helping the London property market very much'. Nearby, a Swiss banker notes that there is a 'huge cash business coming out of Russia - no one knows where it is going'. Meanwhile on London's Bond Street an exclusive jeweller is delighted by the recent surge it has seen in Russian customers. Two years after the collapse of the Soviet Union a new breed of Russian business person - and Russian money - is beginning to arrive in western capitals. The scale of the capital flight is startling. Last year official assets from the former Soviet Union held by Western banks doubled to almost Dollars 18bn, with about Dollars 4.4bn of this held in London. Much of this is accounted for by Russian businesses and banks but anecdotal evidence suggests that some significant fortunes held by Russia's new elite are hidden away in these accounts. In London alone at least Pounds 50m worth of property is estimated to have been purchased by buyers from the former Soviet Union in the past two years, some by companies and some by newly rich individuals. Mr Nikolai Chertvertakov, a former employee at the Russian trade delegation in London and now a business consultant, said: 'Many Russian businessmen are buying homes in London. They come to rest and to work.' He said that London was a favoured haven for three reasons: the high value Russians attach to the English language and education system; its position as a financial centre; and above all, its proximity to the metal, mineral and oil exchanges  -an area which has proved highly lucrative for both legal and illegal Russian exporters in the past. Although the influx is tiny compared with the 1970s spending sprees of the Middle East's oil-rich, it is already presenting both an opportunity and a problem for London financial institutions which fear that some of the money might be from less-than-reputable sources. Russians themselves are keen to minimise this threat, arguing that criminal money forms only a fraction of funds arriving in the west. But the chaotic nature of the Russian legal system means that distinguishing the legal from the illegal is often extremely difficult. Meanwhile, as bankers point out, most of the money arriving in London is doing so by locally legitimate means. Russian regulations stipulate that Russians can only open offshore bank accounts with the Russian Central Bank's permission, and restrict most Russian companies from exporting their hard-currency profits or investing them overseas. Russian businesses and individuals are usually able to circumvent this by setting up a joint-venture or overseas company subject to local law. Mr Bill Newman, assistant general manager of Narodny Bank, a British bank whose main shareholder is the Russian state bank, said: 'There is an awful lot of Russian money swirling around, but much of that comes out quite legally from Russian banks and businesses. The Latin American experience shows that when you have hyper-inflation and a collapse in the exchange rate you will see an outflow of capital.' Either way, the trend has left some estate agents in London celebrating. One estimates that in the past two years more than 70 purchases have been made in London by Russians - with most sales between Pounds 750,000 and Pounds 2m. Estate agents say most of these sales are cash-based, using offshore funds from banks or companies based in a low-tax jurisdiction. One estate agent, Benham Reeves, has been so impressed by the increase that it is talking to a bank based on the Isle of Man about establishing a special offshore payment system for Russians. Some buyers have been Russian companies, operating as joint ventures from London or an offshore base. The Russian Rosal trading group provides a fairly typical example. A British-Russian joint venture based in Monaco for tax purposes, the company trades in metals from the Siberian area and has bought properties in north London for the use of its employees. Mr Vladimir Gusinsky, head of the Most construction group in Moscow, has bought property in London and Portugal registered as company-owned to minimise his tax bill. He is, he says, particularly fond of the Chelsea area. Other Russians have been purchasing private properties more openly. Mr Nick Gilchrist, of Lassmans estate agents, which has sold about five properties to Russians around the Pounds 1m mark, recently sold a Pounds 1m property to a Russian business family from St Petersburg. Mr Gilchrist said: 'They were wanting a family home because they are putting their daughter through further education here.' He added that the family arrived with a beautiful collection of Russian antiques. Artwork and jewellery has proved to be a particularly popular purchase for some Russians. A Swiss banker said: 'We think a lot of this (Russian) money must be coming out through jewellery and things like that.' At his bank more than 150 new accounts had recently been opened by Russians, albeit mostly for sums of less than SFr1m (Pounds 463,000). Mr Ivan Samarin, Russian expert at Sotheby's auction house, said that whereas five years ago 'there would have been no Russian buyers at the auctions of Russian art, now there might be up to a dozen'. Mr Alexis Tiesenhausen, Christie's Russian expert, said that although these clients were financially as sophisticated an any western client, they were 'extremely quiet and secretive'. Cartier, the luxury-goods shop, said it had seen a big increase in Russian clients in the last year, buying watches, jewellery and other luxury goods - almost always with cash. Garrards, the Bond Street jeweller, reported a similar surge not only from Russians but Serbians as well. Russians have also been spending money on education. Oakley Hall school in Gloucestershire launched an advertising campaign in Russia last year. It attracted 18 Russian pupils at Pounds 7,335 a year each. Their parents include a banker, a doctor, a Mercedes-Benz car dealer, the owner of a pharmaceutical company and the director and deputy director of a factory in Siberia. Mr John Rawlinson, the school's headmaster and a former merchant banker, said: 'In several cases the family have got business interests here, which is very convenient because they can take the children out for half-term. What the parents do is come over here - perhaps they buy a house and have the mother live in it.' Fee payments are made in a range of hard currencies, using an 'innovative' system, according to Mr Rawlinson. One set of parents paid through both a German and American bank. And although he has turned away one suspicious parent who arrived at the school with cash in hand, Mr Rawlinson is confident that the business can expand, with about 100 pupils projected to arrive at a range of British private schools next year under a scheme he is in the process of setting up. 'A lot of schools have already trawled the Far Eastern market.' he said. 'There's huge potential in Russia.'

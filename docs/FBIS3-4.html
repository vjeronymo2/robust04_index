			<p>The     following summaries highlight information from articles that  appeared in the Algiers French- and regional Arabic-language press  in January and February.      Liamine Zeroual's Image Favorable      A report in the Arabic-language Doha (Qatar) daily AL-SHARQ of 3  February states that the public views newly elected President  Liamine Zeroual as a very shrewd and experienced military man who  can return Algeria "to the days of Boumedienne."  According to the  report,  Zeroual is seen as the man who can end the confrontation  between the Islamists and the nationalists since he effectively  pushed for dialogue and reconciliation when he was defense minister.  Zeroual reportedly considers nationalism inseparable from Islam as  part of his new national order:  "Zeroual goes back to the origins  of the Algerian revolution when nationalism embraced Islam during  the battle for independence.  In the sixties the two diverged.  Nationalism embraced socialism and Islam was marginalized.  When  socialism failed, Islam came back forcefully."  Zeroual has  reportedly created a positive image through his efforts as defense  minister to deal in a positive manner with both the (Islamic  Salvation Front) FIS and the regime.  As a result, FIS leader Rabah  Kebir says his party anticipates that Zeroual will change policy,  but not necessarily replace government officials.  According to the  report, Kebir's statement indicates that the FIS is becoming more  flexible and wants to undertake serious dialogue with authorities,  particularly in light of the communications that took place before  and after the National Dialogue in January.      Influx of Refugees in the South Provokes Concern      French-language Algiers daily EL WATAN of 10 and 23 January has  reported that Algerian Tuareg frustration and anger is growing in  Tamanrasset because of the high number of illegal foreigners (mainly  from Niger, Mali, and Ghana) who reportedly outnumber Algerians in  the region.  The Tuaregs hold these foreigners responsible for  increasing crime rates, attacks against tourists, and drug  trafficking which weakens the economy and creates a security problem  in the region.  Hadj Moussa Akhmokh, a prominent Tuareg authority,  says a 1992 plan to improve regional security was unsuccessful and  that "the situation has become worse."  In December, for example,  the two national firms National Company for Mining Research  (SONAREM) and Center for Energy Research (CREM) were looted and  several vehicles were stolen. In addition, customs officials from  Tamanrasset were kidnapped by a group of individuals armed with  Kalashnikovs, robbed, and taken to Niger where they were manhandled  before being released. According to Hadj Akhamokh, the more recent  kidnapping of 18 Tuaregs (10 Algerians and eight Malians) set a  "serious" precedent and was the  "last straw." Citizens planned a peaceful march to demonstrate their  anger and to attract the attention of authorities until Hadj  Akhamokh convinced them to postpone the march.  Hadj Akhmokh stated  the Tuaregs have responded to his appeal, but that they are  "impatient," and are waiting for the government to take control of  the situation.      According to Hadj Akhamokh, smuggling is also a serious problem.  He faults local police for participating in the corruption and  allowing it to continue.  Food shipments intended for the local  population are being purchased and resold for twice the price across  the border, including milk which has been unavailable in the markets  for "months."  According to Hadj Akhmokh, "smuggling has grown to  proportions that the Tuaregs can no longer tolerate. To starve the  people is to push us to revolt."

'Terrorists' Exert Pressure; Press, Lifestyle Threatened      EL WATAN of 16 January reported that "terrorist threats" have  promoted a climate of fear in the town of Meftah, "imposing a life  style that has nothing to do with Algerian society."  According to  the report, Meftah and Medea have become towns which immerse  themselves more and more in Islamic, even "fundamentalist,"  tendencies.  For example, the article stated that tracts posted  throughout Meftah threaten that women who do not wear the hijab and  who wear Western style clothes will "have to deal with us."  In  addition threats have been made against beauty salons, Moorish  baths, and cassette vendors.  "Fundamentalists" have also attacked  the press, declaring it "unsuitable reading."  EL WATAN reported in  three articles from 16 to 18 January that newspaper vendors and  bookstores in Blida, Medea, ChIef, and El Khemis were no longer  selling newspapers.  According to EL WATAN of 16 January, national  publications, particularly those of the independent press, have  suddenly disappeared from the shelves due to "terrorist threats."  One citizen reported, "Don't use my name, but I am afraid to tell  you that tobacco shops and bookstores are scared to death. They are  convinced that if they continue to sell newspapers there could be  serious reprisals."  EL WATAN of 17 and 18 January reported that  vendors have denied the threats, blaming distributors for failing to  deliver the newspapers.  Nonetheless, security services have ordered  merchants to sell newspapers or be shut down.      Citizens Reportedly Buying Visas      An article in the French-language daily ALGER REPUBLICAIN of 19  January recounted the frustrations of dozens of Algerians trying to  obtain French visas.  Given the evening curfew, many spend the night  in nearby hotels or in the elevators or hallways of neighboring  buildings.  According to the report, lines can begin as early as 4  a.m., causing citizens to resort to purchasing a place in line for  500-1000 dirhams, depending on the position in line and the time it  is purchased.  In the words of one citizen, "It is a real stock  exchange."  The French consulate reportedly closed for two days and  suspended issuing visas in an effort to set up a new system whereby  visa requests would be handled through the mail.

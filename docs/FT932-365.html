			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Airtours loss at Pounds 16m after abortive bid costs hit Pounds 9m AIRTOURS, the acquisitive holiday company, yesterday announced a first-half pre-tax loss of Pounds 15.9m, including Pounds 8.99m spent on the failed bid for its rival Owners Abroad. The comparative deficit was Pounds 5.6m. The results for the six months ended March 31 1993 also included a Pounds 2.2m loss from Pickfords Travel, the travel agency chain purchased last year. Travel companies are usually in the red in the first half because they have already begun to pay some of their summer season costs. Costs of the Owners Abroad bid, which were slightly below expectations, included a Pounds 3.9m loss on the Owners Abroad shares incurred during the attempted takeover. The other Pounds 5.1m consisted of underwriting commissions and professional fees. Turnover increased 45 per cent to Pounds 147.3m. Losses per share came to 15.27p (4.29p) but the interim dividend is raised to 1p (0.55p). Mr David Crossland, chairman, said he stood by his forecast made during the Owners bid that the dividend for the full year would be lifted by not less than 20 per cent. He said that Airtours summer 1993 bookings were up 23 per cent in a market which was growing overall by 6 per cent. COMMENT However disappointed Airtours might have been in failing to capture Owners earlier this year, it has come out ahead in market share. Owners has always said it was more interested in profit than market share. Nevertheless, it must be galling to see Mr Crossland claim second place to Thomson with 15.2 per cent of 1993 summer business, compared with 13.8 per cent for Owners. Mr Crossland needs to show progress in integrating Pickfords, Hogg Robinson and Aspro before he makes further acquisitions, although he has not lost interest in continental Europe. Expected profits of Pounds 45m, before the cost of the bid, and earnings of 30p put the shares on a multiple of 11. Given that Mr Crossland claims a pre-tax profit per passenger of Pounds 21.60 on the tour operating side, compared with Pounds 12-Pounds 13 for Thomson and Owners, that might look mean. But few can forget how volatile the travel business has been in the past, and it will take several seasons of stability to change that. There is also the additional cloud of the OFT inquiry. If Airtours still looks in such fine shape when that passes, its attractions might become more obvious.</p>

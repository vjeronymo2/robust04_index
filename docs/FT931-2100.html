			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / CrossRail bill may be reactivated THE BILL authorising construction of the Pounds 2bn CrossRail link, the biggest public transport project planned for central London, is expected to be reactivated soon after Easter as the government seeks to counter accusations that it is trying to shelve the scheme. Last week the chancellor said, in his Budget speech, the project would be re-examined as a candidate for private sector finance as part of the government's attempt to attract more private funding for transport infrastructure projects. This gave rise to fears of long delays for the scheme because it had previously been agreed that it would be funded wholly by the public sector. But the CrossRail bill, dormant since its introduction to the House of Commons last year, is now likely to be reactivated and given a second reading in May. The underground British Rail link between Paddington station on the western side of the capital and Liverpool Street on the eastern side would enable thousands of commuters to travel beyond the two terminuses to the West End and the City without changing to London Underground's overcrowded trains. At the end of last week, the Corporation of London, the City's governing body, published a strongly worded report pouring cold water on the idea of getting private funding into CrossRail and other projects. A co-author of the report, Mr Stephen Glaister of the London School of Economics, said: 'There is a real danger that waiting for private sector finance to dig this project out of a financial hole risks losing it altogether.' Department of Transport officials yesterday emphasised that the Budget restated the government's commitment to the project and said the Pounds 200m allocated to preliminary work on the scheme over the next three years remained in place.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vitaliy Denisov report: "Abkhaz Question Threatens </F> Georgian Crisis of Power. Republic's Parliament Not Ready To  Compromise"]    [Text] Tbilisi -- The topic of Abkhazia continues to  dominate sessions of the Georgian parliament. Attitudes toward  the Russian leadership's statement about the introduction of CIS  peacemaking forces to the conflict zone have sharply divided the  top legislative organ into supporters and bitter opponents of  this step. This could lead to a crisis of power in the republic  and even to a possible change of political course.    The opinions held by deputies in different factions are  largely diametrically opposed. The Republicans, as before, are  insisting on a parliamentary debate on the issue of preserving  statehood, and on the legality of the agreements on Abkhazia  signed 4 April and 14 May. Republican deputy Ivlian Khaindrava  called them the "political and legal formulation of the results  of Georgia's military failures, which will directly and  unambiguously lead to the loss of Abkhazia."    The refusal by most parliamentarians to include these issues  on the agenda prompted a stormy reaction from the Republicans,  who staged a walkout and announced that they would be boycotting  the sessions. They were joined by deputies from the Merab  Kostav Society, who are insisting, aside from anything else, on  the abolition of the institution of head of state and a  transition to exclusively parliamentary rule.    But if some people are worried solely about the  Georgian-Abkhaz agreements that have been signed, others are  concerned about the position of a third party -- Russia.  People's Front leader Nodar Natadze, for instance, assesses the  great northern neighbor's peacemaking efforts merely as an  attempt to "quietly" seize Georgia's Black Sea coastline and to  federalize the republic into part of Russia....    Representatives of the parliamentary majority are also  talking about boycotting the work of the top legislative organ  of power. Roman Miminoshvili, deputy [head] of the parliamentary  commission for deputies' ethics, accused the opposition of  destructive actions, sabotage, and antistate debates leading to  the deepening of the crisis and drawing Georgia into war and  chaos, and directly stated that such a step is possible. Roin  Liparteliani, leader of the Agrarians, is not even ruling out  the possibility of parliament's dissolution.    In these circumstances, it is impossible to have a  constructive discussion of any documents on Abkhazia -- the  language of ultimatums is not helping at all. Zurab Zhvaniya,  general secretary of the Union of Georgian Citizens, even  proposed declaring a moratorium on open parliamentary debate of  the issues relating to Abkhazia. Will his appeal be heeded?    Georgian citizens have differing assessments of the question  of introducing CIS peacemaking troops to Abkhazia. According to  the latest opinion poll staged by the newspaper SVOBODNAYA  GRUZIYA, 62.6 percent of Tbilisi people do not see them as any  reliable guarantee of the safe return of refugees. Although  most nonetheless believe that the conflict cannot be resolved  without compromise. But it is the people's elected  representatives above all who will have to learn the art of  compromise. Otherwise, they may talk themselves into a new war.</p>

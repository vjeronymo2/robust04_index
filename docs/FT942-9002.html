			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Make Ecu a business currency, says think-tank The Ecu should be used as a parallel currency to allow business to deal in a single tender across Europe, a new paper by a leading rightwing think-tank argues today. The paper, published by the Institute of Economic Affairs, which influenced Baroness Thatcher during her term as prime minister, says that a parallel Ecu is needed by business given that monetary union has receded to a distant dream. The paper's authors, who have expressed these opinions before, stress there are now powerful economic reasons for a united, parallel currency. The kaleidoscope of national currencies has been calculated to cost European business Ecu15bn (Pounds 19.5bn), it says, with 55 per cent of companies agreeing that savings from a single currency could exceed 1.5 per cent of turnover. Recent European Commission res-earch suggests that many businesses already use the existing abstract Ecu measure in their transactions, with the Ecu bond market the fifth largest in Europe. A parallel currency need not entail any loss of political sovereignty, the paper says. The key to their scenario is a 'basket' Ecu, compiled from a weighted average of community currencies. This would require only minimal political agreement to introduce or manage, they argue, saying that notes and coins could be issued by national banks or even private currency boards, instead of the European Monetary Institute.

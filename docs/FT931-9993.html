			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Simon shares fall on contract warning THE SHARE price of Simon Engineering fell 20p to 119p yesterday on news that it would make a Pounds 5m loss on a Dollars 103m (Pounds 68.2m) contract. Analysts yesterday lowered their forecasts for the engineering and environmental group from between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m to between Pounds 6m and Pounds 7m. They also believe the final dividend will be passed, leaving a total down from 15.7p to 5p. Management was criticised because this was not the first time Simon had suffered cost over-runs on a paper mill contract. The latest problems relate to a contract to rebuild the world's largest liner board paper mill in Jacksonville, Florida. for Seminole Kraft, an arm of Stone Corporation. On the previous occasion, Stone was also the client, though Mr Alan Jarvis, Simon's finance director, said the group took over the Hoya contract in Germany when it acquired Holder Pamac Group in 1989. On the Jacksonville contract, Mr Jarvis said: 'We felt we had done all we could do to avoid this situation,' though he conceded that it had been 'poorly costed'. He added that Simon had lodged a 'substantial' claim with Stone over 'unagreed contract variations' where specifications had been altered during the course of the work. He said that 'substantial' meant more than 10 per cent of the value of the contract and that the two companies were currently in negotiations. Mr Jarvis said that as soon as a loss on a contract was recognised, it had to be written off, though he stressed that Simon was 'not in danger of breaching any of its banking covenants'. Simon said the Pounds 260m factory contract in Armenia, had been completed successfully.</p>

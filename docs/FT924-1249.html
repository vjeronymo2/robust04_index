			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Observer: Gafta's new pew After three moves in one year, the UK's grain and feed merchants have found a final resting place for Gafta, their trade association - a disused 150-year-old chapel on the outskirts of the City of London. Unfortunately, the symbolism of this week's grand opening was spoiled when John Gummer, Britain's saintly minister of agriculture, failed to turn up. He was detained on EC business and left it to one of his deputies, Earl Howe, to give the blessing.</p>

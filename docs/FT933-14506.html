			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Budget likely at end of November MR Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, confirmed in the Commons last night that the first unified budget was likely to be introduced 'at the end of November'. He also gave a further assurance that the time available for the finance bill to be scrutinised by MPs under the new procedure would be 'marginally increased'. Mr Nick Brown, a Labour treasury spokesman, feared that the timetable envisaged by the government for future years would result in the finance bill not being published until after Christmas with MPs being pressed to complete the committee stage before the Easter recess.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of World Taxation (7): A paler shade of green - Environment taxes lose some of their sting When the UK government published its long-awaited audit of its environmental performance, one of the notable omissions was its failure to introduce much-heralded taxes on energy and waste. The 650-point audit, published 10 days ago, commented on the UK's earlier commitment to 'take forward' European proposals for an energy tax. It said the government had concluded that the tax was 'neither appropriate nor necessary for the UK at this stage'. That response points to the cooling of recent enthusiasm for 'green' taxes in many industrialised countries, as the implications of the taxes have become clearer. In the past few years, European and North American governments have been particularly loud in vowing to use 'market mechanisms' such as taxes and permits to bring about environmental goals. Their fondness for these instruments followed two decades in which legislation was the main tool for cleaning up the environment. In those two decades, governments wished on themselves layers of environmental regulation at local, national and international level. Only then did the difficulties of enforcing these rules emerge, as well as the frequently high costs of complying. In contrast, financial instruments appeared to offer a simpler way of achieving environmental goals, with more predictable impacts on the economy. However, the two main international thrusts of environmental taxation in the past few years - on energy and on waste disposal - have proved controversial. So far, they have been implemented only in part. Initiatives for energy taxes were given impetus by the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, at which developed countries pledged to bring emissions of carbon dioxide - implicated in global warming - back to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The purpose of the taxes is to encourage industry and households to use energy more efficiently. However, many economists - such as Oxera, the Oxford-based forecasting group  -have argued that demand for energy responds little to changes in its price. Environmental pressure groups such as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace have appeared ambivalent, welcoming attempts to combat global warming, but suspicious that the taxes were motivated more by governments' need to raise money than by green concerns. Moreover, the proposed taxes have aroused fierce opposition from industrialists in many countries - they have complained that the taxes would harm competitiveness. President Clinton's proposals for an energy tax - the core of the US's initial plan to meet this target - were dropped last year in the face of fierce opposition from senators in oil-producing states. Proposals for a Europe-wide tax on energy, one of Europe's longest running and most-publicised environmental initiatives, have also stalled because of disagreements between countries with very different energy structures. Under the proposals, the energy tax would be based partly on fuels' carbon content. Oil and coal would be taxed more heavily than nuclear energy, which does not emit carbon. However, France, which derives most of its energy from nuclear power, objected that any tax on non-fossil fuels was unfair as they did not damage the atmosphere. The UK also protested at imposition of a uniform European tax on the grounds that it would burden different countries' industries unequally. Instead, in last year's Budget, the UK made clear it would go its own way in designing taxes. In imposing value added tax on household fuel for the first time, and in laying out plans for steadily rising road and motor fuel taxes, it claimed that it had opened the way for a coordinated European approach to energy taxes. The form of taxes could vary considerably from country to country, ministers argued. Whether this proves acceptable to other European Union members will take months to become clear - the issue still remains on the negotiating table. Pressure is on European countries to reach an agreement as they collectively ratified the Rio climate change convention at the end of last year, despite their failure to find a way to meet the targets. However, industrialists have commented that the UK suggestion fails to address the original worries that competitiveness and free trade could suffer from taxes. Similar problems have arisen in those European countries which are considering introducing taxes on waste disposal. The UK government, for example, has suggested imposing a levy on waste tipped into landfills (licensed rubbish dumps). The levy would encourage companies to use resources more efficiently and to recycle more waste. However, UK industrialists, who have criticised European recycling quotas, say that landfill taxes do not recognise that waste disposal costs will always vary widely between different countries. Differences in geology make different waste disposal methods appropriate, they say. According to waste industry estimates, the UK, which has many empty quarries suitable for conversion into landfill, has some of Europe's lowest landfill costs at between Pounds 6 and Pounds 18 a tonne, while Germany and Italy have some of the highest costs at between Pounds 40 and Pounds 60 a tonne. Taxes will erode this 'natural' competitive advantage, UK industrialists argue. The political difficulties which these proposals for taxes have encountered emphasise that some of politicians' enthusiasm for financial instruments may have been misplaced. The fact that the costs of a tax are evident before it is implemented, where the costs of regulation tend to emerge years afterwards, was one of the characteristics of green taxes which politicians have most praised. However, that very transparency means that green taxes are proving, even for their most enthusiastic champions, a political minefield.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REPLACEMENT TRAUMA CENTER SEEN POSSIBLE  </P> <P> As one of Orange County's four trauma centers prepares to drop out of the  nationally known but debt-ridden emergency network two days after Christmas,  several Orange County hospitals are reportedly considering filling the gap.  </P> <P> Although no hospital has yet signed up with the county as a trauma center,  administrators at several facilities have held "preliminary meetings" to  discuss the idea, county officials said. None of the hospitals are expected to  make a final decision until after the holidays, and any new trauma center would  have to be certified by the county.  </P> <P> "I haven't got anybody jumping up and saying they want to be a trauma center,"  said Betty O'Rourke, manager of the county's Emergency Medical Services, who in  mid-October wrote to 10 north central county hospitals inviting them to start  one.  </P> <P> But O'Rourke confirmed that she has had discussions with some of the hospitals.  And sources added one hospital is "'seriously considering" the invitation,  while two others have expressed cautious interest.  </P> <P> Trauma centers are specially staffed and equipped to offer faster and more  sophisticated medical care than standard emergency rooms to people suffering  from severe, possibly life-threatening injuries, such as from car crashes,  falls, shootings, and stabbings.  </P> <P> However, trauma centers throughout Southern California have lost millions of  dollars -- an estimated $5 million last year in Orange County -- because often  the patients who receive the costly care have no medical insurance.  </P> <P> Still, the prestige of offering landmark medical care appears to be sparking  the interest of some Orange County hospitals.  </P> <P> "The prestige is still there," a county official said. "You get hero points  from your colleagues for providing that level of care."  </P> <P> Further, the costs could be offset by the "good public relations" value of such  specialized care and the promise of millions of dollars in new tobacco tax  money soon to be distributed to trauma hospitals, O'Rourke said.  </P> <P> Among the hospitals that have expressed cautious interest in trauma care are  173-bed Los Alamitos Medical Center on the Orange County-Los Angeles County  border and 141-bed Humana Hospital-Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Administrators at the two hospitals noted that although they have not rejected  the option of trauma care, neither have they seriously examined its costs.  </P> <P> "Right now we have to analyze it very carefully," said Los Alamitos associate  administrator Charlene Robinson. But, she added, "we haven't ruled it out." Los  Alamitos officials still haven't broached the idea to staff physicians or their  parent corporation in Los Angeles and probably will not do so until after  Christmas, she said.  </P> <P> 'Might Consider It'  </P> <P> At Humana, executive director Mark Aanonson said: "We don't close our mind to  anything. If they (county officials) had something in mind that might be  workable, we might consider it."  </P> <P> Aanonson acknowledged the public relations potential of having a trauma center.  But he added that staffing and financing a trauma center probably have too many  negatives. "All the money you have to pay out for standby fees and stipends (to  trauma doctors) plus the occasional $200,000 to $300,000 bad debt, it's not  really attractive," he said.  </P> <P> One source said 347-bed St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in  Fullerton is weighing the idea, but hospital president Paul Viviano adamantly  denied that. He said he and his staff had looked at O'Rourke's letter, given  the idea "serious consideration" and soundly rejected it.  </P> <P> "We're not interested at this time," Viviano said. "Not unless the governor or  the supervisors are going to provide a Christmas present -- lots of additional  reimbursement."  </P> <P> The specialized centers are expensive because they are staffed 24 hours a day  with a trauma surgeon and anesthesiologists, with neurosurgeons and other  specialists on call. When the system works, paramedics speed badly injured  accident victims to a trauma center for computerized tomography scans, surgery  or other lifesaving care. Receiving the proper diagnosis and care in the first  hour after a severe injury is crucial to the patient's chance of survival,  studies have shown.  </P> <P> Orange County's network of trauma centers was a national model when it began in  1980. It opened with five centers, and for the last six years has operated with  four -- UCI Medical Center in Orange, Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center  in Mission Viejo, United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana and Fountain Valley  Regional Hospital and Medical Center. But in recent years, hospital officials  have complained that they can't afford to provide the care. When Fountain  Valley's directors decided to close the trauma center permanently Dec. 27, they  blamed losses from uninsured patients that hit $1 million last year and were  expected to triple in 1990.  </P></p>

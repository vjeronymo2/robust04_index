			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sabina Augustynowicz: "Hopes for Growth; Draft </F> Economic Program for 1994-1997" -- first paragraph published in  boldface; passages within slantlines published in italics]    [Text] For the first time since 1989, the Central  Planning Administration [CUP] has prepared a four-year program  for Poland's social and economic development until the year  1997. The government's preferential treatment of exporters,  investors, as well as state protectionism in some branches of  the economy, are supposed to make the program successful. On  the other hand, the program's implementation could be impeded by  the lifting of earning controls in state-owned enterprises.    "We have analyzed three versions of the program: the  warning option, the extensive-development option, and the basic  option -- which is difficult but implementable" -- said  Miroslaw Pietrewicz, a minister and CUP's chief. "We  decided in favor of proposing the third option to the Council of  Ministers. The decision was determined by the domestic  situation -- unemployment, obsolete industrial machinery,  indebtedness by enterprises which last year reached 550 trillion  zlotys [Z], and the crisis of public finances. Poland's debts  have reached the level of Z1,400 trillion. To service the debt  this year, we will need Z112 trillion. On the other hand, we  have reported an economic growth of some extent, even though it  is still fragile and uncertain. We are also hopeful concerning  the economic revival in the West. But generally speaking, the  starting point for the program's implementation is  difficult" -- CUP's chief added.    The program is based on the assumption of growth in GDP by  22  percent over four years, as well as an increase in consumption  generally by 15 percent, and an increase in investment of around  40 percent. There is also an assumption of approximately a  1.5-percent yearly increase in real wages and salaries.  According to M. Pietrewicz, this kind of growth is dependent  first of all on a speeding up of the rate of ownership  transformations and economic modernization. But investments in  enterprises are linked with the need to save money by those  enterprises and to devote savings to production capital.  "It is hard to say whether we will be successful in  that" -- the minister stated. "Investing money in  investments is more risky than investing in bonds."    The version of the program suggested by CUP requires an  intensification of exports. So it is based on a widening of  consumption markets for Polish merchandise beyond the  traditional markets. But the program also envisages  difficulties in eliminating the negative foreign-trade balance.  Modernization of the economy will require an increase in the  imports of modern technologies. So the state is supposed to  provide clearly preferential treatment to exporters, for  instance by providing insurance for risks of credit exports --  this according to assurances received from CUP. Apart from  that, state protectionism will be visible particularly in large  economic branches such as mining, steelworks, the defense  industry, and the energy industry. When asked whether state  intervention and protectionist policies will not deter foreign  investors -- whose involvement will largely determine the  program's success -- Minister Halina Wasilewska replied:  "It is not true that foreign capital invests mainly in  those areas where there is full liberalization. On the contrary  -- investors demand outright protectionism, as in the form of  tax or customs-duties breaks."    CUP also makes the success of the proposed program for  social  and economic development in Poland dependent on a gradual  abandonment of earning controls. According to the CUP chief,  the sudden elimination of such controls would cause equally  sudden consequences. Italy serves as an example -- over there,  such a step resulted in a breakdown of the economic situation.  It is a complicated issue. The controls and popiwek  [earning-control legislation] should be eliminated, but not yet.  First, principles of indexation of benefits should be changed,  enterprises should be commercialized, and the issue of companies  with a strong, monopoly position on the market, resolved; a  special commission should also be established which would deal  with earning issues. Otherwise, the implementation of the  program proposed by CUP would be very hard. Miroslaw Pietrewicz  also expressed his hope that thinking along economic lines will  prevail.    If the implementation of the program is successful, then we  can expect 1997 expenditures on the educational system to be  similar to those of 1989 (it is the same case with health  services); we can also expect 1-1.2 percent of GDP to be devoted  to science, 3 percent to the defense system, as well as a rate  of unemployment which would not exceed 14 percent of the  professionally active population of Poland.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Mortgage bond issue by Banco Santander BANCO Santander, the Spanish bank, has launched a Pta13.5bn issue of mortgage-backed bonds in the Spanish market, the first under Spain's new securitisation law which has clarified tax problems facing issuers of mortgage-backed debt. Banco Santander had already issued two mortgage-backed deals under the previous law, using a different structure. The bonds have a semi-annual coupon of 10 1/4 per cent and mature on June 30 2010, but are expected to have an average life of 5.7 years. The mortgage loans represent 47.15 per cent of the current value of the properties on which they are secured. The bonds are rated AA by Iberating, Standard &amp; Poor's Spanish subsidiary.</p>

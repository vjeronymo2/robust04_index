			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Isosceles to review trading strategy ISOSCELES, the heavily indebted parent of the Gateway food retail chain, confirmed yesterday that it would review its financial structure and was seeking a new chief executive. After a board meeting yesterday it said that it was reviewing its trading strategy with the help of management consultants, and would then consider 'the appropriateness of the present group financial structure'. The statement was seen as an implicit admission that a further restructuring of the group's finances was necessary, only weeks after the last refinancing was approved by shareholders in October. The group, formed by the Pounds 2bn leveraged buy-out of Gateway in 1989, now has debt of Pounds 1.2bn. As well as completing two refinancings the group has lost two chief executives since the original buy-out. Mr David Smith, who led the buy-out, left in September 1991. In October this year Mr Bob Willett suddenly resigned as chief executive of Gateway. Isosceles also admitted that Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes had been only a stop-gap chief executive of Gateway after Mr Willett's departure. It said that when Mr Mitchell-Innes became Isosceles' chief executive in September 1991, after Mr Smith's departure, it was agreed he would leave in 1993 to devote more time to other commitments. When Mr Willett left the two chief executive roles were combined, and Mr Mitchell-Innes will stay until a new person is appointed. However, observers felt that Isosceles would find it hard to appoint a credible chief executive before its financial problems had been addressed. They noted that Asda, another food retailer, had taken months to appoint Mr Archie Norman as chief executive and he had only come after a rights issue had been arranged.</p>

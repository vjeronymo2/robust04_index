			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Hundreds of thousands of Serbs celebrated their national day in the troubled  Yugoslav province of Kosovo, but the region's ethnic Albanian majority  boycotted the festival. In one of the biggest gatherings seen in Yugoslavia  since it was founded in 1918, Serbs packed the plains around Pristina, the  capital of Kosovo, for the 600th anniversary of a battle against Turkish  invaders. The celebrants came from all over Yugoslavia, some from North America  and Australia. Kosovo, the heart of medieval Serbia, is today an impoverished  southern province adjoining Albania. The Orthodox Christian Serbs are a small  minority there and claim they are harassed by the predominantly Muslim ethnic  Albanians.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HIGH-TECH SALES TO E. EUROPE EXPECTED;  </P> <P> BUSH REVIEWING RECOMMENDATIONS AS NATIONS SHED COMMUNIST DOMINATION  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, in a move to help East European countries, is ready to  ease restrictions on sales of high-technology computers and other  telecommunications equipment, officials said today.  </P> <P> "The political and military environment is changing . . . . The situation is  different today than it was a year ago," said White House spokesman Marlin  Fitzwater.  </P> <P> He said recommendations for easing the controls, made Friday at a meeting of  the National Security Council, are under final review by President Bush.  </P> <P> Bush announced last month that he favored a relaxation of some of the  restrictions on high-tech exports into Warsaw Pact nations.  </P> <P> Fitzwater called the proposal developed in response to that appeal "a prudent  change . . . that will not jeopardize strategic interests."  </P> <P> American experts are in London beginning discussions on a joint approach with  British officials.  </P> <P> The discussions are in preparation for a meeting in Paris in mid-February of  Cocom, the coordination committee for multilateral export control. There, the  United States hopes to work out details of what kind of equipment will be  cleared and how much of it.  </P> <P> Cocom, which includes all 16 NATO countries except Iceland, plus Japan and  Australia, attempts to coordinate Western deliveries of technology to Eastern  countries. The United States has been among the most reluctant to provide high  technology to allies of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The countries likely to be assisted include Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia,  all of which have shed Communist domination and are adopting capitalistic  approaches to their weak economies.  </P> <P> The meeting in Paris is designed to adopt uniform rules to guide technology  transfers. In this respect, the Administration's decision to liberalize  restrictions could be balanced against the more eager approaches of some other  Cocom members and produce a compromise.  </P> <P> The net result, however, would be to deliver better computers and  telecommunications equipment to members of the Eastern Bloc, provided  semi-sensitive technology is not then turned over to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said the decision made at the National Security Council meeting  applied directly only to Eastern Europe and not to the Soviet Union. But, the  officials said, the principle -- aiding countries as they adopt Western-style  economies -- could eventually be extended to Moscow.  </P> <P> Cocom decisions are taken by consensus, and the 17 members try to act in  unison. Still, if the United States had held out against liberalization, there  was always a chance one or several of the other countries "would go off on  their own in this time of extraordinary change," a U.S. official said.  </P> <P> "There is some difference of view how far and how fast we should go," he said.  </P></p>

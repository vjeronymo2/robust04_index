			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Majority satisfied with NHS, researchers say TWO THIRDS of people appear to be satisfied with the way the National Health Service is run, according to a survey published today by the King's Fund Institute, the independent health-service think tank. Fewer than a fifth are dissatisfied. Researchers from the King's Fund and Glasgow University say the survey, carried out among 2,165 people in February, shows 87 per cent of patients satisfied with their general practitioner and only 8 per cent dissatisfied. NHS hospitals did less well, with 64 per cent satisfied with in-patient services and 60 per cent with out-patient services. Three quarters wanted cuts in waiting lists for non-emergency operations. A reduction in waiting times for appointments with hospital doctors was a close second. There was also concern about hospital casualty departments and the general condition of hospital buildings. An article published today in the British Medical Journal says evidence from this and other surveys suggests that public dissatisfaction with the NHS may have peaked in 1990 and fallen last year. It says that may reflect people's experience of improved health services but is more likely to be a result of improved news management by the government and a softening of its image after the replacement of Mrs Thatcher by Mr Major. Provisional waiting-list figures published yesterday by the Department of Health show the number of patients waiting for hospital treatment for more than two years fell to 1,640 at the end of March, down from more than 50,000 a year ago. The fall reflects the introduction of the Patient's Charter this week, guaranteeing a maximum wait of two years for treatment once on a waiting list.</p>

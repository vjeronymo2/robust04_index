			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Equity Markets: Other Markets Markets will be keeping a wary eye on the European foreign ministers' special Gatt meeting on Thursday. Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities commented: 'As the negotiations move into higher gear, there will be a whole series of special meetings which will probably come out with what looks like bad news. The good news will be saved for the the end of the process.' FRANKFURT German stock market professionals have been winding clients up ahead of Thursday's Bundesbank meeting which, they say, should bring another cut in interest rates. This should excite more interest in the banks, already in the spotlight as their 10-month results reporting season continues after last week's Commerzbank progress report. Press conferences are scheduled by BHF Bank on Tuesday, and Dresdner and Bayernhypo on Thursday. MILAN The market waits for the pricing of the Credito Italiano privatisation due by Saturday. The Ferruzzi and Montedison shareholders meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday are expected to approve the share capital increases and restructuring plans. AMSTERDAM Third-quarter results are due on Thursday from ING, the financial services group whose shares soared to a record high early last month after the government sold its near-7 per cent stake. STOCKHOLM Nine-month figures come today from Atlas Copco, the tool manufacturing group. UBS is forecasting a 17 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, to SKr875m from last year's SKr751m. TOKYO Further technical selling is expected to depress shares ahead of the December 10 settlement for stock futures and options. Although the Bank of Japan last week lowered short-term money market rates, investors will remain wary of further arbitrage selling and margin unwinding unless the government expresses its support for share prices. MADRID Tomorrow's final deadline for agreement in the social pact negotiations is expected to remove the uncertainty which has made for a volatile market in recent weeks.</p>

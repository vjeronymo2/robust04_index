			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The 60th session of the OAU Ministerial Council  entered its fifth day today. Almost all the points on the  agenda have been discussed. Our camera was present at the news  conference given by the session's official spokesman to  representatives of Tunisian and foreign media.    [Unidentified correspondent] The OAU Ministerial Council, in  its plenary session, which started yesterday and continued  through the night until 0100 today, discussed a number of issues  related mainly to the Lockerbie affair and the developments of  the conflict between the Libyan Jamahiriyah and a number of  Western states. It also discussed the African states' stance  regarding the results of the recent GATT talks, in addition to  the discussion of the special report on Africa's participation  in the world summit on social development that will be convened  in the capital of Denmark in 1995.    The spokesman said that on the sidelines of the meetings, a  special committee continued its efforts to bridge the gap  between the parties to the conflict in Rwanda by meeting each  party separately and listening to proposals of both the  representatives of the Rwandan Government and the Rwandan  National Front. The committee, the membership of which consists  of Tunisia, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Zaire, Zambia and Kenya,  held another meeting this morning to discus the proposals of  both the parties. The formulating committee today started  drafting the resolutions and recommendations which will be  submitted to the Ministerial Council for approval.    In his reply to a question by a reporter, the session's  official spokesman said the OAU Ministerial Council will  conclude its meetings tomorrow evening. [passage omitted]</p>

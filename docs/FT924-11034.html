			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Caricom faces its moment of truth - Inability to create a valid customs union could spell disaster IN 19 years of limited progress towards the creation of a regional common market, the Caribbean Economic Community now faces its moment of truth. At an extraordinary summit starting today, community leaders will, in effect, decide whether or not the group can survive. They must establish if they can create a valid customs union, which all members agree is a prerequisite for the elusive common market. The community, made up of 13 English-speaking countries, has been trying to create the customs union for the past three years. Now there are veiled warnings from technocrats and business leaders that little hope exists for any meaningful integration of regional economies if it does not get it right this time. Caricom could disintegrate. All members agree on the need for a customs union, but the community is riven by differences over new tariff levels, and whether changes should be made to the regime already implemented by some countries. Problems have been compounded by perceived pressure from the US and international financial institutions for large tariff cuts. The common external tariff imposes low rates of duty on imports not competing with goods produced within the community, but sets high rates on any imports likely to injure domestic industry. Under the tariff, the highest rate of duty within the community is 45 per cent, the lowest 5 per cent. This replaced a structure in which tariffs ranged from 5 to 70 per cent. Rates differ where the imports are raw materials or finished products, with agricultural products given protection, while inputs for agriculture are subject to low tariffs. Some governments, such as Jamaica, say the tariff levels must be cut because they are out of step with global tendencies to deregulated trade. Jamaica's proposal for the then highest rate to be cut to 20 per cent started the debate within Caricom and led to next week's summit. Other countries argue tariff rates are higher than those they have been using, and must be reduced because they are inflationary. Mr George Price, premier of Belize, says the tariff rates must stay because any change would hit small, open economies like his. He is willing to consider tariff cuts at some stage, but gradually and on a set timetable. Other countries backing retention of the tariff levels say their industries need protection. Many depend heavily on customs revenue to support their fiscal budgets; some argue than any, even marginal, tariff-rate cuts will set back their efforts to balance their budgets. The narrow tax base of most Caricom countries does not offer any alternative source of revenue. The argument for retention of the tariff levels is supported by the region's business leaders. Reducing the levels, they say, will cause extensive dislocation and business closures in many countries in the community. The business leaders recently concluded some governments were having a 'defeatist reaction' to criticism of the tariff levels, and were acting with 'indecent haste' because of external pressure. Evidence exists that the community is being pressed from outside. Mr Erskine Sandiford, prime minister of Barbados, has attributed a recent difficulty his administration faced in concluding credit agreements with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank to their wishes that the highest tariff be cut at once to 20 per cent. The US objection to Caricom's tariff levels is uncompromising. Mr Myles Frechette, assistant US trade representative for Latin America and the Caribbean, has repeatedly criticised the community. 'One of our concerns is that the highest tariff rate is 45 per cent,' he said. 'In Central and South America, the maximum is 20 per cent.' The leaders at today's summit will worsen their problems if they attempt a compromise filled with derogations, satisfying neither regional nor external critics. Failure to find a solution will put the region's fragile economies at a disadvantage in a world moving to deregulated trade and trade blocs. Ironically, the summit was called to discuss not the common tariff but a report by a commission headed by Sir Sridath Ramphal, former Commonwealth secretary-general, on ways to integrate community economies further. There will be little hope for further integration unless differences over tariff levels are resolved.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "China, Low On Jet Fuel, Is Given A </F> Foreign Lift"]    [Text] China will set up a partnership with foreign oil  firms to ensure enough aviation fuel for its sharply expanding  air fleets.    Years of robust growth in air travel have created a shortage  not only of pilots and air controllers, but of aviation fuel.    Indeed, last year airports in a dozen cities including  Fuzhou, Harbin and Chongqing had to restrict fuel use, forcing  flights to be delayed or cancelled.    Now, major construction of refueling facilities is under way  across China to boost aviation fuel supply and shipping  capacity. And overseas oil investors, eager to pry open the  lucrative Chinese aviation fuel market, will take an active part.    To accomplish this the China Aviation Oil Supply Corp  (CAOSC), the country's sole supplier of fuel, is preparing to  turn three of its seven regional branches into Sino-foreign  joint ventures.    Letters of intent were agreed on late last year for setting  up joint ventures with British Petroleum in North China,  France's ELF in East China, and the Netherlands' Vitol in  Central and South China.    The three regional branches, which account for 80 per cent  of  the corporation's profits and half of its employees, are  responsible for supplying fuel to China's busiest air traffic  areas.    Bai Zhijian, president of CAOSC told Business Weekly that  poor refueling capacity and congested railway transport have  crimped the supply of aviation oil, posing more obstacles to  speedy development of civil aviation.    The CAOSC's bold strategy is imperative if the huge amount  of  capital needed to modernize the supply and storage system is to  be raised, Bai said.    Foreign know-how and managerial skills will also help make  the corporation more competitive, he said.    "The co-operation projects will enter the substantive stage  if we get final State approval," Bai said without elaboration.    But he did say that Chinese will control the ventures'  tangible and intangible assets like market access and good will  while the foreign firms will put up cash but will hold smaller  stakes.    CAOSC is seeking 4 billion yuan ($460 million) from  investors  to upgrade old refueling equipment and build new systems  throughout China by the turn of the century.    Last year, the completion of nine oil depots, like the one  at  Beijing Capital Airport, augmented storage capacity by one-third  to 840,000 cubic metres. New oil pipelines with a total length  of 37 kilometres were also put into service.    "But the current storage capacity is still far short of  demand," Bai stressed.    So high on this year's schedule is construction of bases in  Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Beihai to handle imported fuel,  which is surging in to fill the gap in domestic supplies.    Each base will consist of oil jetties, pipelines and depots,  and is tailored for the long-term needs of the country's  northern, eastern, southern and southwestern regions,  respectively.    Bai said that work on the Tianjin base will begin first, in  June. It will involve building a 140,000-cubic metre oil  transfer farm in Tianjin Harbour, burying a 52-kilometre  pipeline to the oil depot at Tianjin Airport, and laying another  132 kilometre pipeline to Beijing Capital Airport.</p>

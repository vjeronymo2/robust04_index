			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (14): Revitalising a stagnant market - The future for mobile data is in niche applications The decision this autumn by the Department of Trade and Industry to invite bids for the UK's fifth mobile data licence caused amazement in an industry that has had to familiarise itself with unpleasant surprises since its inception five years ago. 'Anyone applying for a licence now would have to be crazy,' was the reaction of one industry executive to the DTI decision to increase competition in a market where customers are today only a tenth of what was predicted three years ago. The three existing operators - Ram Mobile Data, Cognito and Paknet - only have 5,000-10,000 customers between them compared to industry predictions in 1991 that a market of 100,000 would have developed by the end of this year. The high aims were based on the assumption that mobile data would breach a huge market of business users. Any traveller away from the office, it was argued, would want to retrieve information from an office database or immediately input new data, a successful sale, for example, rather than waiting to return to the office. Instead, it appears the future for mobile data is in developing a number of niche applications, although not all of them popular. For instance, Ram Mobile Data's terminals are used by traffic wardens in a number of London councils who issue a total of 5m parking tickets each year. The wardens can send and receive details about illegally parked vehicles far more efficiently this way than by using alternatives such as a cellular telephone. Other niche applications include emergency organisations such as the fire and ambulance services, parcel delivery companies and Trafficmaster, the UK traffic monitoring system which uses the Paknet network to relay signals containing information about traffic conditions collected from roadside monitors to the company's control centre. The system then uses a paging network to carry the same information on to its subscribers in their cars. The radio-paging industry is casting around for new approaches to avoid being superceded by cellular operators who are offering increasingly competitively-priced handsets and tariff packages. Aside from initiatives such as Trafficmaster, paging operators are looking at two ways to revitalise a stagnant market. One is to maintain paging's price advantage over cellular telephones by introducing new, cheaper tariff packages. The other is to make the pager a more sophisticated product that offers similar services to a mobile data network. This autumn has seen the launch by BT and Mercury - two of the UK's four paging operators of a new kind of paging service first developed in Sweden. The market certainly needs this kind of initiative. In the past year the number of subscribers has grown by only about 780,000. Mercury estimates the new services will add between 100,000 and 200,000 new subscribers. The service, known as CPP or Calling Party Pays, is an attempt to widen the audience for paging services to include consumer as well as the business user. CPP services eliminate one-off connection charges and monthly subscription leaving the user only having to pay the price of the pager. The operator recoups the revenue lost on connection and rental charges by charging callers a premium price for leaving a message for the subscriber. Currently calls to pagers are billed at the standard local rate for calls. BT has given its service an extra twist by introducing it with a wristwatch pager - the first in the UK - manufactured by Swatch. It hopes the pager will deliver the same kind of youthful audience drawn to the One-2-One cellular service, launched last year. The second new innovation likely to reach the UK soon is the launch of services based on a new, digital technology that will enable operators to offer a service that will deliver longer messages at higher speeds than is now possible. In addition, the new service known as Ermes (European radio message system) enables users to send and access information from office databases while they are on the move. Aside from teething problems, such as the discovery that in Germany Ermes causes interference to television pictures, it is already available in France and will soon be offered in other European countries. It is likely to further add to the competition faced by the UK's mobile data operators.</p>

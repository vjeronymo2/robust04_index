			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS ON WEEKEND TV  </P> <P> With the NBA regular season still six days away, football has the sports  television weekend almost all to itself, with horse racing and hockey in the  periphery.  </P> <P> USC and UCLA fans may well have to summon plenty of patience today as they  watch their troubled teams. The Todd Marinovich-less Trojans meet Arizona State  at 12:30 p.m. on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42. UCLA (3-4), seeking to avoid  back-to-back losing seasons for the first time since 1964-65, plays host to  Oregon State for a 3:30 p.m. Prime Ticket telecast. The Beavers' 1-6 record may  be of little solace to Bruin fans, who recall Oregon State's 18-17 upset win  over UCLA last season.  </P> <P> Both Notre Dame and Miami (Fla.), which met in the finale of their  often-contentious series last Saturday, are on the air again this week. The No.  3 Fighting Irish face Pittsburgh live at 5 p.m. on ESPN with an 8:30 p.m.  delayed broadcast on SportsChannel, while the No. 8 Hurricanes visit Texas Tech  at 10 a.m. on Prime Ticket.  </P> <P> In other telecasts involving teams ranked in the Associated Press Top 25: No.  12 Florida State plays host to LSU (9:30 a.m., TBS); No. 22 Oklahoma meets No.  10 Colorado (11 a.m., Channels 2 and 8) and No. 23 Arizona faces Washington  State (7 p.m., Prime Ticket).  </P> <P> With the Raiders having a bye and the Rams playing on Monday night against the  Pittsburgh Steelers, Los Angeles-area viewers will have three NFL games to  choose from Sunday afternoon. That is a rarity in these parts because NFL rules  permit only two Sunday afternoon telecasts on those days when either the Rams  or Raiders are playing at home.  </P> <P> KCBS Channel 2 begins an NFL doubleheader at 10 a.m. with the underachieving  Minnesota Vikings (1-5), visiting the Green Bay Packers (2-4).  </P> <P> The NFL's last two undefeated teams both play at 1 p.m. The New York Giants  (6-0) play host to the Washington Redskins (4-2) at 1 p.m. on Channels 2 and 8.  The Giants defeated the Redskins 24-20 on Oct. 14. The San Francisco 49ers  (6-0) seek to extend their winning streak to 15 when they face the Cleveland  Browns (2-5) at 1 p.m. on Channels 4 and 36.  </P> <P> One of their most intense coaching feuds of recent years gets another renewal  when Sam Wyche's Cincinnati Bengals (5-2) meet Jerry Glanville's Atlanta  Falcons (2-4) at 5 p.m. on TNT. This is the first regular season game between  the two since Cincinnati's 61-7 victory over Houston last December when  Glanville was still coaching the Oilers. STEVEN HERBERT  </P></p>

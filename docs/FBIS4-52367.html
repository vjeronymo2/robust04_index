			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the National Army of Democratic </F> Kampuchea [NADK] spokesman on 5 May; place not given -- read by  announcer]    [Text] I. On 4 May, the French press agency AFP urgently  circulated a misleading report saying that the National Army of  Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] had raped scores of women and then  killed them. The NADK spokesman categorically rejects the  French press agency's disgusting and base propaganda, which  arises from nasty and dark political motives.    II. The NADK's morality and virtue is far different -- as  different as sky and earth -- from that of the communist  Vietnamese lackeys and their alliance, with the United States,  France, and Australia acting as proxies. The Cambodian nation  and people are well aware that it is the communist Vietnamese  puppets and the U.S., French, and Australian lackey puppets who  are the bandits and criminals and who have shot and beheaded  people without mercy. They have also raped and executed women,  elderly people, children, pregnant women, and women who are  giving birth to their babies in accordance with the fascist and  barbarous nature of their masters.    As for the NADK, they are the people's children; they have  arduously struggled and shared weal and woe with the nation and  people to defend their localities and prevent the enemies of the  nation and people from acting at will. The NADK has never done  the disgusting, base, and barbarous things that are being  slanderously alleged in this propaganda.    Look, why do the Cambodian nation and people support  Democratic Kampuchea? Why do the Cambodian nation and people  oppose the communist Vietnamese and U.S. puppets and their  masters?    III. It may be asked: What is behind the slanderous reports  carried by the propaganda machines of France and the alliance?  They have painstakingly acted in this way for the following  reasons:    A. They are attempting to slander and discredit the NADK,  which is vigorously supported and assisted by the Cambodian  nation and people in both the northern and western parts of  Cambodia -- presently the scene of fighting against invading  forces from the two-headed Phnom Penh government and abroad. In  view of this situation, the communist Vietnamese and their  alliance are extremely anxious. They have been anxiously  running around. They have ordered their lackeys to kneel at the  feet of the communist Vietnamese and ask them to send troops to  keep the puppets from collapsing entirely. Along with this,  they have intensified their political and diplomatic maneuvers  and stepped up these accusations, which are part of their  propaganda and psychological warfare.    B. They have strived to commit this slander with the aim of  further denigrating us and instigating conflicts within  Cambodia's national community. This will enable them to  intervene without difficulty and further stir up and inflame the  war of aggression, thereby allowing them to come in and secure  their respective vested interests.    This is what they call respect for human rights and the  people's right to self-determination. They are the criminals  and warmongers, (?joining) the communist Vietnamese to do away  with the Cambodian nation and race. Yet they have hurled  accusations against the NADK, which has arduously struggled to  protect the people and nation and prevent the criminals from  acting at will.    This is clear evidence that the alliance -- with the United  States, France, and Australia as proxies -- does not want  Cambodia to achieve national reconciliation, national  compromise, and peace. They have actively launched their  propaganda and sought all available military, political,  diplomatic, propaganda, and psychological means to inflame the  war further and destroy Democratic Kampuchea at all costs.    IV. Nevertheless, concrete experiences since August 1993  have clearly demonstrated and brought into broad daylight that  even though the communist Vietnamese puppets and the American  and French puppets have been combined; even though millions of  dollars have been spent to buy guns, tanks, and so on from the  communist Vietnamese and Russia; and even though they have  strived to provide assistance in the technical field and in  psychological warfare, they can never prevail over the nation,  people, and NADK. We have joined forces to carry out the  struggle to crush the invasion by the communist Vietnamese and  their puppets and the alliance and its lackey puppets, causing  them to scatter and suffer a shameful defeat.    They are currently being forced by the nation and people as  well as the king to terminate their war and accept his majesty's  five-point policy to achieve genuine national reconciliation and  unity, thereby allowing Cambodia to restore peace and survive.    [Signed] The NADK spokesman    [Dated] 5 May 1994</p>

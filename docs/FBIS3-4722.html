			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kim Chong-tu] </F>   [Text] The government decided to revise its national  defense objective, which is a long-term policy directing  national defense, by inserting a section on "contributing to  world peace."    Until now, the government has only attached importance to  contributing to security and peace in Northeast Asia because it  regarded North Korea as its main enemy. The government has now  expressed the will to also contribute actively to world peace.  This is worth paying attention to.    A high-ranking Defense Ministry official said on 27  February:  "Our national defense goal is to `defend the country from an  invasion, guarantee peaceful reunification, and contribute to  regional security and peace.' We are actively examining adding  a section on contributing to world peace."    As soon as such a revision is approved by the president, the  Defense Ministry plans to insert this into the national defense  white paper sometime this autumn. A Defense Ministry official  commented: "The government has started to make great  contributions in efforts to achieve world peace, such as  dispatching our forces to Somalia upon the request of the United  Nations last year. Our national defense goal has to be revised  as it is limited to regional security and peace. Inserting a  section on contributing to world peace in our national defense  goal displays the growth of our national strength. This will  also play a positive role in enhancing our international  status." This official added: "Our government's military  diplomacy will also be greatly enhanced through the revision of  our national defense goal. In particular, through good  neighborly military relations with other countries, we will work  to take the initiative in achieving peace and security on the  Korean peninsula."</p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY SEEKS STATE FUNDS TO COMBAT MEASLES EPIDEMIC;  </P> <P> VACCINATIONS: SUPERVISORS APPROVE A DECLARATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAZARD IN  ASKING FOR $300,000 TO FIGHT THE DISEASE.  </P> <P> In the latest effort to combat Los Angeles County's worst-ever measles  epidemic, the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a Declaration of Public  Health Hazard that allows the county to request $300,000 from the state for  broadened immunization measures.  </P> <P> Officials from the county Department of Health Services said they will seek  funds from the state Department of Health Services to increase vaccine  supplies, maintain extended clinic hours for immunization, and expand media and  community outreach efforts.  </P> <P> John Dunajski, assistant chief of California immunization for the state health  department, indicated that the request would be viewed favorably. "Los Angeles  County is definitely an applicant that will be seriously reviewed. I'm sure  they will receive some funding," he said in a telephone interview. "The state  did make available $1.2 million for immunization programs."  </P> <P> The county measles outbreak this year has struck 1,500 people and killed six,  including four under age 15, officials from the county Department of Health  Services said. This contrasts with a reported 1,202 cases and 17 deaths last  year. Two people died of measles in 1988.  </P> <P> More than 1,800 cases of measles have been reported statewide this year,  including 24 deaths, Dunajski said.  </P> <P> "Obviously, the disease is going at a much greater rate than last year," county  health Director Robert C. Gates said.  </P> <P> Insufficient funding has hamstrung past attempts to curb the disease, health  officials said.  </P> <P> "Basically, it's been a continuous outbreak since 1987," said Dr. Stephen  Waterman, chief of the Health Department's communicable disease control unit.  "It is the longest-running measles outbreak in the country, unfortunately."  </P> <P> Measles, also known as red measles or rubeola, is among the most contagious  viruses. It usually starts with coughing and a high fever and can cause  dehydration, diarrhea or inflammation of the brain. Although the disease  usually disappears after about five days, measles can kill if unchecked.  </P> <P> After unanimous approval of the declaration Tuesday, Supervisor Kenneth Hahn  urged the director of the Department of Health Services to provide measles  immunizations at all of the county's 42 health centers.  </P> <P> "We are having the worst measles epidemic in the history of the county," said  Hahn, who represents the 2nd District. "We should insist that the health  department open up all of its clinics every night and on Saturdays so our  children and babies will get prevention. It's a deadly disease that is at  epidemic proportions."  </P> <P> Twenty-three of the clinics now offer vaccinations, Gates said.  </P> <P> "We have already opened up many of our clinics" to those seeking immunizations,  he said. "But whether each and every one of them should be open is something  I'll have to look into."  </P> <P> Gates and Waterman said many of the clinics are in areas of the county hit  hardest by the epidemic, such as South-Central Los Angeles, El Monte and East  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Many of these areas will also be focal points for the county's latest  anti-measles campaign, Waterman said.  </P> <P> "We're pulling together billboards and posters, many of them in Spanish," the  physician said. "Many of the people hit by the disease are Latinos."  </P> <P> Asian and Pacific Island ethnic groups and children of low-income families have  also been hit hard by the epidemic.  </P> <P> In addition, other locations throughout the state have been plagued by measles  outbreaks, including San Diego and San Bernardino counties. Reports of measles  cases have also skyrocketed in Alameda County in the Bay Area.  </P></p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Bush risks China's wrath with Taiwan jet sale US PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday wooed voters in Texas by announcing his decision to back the sale of up to 150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan. But although the announcement provides a welcome boost to General Dynamics, whose Fort Worth plant manufactures the F-16 aircraft, it offers a perplexing reversal to some key elements in the Bush admin-istration's established foreign policy. Since a 1982 agreement negotiated in part by then Vice-President Bush, the US has scaled down its arms sales to Taiwan. With Mr Bush in the White House, the administration has followed a policy that favoured closer ties to mainland China, in defiance of congressional pressure for tougher economic sanctions in response to repression of political dissent. Administration officials argued yesterday that the sale of F-16s, which will substantially upgrade Taiwan's ageing air force consisting mainly of 30-year-old F-5Es and 40-year-old F-5 fighters, is justified by the need to maintain a balance of power after Russian sales of advanced Su-27 fighters to mainland China. 'I think this is an area where we have a legitimate interest in assisting Taiwan in terms of dealing with its security concerns,' said Mr Dick Cheney, the defence secretary. Beijing has not renounced the use of force against Taiwan, which has been home to the Kuomintang Nationalists since they lost the civil war for the mainland in 1949. However, one of the principal arguments advanced by the administration for not breaking with China over its repressive policies is the need to encourage the Beijing government not to sell its own weapons elsewhere in the world. The real reasons for Mr Bush's reversal appear to lie more in the likelihood that Taiwan, whose plans to develop its own fighter aircraft have made little progress, would buy Mirage 2000-5s built by France's Dassault, and in the resulting loss of jobs in Texas, a state which is regarded as crucial to Mr Bush's chances of re-election. 'Here is George Bush choosing American jobs over his foreign policy instincts. That's a shift,' said Dr Natalie Goldring, deputy director of the British American Security Information Council and a specialist in arms sales. Some US officials are worried that the sale might so irritate the Beijing government as to jeopardise even larger contracts in mainland China won by other US aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. Others argue, however, that China is unlikely to react shortly before Congress's annual vote on the renewal of its most favoured nation trading status, and at a time when the US is threatening a wide range of sanctions in retaliation for perceived trade abuses.</p>

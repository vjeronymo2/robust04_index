			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Books: Aspects of love . . . LOVE AND ITS PLACE IN NATURE by Jonathan Lear Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 20, 243 pages IN THIS brilliant and imaginative reworking of the central ideas of Freudian theory the philosopher Jonathan Lear arrives at surprising and optimistic conclusions about the human condition. This is a book which is destined to provoke controversy, not just among those with a lively professional interest in its theses, but among the general educated readership for which it is written. Freud's revolutionary ideas contain, says Lear, three elements: a science of subjectivity; the discovery of an archaic form of mental functioning; and the positing of a basic force of nature. Lear argues that the significance of these ideas was not fully apparent to Freud himself, because his orthodox attitude to science, understood on the positivist model as the discovery of facts in an objective world, prevented him from grasping the true nature of the unconscious mind and its relation to conscious mental activity. A 'science of subjectivity' cannot proceed in the standard objectivist way, Lear argues; understanding mental life requires a different approach. His reworking of Freud's theory provides him with the premises for his striking new suggestions about what such an approach involves. For Freud, the unconscious contains fully-formed thoughts which their owner represses because he cannot bear to acknowledge them. Curing someone of psychological illness is accordingly a process of bringing repressed thoughts to light so that they can be accepted. For Lear, by contrast, the unconscious is not a repository of repressed thoughts but an 'archaic' mind; it is the locus of primitive, inarticulate, preconceptual mental activity, which can only be brought into consciousness by a process of development rendering it capable of clear expression. Psychosomatic symptoms and the content of dreams both furnish examples of archaic thinking. Resolving difficulties which arise at this level involves not the uncovering of fully-formed thoughts, therefore, but evolution of the primitive mental material into more developed form, resulting in a unification of thought and feeling which enables the sufferer to understand, and therefore to be freed from, the cause of his suffering. For Lear, as for Jung, psychoanalysis cures by bringing understanding, which in turn results from the cultivation into consciousness of what was hitherto inchoate. Lear's rethinking of Freud's concepts of the unconscious and the nature of psychoanalytic therapy provides him with materials for what he takes to be an even more important task: understanding how healthy individuals evolve. Freud had postulated a powerful force in nature which he called 'Eros', love or the life force, a pervasive expression of which is sexuality, but which he also characterised as love for parents, siblings, friends, and the world at large. In an absorbing discussion Lear argues that this principle is central to an explanation of how people achieve individuality, developing away from their primitive identification with others - typically, their parents - and acquiring a full conception of the self. This happens, says Lear, not as a result of the frustrations which in Freud's theory prompt the 'reality principle,' but - precisely the reverse - because the development of the infant's conscious mind is stimulated by his parents' responses to his needs for nourishment, comfort and information. A satisfactory parent is one who meets such needs, thereby ensuring that a normal history of survival and growth unfolds. Because children die if they are not well-enough fed, tended and informed, it is a condition of their existence that the world should be a loving enough place to make their existence possible. Moreover, as the child matures further, not just his parents but his world must be concerned and responsive enough to his changing needs for that development to continue. Since people achieve individuality only if the world is a loving enough place, and since most people do indeed mature, it follows that the world is, in at least the right degree, a loving world. And since individual development is a two-way process, with the growing individual caring about and interacting with the world, the world in its turn must likewise be lovable. This is the surprising and optimistic result of Lear's ingenious argument and if it is right, we are much mistaken about the kind of world we inhabit. He is a highly skilful philosopher. His fluent handling of the psychoanalytic literature in general and Freud in particular is equally skilful and assured. He has given us an exciting, original, highly readable book which is bound to spur debate and to change thinking in both philosophy and psychoanalysis about the nature of personhood and its relation to the world.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Reece losses cut A substantial reduction in first half losses at Reece has come from cost reductions, points out the chairman Mr Peter Knapton. Once sales pick up the low cost base should ensure a return to profits. In the first half of 1993 turnover fell from Pounds 6.56m to Pounds 6.14m and losses were cut from Pounds 183,000 to Pounds 11,000. In the whole of 1992 there was a deficit of Pounds 662,000. All divisions traded more profitably. The door panels operation returned to profit helped by higher exports and cost control, while the fasteners activity turned in a much reduced operating deficit, again principally through cost savings.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> With a little help from its friends, the fourth California condor chick to  hatch this year came into the world Tuesday morning at the San Diego Wild  Animal Park.  </P> <P> The chick, named Shasta, was assisted from its shell by two condor keepers and  weighed in at 6.8 ounces, the park reported. Like its predecessors, the chick  will remain in indoor isolation and be watched closely until it is moved to a  small pen when it is about 2 months old.  </P> <P> Shasta represents the first successful "double-clutch" hatching in captivity  for the California condors. The first egg produced by its parents, AC4 and UN1,  hatched two months ago. That chick now weighs about 3 pounds and has been moved  into a pen. Last year, AC4 and UN1 also produced the first California condor  chick ever both bred and hatched in captivity.  </P> <P> The other two California condors hatched at the park this year also continue to  do well, said Tom Hanscom, park spokesman. They weigh about 1 1/2 pounds.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, AC4 and UN1 have begun rearing an Andean condor chick that was  placed in their nest to see if they would do so. Closed-circuit television is  being used to record for the first time the chick-rearing behaviors of the  California condor.  </P></p>

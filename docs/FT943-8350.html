			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Serbian embargo changes view at the frontier The price of beer in the Bosnian frontier town of Zvornik has doubled in the past week, a sign that the embargo by neighbouring Serbia is holding. Diplomats concur, and the local police commander says all transport - except for humanitarian aid - has been stopped. How long this will remain the case is difficult to tell. Ten days after President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia imposed the blockade against the Bosnian Serbs, UN officials and western diplomats have failed to persuade him to allow the deployment of international monitors on the border. Yugoslavia - now comprised of Serbia and Montenegro - severed communications, trade and financial transactions with the Bosnian Serbs after the latter rejected an international peace plan that would have required them to hand over one-third of the 70 per cent of Bosnian territory they control. But Mr Milosevic appears to be winning the delicate propaganda battle over the embargo move which his Bosnian Serb critics say is turning Serb against Serb. Inhabitants of Mali Zvor-nik, a frontier town 150km south-west of Belgrade, are divided over the peace plan, designed to partition Bosnia between its warring peoples. 'Bosnian Serbs want more land than they can hold. There is not a living soul in dozens of villages around Zvornik,' says Mr Milan Jokic, owner of a roadside cafe by the River Drina, on the frontier. Mali (Little) Zvornik - many of whose 5,000 inhabitants have families or jobs across the Bosnian frontier in Zvornik - was until recently a hotbed of Serb nationalism. It was a stronghold of extremist Serbian leader, Mr Vojislav Seselj, the parliamentary deputy who rallied 'weekend warriors', paramilitaries for violent looting forays in Bosnia. But in the Cafe Balkan, just yards away from the bridge that serves as the local frontier crossing, the summer heat appears to have given way to war-weariness and suspicion. The town's inhabitants themselves are surprised by the change in Mali Zvornik. Even in this feeding ground for radical nationalists, Mr Milosevic so far has succeeded in muting any serious protest against his embargo decision. Indeed, the Serbian President appears to have persuaded many that the war is not in Serbian interests. For the time being, he would be content with driving a wedge between Serbs on either side of the frontier in order to win his power struggle against the Bosnian Serb leadership. Mr Jokic makes clear his frustration with the 28-month long war and the sharp economic decline in Serbia. 'Half a million Serbs in Bosnia are holding 12m hostage in Yugoslavia,' he says. A 41-year-old factory worker who gave his name only as Rodoljub says: 'I was against the war from the beginning, then I did not dare say a word. Now it is possible to speak out a bit. 'The war never should have started. Now Milosevic is trying to blame the war on others,' adds Rodoljub, who until May worked in an aluminium plant in Zvornik which he says is unable to export because of UN sanctions against Yugoslavia. 'Of course, many of the 3,000 workers are angry. They complain that Belgrade pushed them into the war,' he says. 'But a year ago you could not talk with any of the Bosnian Serbs. Their heads were full of war, but now they are plagued with regrets,' says Rodoljub of his Bosnian kin over the river. Zvornik is a mess. Overflowing now with Bosnian Serb refugees, 70 per cent of its population was Moslem before Serb paramilitaries backed by the Yugoslav army seized control of the town in April 1992. Glancing at the portraits of Serbian heroes from the first world war on the walls of the cafe, however, Veljko, another factory worker from nearby, has more strident views. 'The people are not divided,' he says to a friend with a Yugoslav air force MiG 21 tatooed on his forearm. 'Television Serbia is lying when it says that Serbs are in favour of the peace plan. People used to love Milosevic. But this has now turned to hate.' But the bravado may just be a cover. 'People are scared that peace will reveal the crimes they have committed in Bosnia,' whispers Rodoljub.</p>

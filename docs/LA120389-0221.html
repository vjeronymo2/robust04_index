			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVESTMENT OUTLOOK;  </P> <P> ASSESSING THE MAJOR MARKETS;  </P> <P> TACKLING THE CHOICES AFTER RESTRUCTURING;  </P> <P> EXOTIC DEALS CAN CREATE MYSTIFYING CHALLENGES  </P> <P> The August meeting of the Sum Seekers Investment Club of Torrance found members  scratching their heads over what to do with their 100 shares in Marion  Laboratories.  </P> <P> The pharmaceutical company had agreed to merge with a division of Dow Chemical  Co. in a mind-bending deal that would, in part, distribute a type of security  -- a contingent value right -- to Marion shareholders. Shareholders would be  able to sell the right on the market begining in December or wait up to three  years and sell it to Dow.  </P> <P> Would the Sum Seekers tell their brokers to sell Marion on the open market for  cold cash, or tender to Dow and wait for a future payoff?  </P> <P> "We just decided not to deal with it and so we sold our stock," said Roslyn  Bodanis, a club member. "It was too complex a deal."  </P> <P> The wave of corporate restructuring that swept through the business world  during the 1980s has left behind many a confused investor. The 1990s might see  the pace of takeovers and restructuring slow, some financial observers argue,  but that will still leave investors with difficult decisions to make as complex  deals continue. The advice to stockholders: Either follow the Sum Seekers' lead  and sell your shares for cash, or tender your shares and proceed with great  caution.  </P> <P> Matters have been complicated by exotic offers loaded with mysterious  securities whose value sometimes eludes even Wall Street veterans. Investors  must decide whether to trade familiar common stock for packages that often  include stub stocks, junk bonds, rights and securities that multiply into more  securities.  </P> <P> "You don't know what is going on, and it's very confusing for the average guy  to stay on top of and make the best choice," said Hugo Quackenbush, senior vice  president at Charles Schwab Corp., a discount brokerage house, which publishes  a pamphlet to help clients on corporate restructuring. "Investors have to sit  down and figure out what is their best option."  </P> <P> That's not always easy. Take this summer's merger between Time Inc. and Warner  Communications.  </P> <P> Under the deal, Warner stock holders will get $70 in cash for each share and  three types of securities: preferred stock yielding 8.75% in cash; another  preferred stock yielding 11% in the form of more stock for three years and then  cash, and shares in a spin-off company -- BHC Communications -- that includes  several broadcast television stations. Both preferred stocks would later be  convertible to Time common stock at certain prices.  </P> <P> Time Warner, which will pile up $12 billion of debt to finance the deal, said  the three securities should be worth $70 excluding the cash payout -- but no  one is really sure.  </P> <P> "I don't think people would wait around for the three pieces of paper . . .  because of the uncertainty," said industry analyst Jeffrey Logsdon at the Los  Angeles investment firm of Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co.  </P> <P> As the Warner deal shows, a corporation is likely to be left with a lot of debt  on its books after a restructuring. "People don't like debt," said Ernest  Wiggins, manager of the Fidelity Value Fund. "So you are better off getting out  right away."  </P> <P> If investors do not want to abandon a stock, Wiggins suggests that they may  want to sell only half of their holdings to lock in some profits. Professionals  also suggest that investors who can stomach the risk familiarize themselves  with a company's industry and keep up and analyze the flurry of proxy  statements and news reports.  </P> <P> All that work might lead to some sweet rewards.  </P> <P> Supermarket giant Kroger Co., for example, last year fought off unwanted  suitors by assuming $5.3 billion in debt to finance a restructuring.  Shareholders ended up with a one-time $40 cash dividend for each share, a junk  bond and Kroger stock valued at about $8.50 a share that does not pay quarterly  dividends.  </P> <P> Kroger stock -- dubbed "stub stock" because it represents the shrunken amount  of equity remaining in the company -- has nearly doubled in value and has  traded as high as $19.75 a share. But highly leveraged stub stocks have proved  volatile. They tend to outperform the market during bullish times but suffer  more during market declines. "Even the average person does not want a company  with a lot of debt going into a recession," said Wiggins. "So they sell."  </P> <P> Many Marion investors wish that they had sold their shares for cash instead of  accepting Dow's offer -- which Marion shareholders finally approved Friday.  Members of the Pacific Coast Investment Club, unlike their brethren in the Sum  Seekers, chose to sell their 100 Marion Laboratories shares to Dow Chemical and  have regretted the decision.  </P> <P> "Our observation," said Pacific Coast President George Baker, "is take your  money and run."  </P> <P> For starters, Dow would pay cash -- $38 a share -- for only 41 of the 100  Marion shares and issued rights for the remaining stock. Dow says it will buy  those rights for up to $15.77 each in September, 1991, or wait another year and  pay up to $20.20. The amount would depend on the price of stock in a company  formed by the merger of Dow's pharmaceutical division and Marion.  </P> <P> The people at Marion can sympathize with their stockholder's confusion.  </P> <P> "It's one of the most difficult and screwy of deals," says Larry Wheeler,  investor relations director at Marion. "I've been (explaining) this for six  months and it still confuses me."  </P> <P> </P> <P> MERGER ROAD MAP  </P> <P> A look at what holders of 100 shares of Warner Communications received if they  tendered their shares in the merger with Time Inc.

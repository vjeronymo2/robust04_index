			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 17. Should the existing float deductions be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminated? State the advantages and disadvantages of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminating these adjustments to deposits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. Should other adjustments to deposits that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently provided for be eliminated (such as ``BICs'' and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pass-through reserve balances)? State the advantages and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disadvantages of eliminating these adjustments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. Identify other advantages or disadvantages of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option for defining the assessment base.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Expanded Base: Non-Deposit Secured Liabilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this option, the assessment base would consist,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in general terms, of total adjusted domestic deposits plus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-deposit secured liabilities (such as secured notes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other secured borrowings). One argument given for assessing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secured liabilities is that they are protected before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDIC in the event of a failure and, accordingly, increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the risk of loss to the FDIC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secured creditors of insured depository institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are protected against loss by assets of the institution that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are pledged as security for its debts to those creditors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because more favorable terms can be obtained on borrowings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by pledging high-quality, marketable assets as security,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is a tendency for institutions to pledge such assets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for that purpose. If the institution were to fail, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pledged assets would not be available to reduce the FDIC's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> losses or to settle the claims of other unsecured creditors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As more of the institution's assets are pledged_often,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the highest-quality, most marketable assets_there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fewer assets remaining to satisfy unsecured obligations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including unsecured deposit and non-deposit liabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The likely effect of a shrinking pool of quality assets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the FDIC is to increase its failure-resolution costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDIC costs could be increased even further if, as is often  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the case, the market realizes beforehand that an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be heading toward insolvency. Uninsured and unsecured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> creditors typically flee an institution perceived to be in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trouble, leaving the institution more dependent on secured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrowings for funding, and further depleting the pool of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unpledged assets available for settling claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDICIA allows secured claims to be paid up to the fair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market value of the assets pledged against those claims. 12  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 1821(d)(5)(D). Any remaining portion is to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated as an unsecured claim. This marginally reduces the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDIC's exposure by restricting secured claimholders'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recoveries to the market value of the pledged assets, but by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no means eliminates the exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the assessment base were expanded to include secured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities, a better measure of these liabilities would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary. While rough estimates of secured liabilities are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtainable, an institution's secured, non-deposit borrowings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot at present be readily determined from data available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the institution's Report of Condition. As a result, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the assessment base were defined to include non-deposit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secured liabilities, additional data (and additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recordkeeping) would probably be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters are requested to provide an evaluation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this option for defining the assessment base, in terms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the following criteria discussed in section III of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 20.

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Letter: Commitment to road spending Sir, You report (Parliament and Politics, July 8) that the Treasury has earmarked the road programme as a 'soft' target for drastic cuts in this year's review of public expenditure. I am surprised by this suggestion given that one of the very few quantified spending commitments made by the Conservatives in their election manifesto was to 'invest Pounds 6.3bn in our trunk road and motorway network over the next three years'. I am sure the prime minister and his colleagues would not condone reneging on such a specific statement from the programme on which they were re-elected.

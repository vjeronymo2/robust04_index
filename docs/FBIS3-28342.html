			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- An outline of a fiscal 1994  tax reform proposal with the emphasis on rectification of tax  inequities has been laid down, officials said Monday [7  February]. The outline, worked out by the government's tax  commission, also calls for a relaxation of land taxes and a  raise in the tax on non-whiskey liquors.    Details of the proposed 5.3 trillion yen income and resident  tax cuts will be worked out after an agreement among the seven  coalition parties on how to finance the tax reduction,  commission officials said. The commission is due to announce a  tax reform proposal on Wednesday.    A proposal to correct tax inequalities calls mainly for:    -- 10 percent of enterprise expense accounts, even within  the  currently nontaxable limit, will be uniformly taxed;    -- The nontaxable portion of business revenues of  nonprofit foundations like religious organizations will be  reduced;    -- A punitively heavy tax will be levied on funds whose  uses are not accounted for.</p>

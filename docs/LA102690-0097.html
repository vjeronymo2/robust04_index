			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COPING WITH THE PROSPECT OF HIGHER TAXES;  </P> <P> TAX-FREE BONDS ALLURING, BUT WHOLESALE INVESTMENT SWITCHES SEEN AS UNLIKELY  </P> <P> The ink on America's new budget proposal is not yet dry, but well-heeled  investors are already pouring money into tax-free municipal bonds to avoid the  higher tax rates that the budget plan portends.  </P> <P> Net sales of tax-free municipal bond funds have jumped by about $220 million  during the first eight months of 1990, according to the Investment Company  Institute. And the change has been even more dramatic in the past month since  budget talks began, investment experts said.  </P> <P> Fidelity Investments, one of the nation's biggest mutual fund companies, has  seen a 60% increase in investments into its California tax-free bond funds  between September and October, said spokeswoman Patricia Harden. Investments in  other tax-free mutual funds sponsored by Fidelity have also soared, she said.  </P> <P> "There has been a market shift toward municipal bonds," added Michael P.  Buckley, vice president and municipal credit analyst at T. Rowe Price in  Baltimore.  </P> <P> The shift to tax-free investments started months ago because it became clear to  investors that the rich would get hit with higher rates, investment experts  said. The budget deal proposes about a 3% tax hike on the wealthy, from 28% to  31%. However, it sets a separate maximum tax on capital gains of 28%.  </P> <P> The new capital gains rate would provide a break to wealthy individuals who are  active in the stock market and could spur additional market activity next year  when it goes into effect, investment experts said.  </P> <P> "This is clearly going to direct more people into equities than before," Greif  said.  </P> <P> However, the same provision is likely to cause a decrease in market activity  this year, particularly among upper-middle-income taxpayers who are in the  so-called bubble bracket. These individuals currently pay 33% in federal tax.  They are likely to put off triggering any capital gains to avoid paying tax at  their 33% ordinary income rate this year. The current tax proposal also expects  to burst the bubble bracket, presumably next year, by making the top federal  rate about 32%.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the tax increases and breaks proposed in the current budget plan  are not significant enough to spur wholesale changes in investment patterns,  said Gregg Ritchie, partner at the accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick.  </P> <P> In 1986, when tax laws changed to eliminate the 20% capital gains rate,  investors rushed to sell anything that would trigger such a gain, causing a  flurry of activity at year-end. However, since most taxpayers would see only an  increase of about 3% in their federal tax rate, and less than a 5% break on  capital gains, they are not likely to act with as much vigor, Ritchie noted.  </P> <P> "It is not going to be some wholesale flight" of capital, he added. "The  difference is not that significant."  </P> <P> Indeed, although there has been a big increase in the tax-free market,  investors continue to be cautious about what they are buying, Buckley said.  Although the changes could effectively hike the after-tax yield for many  investments, the difference is not big enough to overlook investment risk.  </P> <P> "I think investors will be looking at municipals, but they will make sure they  are buying high-quality bonds," he said. "I think you will see investors being  much more conservative in jumping into deals where the (bond issuers) have  known financial problems."  </P></p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / BAe may build train body shells BRITISH Aerospace, Britain's biggest aircraft maker, is considering a return to its roots in the locomotive business. Executives at the company's Chadderton site at Oldham, Lancashire, are considering bidding for the contract to build train body shells for the extension to London's Jubilee line. The go-ahead for the extension is scheduled to be announced today. The company, confirming a report in Modern Railways magazine, said yesterday: 'We have had some exploratory work into the rolling stock business. We are at an early stage and no decisions have been made.' A rail contract would see BAe re-enter an industry it forsook more than 50 years ago to build military aircraft for Britain's war effort. The move would be logical for the company, which has seen markets eroded by cuts in defence spending, heavy competition in civil aircraft, and recession. The Chadderton site specialises in machining aluminium components for Airbus aircraft. This technology would be applied to lightweight train wagons. GEC-Alsthom is leading the race to win the main Pounds 300m contract to build 59 six-wagon trains for the Jubilee line. It expects to hear more about the allocation of the contract in today's announcement. If BAe were successful in its bid, it would build body shells for the winner of the main contract. BAe's forebears, which include many of the grand old names of British aviation such as English Electric and AV Roe, had been working in rail since Victorian days. In 1875 a Kilmarnock company called Dick Kerr made its name in railway electrification. In 1917 it bought the United Electric Car Company, a maker of tram and railway wagons based in Preston, Lancashire. Two years and several mergers later it emerged as English Electric. The aircraft side became part of British Aircraft Corporation in the 1960s.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 2, (IRNA) -- A Foreign Ministry  spokesman here Thursday [2 June] reiterated Iran's policy of  establishing friendly ties with the Persian Gulf states and said  the country is ready to hold direct and bilateral talks with the  United Arab Emirates [UAE] to eliminate the existing  misunderstandings.    The spokesman, Mahmud Mohammadi, was referring to the recent  statements by the UAE Crown Prince Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Zayid Al  Nuhayyan who has called for the establishment of friendly ties  with Tehran but asked Iran to give up the three islands of Abu  Musa, the Lesser and the Greater Tonbs.    Mohammadi further added that the Islamic Republic of Iran  attaches great importance to the security and stability of the  region.    He stressed that Iran had always tried to maintain security  and stability in the region and under critical conditions had  even welcomed cooperation of other countries in thwarting  threats against the collective regional interests.    The spokesman said that Shaykh Khalifah's statements  regarding the three Iranian islands were in contradiction with  the UAE's call for the establishment of friendly ties with Iran.    Mohammadi termed as incorrect the report aired by Agence  France Presse (AFP) on the meeting between the Iranian and  Egyptian Foreign ministers in the course of the on-going  Non-alignment Movement [NAM] ministerial session, convened in  Cairo Tuesday.    AFP had reported that Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  had  expressed willingness to confer with his Iranian counterpart  'Ali Akbar Velayati and quoted Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman  as saying that Velayati would not meet any Egyptian official.    He said that to meet with foreign ministers of other  countries at multilateral sessions and holding talks with them  is quite customary.    Stressing that Iran and Egypt are two influential members of  the movement, the spokesman said that during the NAM meeting the  two foreign ministers can discuss major issues such as situation  in Bosnia-Herzegovina, disarmament and restructuring of the U.N.  organization.</p>

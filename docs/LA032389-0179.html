			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HABERDASHERY AFFAIR PASSES HAT FOR CHARITY  </P> <P> When you've got an award for "Most Likely to Bid for an Evening With Dan Quayle  to Swap War Stories," who but Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, Orange County's own  up-and-coming boyish Republican, would even be considered?  </P> <P> Vasquez was one of the high-powered models to receive awards at last Thursday's  10th Annual Gentlemen's Haberdashery Luncheon at the Irvine Hilton &amp;  Towers, sponsored by fellow Supervisor Thomas F. Riley.  </P> <P> The off-the-wall awards, chosen by a panel of female judges, also included such  distinctions as "Most Likely to Get a Date at the Bachelor Bid," won by Joseph  D'Ambrosio, vice president of American Airlines' Western Division; "Most Likely  to Commute in a Helicopter Complete With Phone and Fax," awarded to Alan  Cummins of Shapell Industries Inc., and "Most Likely to Buy a Lifetime  Membership From Tans R Us," which went to George O'Connell of O'Connell  Landscape Maintenance and Bill Harris of Rampart General.  </P> <P> The luncheon itself fell into the most-likely-to-succeed category, having  raised about $100,000 to benefit the Heart of Jesus Retreat Center operated by  the Sisters of the Society Devoted to the Sacred Heart in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> In addition to the more than 700 guests who paid $100 each to attend the  luncheon, 31 people also contributed $1,000 each to join the center's Heart of  Gold Club.  </P> <P> "There's something very magical about these nuns," Riley told the gathering.  "You can tell that God's hand is on their shoulders."  </P> <P> The retreat center is the only such facility for children in Southern  California, according to Sister Susan Blaschke, one of 47 members of the order.  About 5,000 Catholic children from public, private and parochial schools visit  the center each year, she said. The center is also used for religious programs  by Catholic and non-Catholic groups.  </P> <P> "We want children to know that when they hear the name Prince, that's not only  a seductive rock star but the Prince of Peace," said Sister Jane Stafford, the  order's Superior General. "We want them to know that Madonna is not just a teen  idol, and that Jesus is not just a word you use at the end of a joke or the  beginning of an argument.  </P> <P> "It's an uphill struggle, because we're offering them an invisible reality in a  very physical, proof-giving society," she said.  </P> <P> The luncheon began a decade ago, the brainchild of Riley's wife, Emma Jane.  </P> <P> "We used to have to beg guys to be in the fashion show," said Anthony Moiso,  president of the Santa Margarita Co. and one of the people involved from the  beginning.  </P> <P> "This year we tried to keep it to 50 (models), but we ended up with 66," Riley  said. "And we turned away 100."  </P> <P> There were a few cutups among those who made the cut, including Orange County  Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates, who was dressed as a marshal from the Wild West;  Harbor Municipal Court Judge Calvin P. Schmidt, who walked down the ramp in a  clown costume, carrying the suit he was "modeling" on a hanger, and priests  Kenneth A. Schmidt and Michael Harris, who appeared in surfer attire and were  dubbed "our favorite unwed fathers" by show coordinator Kitty Leslie of Fashion  Island, who served as commentator along with announcer Paul Salata.  </P> <P> Other models included hamburger mogul Carl Karcher, Supervisor Don R. Roth,  Orange County Republican Party Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes, former Supervisor  Ralph Clark, Tom Nielsen, Richard O'Neill, Gilbert Aguirre, Terrance Barry, Jim  Dale, John Crean, Thomas Malcolm, Peter Muth, Stanley Pawlowski, Tim Strader,  William D. Lusk, Ernie Vitucci and Bill Yacobozzi.  </P></p>

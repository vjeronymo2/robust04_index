			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi, April 19 KYODO -- A consortium of three  Japanese firms and a U.S. company Tuesday [19 April] signed a  contract with the Vietnamese state-run oil corporation to  develop oil deposits off Vietnam, company officials said.    The 408 square kilometer deposit, named Blue Dragon, located  beneath the ocean floor 400 kilometers off Ho Chi Minh City, is  estimated to hold 600 million barrels, the officials said.    The three Japanese firms involved are Japan Petroleum  Exploration Corp., Indonesia Petroleum Ltd. and Nissho Iwai  Corp., while the American firm is Mobil Corp.    The Japan-U.S. consortium is expected to begin two years of  trial drilling in August for prospecting and development, they  said.    Under the contract, crude oil produced from the deposits  will  be divided among the partners, with the Japan-U.S. firms taking  72.5 percent and the Vietnamese company, Petrovietnam, 15  percent, according to the officials.    Of the foreign share, 50 percent will go to Mobil, 25  percent  to Japan Petroleum Exploration, 15 percent to Indonesia  Petroleum and 10 percent to Nissho Iwai, they said.</p>

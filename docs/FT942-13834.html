			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Margins pressure on Japan's stores Japanese retailers have been hit by continuing weak consumer confidence exacerbated by a cold summer and falling corporate profits. The growth of discounting retail chains, due to the economic slump and deregulation of the retail industry, has affected profit margins at leading supermarket chains which this week announced annual earnings to February. Convenience store chains, which have been one of the few growth sectors within the industry, have also been affected by the growing trend to discount products, and announced lower-than-expected profit increases. Most leading supermarket chains were especially hard hit by the fall in clothing sales, the leading profit earners during the past few years. At Ito-Yokado, which suffered its first annual profit fall in 11 years, clothing sales fell 0.4 per cent to Y444.7bn (Dollars 4.3bn) while food sales rose 2.9 per cent to Y532.5bn. The profit fall at Daiei comes in spite of cuts in interest bearing debts and other efforts to strengthen its financial base. The company reported a Y13.8bn extraordinary profit from the release of its securities holdings and a Y14.4bn extra loss from the liquidation of its subsidiaries. The company's after-tax profit rose 24.9 per cent to Y10bn. At Jusco, company officials said the number of customers rose after the retailer increased its low-priced product lines, but as a result, the amount which each customer spent declined. After-tax profit at the company rose 3.5 per cent to Y11.1bn due to asset sales including shares and real estate. The company also posted extraordinary losses from liquidating a subsidiary. The retailers, still suffering from over-expansion during the economic boom of the late 1980s, hope to implement rationalisation measures this year, including reduction of labour costs. 'Supermarket chains above a certain size in Japan seem to experience dis-economies of scale from excessive overheads that result in lower efficiency and performance than that experienced by slightly smaller chains,' says Mr Shintaro Hori, director at Bain &amp; Company, the business consultancy. Mr Dean Perry, retailing analyst at brokers Lehman Brothers in Tokyo, says retailers' earnings this year will depend on the yen's fluctuations and its effect on overall corporate earnings and prospects for employment. Deflationary pressure on retail prices is expected to persist due to the increase in cheaper imports, widespread competition from discount retailers, and overall deregulation of various industries. However, many economists are predicting a pick-up in the economy in the second half of the year, led by a rise in consumer spending, and point out that some of the retailers' earnings projections may be too conservative. Daiei sees pre-tax profits for the year to next February rising 18.1 per cent to Y26bn, on a 24.9 per cent rise sales to Y2,590bn. Ito-Yokado expects sales to rise 1.9 per cent to Y1,565bn and pre-tax profits at Y86.5bn, up 5.5 per cent. Jusco projects a 10.3 per cent rise in sales to Y1,170bn on a 1.9 per cent in pre-tax profits to Y26.5bn. Meanwhile, earnings growth at convenience stores seems to be slowing, as they, too, have been forced to discount some of the national brand products. The stores, most of which are open around the clock, were previously seen as the high-growth sector of the retailing industry since they cater to a market separate from the supermarket chains and were not susceptible to the fall in prices. However, earnings projections by the retailers yesterday indicated that the industry trend toward discounting has started to affect profits. For the current year to February, Seven-Eleven Japan expects a 2.1 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y90bn on a 5.5 per cent increase in sales to Y206.5bn. Family-Mart forecasts a 10.5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y18.8bn on sales up 9.3 per cent to Y85bn.  -----------------------------------------------        RESULTS FOR YEAR TO FEBRUARY 1994  ----------------------------------------------- Supermarkets  ----------------------------------------------- Daiei           2,073.4   +2.9    22.0     -8.4 Ito-Yokado      1,536.3   +1.6    82.0    -15.9 Jusco           1,060.8   +5.5    26.0     -5.5  ----------------------------------------------- Convenience Stores  ----------------------------------------------- Seven-Eleven      195.6   +7.5    88.1     +3.5 Family-Mart        77.8   +4.3    17.0     +0.7  ----------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  -----------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Migrants halt decline in Scottish population THE long-running gentle decline in the Scottish population was reversed last year for the first time since the mid-1970s as Scotland, normally a reliable source of emigrants, received an influx of migrants. In the year to June 30 1990 the estimated population rose by 11,700 to 5,102,400, according to Scotland's registrar general. A net 13,500 people migrated into Scotland, most of them from the rest of Britain, but also from abroad. This offset a natural fall in the population of 1,400 caused by a high number of deaths from influenza in the winter of 1989-90 and a relatively low number of births. The gradual decline in the Scottish population and, until recently, high levels of emigration have long been a matter of concern to the government, as well as a source of political point scoring by opposition parties, notably the Scottish National party.</p>

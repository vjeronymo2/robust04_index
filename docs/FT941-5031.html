			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (14): Superhighway into the home  -Efforts to turn couch potatoes into couch commandos The computer, telecommunications and entertainment industries are conspiring to turn 'couch potatoes' into 'couch commandos'; to rouse television viewers from their passive stupor and to get them 'interacting' with the tube. Interactive television will be the foundation of a Dollars 3,500bn digital consumer electronics industry by the turn of the century, John Sculley, the former chairman of Apple Computer, has predicted. The prospect is sparking a frenzy of activity among US telephone, cable television, entertainment, computer, software and semiconductor companies. Hollywood and High Tech are joining forces to promote I-TV. It 'will usher in the multimedia age, inaugurating the electronic superhighway into the home,' enthuses Gerald Levin, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, the entertainment group. 'This is the 'information infrastructure' that President Clinton has talked about,' says Richard McCormick, chairman and chief executive of US West, one of the largest US regional telephone companies, which plans to expand its services to include I-TV. The multi-billion dollar question, however, is whether consumers will share the industry's excitement about technology that transforms the living room TV set into a 'digital interactive multimedia terminal'. Today, fledgling I-TV services offer viewers the chance to participate in television game shows, to call football plays before the quarterback makes his move, order movies for instant viewing and register their opinions on issues of the day. But is this enough to 'change the use of television' as industry proponents maintain? Future plans include interactive shopping channels. Picking fashions from Nordstrom, or home furnishings from Macy's could soon become as simple as pressing a few buttons on the remote control. There are also grand plans for multi-media information services ranging from restaurant guides complete with video footage of the dining-room and a nutritional analysis of the menu, to maps that can display the most scenic route or locations of inns along the way. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of I-TV, however, is the prospect of being able to design your own TV channel, selecting all your favourite shows and programmes reflecting your interests. You might, for example, want to watch only a re-run of Cheers, or all news broadcasts concerning the war in Bosnia. But with so many different potential uses for I-TV, there is little consensus on what are the 'killer applications' that will lure consumers to pay for this new technology. Games will be the 'Trojan Horse' that bring I-TV into the home, providing an entree for information services, movies-on-demand, TV shopping and other services, analysts at Salomon Brothers predict. 'Consumers simply are not willing to invest the money . . . for any application but games and 'edutainment',' they say. However, extensive consumer research conducted by Hewlett-Packard suggests that educational applications of interactive television, aimed at children, may be the initial attraction. 'Consumers are very shrewd. They realise that although games may have some novelty value they are not going to hold their interest for long,' says Casey Lumus, HP's interactive television market development manager. She wonders, however, whether the 4,000 participants in HP's surveys, interviews and focus groups may have been giving a 'morally correct' answer by putting education at the top of their list of most interesting applications. There is a widespread suspicion among market researchers that I-TV could take off on a different note. They point out that pornographic films established the Dollars 12bn video rentals business and that on-line romance is a key attraction of computer information services. The same may be true of I-TV. While identifying the services that will persuade consumers to pay for I-TV is difficult, market researchers have a clearer picture of what consumers do not want. Of more than 3,000 people interviewed by H &amp; M Consulting, a California market research firm, 94 per cent said they wanted no solicitation on I-TV and 73 per cent said no to advertising. Consumers are afraid of the 'Big Brother' factor. 'They fear that their interaction habits - what they purchase, which programmes they watch and which information services they access - will be monitored by service providers to target advertising at them,' explains Mark Macgillivray of H &amp; M. This poses a huge problem, because advertising is the primary source of revenue for the TV industry. Although advertisers relish the idea of being able to target consumers who are likely to buy their products, it seems that they will have to create new forms of advertising such as 'infomercials' to catch their attention. HP's researchers also found that consumers are concerned that I-TV will make TV shopping too easy, leading to impulse buying. 'A surprisingly high number of consumers said that they already 'couldn't trust' family members with home shopping TV channels which require a phone call to order goods,' notes Ms Lumus. 'What would happen if they could spend money just by punching a button on a remote control?' HP's research subjects asked. The biggest question hanging over I-TV, however, is whether people will find the time to use it. Initial response from viewers offered 'movie-on-demand' service has been mixed, with most consumers making little use of it. In addition to the uncertainties of consumer response, several economic, regulatory and technical obstacles stand in the way of widespread availability of interactive television services. Delivering interactive TV to the home will require huge investments in optical fibre cables capable of carrying hundreds of different TV signals as well as computers to control the interactive network and store massive quantities of data for multi-media information services. Viacom, one of the largest US cable TV operators, estimates the total industry's costs at more than Dollars 30bn. Cable TV and telephone companies are vying for the role of I-TV providers, yet neither industry has networks that are well suited to the task. While telephone networks have the two-way communication capability and sophisticated switching systems needed for I-TV, they lack the broad band width needed for hundreds of video signals. Cable TV networks have higher capacity, although most will need to be upgraded for I-TV, and they are not designed for two-way communications. Regulatory barriers limit the activities of US telephone companies. While the Clinton administration is backing legislation that will enable 'open competition' in telephone and television services, many details have yet to be worked out. There are, as yet, no technical standards for interactive television. Early purchasers could get stuck with the I-TV equivalent of a Betamax; the losing contender in the video tape recording standards battle. Similarly, cable TV operators risk choosing the wrong method of video compression, which squeezes hundreds of digitised TV signals down a single cable. I-TV faces competition from alternative 'interactive multimedia' products. 3DO, a Silicon Valley start-up company backed by AT&amp;T, Matsushita and Time Warner, has launched a Dollars 700 'multimedia player' and CD-ROM interactive programmes for PCs have multiplied the sales of PCs to home users. None of this has dimmed the enthusiasm of the high technology and entertainment industries, which are banding together in a multitude of cross-industry partnerships and alliances to position themselves for the brave new world of I-TV. . Among the key players, Tele-Communication and Time Warner, the two largest US cable TV operator with a total of over 17m subscribers, are 'both committed to transforming our cable systems into powerful networks that will deliver a broad array of services,' says John Malo , president and chief executive of TCI. The companies have formed a joint venture to develop standard hardware and software for interactive TV networks. Time Warner Entertainment and TCI are also partnering Sega America, the US subsidiary of the Japanese video games manufacturer, to launch 'The Sega Channel', offering Sega video game owners access to a large library of games via cable television.</p>

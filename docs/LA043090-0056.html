			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JASON NETTER WINS PAC-10 MEN'S TITLE  </P> <P> UCLA's Jason Netter, perhaps college's most aptly named tennis player, defeated  Stanford's Alex O'Brien, 6-3, 6-2, to win the Pacific 10 men's singles title  Sunday.  </P> <P> Netter, a 21-year-old sophomore, was a former player at the Bollettieri Academy  in Bradenton, Fla., before his family moved to Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Netter did not play tennis last summer and instead worked as a production  assistant with his grandfather, Doug Netter, who owns a film production company  in Hollywood.  </P> <P> If film work interests Netter, his tennis fortunes are getting more of his  attention. "I'm really into it now," he said. "This summer, it's going to be  all tennis."  </P> <P> Trevor Kronemann withstood a late rally to beat San Jose State's Mike  Chinchiolo, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-2), and lead UC Irvine to its fourth consecutive  Big West men's title.  </P> <P> Chinchiolo won four games in a row in the third set to erase a 5-2 deficit  before Kronemann broke him at 6-5 to send the set into a tiebreaker.  </P> <P> The Anteaters won five of the nine flights to win the team title with 51  points. Fresno State was second with 45 points. THOMAS BONK  </P></p>

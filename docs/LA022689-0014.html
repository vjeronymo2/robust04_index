			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SPRING BEAUTY REPORT;  </P> <P> SOFT NEWS;  </P> <P> HAIR, MAKEUP AND FRAGRANCES ECHO FASHION'S NEW LIGHTENED-UP LOOK  </P> <P> WHEN FASHION DESIGNERS show chiffon and lace for daytime, as they did at spring  previews, the result is a season of softness -- flowing lines rather than  geometric shapes, subdued rather than garish colors. With this message of  softness emanating from the fashion capitals -- Milan, Paris, New York and  Tokyo -- beauty decision makers are responding in kind: Spring makeup, hair and  even fragrances are softer, gentler and less restricted than at any time since  the '60s, when flower children introduced the no-makeup look.  </P> <P> But the new soft look doesn't mean no makeup. Paradoxically, to achieve a  softer look, women may find themselves wearing more makeup than ever before.  What they wear, however, will be applied with a light hand and with precise  attention to detail. The ultimate goal is to look refined -- emphatically not  bare-faced or unfinished, which was fashionable in the '60s and early 1970s.  The pale lips, fragile eyelids and unexaggerated cheekbones that are the  signatures of spring are carefully highlighted with new, more delicate shades.  </P> <P> The season's beauty focus is on individuality, concentrating on facial features  rather than on makeup or hair styles. Idiosyncratic characteristics are  amplified rather than masked to allow an individual's inherent beauty to come  through. Women who have "quirky" features -- freckles, full lips, thin lips --  will not try to disguise them. Tyen, artistic director for Christian Dior  cosmetics, says: "There is no contouring. No spots of color. When I look at a  woman this spring, I don't remember her color. I only remember her beauty."  </P> <P> SUBDUED HUES COLOR THE NEW FACE  </P> <P> FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS, aggressively red lipsticks have been fashionable. This  season, however, lipsticks in shades of almond, golden pink, dusty rose, even  brownish-red, border on pale; yet these should never be lighter than natural  lip tones. And after years of glossy lipsticks, matte finishes are in fashion.  These "allow you to see natural texture and contours without the distortion  caused by shiny, creamy lipsticks," says makeup artist Marilyn Young of the Ole  Henriksen salon in Los Angeles. In the past, although women rejected drying,  matte-finish lipsticks, manufacturers found that adding moisturizing emollients  to a matte-finish product was virtually impossible. Now, however, blending  technology has been improved, permitting the introduction of new, oil-rich  matte lipsticks.  </P> <P> When the lips are muted, eyes get the attention. This spring, eyelids may be  shaded with as many as five different powders -- sand, rose, honey, peach,  sable, for example -- but such amalgams are blended to produce a hint of gentle  color. Surprisingly, the season of softness allows for a variation that  strongly emphasizes eyes with liner. Shiseido's Parisian artistic director,  Serge Lutens, for example, is showing an obvious, dark liner on upper and lower  lids with shadows that appear to lighten the lids slightly. Most American  makeup artists, however, are featuring the look without liner, placing emphasis  on lashes and brows. The eyebrows are left natural, yet tamed with new brow  gels. Before mascara, lashes are softly curled; a new device called Lady Wink  can be used as a cold or hot curler for long-lasting curve.  </P> <P> TOUCHABLE HAIR AT ANY LENGTH  </P> <P> THE NATURAL FREEDOM of very short or very long hair is an integral element of  the soft spring look. Just as designers of beauty products are operating on the  theory that a woman's makeup should not be noticeable, many hairdressers are  likewise saying that the healthy glow of the hair -- rather than the style --  is what's fashionable. Geometrically structured haircuts -- such as the sharply  chiseled bob -- have become passe. And now more than ever, black and Asian  women will not alter their natural hair with gels and texturizers to conform to  a largely Caucasian ideal. The point of the natural look in hair is to call  attention to the eyes, an effect achieved by dense bangs, which skim the  eyebrows, as well as hair brushed back and off the face. Long hair -- straight,  waved or curly -- can be worn free-flowing. Or the hair can be pulled back into  a chignon or ponytail to completely free the face of clutter.  </P> <P> "Short" this spring means hair cut no longer than earlobe length. If the style  is a blunt page boy, hair should just graze the earlobes. Even newer is hair  cropped to within an inch of its roots. This is "no-conflict" hair -- tresses  snipped into shape, then left to their own devices, framing the face rather  than being noticed on their own. Sterfon Demings, educational director of the  John Atchison salons in New York and Los Angeles, says that one of the most  important aspects of the short style that he created, at left, is that it is a  "low- to no-maintenance look. Women have better things to do with their time  than worry about their hair."  </P> <P> NEW TREATMENTS FOR 'NATURAL' SKIN  </P> <P> UNDER THIS SEASON'Ssheer makeup foundations and delicate, iridescent powders,  the natural textures and tones of the skin are not hidden. Therefore, the  newest treatment products are designed to make skin look very refined and  flawless. But since consumers spend $3 billion annually on skin-care products,  the Food and Drug Administration is constantly reminding the cosmetics industry  that product promises of wrinkle-free, blemish-free skin won't be tolerated. In  response, in April, Ultima II will release The Moisturizer, an emollient cream  for which the only claim made is that it will be regularly reformulated to keep  up with changing technology. Consumers are left to draw their own conclusions.  </P> <P> A large number of other moisturizing formulas will be released this season. The  impetus has come from the fact that the 30- to 40-plus crowd -- who now spend  the most money on cosmetics -- are developing wrinkles. (Fine lines can be  attributed to surface dryness, but deeper wrinkles are typically caused by  aging and can't be helped by moisturizers.) While most exfoliating products  tend to dry the skin while helping to refine the surface texture, Dior's new  Exfoliant Rose, a gel with grains encapsulated in oils, is intended to  lubricate as it exfoliates. Lancome's Hydra-Bleu Cool Hydrating Masque and  Princess Marcella Borghese's Cura Natura -- which looks like green caviar --  are other new products purported to restore moisture to the surface of the  skin. For oily skin, Max Factor offers the clay-based Incredible Blue Mask,  which changes color as excess oils are absorbed.  </P> <P> SPRING SIGNALS A NEW, LIGHTER APPROACH TO FRAGRANCE  </P> <P> VIRTUALLY EVERY scent introduced for spring emphasizes subtlety. Advertisements  for Red, the new fragrance from the makers of heady Giorgio, declare that  "nothing so soft was ever so exciting." Christian Dior, which introduced  powerful Poison perfume two years ago, now produces Soft Poison, a "light  cologne" version of the very successful original. Fred Hayman's 273, developed  by the former owner of Giorgio, is much more understated than his potent debut  fragrance. And Listen, the first fragrance put out by music-industry mogul Herb  Alpert, blends delicate notes of muguet with lemon and bergamot. Following a  successful test run in Southern California that began in October, the scent,  which a Listen representative describes as "whisper soft," will be launched  nationally in spring.  </P> <P> Even the House of Guerlain, which is probably best known for its intensely  sensual scent, Shalimar, is launching a new soft perfume in Paris in June. The  name, as yet undisclosed, will reflect the newly rediscovered virtues of  low-key essences.  </P> <P> Just as there is a trend toward subtle lip and eye color that recalls elements  of the natural look in '60s makeup, there is a renaissance of lighter  fragrances with obviously natural notes -- lily, lemon and herbal aromas, among  them -- that also were popular in that decade. The big difference now is that  the new soft scents are among the most costly perfumes, and major companies are  marketing them to an upscale audience. In contrast, many of the lighter scents  of the '60s and early '70s were inexpensive fad items, aimed predominantly at  the youth market.  </P> <P> When New York City's Bloomingdale's begins its tribute to California fashion  designers and beauty products in April, it will introduce a new Max Factor  fragrance, Jaclyn Smith's California, an ultra-soft scent that joins the  celebrity-signature fragrance category. The Smith fragrance will be available  to the rest of the country -- including California -- in July. Before the  scent's development, consumers surveyed by Factor reported that they were tired  of heavy fragrances and wanted a "soft and light scent." Further, they  described the former "Charlie's Angels" star as "soft and feminine," according  to Sharon LeVan, Max Factor's senior vice president of marketing. Thus consumer  opinion directly influenced the softness trend.  </P> <P> The question remains, however: Will women respond at the cash register to  beauty's new soft wares? Will sales of red lipsticks and aggressive fragrances  fall as consumer taste shifts to pale shades and mellow smells? Retailers are  optimistic. Gary Cockrell, cosmetics buyer for both I. Magnin and Bullocks  Wilshire stores, explains that the soft approach in beauty and fragrance is a  result of a growing self-confidence among women. "Pale cosmetics are for a  woman who is sure of herself and who is sophisticated enough to appreciate her  own beauty," he says. Michael Ziegler, senior vice president and general  merchandising manager of cosmetics at Robinson's, concurs, noting that he sees  the season's soft, natural look "as a form of enhancement, rather than an  attempt to change the way a woman looks. Will women here go for it? Why not?  Isn't it very much a California thing to do?"  </P> <P> Styling: Karen O'Neil; models: Paula Thomas / It Model Management; Nancy  Sheppard / Prima; Jacqueline Rabun; foot model: Susan McNabb / Prima; hair and  makeup: Dominic Cervantes / Zenobia; additional hair: Sterfon Demings / John  Atchison Salon, Los Angeles  </P></p>

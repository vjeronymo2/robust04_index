			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: Maple Leaf Foods plans to go ahead with merger MAPLE Leaf Foods, owned 56 per cent by Britain's Hillsdown Holdings, plans to go ahead with a merger with Corporate Foods, Canada's biggest baking group. Maple Leaf already owns 66 per cent of Corporate Foods. Last April, the two companies proposed a merger on the basis of 1.15 shares of Maple Leaf for each share of Corporate Foods. Now an independent committee of Corporate Food directors has recommended the merger take place on the same basis, but with a cash option. Corporate Food shareholders can now take CDollars 19.90 a share cash for their stock. Hillsdown will take steps to retain its 56 per cent ownership in Maple Leaf Foods, which is has operations in the US and Europe. BioChem Pharma, one of Canada's leading biotech companies, and Sweden's Astra pharmaceuticals group plan a joint development of the Montreal company's pain control compounds, based on BCH-150, now at the pre-clinical trial stage. The agreement includes an upfront payment, research, funding and other payments from Astra to BioChem and provides for the potential future development and commercialisation of compounds.</p>

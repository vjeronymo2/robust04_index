			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Ownership of Wace Group to be investigated by DTI THE Department of Trade and Industry has appointed inspectors to investigate the ownership of Wace Group. The appointment of Mr Anthony Robertshaw and Mr Christopher Mayhew was announced yesterday. It follows an internal inquiry by Wace into share dealings ahead of an uncontested takeover in 1990 of its main UK rival, Parkway Group. Wace is the world's largest specialist in pre-press printing. It said it found 'potentially unlawful' dealings in Parkway shares. The Wace findings, passed to the DTI, included share transactions carried out by relatives of Mr John Clegg, its former chief executive. Mr Clegg, 33, resigned three weeks ago, three days after the company had denied that it had connections with the IRA. The denial was issued because of a newspaper article which linked an unnamed publicly quoted UK company to an IRA money-laundering scheme. It emerged that share dealings surrounding the Parkway takeover had been investigated by the London Stock Exchange's insider dealing group. A dossier was shown to the Royal Ulster Constabulary in June last year. A brief police investigation which was carried out into suspicions of IRA connections dismissed them. The DTI said it was looking at the information passed on by Wace. The inspectors have been appointed under Section 442 of the 1985 Companies Act which covers investigations into who has financial interests in a company's success or who may control or influence company policy. In the months before Wace launched its bid on August 1 1990, nearly 4m Parkway shares were bought and registered in the names of six of Mr Clegg's relatives and seven people sharing their addresses. Mr Clegg, in a statement released by his solicitors this week, said he had never provided price sensitive information to anyone. Mr Frans ten Bos, Wace chairman, yesterday welcomed the DTI investigation. 'The company has nothing to fear from its findings. Our only wish is that the position should be speedily resolved,' he said. Extended family ties, Story and picture Page 11</p>

We  extend our warm congratulations to the session and wish it great  success.    In the past year, Chinese people of all nationalities,  guided  by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and led by the party Central Committee  with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, resolutely implemented the  guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; made headway  in reform, opening up, and modernization; and scored tremendous  achievements on all fronts. The national economy developed in a  sustained, rapid, and healthy manner, with the gross domestic  product breaking 3 trillion yuan, and advanced further in all  social undertakings, and continuous improvement of urban and  rural residents' life. The situation is heartening.    The new situation arising from reform and construction has  put forth new tasks and requirements for people's political  consultative conferences, and has provided a more favorable  opportunity and condition for them to open up a new situation in  their work. In the past year, the Eighth CPPCC National  Committee, on the basis of the work and experiences of the  previous committees, earnestly organized the implementation of  the tasks laid out by the First Session of the Eighth CPPCC  National Committee, worked hard to explore new ways to exercise  the functions of political consultation and democratic  supervision under the new situation, and took part in the  administration and discussion of state affairs focused on the  work of the party and the government, thereby achieving  significant progress in all fields of endeavor and bringing  about a more lively situation. The CPPCC National Committee's  Standing Committee held a total of five meetings; made numerous  constructive suggestions and proposals concerning major issues  in the political, economic, cultural, and diplomatic fields; and  injected new vitality in the administration and discussion of  state affairs. All special committees worked energetically to  score notable results. They have been highly valued by the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council, as well as relevant  departments and local governments, which have already adopted  some of the suggestions and proposals. The CPPCC National  Committee also achieved breakthroughs in developing exchange and  enhancing friendship and cooperation with foreign countries,  expanding contacts between people at home and Overseas Chinese,  and promoting the motherland's peaceful reunification.  Meanwhile, the CPPCC National Committee actively organized its  members to make suggestions for reform and development, to take  part in the anticorruption drive, and to help handle motions  made by members. The fruitful results of the work in these  areas crystallize the painstaking efforts of CPPCC organizations  and members, and reflect the vigorous vitality of people's  political consultative conferences.    This year is a very crucial one for China's progress in  reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. The result of  the work has a very important bearing on the relationship  between reform and development in the future. The party and  state have decided on the basic principles for their work,  namely, to implement the guidelines of the 14th national party  congress as well as the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee in an all-around way; to  accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economy; to  maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic  development [bao chi guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian kang fa  zhan 0202 2170 0948 3046 4842 3444 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660  4099 1455]; to maintain political stability; and to promote  sweeping social progress under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line. The burden  shouldered by the CPPCC committees at all levels is even  heavier. We believe that the CPPCC committees' work will surely  meet the needs of the new situation, enjoy new development, and  blaze new trails.    The CPPCC committees have the strong points of abundant  intellectual resources, far sightedness, and broad channels.  These strong points are extremely valuable and play an  important role in China's modernization. The achievements  scored by reform and opening up over the past 16 years include a  large number of outstanding contributions by CPPCC members. The  CPC Central Committee highly appraised their contributions. At  the Fifth Session of the Fifth CPPCC National Committee, Comrade  Deng Xiaoping pointed out that our united front "has a bright  future and bright prospects." As the CPPCC committees' work  continued to make new strides forward and score new achievements  in recent years, the fine tradition -- "long-term coexistence,  mutual supervision, showing utter devotion to each other, and  sharing honor and disgrace" -- shines forth with new splendor.  There are many new contradictions and problems that need to be  solved in our endeavor to accelerate the establishment of a  socialist market economy in the new year. The CPPCC committees  must unite the masses of the people to support the governments  to implement various reforms and to promote integration between  reform, development, and stability. We believe the CPPCC  organizations and CPPCC members will surely be able to carry  forward their fine tradition, to give full play to their own  strong points, to improve the concrete results of participating  in and discussing government affairs by closely revolving their  efforts around the central tasks of the party and state, and to  make suggestions for and make greater contributions to seizing  the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting  development, and maintaining stability.    During the session, members will examine and discuss the  work  report of the CPPCC National Committee's Standing Committee,  amend the constitution of the CPPCC National Committee, attend  the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress as  observers, and hear and discuss government work and other  reports. We hope members will give full play to their role of  political consultation and democratic supervision, actively  participate in and discuss government affairs, speak out freely,  draw on collective wisdom and absorb all useful ideas, and make  the session a democratic and realistic one that is marked by  unity and arouses the enthusiasm of all participants.</p>

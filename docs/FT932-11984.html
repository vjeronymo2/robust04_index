			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major promises not to destroy 'economic gains' MR JOHN Major pledged yesterday not to 'throw away' recent hard-won economic gains as he set the government's sights on achieving a 'steady and sustainable' recovery. The prime minister seized on this week's confirmation that Britain has emerged from one of the longest recessions for 50 years to claim that government policies were largely responsible for the upturn. He said figures that had recently emerged indicated the recovery had started to 'get under way' last summer, within months of the Conservatives' fourth consecutive general election victory. But - challenged by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader - he was careful to acknowledge that the recession had led to difficulties and suffering for many people. Warned by a Tory backbencher that Britain must at all costs avoid 'a return to the cycle of boom and bust,' Mr Major said: 'I share that objective . . . we have said from the outset that we wanted a recovery that was steady and sustainable.' He said the government had repeatedly taken action to achieve this 'over the last two years'. The government had said that recovery would follow the reduction of inflation and this now appeared to be happening. Interest rate cuts were the result of that achievement and did not precede it. Mr Major said it had been 'extremely difficult for everyone to get the fundamentals right'. He added: 'We now have them right. I have no intention of throwing that advantage away.' Mr Ashdown, urging the prime minister to pause in his 'campaign of self-congratulation', said the price of the government's policies for Britain had been '3m unemployed, borrowing at Pounds 1bn a week, a devalued pound and a burden of debt that will not be paid off until the end of the century'. Mr Major retorted that the recession was 'not unique' to Britain and quoted Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive of Grand Metropolitan, as saying British industry now had 'almost everything it had been asking for'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- The supreme command of  the Bosnian Srpska republic armed forces assessed late tonight  [10 April] that by bombing Serb territory the United Nations  sided against Serbs in the civil war in former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and announced that all contacts between the  Srpska republic and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] were  suspended.    A statement from the command, forwarded to TANJUG from the  Srpska republic president's office stresses that: The attacks  on the Serbs were carried out in order to prevent the  realization of the Serb proposal on a complete and lasting  cessation of hostilities.    Noting that the Serb side was determined to persist in its  commitment to an immediate and lasting peace, but also to the  energetic defense of the Srpska republic and Serb national  interests, the supreme command stresses that the Serbs will not  be frightened and that they will keep the right to self-defense  with all available weapons.    The text of the statement by the supreme command of the  armed  forces of the Bosnian Srpska republic reads:    1. The supreme command of the Srpska republic armed forces  lodges a sharp protest with the United Nations over the bombing  of Serb territory. It is not true that UNPROFOR personnel were  in danger, and there is no justification for the use of NATO's  air force. By doing this, the United Nations has sided against  the Serbs in this civil war. Further cooperation of the Srpska  republic with UNPROFOR has been brought into question, and all  contacts between the Srpska republic and UNPROFOR are now  suspended.    2. The supreme command of the Bosnian Srpska republic's  armed forces is informing the international public about the  Serb proposal for a complete and lasting cessation of  hostilities. This proposal was not accepted by the Muslim side  and was not supported by UNPROFOR. By protecting the Muslim  offensive from defeat, the United Nations is prolonging the war  and suffering. The attack on the Serbs was carried out in order  to prevent the realization of the Serb proposal on a complete  and lasting cessation of hostilities.    3. The peace process has been put in jeopardy and the UN  bears the responsibility for it. The Serb side is determined to  persist in its commitment to an immediate and lasting peace, and  to the energetic defense of the Serb republic and Serb national  interests.    4. The soldiers of the Srpska republic are forced to choose  between being killed or responding to the offensive.  Politically motivated elements in NATO and the United Nations  are encouraging Muslim attacks against Serbs in order to take  the Serb response as a cause for military intervention. The  Serbs will not be frightened, and they will keep the right to  self-defense with all available weapons. This is said in the  statement by the supreme command of the armed forces of the  Srpska republic.</p>

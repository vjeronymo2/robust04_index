The newspaper announced that large-scale exercises of Armed  Forces headquarters units and formations took place in certain  southern oblasts of Ukraine and in the Crimea from 24-28  January. According to the newspaper, the exercises were  connected with the results of the first round of the  presidential election on the peninsula.    The press service of the Ukrainian military department, the  report indicates further on, had more than once reported about  the upcoming strategic exercise that was held from 24-27 January  this year under the leadership of the supreme commander of the  Armed Forces of Ukraine. The plan of holding the exercise,  aimed at solving the tasks of the country's territorial defense,  was approved as far back as November 1993. As for the units and  formations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, they were not  involved in the exercise at all.</p>

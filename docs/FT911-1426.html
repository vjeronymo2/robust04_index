			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / US jobless fall fuels recovery hopes AN UNEXPECTED fall in US unemployment last month, the first since June, fuelled speculation yesterday that the US recession might be easing. The dollar rallied strongly on the news, rising 3 1/2 pfennigs to DM1.7465 at midday and closing at DM1.7495. Bond prices fell sharply as analysts discounted the prospect of further monetary easing. The unemployment rate fell to 6.6 per cent, compared with 6.8 per cent in March. However, the decline largely reflected a rise in self-employment and an increase in government jobs. Non-farm payroll employment continued to fall, although at only half the rate of the previous three months. The better figures surprised markets following the Federal Reserve's decision to cut the discount rate by half a percentage point on Tuesday. The Fed, which had been under strong White House pressure to cut rates, usually eases in anticipation of economic weakness. Ms Janet Norwood, the head of the Bureau for Labour Statistics, cautioned that the unemployment figures were based on volatile household survey data. It would take more than a single month's decline in the jobless rate to set a clear new trend. The fall follows two large consecutive monthly increases in the unemployment rate, which remains more than a point higher than at the start of the recession last July. After seasonal adjustment, non-farm employment - seen as a more reliable guide to labour market trends - fell by 125,000 last month to 109.1m. This was a smaller decline than expected, but from a lower base. Employment figures for March were revised substantially - to show a fall of 240,000, compared with a previously estimated fall of 205,000. About 1.6m jobs (1 1/2 per cent of the total) have been lost since last summer. Manufacturing employment fell by 40,000 last month to 18.3m - about a third of the average monthly loss since late autumn. Job losses were also less widespread. Mr Richard Berner, senior economist at Salomon Brothers, the New York securities firm, said the figures indicated that 'the economy was groping for a bottom'. Editorial comment, Page 8</p>

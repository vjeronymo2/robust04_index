			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule specified the collection of fees sufficient to recover all of the Agency's costs related to operating the RMP program. For the RCP program, the Agency recognized that a fee set at a full cost recovery level would discourage participation in this new program. Also, a full cost recovery fee for the RCP program would be significantly higher than the costs charged for other environmental risk mitigation courses currently being offered in the marketplace (e.g., NJ State inspector training courses, asbestos inspector and remediation courses, etc.). Accordingly, EPA proposed a less-than-full cost recovery RCP fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments received on the proposed rule indicated that the radon testing and mitigation industry is in a period of contraction. These comments are further substantiated by a comparison of the number of participating organizations in the RMP program at the time of the proposed rule (about 6,670) and those currently in the RMP program (about 1,600). Comments also expressed concern that the proposed fees would drive a significant number of industry members out of business. In selecting fee levels for the final rule, EPA considered a number of factors including the revenue to be collected, estimated program participation rates, and the average radon firm profits. EPA then assessed the effects different fee levels would have on participation rates in the proficiency programs and the amount of revenue that would be collected. In developing the final rule, the Agency analyzed five different formulas, including the fee levels in the proposed rule, for cost recovery ranging from 20% program cost recovery to 100% recovery. Specific details regarding EPA's sensitivity analysis for options for the final rule can be found in the Economic Impact Analysis of the Radon Proficiency Program User Fee Rule, U.S. EPA/Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, November 17, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to concerns raised in public comments regarding the ability of the radon industry to bear the costs of the proposed rule, as well as its own economic analysis, the Agency has decided to establish fees at a level lower than that which it proposed and is sufficient to collect 30 percent of its operating costs for the RMP program in the first year of fee collection. RMP fees, as a percentage of the average radon firm's annual profits, range from 40% to 60% in the final rule, in contrast to 80% to 95% in the proposed rule. EPA estimates that participation rates at this fee level will range from 85% to 90%. In contrast, the proposed rule would have resulted in participation rates ranging from 50% to 75%. The Agency considers the impacts of this final rule to be acceptable for the following reasons: (1) EPA expects that an adequate supply of proficient radon measurement and mitigation service providers will remain after this rule becomes effective to meet the anticipated consumer demand with reasonably priced services, and (2) since virtually all radon firms can be considered small, this rule does not place an undue burden on small businesses and it does not give an unfair advantage to large businesses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, EPA is adopting the proposed fee level for the RCP program. The Agency received no comments indicating that the proposed fee level would decrease participation in the RCP program significantly. Therefore, EPA also believes the proposed fee level for the RCP program is appropriate and will not discourage participation in this element of the proficiency program. Consistent with its authority under TSCA, the Agency shall adjust fees for its proficiency programs as necessary to achieve the full recovery of the cost to operate its proficiency programs within the next five years. EPA will also consider potential industry impacts as it adjusts to fee levels which achieve full cost recovery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Fee Amounts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants to and participants in the RMP and RCP programs are required to pay fees according to the following fee schedule: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> a. RMP Program Primary Organizations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) In order to remain a listed participant, each primary organization that is a listed participant in the RMP program on the effective date of this rule shall pay an initial annual fee of $375 for each device listed in the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Each primary organization that is not a listed participant in the RMP program on the effective date of this rule and submits an initial application after the effective date of this rule shall pay an initial annual fee of $375 per device. This fee will be prorated quarterly, based on the acceptance date of an organization's application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by local reporter Kennedy Alencar] </F>   [Text] The Catholic Church will present the candidates for  president with a plan for this country in which it proposes an  end to what it calls the "democracy of the elites." The idea,  expounded in a document obtained by FOLHA, encourages a  political "revenge" in this year's elections: "use your vote to  judge those congressmen and politicians who have betrayed their  mandate from the people."    The document, entitled "Brazil: Alternatives and  Protagonists," is the way the National Conference of Brazilian  Bishops (CNBB) has chosen to influence the presidential  election, in addition to proposing a long-term political and  economic plan for the country.    Drafted by a commission from the Social Pastoral office of  the CNBB, the text says that Brazil is a "society in which only  a democracy of the elites is practiced" and in which  "consultation with the citizens is avoided and feared." The  Church appeals for changes that must occur in a society that is  "stupefied" by the events that led to the impeachment of Collor  and the proposal to expel and strip political rights from  corrupt congressmen.    The document is the result of a consolidation of documents  contributed by 14 regional units of the CNBB, which held  meetings with civic organizations. The CNBB proposal will be  discussed during the Second Brazilian Social Week (24 to 29 July  in Brasilia) and presented to the presidential candidates during  an evening of debate. Father Inacio Neitzling, coordinator of  the commission, says it is a "controversial document that is  intended to be discussed and will provoke plenty of debate both  within and outside the Church." The meeting is likely to be the  scene of a clash between progressive and conservative elements  in the Church.    The bishop of Jales (Sao Paulo State), Dom Luiz Demetrio  Valentini, head of the Social Pastoral office, says "it is more  than legitimate that the CNBB get involved in the elections and  submit alternatives, not just for the immediate future, but for  the long term as well." According to Valentini, the document  does not support any individual candidate. It does, however,  identify similarities between the CNBB proposals and ideas  advanced by the PT [Workers Party], the PSDB [Brazilian Social  Democracy Party], and sections of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic  Movement Party] and the PDT [Democratic Labor Party].    The document, to be released nationwide on 24 March,  contains  detailed proposals for an economic model, agrarian reform,  education, the media, Mercosur [Common Market of the South], the  role of the Armed Forces, and military and civilian policies.  Final touches are still being put on proposals pertaining to the  environment, the judiciary, urban renewal, health, and specific  suggestions for each region of the country. The plan will be  debated at the meeting in July and may be modified.  <H5>  Educational Change Makes Greatest "Impact" </H5>   The Church document calls education the priority "of  greatest  impact" to change the country, something that "will genuinely  ensure the distribution of income and social justice." The  subject is seen as the basic condition for development and the  exercise of citizenship. The chief proposal in this area is the  adoption of full-day school sessions.    The part of the document that deals with agrarian reform  states that in Brazil there is an unlimited right of ownership  that has created "a capitalistic monopoly on farmland."  Apparently born of free enterprise, the property  right--according to the text--has been translated into the  practice of "using and abusing the entire extension of land that  you buy." The Church believes agrarian reform "is urgently  needed" in order to democratize Brazilian society.    With respect to the media, the document points to  "contradictory" aspects in assessing its "near indispensability"  and the need to democratize the media organizations. According  to the text, there is a "scandalous" degree of concentration in  that sector. "About 90 percent of everything that Brazilians  read, hear, and see through the media is controlled by fewer  than nine families."    The Church criticizes the means by which the Mercosur (the  common market formed by Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and  Paraguay) was created, stating that only economic interests were  considered and that "human and social aspects" were left out. In  the opinion of the Church, the "Rio-Sao Paulo industrial axis"  and the "Argentine agroindustrial complex" are the only  beneficiaries, because of their competitive clout. The Church  suggests a plebiscite.    The text states that the "military apparatus has been taken  over by arbitrariness and prepotency." And it proposes that  "society should control" the military and police forces. The  Church finds that there is now "proximity between the police and  illegal groups" such as the death squads, the narcotics traffic,  and criminal elements.  <H5>  Excerpts </H5>   In analyzing the performance of the politicians: "Elected  officials, in the name of representation but with their backs  turned, sneakily act according to their own personal  inclinations and protect the interests of the privileged."    On the subject of the media: "It is important to accentuate  the fact that although the power of the communications media in  Brazil today seems almost absolute and totalitarian, it does,  like all institutions throughout history, have its  contradictions and limitations."    On Mercosur: "It is surprising to see how this agreement is  being worked out solely on the basis of the interests of  businessmen and traders."    On the Armed Forces and the police: "This armed wing of the  state has on various occasions constituted itself as a truly  independent force that has often taken upon itself the  responsibility to determine the course of the Brazilian nation,  as was the case in the recent period of military dictatorship."  <H5>  Constitutional Revision is "Deplorable" </H5>   The constitutional revision is described as a "deplorable  spectacle staged by the National Congress," according to the  CNBB text. The document observes that the way the revision of  the Constitution is being handled endangers "the democractic  fellowship."    The document expresses the belief that the revision is being  done hurriedly, with participation by lobbies from the federal  government, the military, and other groups--especially the  national and international business community. The document  asks: "Might this be the last chance to revisit the Constitution  with a view to inserting in it the implantation of the  neoliberalism imposed by the IMF and by the interests that  represent and are accepted by almost all the Brazilian elites?"  <H5>  The Main Proposals By the Church </H5>   The Economic Model:     -  Rejection of the neoliberal model and attempt to construct  a new model as a paradigm of modernity    -  An economy that  prioritizes the social and subordinates the economic    -  Alternative  government policies based on the experiences of grass-roots  entities in civilian society       Armed Forces and the Police:     -  Democratization of the Armed Forces and the police, with  control exercised by the public    -  Elimination of arbitrariness and  prepotency in those forces       The State:     -  Social pact between the principal economic, political,  social, and cultural agents    -  Deprivatization of the State and  destatization of society       Agrarian Reform:     -  Distribution of lands, starting with the largest tracts in  each region, the least cultivated, and those that either do the  most environmental damage or most seriously impede a healthy  environment    -  Agricultural credit and technical assistance to  small farmers, with adoption of alternative agro-ecological  methods appropriate to each region    -  Guaranteed means of  transporting, warehousing, and marketing the products       Mercosur:     -  Plebescite on the terms of the agreement    -  Extension of  deadlines for opening up borders, to allow countries to better  prepare for competition    -  Cultural integration of universities,  churches, and unions       The Media:     -  Installation of public radio and TV sets in each  city    -  Regionalization of cultural, artistic, and journalistic  production at all radio and TV broadcasters, to constitute 40  percent of programming    -  Guarantee of free radio and TV air time  for state and national civic organizations    -  Protection for  journalists through insertion of a "conscience clause" in their  employment contracts, based on ethics and the public  interest       Education:     -  Full-day school sessions in all public elementary  schools    -  Ban on hiring minors to work during school  hours    -  Guarantee of one minimum monthly wage for each family with  dependent children    -  Hiring 500,000 new teachers in the midterm  future    -  Municipalization of education, using criteria defined in  law</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Births outside marriage increase THE UPWARD trend in births outside marriage is continuing, Alan Pike writes. By 1991 three in 10 births were to unmarried women, which was double the proportion 10 years earlier. Half of the births are registered with both parents living at the same address. The issue is one that produces remarkable variations between European countries. Half of all births in Sweden are outside marriage compared with only one in 50 in Greece.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> VOTE DELAYED ON REMOVING BIKE LANE  </P> <P> The Camarillo City Council postponed a decision Wednesday on whether to remove  new bike lanes from Temple Avenue and to allow cars to park there instead.  </P> <P> The lanes, installed three months ago at a cost of $6,000, became a problem  after soccer and softball players at a nearby park complained of insufficient  parking, city officials said. Parents dropping off or picking up students at a  nearby school also used the street for parking, officials of the Pleasant  Valley School District told the city.  </P> <P> Because parking is prohibited in designated bicycle lanes, city staff members  and the council's Transportation Committee have recommended that the lanes be  replaced with signs designating Temple Avenue as a bicycle route instead of a  bicycle lane.  </P> <P> Bike routes have no striped right of way, and parking is permitted. The only  thing that distinguishes a bike route from a regular street is a sign  designating the street as a preferred bikeway, a condition Mayor Charlotte  Craven said is insufficient for well-traveled Temple Avenue.  </P> <P> Daniel Greeley, the city's director of engineering, said bicycle lanes offer  more protection to cyclists than bike routes, but bike routes still protect  riders because the signs act as cautions to motorists.  </P> <P> "It increases the motorists' awareness and cautiousness," Greeley said.  </P> <P> Temple Avenue is the latest link in the city's ambitious plan to establish a  citywide system of bicycle lanes and routes over the next several years.  </P> <P> The council split 2 to 2 on the proposal to downgrade the bicycle lanes. In a  compromise, Councilman Mike Morgan, an avid ball player, suggested that the  council narrow the two northbound lanes of Temple Avenue to one to allow for  both parking and bicycle lanes. Craven and Councilman David Smith refused to  vote for any parking along Temple.  </P> <P> The council will reconsider a proposal to alter the bicycle lanes Sept. 12.  JOANNA M. MILLER  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Glavkos Kliridhis, president of the Republic </F> of Cyprus, by Frank Schlomer in Nicosia; date not given:  "Without Us, The European Union Is Incomplete; 20 Years of  Turkish Occupation on Cyprus"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Schlomer] Talks between both  communities have been resumed under UN auspices, but sometimes  one can wonder whether this is really a dialogue. Is it not  true that Rauf Denktash is playing some kind of game just to  keep busy, rather than trying to come to a solution?    [Kliridhis] What is being discussed right now certainly is  not the solution for the Cyprus problem, but could be called  confidence-building measures. Such measures can only be a first  step in restoring a favorable climate. We are conducting these  negotiations at UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's request, and  we consider it quite an improvement that the United Nations has  sent a mediator and the European Union an observer here.    We are adhering to our final goal of a peaceful restoration  of the country's unity. At this stage, the main purpose is to  restore general confidence. This principle also was accepted by  Denktash, after his elections (on 13 December 1993, editor).  However, this does not mean that we will be ready very soon to  sign agreements or even to lay down an agenda for possible  future steps.    [Schlomer] One could, however, get the impression that Rauf  Denktash is hiding behind all kinds of excuses so as not to make  any progress at all. First, we had to wait for his elections,  now he is waiting for the outcome of the Turkish municipal  elections on 27 March. These elections might result in a  political earthquake.    [Kliridhis] It is not inconceivable that Denktash is trying  to buy time. I have known him for many years. I have had many  discussions with him, and I can see through his tactics. The  situation in Turkey clearly is deteriorating, and these  municipal elections even might jeopardize the government  coalition. In a way, these confidence-building measures were  forced upon Denktash, and he does not like the idea. The Ciller  government wants some kind of settlement for Cyprus, and  therefore is exerting pressure on Denktash. The present  dialogue could be one step in that process, but Denktash's  position could change if a different coalition were formed in  Ankara. Finally, he also wants to gain advantages that are not  offered in the UN-proposed package, which is why he is  maneuvering this way. I know these tactics.    [Schlomer] The UN package mainly provides for the reopening  of Nicosia's International Airport, and for the restoration of  access to Varosha, in both cases under UN control. Is Varosha  such an important symbol to you?    [Kliridhis] Before the occupation, the seaside resort of  Varosha in the east, near Famagusta, was a famous tourist center  attracting Turkish, Greek, and foreign visitors. Now it is a  desolate and dilapidated ghost town, cut off from the outside  world by barbed wire. The telephone and electricity systems as  well as streets and houses are destroyed, and it will take at  least $2 billion to make the town inhabitable again. However,  if the occupier would make the town freely accessible, some  20,000 people could return to their homes. This cannot be  achieved overnight, but Varosha could be made livable within  five years. It is a symbol to the extent that the Cyprus problem  would not be solved by the reopening of Varosha, but it at least  would become a place where both communities could meet in peace.  It could create a change of mentality, and the Turkish myth  that we can no longer live together could be unmasked. Varosha  could become some sort of a test case, a stepping stone toward  future developments. The United Nations also would consider  this a success because, believe me, they really are watching  closely to see which party is taking an unreasonable position.    [Schlomer] Your policy's second objective is to join the  European Union [EU]. Can you imagine a situation in which the  Republic of Cyprus would be part of the EU while Turkey would  still occupy the northern part of the country?    [Kliridhis] Listen, the international community wants a  solution to the Cyprus conflict. The EU, which is sympathetic  toward our accession, will reassess our membership request from  1 January 1995 onward. Europe insists that a political solution  be found for Cyprus by then. However, even if no solution is  found, our membership request will still be reassessed. Anyway,  since we cannot join the EU before 1996, many problems can still  be solved by then. In the meantime, we continue to work and  already have done much work on harmonizing our legislation with  the laws prevailing in the EU. We are meeting practically all  conditions for accession.    If we adopt a constructive attitude during the various  talks,  Europe can hardly penalize Cyprus by not admitting it, even if  part of it would not be free. The European observer is  reporting continuously to Brussels, and he is a firsthand  witness to our positive attitude. That is why it is so  important that the EU decided to send an observer.    [Schlomer] Allow me to play devil's advocate. One might say  that Cyprus is a small, far-off island, situated somewhere near  the Syrian and Israeli coastlines. Why on earth should this  island join the EU?    [Kliridhis] The political parties on Cyprus, as anywhere  else, have different views and argue about all sorts of issues.  But there is absolute unanimity about one thing: Everyone  wants to join the European Union, all political parties, the  entire population. Including the communists, especially after  the fall of the Eastern Bloc. Even the people from the  northern, occupied part of Cyprus want to join the EU. I am  quite sure of that. And this is not only true for businessmen,  who expect economic benefits from the EU.    We have been part of Europe for several millenia, our  European traditions are innumerable, so it is only natural that  we should become a formal member state of the EU. Just ask  anyone in the street whether or not he feels European.    In addition, our geographic position is interesting for the  Union: we are at the crossroads between different continents,  and the EU could play an important role in the region through  Cyprus. Cyprus always has functioned as a bridge, and it could  play this role even more efficiently as an EU member state. The  EU without Cyprus is like an unfinished building.    [Schlomer] Do you not have the impression that the world has  somewhat forgotten about Cyprus? Some countries who have UN  Blue Helmets stationed here believe that 20 years is enough, and  already have hinted that they may recall their peacekeepers.    [Kliridhis] As far as your last remark is concerned, it is  true that some countries are recalling their blue helmets from  Cyprus, but I do not see why this should be a major problem.  Other countries already have offered to send peacekeeping  forces to the demarcation line on Cyprus, such as Argentina,  Hungary, Romania, and some former Soviet republics. The cost of  the stationing should not be exaggerated, either: the operation  costs $40 million a year, and Greece and Cyprus together pay  half of that amount. By the way, I am a strong advocate of a  continued presence of UN blue helmets on the island because they  form an essential factor of our security.    As regards the world's attention to Cyprus, I believe it is  slowly coming back. I perfectly understand that Europe has had  other things on its mind in recent years: the fall of the  communist regimes in East Europe, the new republics on the  continent and in the former Soviet Union, and the terrible  tragedy in the former Yugoslavia. I understand that all these  issues pushed Cyprus somewhat into the background. The same  goes for the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, which  is presently taking place not so very far from here: the world's  attention is focused on that problem rather than on ours. In  addition, the situation on Cyprus is -- fortunately -- quiet.  Attention also slackened a little because of that.    [Schlomer] But your Greek friends are presently presiding  over the European Union. Can they not support Cyprus a little  more?    [Kliridhis] Being president is often useful to determine an  agenda, but a president cannot simply promote any issue it  wants. Greece may be president, but it also is up to its neck in  the all-embracing Balkans conflict, which has a certain  paralyzing effect. Its dispute with The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia [FYROM] also is taking much of its energy. I  talked to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou shortly before  Greece became EU president, and I will meet with him again in  mid-June on Rhodes; the United Nations currently is working very  hard on the Cyprus issue; the European observer is keeping  Cyprus in the spotlight in Brussels. So, Cyprus certainly is  back on the world agenda.</p>

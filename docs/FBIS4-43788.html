			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>   [Text] Brussels, June 21 (AFP) -- The European Union's [EU]  Greek presidency called on EU leaders here Tuesday [21 June] to  seek rapid compromise in the choice of a candidate to replace  Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission.    Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said it was of  "capital importance" that the EU leaders name a successor to  Delors at their summit on the Greek island of Corfu on Friday  and Saturday.    In a letter to the leaders outlining the summit's agenda, he  said failure to do so would not leave the European Parliament  enough time to properly ratify the eventual nominee before he is  due to take office on January 5.    Diplomats here have predicted that the EU leaders might not  be able to break their deadlock at Corfu.    Germany and France are backing Belgian Prime Minister  Jean-Luc Dehaene for the job.    But outgoing Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers has said he  wants the position on the grounds that the Netherlands is alone  among the EU's six founding members never to have held the job  for a full term.    The nominee must be chosen unanimously. A third official  candidate is the EU's British trade commissioner, Sir Leon  Brittan, who has the support of London.    Papandreou warned that delaying the decision would mean  cutting into the European Parliament's ratification time and  thereby violate "the letter and the spirit of the Maastricht  Treaty."    The treaty, which came into effect in November last year,  gives the European Parliament the enhanced right to accept or  reject the EU's nomination for president and his colleagues on  the EU Commission.    However, Papandreou, who will chair the summit, said he was  willing to accept high-level horse-trading involving candidates  for the top positions in other international organisations.    The secretariat of the EU's Council of Ministers is looking  for a new chief, as is the World Trade Organisation which will  replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    The same applies to the Organisation for Economic  Cooperation  and Development (OECD) and the Western European Union, the EU's  developing defence arm. And NATO might soon need a new  secretary-general.    Heading the Corfu summit's agenda is a partnership and  cooperation agreement between the EU and Russia. President  Boris Yeltsin will sign the accord on Friday, after dining with  the EU leaders on the Greek island on Thursday night.    Also on Friday, the EU will formally accept four new  members.  Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden will sign their accession  agreements.    However, membership is certain only for Austria, where  voters  approved EU membership in a referendum earlier this month. The  other three countries are holding referendums later this year.    In his letter, Papandreou invited the EU leaders to hold a  post mortem on this month's elections to the European  Parliament, which reflected widespread voter apathy.    There will also be debates on asylum policies and ways to  fight unemployment, drug smuggling, international crime, racism  and xenophobia.    The EU leaders are to discuss a joint approach to the G-7  summit of seven industrialised countries in Naples on July 8-10.    The Greek leader said particular attention would be paid to  an initiative to help finance the permanent closing of Ukraine's  Chernobyl nuclear power plant, where the world's worst civilian  nuclear accident occurred in 1986.</p>

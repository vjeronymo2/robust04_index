Recently, the Foreign Ministry  called the ambassadors of the five permanent members of the U.N.  Security Council seeking their countries' mediation in the issue  and calling for retrials of the Jordanians, most of them accused  of "collaborating" with Iraq during its six-month occupation of  Kuwait. The Foreign Ministry has also called several  ambassadors of Arab states in Amman for the same purpose. It  has also contacted Jordanian diplomatic missions in Arab and  Islamic states and at international organisations to continue  their efforts in this regard.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed MPN/JWI: "Belgium Protests `Super 301'"; as </F> released by Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 7 Mar (BELGA) -- Robert Urbain, Belgian  minister for foreign trade and European affairs, has affirmed  that he was astonished at U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision  to reintroduce the "Super 301" procedure.    This unilateral measure permits the United States to take  retaliatory measures against countries that are opening up their  markets insufficiently to U.S. products.    "Although this decision has been dictated by the U.S.' vast  trade deficit ($59.3 billion) with Japan," Robert Urbain  continued in a press release issued in Brussels on Monday [7  March], "the moment chosen to announce this measure is entirely  inappropriate, since it comes just after the conclusion of the  arduous negotiations on a GATT agreement thatwill be signed  officially one month from now in Marrakesh."    Mr. Urbain said that, "without seeking to attach too much  importance to the effects on our foreign trade caused by  resorting to this `Super 301' weapon, which must be considered  more as a means of dissuasion and whose reintroduction is  certainly also motivated by domestic policy considerations," its  use "runs totally counter to the procedures aimed at combatting  unfair competition."    "Falling back on unilateralism to resolve trade conflicts  should be avoided at all costs," the foreign trade minister  concluded.</p>

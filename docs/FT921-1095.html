			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Manila sees GNP growing 2.5%-3% THE PHILIPPINE government projects gross national product this year to grow 2.5-3 per cent, following zero growth last year. Mr Cayetano Paderanga, economic planning secretary, yesterday briefed the policy-making National Economic and Development Authority, headed by President Corazon Aquino, on 'signs the country is on its way to recovery'. Mr Paderanga said growth in the domestic economy in the last quarter of 1991 'turned slightly positive', against a 3.1 per cent third-quarter fall. Higher growth had come from increased public building activities, higher export receipts, and heavy industrial re-stocking. Independent economists also expect increased spending in the first half of this year to fuel a consumer-led buoyancy. This could be bolstered by a rise in private-sector investments in the second half, especially with the lifting after June 30 of the 5 per cent import levy. But Mr Paderanga cautioned against complacency, citing the need for government to continue stabilisation measures by carrying on with its strict fiscal and monetary policies. He also urged continuation of structural reforms in the economy. These include: completion of import liberalisation; privatisation and deregulation; broadening of the tax base and increased tax-collection efficiency; financial-sector reforms, and continued liberalisation of the foreign-exchange market. Moslem gunmen freed two Americans and two Australians from eight days' captivity in the southern Philippines, a spokesman for a Moslem rebel group involved in negotiations with the kidnappers said, Reuter reports from Manila. Sharif Zain Jali, spokesman for the insurgent Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), said by phone from the southern city of Zamboanga the four captives were unharmed and no ransom was paid for their release. Australian and US embassy officials in Manila said they were checking the report but had not been able to confirm it.</p>

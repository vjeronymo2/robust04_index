			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong under pressure as Seoul hits a new high LATE afternoon arbitrage selling eroded earlier gains, and the Nikkei average ended easier in low volume. Many investors remained inactive ahead of Wednesday's public holiday for the royal wedding, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei relinquished 38.05 to 20,844.19 after a day's high of 21,101.80 registered in the morning and a low of 20,829.54 minutes before the close. Volume fell to 351.4m shares from Friday's 563m. Investors have been reluctant to take positions ahead of Wednesday, and the futures and options settlements on Friday, while some have also been deterred by a number of economic indicators to be revealed this week. The government will release its monthly economic report on Thursday, followed by the Bank of Japan's tankan, or quarterly survey of business sentiment, on Friday. In spite of the Nikkei's loss, rises led falls by 523 to 504, with 165 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained a marginal 0.15 at 1,671.85 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 3.30 to 1,269.21. THK, a bearings company on the over-the-counter market, suffered from rumours, which it later denied, that it was facing financial difficulties. Nevertheless, the rumours prompted a fall in the OTC average of 17.80 to 1,645.51. On the main market, prices fluctuated on technical trading. Some property companies were higher on rumours that Mr George Soros, the international fund manager, was targeting the property markets. Mitsubishi Estate moved forward Y20 to Y1,150. Banks were bought by foreign investors, many of whom have relatively low weightings in this sector. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank rose Y30 to Y2,080 and Fuji Bank put on Y10 at Y2,330. Regional banks were also higher, with Kanto Bank up Y340 to Y5,150. Aids-related stocks continued to be sought, with Olympus Optical, reported to be developing Aids diagnostic equipment, appreciating Y10 to Y1,290 in active trading. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 10.63 to 23,361.60 in volume of 24.9m shares. Roundup THE WEEK opened with many markets seeking fresh directions. HONG KONG lost ground under pressure from a late round of profit-taking. The Hang Seng index fell 32.76 to 7,124.73 in turnover sharply down to HKDollars 3.1bn from Friday's HKDollars 4.9bn. Cheung Kong was a focus of trade, off 10 cents at HKDollars 27.40, having hit a low of HKDollars 27.20, while HSBC Holdings fell victim to a late wave of selling, retreating 50 cents to HKDollars 71.50. Wharf Holdings shed 10 cents to HKDollars 20.20. There was also selected bargain hunting, China Light gaining 25 cents at HKDollars 39.50 and Hongkong Land up 40 cents to HKDollars 16.10. SEOUL rose to a 31-month high, with investors encouraged by hopes that a breakthrough in talks between North and South Korea might soon be reached. The composite index added 11.69 at 766.28 in turnover of Won977.5bn. Forecasts of good first-half results from pharmaceutical and chemical groups left most stocks in this sector at their daily highs. Hanyang Chemical and Isu Chemical each rose Won600 to Won12,600 and Won13,800 respectively. SINGAPORE weakened further as investors continued to take profits after recent strength. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 14.76 lower at 1,856.12 in volume of 136.75m shares against 186.11m. TAIWAN was easier, with economic data released on Saturday showing a fall in inflation last month unable to lift sentiment. The weighted index, which had opened slightly lower, extended its loss in late trading to end 51.23, or 1.2 per cent, off at 4,317.00. Turnover fell to TDollars 19.6bn from the TDollars 26bn seen in Saturday's half-day session. Financials remained weak, with the major banks losing between TDollars 1.50 and TDollars 3. MANILA was encouraged by Friday's news of lower inflation and Philippine Long Distance Telephone's recovery in New York. Inflation fell to 6.7 per cent in May from 7.9 per cent a month before. The composite index rose 16.88 to 1,604.17 in turnover of 301.7m pesos, against 291.8m pesos. PLDT put on 10 pesos at 965 pesos. AUSTRALIA drifted lower in a featureless market. The All Ordinaries index shed 2.5 to 1,738.5 in ADollars 186.43m turnover. CRA lost 6 cents to ADollars 13.12. BOMBAY rose on better than expected results from Tata Iron and Steel. The BSE index finished 56 ahead at 2,392. BANGKOK weakened as investors took profits on a number of new issues which had made their market debuts last week. The SET index slipped 4.94 to 827.14 in turnover of Bt4.32bn.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: CS First Boston launches global on-line system CS First Boston was today launching a global on-line electronic trading system for US government bonds and related securities. GovTrade, as the system is known, allows investors to buy and sell US Treasury bills, notes and bonds from the start of European trading to the close of US trading (18 hours) on a live market that can be accessed through Bloomberg terminals. To trade, an investor chooses on the Bloomberg screen an issue in which CS First Boston makes a price, completes an electronic dealing ticket and transmits the trade to CS First Boston's government bond traders, who confirm the trade. This procedure frees up some of the bank's trading and sales staff, enabling them to perform tasks other than executing straightforward client orders. According to Mr Jim Toffey, head of electronic trading for CS First Boston, the bank processed more than 4,200 trades electronically with its customers in October alone. However, he says the system will 'complement, rather than replace' the salespeople by offering speed of execution in a liquid and fast-moving market. The system is an expansion of the firm's proprietary GovTrade product which was launched in September 1992. To date, securities worth Dollars 60bn have been traded on the system with more than 400 customers in the US, the bank says. Some 75 investors outside the US are currently viewing the product.</p>

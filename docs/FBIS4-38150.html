			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Ismail] </F>   [Text] Islamabad -- President Sardar Farooq Ahmed Khan  Leghari Thursday [23 June] said the criticism of national  institutions like armed forces and judiciary by the opposition  leaders was "most unfortunate".    Responding to journalists questions at the inaugural  function  of Nathiagali Summer College here, the president said armed  forces fully knew their responsibilities which they were  fulfilling in accordance with the constitution and democratic  system.    The president was happy with the role being played by the  armed forces. When a journalist said that those elements  criticising the armed forces wanted army's interference in  politics, Leghari dispelled such impression saying "there was no  danger of any such interference."    Asked about the need for a new legislation to check the  criticism of the national institutions, including the armed  forces, the president said: "Though the criticism was  unfortunate but there are sufficient laws to deal with such  criticism. However, if the government and legislators feel the  need of more legislation, they can do the same", he pointed out.    The president said continued dialogue between the opposition  and government were a must for the functioning of the democratic  system, Leghari said in his capacity as the president of  Pakistan. It was his duty to help create harmony between the  opposition and government. "It is important for democratic  system to function. There should be dialogue between the  government and opposition all the times", the president said  adding "it will be his endeavour to create conditions to enable  the democratic process to function.    When reminded of the increased Indian defence budget, the  president said: "we are also meeting Pakistan's defence needs".    Asked about the Indian's alleged plan of a "limited war"  against Pakistan, the president said: "Armed forces, government  and people of Pakistan are fully capable of defending their  motherland". "We know how to defend our country and our forces  are fully capable to safeguard our frontiers", he concluded.    Earlier, inaugurating the 19th International Nathiagali  Summer College on physics and contemporary needs, the president  said the freedom of thought and expression was a must for the  promotion of science. A democratic order which guarantees  freedom, provides a fertile soil for nurturing of science, he  added. Repressive societies are not only intolerant of new ideas  but in fact force creative minds to seek refugee in free  societies which are more congenial and receptive to new ideas  and initiatives, he added. He urged the scientists to strive to  set up liberal and democratic traditions to discuss and debate  the economic and technological problems facing the country and  work out strategies to put Pakistan on a path of accelerated  technological development. The president said systematic  dialogue between leading scientists, technological experts,  academicians and government functionaries had been initiated by  him at the presidency and that he himself participated in the  discussion.    Nuclear programme: The president said Pakistan would  continue to pursue its peaceful nuclear programme. "We are  against nuclear proliferation and have no intention to develop  nuclear weapons. Our government is firmly committed to  establishing an equitable, non-discriminatory and  non-proliferation regime in South Asia. Leghari said Pakistan  had put forward several proposals for NPT in the South Asia but  unfortunately India had not responded positively. "Pakistan will  welcome and cooperate on any future proposal but its security  concerns must be taken into account," he added.    The president said Pakistan's nuclear programme was designed  to help improve living standards of our people. We are in the  process of setting up a major nuclear-based power plant at  Chashma with the Chinese help. We will like to set up more  nuclear power plants under IAEA safeguards, he added.    Leghari said Pakistan was determined to press into service  science and technology to make progress and provide reasonable  living standards to its people. For this purpose he said, the  government had doubled the allocation for science and increased  the education budget by 45 percent. But this is not sufficient  and more resources will have to be diverted for human resource  development, he maintained.    Earlier, Dr. Ishfaq Ahmed, chairman of Pakistan Atomic  Energy  Commission presented the address of welcome.</p>

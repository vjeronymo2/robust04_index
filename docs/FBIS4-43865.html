			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Violence is still prevailing in Rwanda. The  forces of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] have continued  shelling the barracks of the presidential forces in Kigali.  [passage omitted]    Francoise Walmack met Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister Willy  Claes at noon today. She asked him whether the French decision  to intervene was not a gaffe, given the reservations and the  opposition of the RPF. Willy Claes said:    [Begin Claes recording] I do not think that it is awkward. I  understand the reservations that have been expressed, but it  must be understood that.... [pauses] and I am not going to give  you an exhaustive list of all the attempts to achieve a  cease-fire that have failed. Unfortunately, confirmation of  serial killings--if I may put it this way--is expected every  day. Someone must indeed take the initiative to try and save  what can still be saved. France has taken the initiative.  There are no other candidates, as far as I know. There are no  others, because we should not underestimate the military risks  of any operation, even if it is a humanitarian one. I believe  that the French are only intending to try to rescue civilians in  danger in a single zone by taking them temporarily outside the  country to refugee camps, while hoping that--in two months' time  at the latest--UN soldiers will be in a position to fulfill  their mandate. They are also hoping that, in the meantime, it  will be possible to have a cease-fire respected. [end recording]  [passage omitted]    What is the situation on the ground? As we told you in our  headlines, scenes of violence are still taking place on a daily  basis. If French troops enter the Rwandan territory, it will be  through the west, that is, through the Central African Republic  via Zaire. Massacres are taking place in the west of Rwanda,  whereas in the south--in Butare--people in a precarious  situation in makeshift camps still prevail. Nicholas Poincare  takes stock of the situation in Butare:    [Poincare] If French soldiers come to Rwanda, they will  probably enter through the west. They will come to the country  of militias, machetes, and killers--in those regions where the  Tutsi hunt is not over, even though casualties are becoming  scarce. A humanitarian operation could still save many lives  here. It would come quite late, a long time after the  massacres, but there are still thousands of Tutsis in mortal  danger who are scattered and hidden in many places. There are  orphans who are grouped together by nuns. There are Hutus  threatened because they protected Tutsis, while others hide  simply because they have lost their identity papers and cannot  prove that they are Hutus.    There are also hundreds of thousands of people who are not  threatened by the massacres, but by famine and disease. They  are the Hutus who have fled before the RPF. At least 2 million  of them are believed to be in the south of Rwanda. They live in  utter poverty, banding together in the hills. In most of these  unauthorized camps, no humanitarian organization has yet been  seen.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: French prepare for les beaux oiseaux THE FRENCH will not know quite what has hit them but Bernard Matthews' 'bootiful bird' turkey advertisments - 'les beaux oiseaux ' perhaps - are about to take France by storm. Under siege at home from imports and consumers whose allegiance has switched to cheaper chickens, the turkey king, is to lead an expeditionary force across the Channel. Early in the new year Bernard Matthews, the Norfolk-based poultry manufacturer, is to launch a nationwide, multi-million pound TV campaign to develop the prepared turkey meat market. The company believes French taste for prepared turkey can be developed from scratch into a market even bigger than in the UK. The stakes are high. Ten years ago the UK market did not exist but is now worth Pounds 150m of sales, according to Mr David Joll, managing director of Bernard Matthews. French turkey consumption is the highest in the EC but almost all of it is in the form of whole birds. The assault on the French market has only been made possible by passage into law of the European Community's meat preparation directive allowing the export of prepared meats. Bernard Matthews has, however, received additional approvals from the French Ministry of Agriculture. Mr Matthews will personally lead the marketing of the 7 products which are to be introduced and exported from Norfolk and Suffolk through a distribution network based in Normandy. Bernard Matthews has promised supermarket groups like Carrefour and Leclerc four nationwide TV campaigns in the first year backed up by promotions and regional support. The company has been researching the market for 18 months and said that the French have the fastest growing per capita frozen convenience products market in the EC.</p>

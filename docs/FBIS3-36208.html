			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Liberal Democratic Party leader </F> Vladimir Zhirinovskiy by Fulvio Scaglione in Moscow; date not  given: "Hands Off Russia"]    [Text] "In the fall it will be our turn to govern.  Meanwhile I am resting." This was said by Russia's bugbear,  the Black Specter in politics Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy,  leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and winner in the latest  elections, but he was not telling the truth. Some rest: He  travels, sees, meets, makes speeches, shakes his fist in the  corridors of the Duma (the Russian parliament), and he gives a  few interviews, such as this.    [Scaglione] You are about to visit Belgrade. Are you pleased  with the document in support of Serbia approved by the new Duma?    [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, partly because the document stemmed from  an initiative on our part. We told Kozyrev (foreign minister --  FAMIGLIA CRISTIANA editor's note) clearly: Unless you adopt a  pro-Serbian stance right away, we will make you resign. We have  no doubts: We are with the Serbs.    [Scaglione] How can the war in the former Yugoslavia be  ended?    [Zhirinovskiy] It is enough to remove all the foreign armed  forces. Let us remove them, then you will see how order will  return.    [Scaglione] You will be visiting Poland, where you are not  much liked. Why?    [Zhirinovskiy] I will be visiting Poland, true -- but  Slovenia, too -- and I have been to Bulgaria. I am in  solidarity with them: We should form a community of Slavic  states together, but with no ideology, no pan-Slavism. This is  demanded by the compactness of our territories, our customs, our  history, and our culture. Be that as it may, the Poles must not  be afraid: We are in favor of the inviolability of borders.  Unfortunately we are forced to defend ourselves because the  West is trying to change ours, despite the accords signed in  Helsinki in 1975.    [Scaglione] I beg your pardon?    [Zhirinovskiy] Those accords envisaged the inviolability of  borders in Europe. Why, then, were the Soviet Union's borders  changed? Who gave them the right to do that? France cannot be  touched. We will not even mention Germany. Only in Yugoslavia,  Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union have the borders been  changed -- as it so happens, the Slavic countries. These are  double standards: How can we be happy with that? There is  nothing fascist about it. They call us fascists to denigrate us  and to frighten our supporters. They will pay for it: We have  sued Yegor Gaydar over this, and have demanded 100 million  [currency unspecified] in damages.    [Scaglione] Why do you take issue with the West so much? Not  long ago you said that Russia needed technology and aid.    [Zhirinovskiy] This business of Western aid is just a  provocation. Nobody gives us a cent: In fact they only come  here to take. This IMF is just an illusion; it does us harm,  and that is all. The tide of profiteers will gradually be  eliminated: By 1995 we will have thrown them all out, we will  have a new government and a new policy.    [Scaglione] Is there no European political leader that you  respect?    [Zhirinovskiy] None. They all hate Russia. But we will get  along on our own -- and better.    [Scaglione] If it is as you say, why sell so many weapons  abroad? To China, for instance?    [Zhirinovskiy] We will continue to sell weapons everywhere.  Whoever wants to buy will always be welcome. But we will ensure  that our weapons do not end up in the hands of those who have  aggressive intentions with respect to Russia. So to our  neighboring countries we will sell only defensive weapons, while  to distant countries we will also sell offensive weapons.    [Scaglione] Do you not consider this a harmful attitude for  you to take? You are not even allowed to enter Germany.    [Zhirinovskiy] This is already the second time that I have  been refused a visa. The first time, last year, I organized a  picket outside their embassy in Moscow, and after two hours my  visa was ready. But that is not the important thing: I will be  visiting Spain, Norway, Australia. There are many countries  that I still have to visit. In any case, this time the picket  was not necessary: My German friends and colleagues organized  one outside their Foreign Ministry. Not bad, would you not say?  Be that as it may, Germany is a country with limited  sovereignty, a colony of the United States and the Zionists.  What kind of freedom are they talking about? The freest  country in the world is Russia. The strongest country in the  world is Russia. And Russia's largest party is the Liberal  Democratic Party, my party. Freedom is here, in my office.  Germany is a colony where foreign troops have resided for 50  years, plagued by 4 million Turks whom the Germans are starting  to burn alive in their homes. That is fascism.    [Scaglione] No cooperation with anyone, then?    [Zhirinovskiy] On the contrary. I am in favor of joint  projects. For instance, we should build a freeway from Germany  to Japan via Russia. The traffic would be huge, and we Russians  would stay home drinking tea and live off the transit tolls.  Or: The Germans build good motors, we build excellent armor  plate. Together, we could build the best tank in the world. We  could take the Italians into space, and you could give us  automobiles. There are opportunities. It is the European  countries -- hostages of the United States and the Zionists --  that are reluctant. They eat, drink, and remain silent. And to  think that it was we who saved them.    [Scaglione] I beg your pardon?    [Zhirinovskiy] In the 13th century, from the Mongols. In the  18th century, from the Swedes. In the 19th century, from the  French. In this century, from the Nazi-fascists. We confronted  the Ottoman Empire, freeing the Balkans, Southern Europe, and  Central Asia. We saved Israel, when we were the Soviet Union,  and as Russia we saved Iraq.    [Scaglione] What is the status of your relations with  President Yeltsin?    [Zhirinovskiy] Good. We meet from time to time. He likes  volleyball, and so do I. He is a good man, and he gives me no  trouble.    [Scaglione] Are there no problems between you?    [Zhirinovskiy] Problems? Why should there be? He was  deceived by Gaydar, Burbulis, and their group, and it is never  pleasant to be conned. Now, having seen the results, he is  trying to redress matters, but that is a difficult task. If I  were in his shoes, I would already have expelled them from the  country or put them in prison. But Yeltsin is a good man, and  he is not doing anything to them. But I will not leave them  alone; I will make sure that they pay the penalties envisaged by  the criminal code for those who attack the state's security and  prosperity. They know this, which is why they shout, "fascist,  fascist."    [Scaglione] But will you take Yeltsin's place sooner or  later?    [Zhirinovskiy] Certainly. Through lack of rivals. Now, or  in a year or two: It makes no difference. Yeltsin is finished  politically, and look who is around -- Gaydar, Sobchak, Volskiy,  Travkin, Yavlinskiy -- all people who command 10 percent of the  votes. We have 120,000 members and received 12.3 million votes.  In the next election it will be triple that. This is why they  hate me: They know that I will be the next president.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / China to act on power stations CHINA is ready to allow 100 per cent foreign ownership of power stations in an attempt to tackle energy shortages caused by explosive economic growth, a senior government official said, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Mr Zhou Heliang of the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics said China would need to invest at least Yuan 50bn (Pounds 6bn) at 1993 prices in power plants up to the year 2000. Hong Kong companies have led the drive to build up China's power industry but have done so by forming joint ventures with local partners to build and run plants. But Mr Zhou, who is director of the ministry's Department of Major Project Equipment, said: 'We welcome foreign businessmen to China to build wholly-owned power plants.' In Hong Kong recently, he said power shortages were especially severe in Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. China's economy grew 12.8 per cent last year, over twice the original target. Internal funds were insufficient to boost power output. 'Premier Li Peng has said part of the market should be reserved for foreign businessmen and they should be allowed to make profits,' Mr Zhou added. But some analysts said foreign investors might well prefer to continue working in joint ventures because Chinese partners have the influence needed to cut through red tape. Mr Allan Ng, of SG Warburg Securities, said Chinese infrastructure projects could be profitable. But foreign companies should not bypass local partners unless familiar with China.

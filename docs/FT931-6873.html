			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (26): Leave it late then beware of salesmen - Year-end tax planning IN THE world of personal finance, the year ends on April 5, not December 31. The end of the tax year is a focal point for financial planning, and can also provide the financial services industry with an opportunity to celebrate as wildly as the rest of the population does on New Year's Eve. When time is running out, the opportunities for high-pressure sales increase, and most salesmen find this the most profitable time of year. Many personal tax allowances expire at the end of a tax year, and it is sensible to leave tax-motivated decisions until late in the year, so that you have a good idea of how much tax you will be asked to pay. Just make sure that salesmen do not use tax as an excuse to sell investments which cannot otherwise be justified. The main planning opportunities are as follows: Capital Gains Tax: You are allowed to realise gains of up to Pounds 5,800 in this tax year, before paying any capital gains tax. This allowance is after indexation - if your investment does no more than keep track with the retail prices index, then it will not be deemed to have made any gain for CGT purposes. Details of the indexation allowance are given each month in the Weekend FT. This means that normally only the very wealthy need to pay CGT, and even they can avoid paying much. The classic method of doing this is 'bed and breakfasting', the stock exchange nickname for selling shares one afternoon and buying them back the following morning. This is most sensibly done when you have already made gains above the Pounds 5,800 post-indexation allowance in the rest of your portfolio. By establishing a loss elsewhere in the portfolio, you may still not need to pay CGT for the year. More speculatively, you can establish a capital gain for the year which is inside the CGT allowance, while establishing a higher base on which gains will have to be made for tax to be payable in future. Brokers' fees can eat into tax savings. Personal Equity Plans: Pep allowances expire at the end of each tax year. You are allowed to put up to Pounds 6,000 per year into a general Pep (which can hold a range of shares, investment or unit trusts investing in UK and other EC equities), and, more speculatively, another Pounds 3,000 into a single-company Pep. These investments will then be free of capital gains and income tax, but you invest out of income which has already been taxed. The concession is most useful for those who already have a large equity portfolio, while charges make the benefits more marginal for those who do not. Business Expansion Schemes: Like Peps, BES allowances expire at the end of each tax year (although there are also provisions to carry a limited amount back if you invest in the following year). BES investments are entitled to full income tax relief at your top marginal rate, so a 40 per cent taxpayer investing Pounds 1,000 will receive a rebate of Pounds 400, leaving an effective post-tax investment of Pounds 600. The maximum annual investment is Pounds 40,000, so the scheme allows Pounds 16,000 in tax to be reclaimed each year. With some exceptions, where banks offer 'non-recourse loans' with only BES shares as security, these investments must be maintained for five years to qualify for tax relief. Pensions and AVCs: These are, again, highly tax-efficient as premiums paid in to a pension fund are 'grossed up'. But you have to be prepared to wait until retirement before unlocking your money. Those in personal pension plans should decide how much money they are prepared to contribute for this year (the precise funding limits vary with age). Extra contributions can be made most cost-effectively using single-premium pension contracts. If you are in a company scheme, you can add to your contributions by putting money into an additional voluntary contribution (AVC). Total contributions into the company scheme and the AVC combined must not exceed 15 per cent of your salary. Inheritance Tax: Several allowances for IHT are sensitive to the end of the tax year (see E for Estate planning). Enterprise Zones: Investment in commercial property on enterprise zones carries the same incentives as the BES, without any upper limit on annual investment. But commercial property investment in the current environment is difficult and speculative. Early this year, there were few opportunities for EZ investment, although there may be more in future. Wealthy investors should not ignore this route. Charities: Top-rate taxpayers with a generous bent might use the Gift Aid scheme as a way of reclaiming tax. Donations of Pounds 400 or more qualify for Gift Aid relief. If you give Pounds 400, then it will be treated as net of basic-rate tax, so the charity can claim tax relief at 25 per cent (an extra Pounds 133.33). Top-rate payers can then reclaim the 15 per cent difference between the top and basic rates (Pounds 79.99), meaning that the charity would have been given Pounds 533.33 for a net outlay of Pounds 320.01. Much of this is complex, and it is easy to make mistakes. If tax-planning seems to make sense for you, then it is worth paying for the services of a good accountant.</p>

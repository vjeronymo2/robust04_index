			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AD-FREE MS. BACK ON NEWSSTANDS WITH FOCUS ON 'WORLD OF WOMEN'  </P> <P> Eight months after suspending publication, Ms. magazine went back to the  newsstand today without advertising.  </P> <P> The magazine also has a slightly new name, Ms.: The World of Women, which its  backers say better reflects its worldwide scope.  </P> <P> The first issue of the redesigned magazine is selling for $4.50 a copy.  Subscriptions are $40 a year for six issues.  </P> <P> The cover of the first issue shows a tiny globe nestled between two women's  hands. "Collector's edition," it says across the top. "No advertising,  editorially free. Ms. Lives."  </P> <P> The 17-year-old Ms. suspended publication after the November, 1989, issue. Its  new owner is Dale Lang, who also publishes Working Woman, Working Mother, Sassy  and Success magazines.  </P></p>

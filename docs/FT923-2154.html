			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Letter: Time to remove UK monetary policy from political arena Sir, The government's policy for fighting inflation is in tatters. European monetary co-operation has failed due to the incompatibility of a German post-unification boom with the slow-down in other economies. But the goal is still important and the markets need to be convinced about Britain's anti-inflation resolve. So how can credibility be restored? The time has surely come to make the Bank of England fully independent, handing over to it the conduct of monetary policy. This should now be made an urgent priority and the intention to do so should be announced as soon as possible. It could hardly do a worse job] The Bank of England could reassure markets of its resolve by maintaining a cautious monetary policy, but in the context of the protracted economic weakness at home, rather than exceptional circumstances overseas. Britain's interest rate policy would then be in the hands of a body which should ensure that Britain's interest rates are determined by the inflation pressures in our own country - but irrespective of political time-tabling. After all, is this not what the most respected independent central bank of all has been doing so successfully for itself these last two years?

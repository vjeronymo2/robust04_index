			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Observer: Trading up Are Michael Heseltine's spin-doctors being a bit economical with the truth? Let's for a moment accept that his recent visit to South Africa 'ended in triumph', as a DTI hand-out would have us believe. Let us also concede that it is possible that Britain's trade minister returned 'a richer human being for the privilege of sharing this dawn of a new historic era', as the same document enthuses. But he really cannot get away with yesterday's press release which talks of a trade support and assistance package for South Africa worth Pounds 1.25 bn, 'the largest offered by any country since the South African elections'. All fine and dandy except that an Export Credits Guarantee Department facility just happened to have been available before he set off; so deduct at least Pounds 1bn. As that old maxim goes, there are lies, damn lies and aid statistics.</p>

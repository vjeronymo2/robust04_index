Inaugurating the seminar, the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha  Rao, said no country can afford complacency about the drawbacks  of the system though there is room for satisfaction. He said  parliaments have to adapt themselves with the pace of the  growing change in contemporary society. It is the will of the  people and, therefore, it should articulate their aspirations.  He said parliamentary democracy will succeed when it addresses  the agenda of the nation. Listing the recent steps taken in  India, Mr. Rao said several parliamentary committees have been  formed to ensure accountability of the executive. Any Indian  parliament member can now identify the urgent needs of the  people of his constituency and suggest schemes up to one crore  rupees. Mr. Rao also said that parliament and press should  complement each other. Quoting Mahatma Gandhi, Mr. Rao called  upon parliamentarians to recall the face of the poorest man they  met ever and ask whether the steps they plan are going to  benefit him.    Welcoming the delegates, the Lok Sabha speaker, Mr. Shivraj  Patil, emphasized the need to discover devices to cope with  numerous problems faced by the people. While the parliamentary  system works on the basis of majority's views it will become  less productive if the aspirations of the minority are  neglected. Mr. Patil also called for striking a balance to make  multiparty democracy meaningful.    The deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha, Dr. Najma  Heptulla, emphasized the need for stability of a parliamentary  system domestically to ensure the stability of the world order.    The seminar will discuss among other things the need to  reform parliamentary system and the roles of presiding officers  and the opposition. The nine-day seminar is being attended by a  number of delegates from home and abroad including the former  speaker of the House of Commons of Britain, Lord (Wheteral).    Later, participating in a discussion on parliamentary system  in India, the secretary general of the Commonwealth  Parliamentary Association [CPA], Mr. Arthur (Donahue), commended  India's democratic system. He said the CPA is taking steps to  monitor the forthcoming elections in South Africa. Former union  minister and Janata Dal leader, Mr. I.K. Gujral, in his speech  said Indian parliament, by and large, has ensured accountability  of the government to the people.</p>

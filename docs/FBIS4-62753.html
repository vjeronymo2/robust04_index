			<p>BFN     [Text] Chief of the Federal Counterintelligence Service  (FSK) Sergey Stepashin in an interview with Interfax on Tuesday  said he was opposed to the imposition of federal rule in North  Ossetia's Prigorodny Region, which is at the center of a dispute  between the Ossetian and Ingush communities. He described  special rule as a form of territorial claim.    Stepashin said the misguided article six of the law  rehabilitating the deported people which provides for territory  changes had ignited the whole of the Northern Caucausus. While  the introduction of special rule in Prigorodny Region could blow  up the whole of Russia, he said. "We have already gone through  this in Nagorno-Karabakh," he added.    The FSK chief believes the parliament must ban any attempt  to  redraw borders and prevent all announcing of territorial claims.    Pointing to what he called Chechnya's "visible and  invisible"  presence in any region of the Northern Caucausus, Stepashin said  that Chechen leader Johar Dudayev stood to benefit from the  conflict between Ossetia and Ingushetia whether maintaining the  role of a potential peacemaker or directly involving itself in  the conflict.    Stepashin said his agency was capable of improving the  situation in Chechnya itself by ensuring the safety of railway  trains which come under attack there. One way of resolving the  problem is to replace ordinary trains for armored ones  accompanied by military escorts, he said.    Stepashin said that different states including Turkey and  the  U.S. had begun to consider the region as an area of their vital  interests over the years of regional instability. "Their  intelligence services employ military and trade emissaries,  professional agents and foreign nationals to carry out espionage  in the region," he said. "The FSK is planning a series of  operations to try to root out these practices," Stepashin said.  He stressed that FSK activity in the Northern Caucausus would  become part of government policies given the crisis situation  there.</p>

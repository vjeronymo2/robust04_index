			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Amalia Frias Santillan and Guadalupe Mendoza] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, the Business Coordinating Council (CCE)  and the Private Sector Economic Studies Center (CEESP) said that  during the first trimester of the year, the Mexican economy  confronted "a very difficult situation that has created an  atmosphere of uncertainty and has had a negative impact on the  expectations of many national and foreign economic agents." They  clarified, however, that the economy is "strong, and thus the  country's economic development model is viable."    Meanwhile, Victor Manuel Terrones Lopez, president of  Canacintra [National Association of the Processing Industry],  has predicted "stronger pressure is on the way from small groups  seeking to break social peace," and he urged sectors to act  "coldly and prudently to prevent violence at any cost in the  upcoming elections."    In an interview with UNOMASUNO, Cesar Hernandez Espejo,  president of the National Association of Executives of Business  Chambers and Associations [Asociacion Nacional de Ejecutivos de  Camaras y Asociaciones Empresariales], has said there is no  threat of economic instability because of the closeness of the  elections. He added "given that we Mexican businessmen are not  a political party, we will continue to invest and create jobs  even if the Presidency is not won by the ruling party because we  are part of a country that has a great chance of overcoming its  problems and modernizing its economy, and, in turn, of achieving  a definite economic consolidation."    The country's top organization, which is affiliated with the  CCE and CEESP, in a joint analysis of "the viability of Mexico's  economic development model," believes "the pressure applied by  the exchange rate and financial markets in November 1993 and  March 1994 demonstrated the effectiveness and strength of the  economic policy and the progress achieved so far because  otherwise unfortunate events would have brought about economic  crises of incalculable magnitude to the country."    It is said this economic strength creates maneuvering space,  which is "significant for economic development as well as a  means to face difficult periods."    The two organizations have explained that adverse  developments, such as the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio,  "have not been caused by problems of economic or economic policy  problems, and it is wrong to associate their impact on economic  development with problems that are not inherent to it."    In debating the strength of the Mexican economy, the CCE and  CEESP have pointed out Mexico has managed to maintain a moderate  growth of 16.9 percent from 1988 to 1993. Real remuneration  (salaries, wages, benefits) grew by 31.9 percent in the  manufacturing sector. "Few countries have managed to  continuously reduce inflation while preserving economic growth  and increasing competitiveness," the business leader added.    According to the analysis of these two business  organizations, the following will give the Mexican economy space  to maneuver and even face other difficult situations:     -  The  perseverance and congruity of economic policy during regular and  critical periods, as was the case recently.    -  The strengthening of  the national productive apparatus based on efforts to modernize  and improve international productivity and competitiveness.    -  The  tidying up of public finances and budget discipline.    -  The trust  of investors, government authorities, and international  organizations on the Mexican economy.    It is also claimed that the process to modernize the Mexican  economy shows significant progress and favorable results in  various areas, "but this does not mean this did not entail costs  for various sectors or that the process is over."    On the contrary, the CCE and CEESP have added, "it is  necessary to hasten the pace and increase efforts in all areas  that for various reasons have fallen behind or have become out  of step with the process of modernization."    Likewise, it was said current headway in the development  scheme and results make the Mexican economic process of  modernization irreversible, because to "abandon or modify that  scheme will cause serious consequences for the country's future  and economic viability."    The two business organizations have stated efforts that have  already been made cannot be wasted because most of the economic  adjustments have already been completed, and "their costs have  already been covered, and the benefits are only now beginning to  be reaped."    Nor did they recommend the Mexican economic development  model  be changed because Mexico's challenge "is to ensure the full  completion of the process of modernization, making it essential  to advance and broaden all those areas in which the process has  made the least headway."    The CCE and the CEESP have concluded it is essential to  complete the process of modernization "because it is the only  way to guarantee a sustained, expeditious, fair, and balanced  economic development."    Canacintra President Terrones Lopez, interviewed shortly  after a news conference in which he said the gross national  product will grow between 1.5 to 2 percent in 1994 and that  there will be 7-percent inflation, has expressed the private  sector's commitment "to redouble investment and efforts to  counter actions of destabilization by small groups, because we  still have confidence in the country and its institutions."    Lopez believes that as election time draws nearer, "pressure  from destabilizing groups will be greater, but one must consider  that Mexicans can rise above adversity, as we have seen for a  long time, and in the face of this threat businessmen will  strengthen efforts and work."    He clarified that in addition to the education and cultural  process in which Mexican society is involved, there is also a  political process that permits greater awareness to analyze  events with a cool head, "but it is essential that rumors which  affect us so much be ignored because all sectors must seek  social peace."    Lopez said that regardless of the unfortunate events that  have transpired, and those that may transpire, the government is  continuing its economic program of support to the micro, small,  medium, and big businesses; therefore, it will also continue to  restructure their commercial bank debts. The Canacintra  president said foreign capital continues to flow into Mexico, to  the amount of $5 billion between January and March, and "that is  why we need to act calmly and always place national interest  first."    In conclusion, he reported he has met with Secretariat of  Finance and Public Credit authorities to look into the  possibility of reducing the 2-percent tax on fixed assets and  the value added tax, adjusting it to international levels of  between 7 to 8 percent.</p>

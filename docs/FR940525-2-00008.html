The meeting will be held at the Naval Air Warfare Center, Technical Support Division, Orlando, Florida. The first session will commence at 8:30 a.m. and terminate at 5 p.m. on June 8; the second session will commence at 8:30 a.m. and terminate at 5 p.m. on June 9; and the third session will commence at 8 a.m. and end at 1 p.m. on June 10, 1994. All sessions of the meeting will be open to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the meeting is to provide the Department of the Navy with an assessment of the importance of high fidelity models and Advance Distributed Simulation technologies to enhance Department of the Navy test and evaluation, and acquisition programs. The panel will review current utilization of modeling and simulation/Advanced Distributed Simulation; identify key areas that would benefit from an investment in modeling and simulation/Advanced Distributed Simulation; identify candidate demonstration projects to evaluate modeling and simulation/Advanced Distributed Simulation utility; evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of modeling and simulation/Advanced Distributed Simulation technologies from a Department of the Navy perspective; and recommend specific research areas related to modeling and simulation/Advanced Distributed Simulation technologies that warrant investments by the Department of the Navy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The meeting will include briefings, discussions, and demonstrations relating to distributed interactive simulation reach and development, technical standards for interoperability, and relevant industry and Department of Defense technology and applications related to Advanced Distributed Simulation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For further information concerning this meeting contact: CDR R.

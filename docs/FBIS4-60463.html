			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial:"Nuclear Nonproliferation ... President Leghari's </F> Categorical Announcement"]    [Text] Talking to the Associated Press of Pakistan  correspondent in London, President Farooq Ahamd Khan Leghari has  said Pakistan will not accept any unilateral restriction on the  nuclear nonproliferation issue, because a solution that imposes  restrictions on Pakistan but not on India is unacceptable. We  want restrictions on the entire world, especially on all  countries in the region. From the very beginning, Pakistan has  adhered to a principled and just stand on nuclear  nonproliferation -- to forcefully support the issue, especially  to extend all sorts of cooperation to the international  community in eliminating a nuclear arms race in South Asia --  provided India signs the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]  at the global level or be prepared to endorse any acceptable  solution on the issue at the regional level. But, as India is  crazy to become a mini-superpower in the region, forcing its  hegemony on other countries, it is bent on rejecting every  proposal on nuclear nonproliferation which impedes any progress  in the direction. Now, after Indian Prime Minister Narasimha  Rao's visit to the United States, President Clinton himself has  admitted that India is not willing to extend any cooperation on  nuclear nonproliferation and human rights issues and has refused  to accept the U.S. proposals as well. Under these  circumstances, the sincerity and truthfulness of Pakistan's  position has come to the foreground that it is not Pakistan  erecting obstacles in the way of nuclear nonproliferation but  rather India, which is not prepared to curtail its nuclear  program at any cost. As long as India does not do it, Pakistan  is not ready to accept any unilateral restrictions on its  nuclear program. Now that the differences between India and the  United States on the nuclear nonproliferation issue could not be  removed, Pakistan should take advantage of the situation and  intensify its efforts to convince the United States of the  soundness of its position so as to get the illegitimate embargo  on economic and military aid lifted.</p>

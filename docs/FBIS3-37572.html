			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS political correspondent Yuriy Sizov] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 17 TASS -- Tajik Prime Minister  Abdudzhalil Samadov said Russia and Tajikistan may reach a  serious breakthrough in bilateral relations in 1994.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday following the  talks with Russian officials that ended last week, Samadov said  that Tajikistan "is destined to success only with Russia."    He said that Russian troops and the troops of other CIS  states on the Tajik-Afghan border are a "powerful stabilising  factor." Russia's presence in Tajikistan has helped avert "a  large-scale armed interference of militants from Afghanistan  into Tajikistan."    Speaking about the prospects for normalising the situation  in  the republic, the premier called for intensifying the political  dialogue, including with representatives of the opposition who  are seeking to restore peace in Tajikistan. "This should be done  as soon as possible without setting any dates or preliminary  conditions. This process should involve international  organisations, primarily the United Nations, Russia and Central  Asian republics," Samadov said. "Our government is ready to take  the necessary steps to begin the process."    He stressed that his government "is ready for a dialogue  with  those who favour democratic development of Tajikistan." "Without  any preliminary conditions we need to reach an understanding on  joining our efforts to promote complex political, economic and  social integration processes that are under way in Tajikistan  this year," the premier said.    Asked if Tajikistan plans to sell raw uranium to Arab states  and Iran, Samadov replied that "I am sure that the process of  selling uranium made in the republic, which is being monitored  by respective international organisations, will proceed in the  same way as it has been proceeding until today. I state that  any attempts to link Tajikistan with countries seeking to  involve it in the development of their uranium programmes are  doomed. The exception is the countries with which we have  steady relations in this field, primarily Russia. These  attempts are doomed politically too."    Commenting on the situation in the Central Asian region,  Samadov pointed out to Tajikistan's relations with neighbouring  Uzbekistan. "Our government has put inter-state relations, if we  speak about the Republic of Uzbekistan and the Republic of  Tajikistan, on a constructive basis, the basis of mutual  understanding of specific problems and the assessment of the  substantial assistance provided by the Republic of Uzbekistan at  the period of hardships in 1992-1993," the premier said.    "I feel responsible for building such a system of economic  and political relations which would ensure that the assistance  and support we have received will be returned, but without  damaging our own interests and with due account of the  circumstances in this or that republic," Samadov said.    "As for the Tajik and Uzbek people, I am sure that  considering the centuries-old historic ties that have been  established on the vast expanses of Central Asia, these  relations cannot be other than peaceful and all attempts to  provoke an aggravation of these relations will be checked," the  prime minister stressed.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Earnings up 41% at US securities house PAINEWEBBER, the US securities house, yesterday reported 1992 earnings rose 41 per cent to a record Dollars 213.2m, despite a decline in fourth-quarter profits. The company earned Dollars 41.2m in the final quarter of 1992, down from Dollars 46.9m in the same period of the previous year. Although the result was in line with analysts' forecasts, the figure appeared to disappoint investors, who may have been looking for PaineWebber's earnings to exceed market expectations. At the close of trading in New York, the company's shares were down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 25, having recovered some of their early losses. Several factors were behind the profits shortfall in the fourth quarter. Revenues from investment banking fell 13 per cent to Dollars 85.5m because of a slowdown in closed-end fund and new stock issue business, while income from principal trading slipped almost 4 per cent to Dollars 165.5m, a reflection of less favourable conditions in the financial markets. At the same time, employee compensation and related expenses rose Dollars 14.3m to Dollars 347.6m. Other areas of PaineWebber's business, however, posted strong gains in the final quarter, including brokerage commissions, which rose 8.3 per cent to Dollars 205.8m, and asset management revenues, which jumped 21 per cent to Dollars 70.9m as more investors entrusted their funds with the company's fund managers. Earnings were up sharply across the range of business lines last year, most notably in investment banking, where revenues jumped 30 per cent to Dollars 380.2m, and asset management, where revenues rose 23 per cent to Dollars 267.1m. By the end of the year, PaineWebber was managing a total of Dollars 35.1bn of customer assets.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: GBL pulled back by Petrofina NET consolidated profits at Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, Belgium's second-largest holding company, were dragged down in 1992 by the collapse in profits at Petrofina, the Belgian oil company, and reduced capital gains on other shareholdings. Profits at GBL slipped to BFr6.33bn (Dollars 188m) in 1992, from BFr7.02bn. The contribution from the group's 20.2 per cent stake in Petrofina was BFr940m lower than in 1991. The company said it proposed holding its net ordinary dividend at BFr142.5 per share. However, the company pointed out that its consolidated profit before exceptional items and capital gains had increased by 7.3 per cent to BFr4.59bn from BFr4.28bn. The group said that barring unforeseen circumstances it expected the 1993 profit before capital gains to be roughly the same as last year. GBL confirmed yesterday it had put an end to various long-running legal cases in the US which followed the 1990 collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the securities group in which the Belgian company had a stake. GBL wrote off BFr3.2bn against the stake in its 1989 accounts. The group said yesterday that an agreement signed in the US 'wiped out all possible action against GBL concerning Drexel.' GBL said other core holdings had performed well in 1992, in spite of the difficult economic climate. The group picked out Tractebel, the utilities group, Royale Belge, the insurance company which announces results today, Parfinance, the French holding company, and Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion (CLT), the Luxembourg broadcaster. Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), the Belgian bank, improved its contribution by BFr113m, according to GBL, which is the bank's largest shareholder.</p>

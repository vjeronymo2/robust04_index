			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLYDE THE CAMEL USED TO PROTEST WATER-CUTBACK PLAN  </P> <P> Critics of a state water plan paraded a camel outside a hearing Tuesday to  protest proposed cutbacks in Southland water supplies from Northern California.  </P> <P> The 1,500-pound camel was kept tethered outside UC Irvine's Beckman Center as  the State Water Resources Control Board conducted a hearing into its plan to  monitor more closely the amount of water flowing through the Sacramento-San  Joaquin Delta.  </P> <P> Southern California water officials said the plan would curtail Southland water  shipments from the delta by up to 15%. Members of the Southern California Water  Committee, a coalition of Southland water and political leaders, said they  brought the camel to the hearing to underscore their concerns that the region  is approaching desert-like conditions and would only suffer more under the  state plan.  </P> <P> "The purpose of bringing a camel is to call attention to all Southern  California residents that we have water problems today," Ventura County  Supervisor John K. Flynn, chairman of the water committee, said Tuesday as he  and another committee member posed for photographs with the animal.  </P> <P> The other committee member, Peer Swan, president of the Irvine Ranch Water  District, also pointed to the camel's water-filled humpback as an illustration  of how the state needs to provide more storage facilities for Northern  California mountain runoff.  </P> <P> Swan said that surplus water from wet years needs to be saved so that it can be  used in dry years. California is locked in the fourth year of a drought.  </P> <P> As Swan and Flynn spoke, Clyde the Camel, on loan from a Los Angeles wildlife  company for $800 a day, fidgeted uncomfortably after his long truck ride to  Irvine.  </P> <P> Tuesday's hearing in Irvine was the latest in a series of hearings that the  state water board has been conducting throughout the state since 1987. The  hearings are on the future of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, an  environmentally sensitive estuary through which the majority of Northern  California water is diverted to both Southern California and the San Francisco  Bay Area.  </P> <P> The state board recently drew up a plan intended to better safeguard delta  agriculture, fish and wildlife. It is that plan that the Southern California  water community is opposing. A final decision on the plan is not expected for  several more months.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The UN Human Rights Commission [UNHRC] has approved  a resolution against Cuba that is in keeping with the  traditional U.S. policy of hostility and reflects the constant  politicization of that UN commission. The document presented by  the United States was adopted by a vote of 24 in favor and nine  against, with 20 abstentions. Nicaragua and El Salvador were the  only Latin American countries to back the resolution. According  to diplomatic sources, the result of the vote did not satisfy  the United States which insisted, up to the last minute, that it  would obtain 40 votes in favor.    A project similarly based on selectivity and discrimination  in the treatment towards Cuba at the UN Human Rights Commission  was also approved under U.S. pressure last year, by a vote of 27  in favor -- only three more than this time.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASSESSING BLAME IN OIL SPILL ALONG COAST  </P> <P> Any oil spill that kills any amount of wildlife is an ecological disaster. The  oil spill of Feb. 7 off the Orange County coast has killed more than 100 birds  and other sea life, and the count will climb higher as the long-term effects of  the spill become known.  </P> <P> To blame one company for spilling the oil is a gross miscalculation of Southern  California's interests. Most people in this country use oil in one way or  another, and these interests are the real cause of the spill.  </P> <P> As with any other man-made disaster, this spill shouldn't have happened. All  that society can do now is learn from this catastrophe, pass laws to help  prevent another oil spill and hope that it won't happen again.  </P> <P> J.

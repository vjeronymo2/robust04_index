			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NICARAGUA'S ELECTION  </P> <P> I must take exception to William Goodfellow's mendacious account ("Others Await  the Arias Cure," Op-Ed Page, March 2) of the road to Nicaragua's recent  elections. It is so rife with error and untruth I'm not sure where to begin.  </P> <P> For instance, Goodfellow informs us that "standing for election before economic  recovery turned out to be (President Daniel) Ortega's biggest miscalculation."  Economic recovery? This is the same regime that drove the Nicaraguan economy  into the ground with its 19th-Century Marxist theories.  </P> <P> Another salient deception is Goodfellow's attempt to portray the Sandinista  junta as being almost eager to hold elections, when in fact they had to be  dragged into them kicking and screaming, while attempting to intimidate the  opposition with their roving bands of thugs. It was not Sandinista integrity  that guaranteed a fair election, but instead intense international scrutiny and  the presence of Jimmy Carter and other independent election observers, coupled  with the knowledge that the Soviet Union would no longer finance and arm their  bankrupt revolution.  </P> <P> Let the battalion of Sandinista apologists camped out in Washington wail and  moan over their heroes electoral thumping. Nicaragua, and the world, will be  better off without K-mart Castros like Daniel Ortega who brutalize and  impoverish their subjects.  </P> <P> MATTHEW J. CUNNINGHAM  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

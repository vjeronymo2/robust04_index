			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / LDP announces poll reform plan JAPAN'S Liberal Democratic party yesterday published proposals for electoral reforms after having lost its parliamentary majority in an election prompted because it refused to reform a scandal-prone electoral system, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. The proposals by the LDP, which had ruled for four decades, are similar to those of the seven-party coalition government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, who wants a blend of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation to replace the present multi-seat constituency system. However, the coalition wants 250 representatives to be chosen by each method for a total of 500 MPs in the lower house, compared with the present 511. The LDP suggests that 300 representatives come from the constituencies and 171 from proportional representation. Another difference in the drafts is that the coalition supports a two-vote system, one for the constituency and one for proportional representation candidates, while the LDP wants only one vote, believing larger parties will profit from this system. The LDP, along with the coalition, suggests that public subsidies be used to cover campaigning costs, though LDP members oppose a ban on corporate donations, which was initially promised by the coalition but is now under review. Under the LDP proposal, each citizen will be asked to pay Y250 (Pounds 1.57), creating a pool of Y30bn (Pounds 188m) in election funds. The coalition has suggested that the charge be Y500, doubling the size of the pool. The proposals will be debated at a parliamentary session expected to begin in the middle of this month. The LDP, which has been belligerent in opposition, is unlikely to give way easily to the Hosokawa coalition, knowing that the seven parties are yet to settle their own differences on the details of reform.</p>

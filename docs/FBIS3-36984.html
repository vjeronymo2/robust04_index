He said in a press release on Sunday that General Suleymenov  "was and remains a member of Chechnya's legally elected  parliament, as well as defence minister in the Government of  People's Confidence of the Chechen Republic".    "His illegal arrest by supporters of the Chechen ruling  regime may exhaust the patience of our government and force it  to take adequate measures" if Suleymenov is not set free in the  near future, Mamodayev warned. He did not elaborate on  "adequate measures" and did not specify the date from which his  ultimatum was to come into force. But he stressed that "the  Government of People's Confidence has everything it needs for  taking such measures".    General Suleymenov headed armed opposition in Chechnya after  Dudayev disbanded the Chechen Parliament last spring and  declared open war on political opposition. The general formed  an opposition army of several hundreds of fighters. In early  February, he conducted military exercises of his army and  demanded President Dudayev's resignation. On February 9,  Suleymenov and his bodyguards were arrested by Chechen Security  Department officers. So far, he has not been officially charged  with any crime.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 17 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC]  will not voluntarily sever diplomatic relations with South  Africa even if Pretoria decides to establish formal ties with  Beijing, Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu said Tuesday [17 May].    Chien made the remarks when he was asked during an  interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan on how well the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs is prepared for South Africa's  possible diplomatic switch from Taipei to Beijing, an "old  friend" in South African President Nelson Mandela's terms.    He said Pretoria may choose to recognize both Taipei and  Beijing, which would benefit Taipei because other countries  might then be prompted to follow suit. And such a policy on the  part of South Africa would not mean Taiwan has abandoned its  "one-China" policy, he asserted.    But he added that Taiwan has "no right to snoop into South  Africa's external relations," saying it was up to Pretoria to  decide with whom to make friends.</p>

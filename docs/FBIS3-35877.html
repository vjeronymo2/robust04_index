			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By L. Sviridov; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Sviridov] Official Minsk is awaiting the visit of  Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy prime minister of the Russian  Government. It is thought that in the course of the talks a  package of documents will be finally agreed on the unification  of the two states monetary systems.    There is especial controversy on the question of mutual  settlements. But Vladimir Ratkevich, the chairman of the State  Committee for Foreign Economic Relations, considers that:    [Ratkevich] It is pointless for the Russians to worry that  Belarus will dump a great deal of funds onto Russia's monetary  system; that there will be inflation. I am sure that when  Russia takes down its customs barriers, takes down its customs,  and when prices are equalized it will be more efficient for  enterprises to get what they need both in Belarus and Russia.    [Sviridov] Meanwhile, in the republic discussions are being  held on the possible exchange rate. For citizens of course a  rate of one to one has been fixed. Industrialists insist on  their own: One to three or one to four. No doubt not without  justification, because trade with Russia comprises almost 70  percent of its overall volume with countries of the former USSR.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 14, IRNA -- A morning English daily here  Saturday [14 May] commented on the installation of bugging  devices in the Iranian Embassy in London saying that the British  Government faces the two charges of espionage and violation of  the terms of the 1961 Vienna Convention regarding the concept of  national sovereignty.    The Iranian Government's disclosure about this illegal act  was "coincident with the ballyhoo started by the British  Government on the alleged Iranian financial assistance for the  Irish Republican Army (IRA)," noted the paper.    It argued that the Irish Americans were the greatest  supporters of the IRA and their financial and logistic  assistance to IRA, with the green light from the C.I.A., was  considered normal and acceptable in international political  circles.    While the statesmen in London found it prudent to condone  any  differences they might have with the U.S. over the issue of IRA,  they apparently felt it was necessary to transfer their internal  crisis to other parts of the world, said the paper.    Urging Iran's Government to continue to exert pressure until  British authorities were ready to accept responsibilty, the  paper concluded "we should not allow such glaring cases of  violation of the country's national sovereignty be easily  forgotten."</p>

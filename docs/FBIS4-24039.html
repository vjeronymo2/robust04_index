			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Isaias Afwerki by Salih 'Abdallah </F> in Asmara "last week"]    [Excerpts] ['Abdallah] A year after you officially assumed  power in Eritrea, how do you assess your experience in the light  of current Eritrean conditions?    [Isaias] We are now at the stage of rebuilding what was  destroyed by war and establishing a future political system to  run the country. I can say that the setting up of a commission  for the Eritrean Constitution is an important political  achievement. It certainly needs to exert tremendous efforts,  with participation by the people, to draft a constitution. By  cooperating with states with resources and with UN agencies, we  are now working on creating government agencies. I can say we  overcame real difficulties.    On the other hand, there are certain problems inherited from  the liberation war. These are economic and social problems.  We are trying our best to overcome them by introducing  practical programs. Because the challenges were great, we can  say that certain successes have been achieved in certain fields.    ['Abdallah] In your speech last year, you set a transitional  period for your government and said that free, multi-party  elections will be held. Will you keep to your promise to allow  free elections?    [Isaias] Free elections will be held on the basis of the  Constitution. The Constitution will determine the political  system and the form of government in Eritrea. The setting up of  a commission for the Constitution, is, in my opinion, a first  step in that direction. Within two years, and with the  participation of the Eritrean people, this commission will draft  the Constitution. Within three years after the Constitution is  ratified, elections will be held according to the approved  Constitution. This is not only a promise or a commitment, but  is an imperative thing to do to support the stability that  prevails in Eritrea right now. I think this is also a historic  need, not just an act of charity or the decision of a political  party or government that is in power now, during this  transitional phase.    ['Abdallah] The transitional National Council has an  overwhelming majority from the Popular Front for Democracy and  Justice; you are its secretary general. Does this mean you plan  to tailor an Eritrean constitution to the front's standards?    [Isaias] The new structure of the council is considered a  progressive step. Half the members are not from the Popular  Front. This means other members are represented in it, unlike  the first council which indeed had the majority of members from  the Popular Front. The composition of the current National  Council is comprehensive at this stage. I think the front's  role in, and contribution to the government agencies is reducing  now. On the other hand, government work is now completely  separated in principle and we are seriously seeking to apply  this in practice. The front and the government are two separate  things, and they have different issues to address. The Popular  Front understands its role in this society and is playing this  role wisely and carefully. It also gives the opportunity for  more participation by the people in this country.    ['Abdallah] When you talk about participation, do you mean  the other Eritrean factions? If so, which ones do you mean? If  that is not the case, then what is the future of the other  Eritrean military and political organizations?    [Isaias] In the march of this country, we are not interested  in talking about other Eritrean political trends that are linked  to Arab or foreign regimes. We do not think other countries  have the right to participate with us in drafting the  constitution or the political system in Eritrea in any way. Nor  do we like to interfere in the political affairs of others.  There is no justification for any state or certain political  forces to impose on us groups and factions and to appoint  themselves custodians over our future and bring us a political  system that suits their own whims.    We do not think there are Eritrean political forces outside  the Eritrean arena. The entire Eritrean people are  participating in the national action during the transitional  period, in an atmosphere marked by tranquillity and in which  there is no suppression or attempts to impose a certain view.    The process to draft the Constitution is continuing. Through  it we will confirm broad-based popular participation. But if  certain states wish to impose a specific group on us and talk  about cultural and political differences and a host of past  disputes, then we are trying to avoid that and not accept what  they are trying to impose on us from abroad. We are also trying  not to enter into bargains with certain states or political  forces so that they give us aid in return for allowing them to  impose on us certain political forces that will in the end turn  into a fifth column working inside this country. We say this is  unacceptable. What is going on the Eritrean arena in terms of  participation and the steps to establish a democratic system is  a firm course. It will not be affected by false conjecture: Is  there participation or not; is there democracy or not. This  must be made clear to certain people abroad who think that by  talking about democracy and participation, they can impose a  group of people or individuals on Eritrean politics. [passage  omitted]    ['Abdallah] Mr. President, many questions have been raised  about Eritrea's identity. The fact that Eritrea has not yet  joined the Arab League raises fears among the Arabs that Eritrea  is distancing itself from its Arab surrounding. What do you  think, your excellency?    [Isaias] We are Africans above anything else. We exist in  this continent and our geographic position is part of our  identity. We cannot deny this identity. There is no dualism in  identity. And, before that, there is one identity; that is, we  are all Eritreans. [passage omitted]    ['Abdallah] There are reports of Sudanese military  reinforcements on the borders with Eritrea following the Abu  Jabal [placename as published] incident in which the Eritrean  forces arrested a Sudanese officer and then the Qarmakiya  [placename as published] incident in which a camp of the  Eritrean forces was destroyed. Does this mean there will be a  potential for tension in the entire region?    [Isaias] First, I do not have specific information. However,  what I would like to say is that we had differences with the  regime in Sudan over certain issues. I think these are pushing  in the direction of tension and disagreement with Sudan, but a  conflict would be too far from the reality. What happened was  very simple. The border police conducted an operation to fight  smuggling. There was a shootout, by accident. The incident did  not have any political nature. This I can say. I can also  confirm that it was not a political clash, but an incident that  can happen anywhere. Regardless of how many differences we may  have with Sudan, I do not think that such differences can reach  the point of an armed conflict. What are the reasons and the  motives? If some people tried to interpret this incident as a  sign of a potential war between Eritrea and Sudan, I can say  that this is very far from our thinking and strategy. The  entire subject has been resolved. Such issues are resolved  through a joint effort by both countries.    ['Abdallah] Stories have arisen recently over  Eritrean-Israeli relations. This issue has been a subject of  concern. A report by one of the regional organizations that  monitor Israeli activity in Africa says Israeli promised to set  up three Israeli military bases in Asmara, Dankalia, and Sakhit  [last two placenames as published]. What is the true Eritrean  position on this?    [Isaias] All this is a propaganda and media clamor. We  should not be asked to be in a certain track more than others.  If some people are trying to find an excuse for their  psychological complexes by directing the finger of accusation  toward Eritrea over its cooperation and relations with Israel,  then I can say that this will not serve that purpose. Even the  psychological problems and the domestic political problems  cannot be justified by directing false accusations against  Eritrea or fabricating scenarios to frighten people in order to  justifiy certain trends. What will follow such an announcement?  Who wants to promote the idea that Eritrea is going to give  Israel bases here and there? What is the purpose?  Sensationalism? But what will follow? I believe that there  are certain people who are living in an illusion and excel at  hypocrisy, instead of dealing with reality in a rational way.  What they claim may have been possible 15 or 20 years ago. But  things are different now. The Palestinians have reached an  agreement with Israel, and those who used to accuse the  Americans of conspiracies in the past are now extending their  hands asking for help from the United States to resolve this  problem. Several events have proved that the rational and  practical thing to do is to act in a constructive way. I think  that, regardless of its source, this sensationalism has been  outdated and there is no need for such a clamor.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> COLT INDUSTRIES ANNOUNCES PLANS TO SELL HISTORIC FIREARMS SUBSIDIARY  </P> <P> The historic firearms business that gave Colt Industries Inc. its name will be  sold, company officials in New York announced today.  </P> <P> Colt is trying to find a buyer for Colt Firearms, which employs 1,100 workers  at two plants in West Hartford and Hartford, spokesman Michael G. Dunn said.  </P> <P> The firearms division, which has been mired in a 3-year-old strike, also  recently lost its contract to manufacture M-16 rifles for the military. But  Dunn said neither was a factor in today's announcement.  </P> <P> Colt management decided the company should focus on its aerospace, automobile  and industrial services sectors, Dunn said.  </P> <P> Dunn refused to disclose sales and revenue figures for the firearms division.  Colt Industries, based in New York, is a privately held company and does not  publicly disclose its financial statements.  </P> <P> Colt was founded in 1836 in Hartford by Samuel Colt, the inventor of the famous  Colt .45 handgun. Dunn said he would expect a purchaser of the gun manufacturer  to retain the Colt name.  </P></p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Iranians to be deported as 'national security' threat BRITAIN yesterday announced it was deporting three Iranians, two of them locally engaged embassy officials, for reasons of 'national security' in a move that marks a further deterioration in relations between London and Tehran. The deportation order for the three men follows the announcement by the Iranian government earlier this week that it was expelling Mr Geoffrey Brammer, a British diplomat, for 'acts violating diplomatic norms'. The Foreign Office said last night that yesterday's deportation order followed 'painstaking investigations' into the activities of the three Iranians which predated Iran's move against Mr Brammer. The investigations, believed to have involved the Special Branch and MI5, focused on the alleged intelligence activities of the three Iranians among the political dissident community. At least one of the Iranians is thought to have been involving in tracking Mr Salman Rushdie, who is under an Iranian death threat because of his book The Satanic Verses. UK officials played down reports that the three Iranians had got as far as plotting to assassinate Mr Rushdie, and there was no confirmation that one of the Iranians had been spotted at one of the author's public engagements. But friends of the author on the Rushdie Defence Committee said that yesterday's move was a 'further indication of the close connection between planned terrorist acts and the Iranian government', and showed that the death threat was still hanging over Mr Rushdie. One of the Iranians is Mr Mehdi Sayed Sadeghi, who worked in the embassy's passport section. Another is Mr Mahmoud Medhi Soltani, who was in the embassy's public-relations department. Neither was accredited as a diplomat, and Mr Sadeghi is believed to have been working without necessary immigration papers. Officials in the UK could provide few details about the third Iranian, Mr Gassem Vakhshiteh, who had been living in Britain as a student. Last night an Iranian embassy official, who refused to identify himself, accused Britain of taking 'tit-for-tat action'. He described the allegations against two members of the embassy staff as 'absolute nonsense'. He said that the student had arrived in the UK last autumn, but that the embassy had had no contact with him. Until recently UK officials hoped that relations with Iran were improving, particularly after Tehran helped in securing the release of British hostages held in Beirut.</p>

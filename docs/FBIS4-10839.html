According to Deputy Luis German Lagos, a member of the  Innovation and Unity Party, data -- in the hands of the United  Nations -- presented at a recent seminar on human rights in the  United States indicate that President Carlos Roberto Reina could  be a victim of a coup d'etat within a period of time not yet  established.    Nevertheless, the military officer said that if the nation  is  entering a state of law and is initiating a phase of democracy,  such an idea should not even be brought up. "If Gen. Luis  Alonso Discua Elvir, commander in chief of the Armed Forces,  were to propose this type of situation, I would prefer to resign  from my post before breaking my oath to the Constitution and the  laws," he said.    He said that this type of speculation "makes us lose some of  the credibility we have achieved as a nation in the eyes of the  nations of the world," adding that in Honduras the coup d'etat  stage has been overcome and we are now on the road that all  Hondurans wanted. He added that there have been attempts to pin  negative aspects onto Reina's in order to harm his image. "It  is certain we are a poor nation but we are also a nation with  dignity, with an Armed Forces based on the nation's needs.  "While I am at the helm of the Armed Forces such a monstrosity  would not cross my mind," he stressed after recalling that "we  have sworn before the Constitution of the Republic and before  the altar of the nation our loyalty to the established  governments."    Making reference to Deputy Luis German Lagos, Discua Elvir  said that when an independent representative attends events  sponsored by such organizations as the United Nations, he should  be serious enough to weigh this type of information. "A number  of hypothetical aspects and situations related to these  countries were discussed there, he assured, after adding that  these types of matters do not favor the nation. [sentence as  published]    Likewise, he asked all Hondurans to "give their total  support  to President Reina's government for the nation to advance."  Meanwhile, he recognized that the armed institution has many  times voiced its opinion on matters of national interest, but as  recommendations, adding that he personally conveys these to the  president.    "It is shameful that our country is placed on the same level  as African nations where presidents sill die, where there are  coups d'etat." I believe that due to our proximity to North  America where the headquarters of this important organization is  located, this type of situation should not occur," Gen. Discua  noted. "I want to tell the Honduran people and the whole world  that at no time will the Armed Forces think of acting in such a  manner... this was a matter of the past, these were historical,  political moments. I do not think this should be repeated," he  stressed.    According to him, the alleged conspiracy against the  president and the accusations of a coup d'etat are the work of  small groups that want to create distrust within the community  toward their authorities. "They attempt to create a climate of  anxiety and weakness within the community," the military chief  charged. He recalled that Honduras is beginning a new  government that faces a series of problems and the government  does not have a magic wand to resolve the problems immediately.    "We are not in a position to resist, rather we are in a  position to give the president all the support, all the loyalty  he deserves as the nation's first authority," he noted. "I do  not know where they want to take the nation. I believe we  should be the architects of our own destiny, we should be the  ones called on to resolve our own problems," he remarked. "I  hope that we will not have situations similar to those in Mexico  where a political leader dies; Guatemala where a high-ranking  government official is murdered; and other nations where  fratricidal leftist forces have emerged," he said.    Without naming names, Discua said these persons or  institutions do not act like friends of Honduras, which is  striving to come out ahead. He said: It is not true the  military corps has diverted from its constitutional role; "we  continue to support and maintain our institution's  professionalism."    Discua added that, since all the institutions currently face  a difficult situation, the Armed Forces are aware of their new  role in a country that is immersed in a development and  democracy process. The Armed Forces, and not just in Honduras,  have a clearly defined framework where they must assume their  responsibility; "and I have been clear, and sufficiently  explanatory, with the president of the Republic," he said.    Discua thinks the military corps must be the backbone of the  democratic system which prevails in Latin American countries;  and they should not assume a leading role as in previous  decades. "That must now be history; we had our role, but now we  must all become involved in solving the country's problem. We  are contributing our quota of sacrifice; we are assuming our  responsibility; and, logically, we must guarantee the social  welfare of our corps' members."    The Armed Forces chief emphasized he is responsible for the  welfare of its members, and he must keep them trained and ready  to counter any situation which taints, or tries to taint, the  country's sovereignty or threatens its democratic system.    Later, the military commander said the Armed Forces have  clearly defined their role for the future; and he asked  Hondurans who became involved in the previous decade's Cold War  to conduct a self-analysis and see exactly what happened. "I  have always said that whoever tries to see the past is trying to  return to the past," he said when asked if the accusations came  from enemies of the armed corps involved in the 1980's  confrontation.    The military corps looks ahead, toward the country's future,  he said. "If the Honduran people were ever involved in the  defense of an ideological position that was imposed on them, now  is the time to stop and conduct a self-analysis to see exactly  what happened," he demanded. Discua added: It was a cold war,  a situation imposed on our country; and we became involved, in  one way or another, because we believed it was the right thing.  "However, if we continue to look back, some people might return  to the past; but the Armed Forces are not in that situation --  we look ahead and we believe we have a great mission to  accomplish, an important role to play," he emphasized.    Discua Elvir believes the Armed Forces have matured in their  responsibility as an institution. "We should have always had  that maturity but, due to external circumstances, it opposed  many situations with which, perhaps, we never agreed."</p>

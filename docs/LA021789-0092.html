			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A disgruntled bank employee who opened fire on his co-workers, killing three of  them and then himself, had an extensive history of psychiatric treatment,  officials said. Emanuel Tsegaye, 33, a bill collector who worked for Chevy  Chase Federal Savings Bank's credit card center in Bethesda, Md., had been  quietly feuding with supervisors for weeks, co-workers said. Officials of the  Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said that Tsegaye had been  treated at a maximum-security psychiatric hospital for more than two years  after threatening a police officer. He was declared criminally insane.  Officials speculated that Tsegaye's mental problems began in his home country  of Ethiopia, where he was hospitalized for depression in the 1970s.  </P></p>

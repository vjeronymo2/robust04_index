			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WITNESS WAS THE REAL KILLER, LAWYER ASSERTS  </P> <P> The attorney for a Palmdale man charged with the execution-style slaying of two  other men Wednesday accused an alleged witness of being the real killer.  </P> <P> In his opening statement, attorney Leonard R. Milstein charged that Dan Lucero  intended to kill defendant Brad Millward but accidentally shot one of the  victims instead.  </P> <P> If convicted, Millward faces the death penalty for first-degree murder in the  July 5, 1987, killings of Bruce Gruber, 28, of Yucca Valley and Albert Dulyea,  37, of Norwalk. Both men were shot in the desert east of Palmdale.  </P> <P> Over nearly five days of testimony before a San Fernando Superior Court jury,  Lucero, 22, of Palmdale, testified that he, his wife and two children were  driving along Avenue P when he saw Millward holding a gun several inches from  Gruber's head. Lucero said he heard a gunshot, then saw Gruber fall to the  ground and Millward flee into the desert.  </P> <P> Lucero, who said he had never met Millward or Gruber, brought the dying Gruber  to the police station with the assistance of several passers-by.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bullet-Riddled Body  </P> <P> Milstein told the jury that Lucero brought Gruber's body to authorities to  cover up his crime. He charged that Lucero, Gruber and other members of an  Antelope Valley drug-trafficking ring killed Dulyea because they thought that  he and Millward were federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents. Dulyea's  bullet-riddled body was found in Millward's garage.  </P> <P> Gruber was killed accidentally by Lucero after Gruber caught Millward as he was  attempting to escape, Milstein said.  </P> <P> Gruber and another man caught Millward and wrestled him into a brown  Oldsmobile, the lawyer said. Millward managed to steer the car off the road,  get out and run into the desert, Milstein alleged. But Gruber caught him and  then Lucero, who had been following in his own car, fired at Millward, but  fatally wounded Gruber, Milstein said.  </P> <P> While he was on the stand, Lucero repeatedly denied killing Gruber and denied  involvement in a methamphetamine ring.  </P></p>

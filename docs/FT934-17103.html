			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / International Company News: Banesto unveils shake-up of industrial portfolio BANESTO, the big Spanish bank, yesterday announced a divestment in the steel sector and plans to buy out minority shareholders in Corporacion Banesto, the umbrella company for its industrial assets. The bank said that it had reduced its stake in Acerinox, the profitable stainless steel producer, from 35 per cent to 8 per cent, though a placement with European and US producers lead-managed by JP Morgan Securities. Banesto, which owns 85 per cent of Corporacion Banesto, plans a public share offer for the outstanding 15 per cent of the industrial conglomerate. The bid, worth Dollars 126m, is being made to gain full fiscal advantage. Under Spanish tax laws, ownership in excess of 90 per cent allows the parent institution to consolidate results. The disposal of the Acerinox interests is the first Banesto divestment to be managed by JP Morgan. It follows a wide-ranging agreement cemented with the US investment bank earlier this year, and designed to raise Dollars 1.1bn in capital. The steel disposal, for Dollars 213m, will give Banesto an estimated capital gain of Dollars 28m. Under central bank guidelines, domestic financial institutions have to reduce industrial holdings in their accounts to 20 per cent of the capital by 1998. Before the Acerinox disposal, Banesto had a capital-to-industrial holding ratio of around 39 per cent. Acerinox, which controls 65 per cent of the domestic stainless steel market and is the fifth-largest producer in Europe, posted net profits of Dollars 23.6m in the first six months of this year. Banesto is offering Pta2,500 for each outstanding share in its industrial conglomerate - a price which represents a 25 per cent premium on the average share value over the past six months, and is Pta425 up on the Thursday closing price of Pta2,075. The shares were suspended before the market opened yesterday. The minority interests are widely distributed, save for a 3 per cent stake owned by AGF, the French insurance group. Analysts said Banesto could be 'tidying up' its control over the industrial group as a preparation for further disposals. Over the past two years, the bank has sold the refinery and petrol distributor Petromed, its combined cement interests, and a stake in the insurance company Union y Fenix. JP Morgan manages the Corsair Fund, an equity port-folio which owns 7.9 per cent of Banesto.</p>

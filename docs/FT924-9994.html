			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Fear of new IRA mainland campaign RUC CHIEF Constable Sir Hugh Annesley yesterday warned of a heightened IRA terror campaign on the British mainland with more and bigger bombs. The latest outbreak of violence in London, he said, was only a foretaste of what might happen. It was clear that militarists now held sway within the republican movement. Sir Hugh told the BBC Northern Ireland programme Inside Ulster that lives had been saved and damage prevented because of interruptions to IRA attacks in London. But he warned: 'It would be nave to think the Provisional IRA are not planning a major attack on the British mainland.' The provisionals, he said, were well armed and determined to keep going, even though a debate was in progress within the republican movement. 'Those who are intent on pursuing violence are perhaps holding the majority sway now within the IRA army council,' Sir Hugh said. He said loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland posed a 'significant threat' in the Irish Republic. Meanwhile, the Association of Chief Police Officers defended the present structure of police ranks, saying the way the structure was used was more pertinent than any debate about 'losing ranks'. Its comments were in response to the Sheehy inquiry into police rewards and duties.</p>

There, he put forward the new idea  about the "New Pacific Community." In November, he played host  to leaders of the organization for Asia Pacific Economic  Cooperation [APEC] and held the first informal meeting with  them. Such major diplomatic moves adopted by Clinton in Asia  prompted people to analyze and comment on the U.S. foreign  policy trend. The European allies on the other side of the  Atlantic Ocean doubted and worried that the United States might  shift the focus of its foreign policy "eastward." Thus, a U.S.  State Department spokesman appeased the Europeans by quoting a  children's song: "Making new friends but not forgetting old  friendships; one is silver and the other is gold." In January  this year, Clinton attended the NATO summit meeting in Brussels  and then visited Prague and Moscow. According to the White  House timetable, he will still make a second visit to Europe  this year. The "old friends" reacted warmly. Britain's Thames  Television said: "Europe remains the U.S. first lover."    What then are the specific positions Europe and Asia  separately hold in the U.S. diplomatic pattern? To answer this  question, we should first know what objective is being pursued  by the United States in its foreign affairs. There are three  major pillars in the U.S. foreign policy: Economic security,  military strength, and the advancement of "democracy." All this  is aimed at safeguarding U.S. global interests and its "leading  position." If we put Europe and Asia to the two sides of such a  scale by comparison, it may not be difficult for us to find the  answer.    Let us first view the issue of economic security, to which  the United States gives top priority. In Europe (mainly Western  Europe) there exists 50 percent of U.S. corporations' overseas  investment (about $120 billion), 60 percent of their overseas  profits, and 65 percent of all foreign investment made by the  United States. For example, up to the end of 1992, the  investment made by American companies was only $78 billion. In  addition, the European Community is also a major region where  the United States can achieve a foreign trade surplus. Asia is  the region which absorbs the largest part of U.S. exports ($127  billion in 1992 against $117 billion to Europe) and is also the  region where U.S. exports have increased at the fastest speed.  Between 1978 and 1992, the U.S. exports to Asia have multiplied  over four times but, in the same period, the U.S. exports to  Europe multiplied 2.9 times. The exports to Asia provide 2.5  million jobs in the United States (those to Europe creating some  2 million jobs). More importantly, as the region recording the  fastest economic growth in the contemporary world, Asia has  development prospects which are strongly attractive to the  United States. In the 1960's, Asia's total GNP accounted for  only 4 percent of the world's total. The proportion has now  increased to 25 percent and it is expected that it will reach 30  percent in the early 21st century. The volume of trade in Asia  now accounts for 25 percent of the world's total, the foreign  exchange reserves kept by the central banks in Asia accounts for  33 percent of the world's total, and Asia's population accounts  for 59 percent of the world's total. As long as the U.S. share  of this huge market increases by 1 percentage point, some  300,000 jobs will be added to the U.S. job market. In such  circumstances, it is not hard to understand why President  Clinton, who took reinvigoration of the U.S. economy as his  priority task, is trying to make a "new friend" out of Asia.    We can then review the issue of national security backed by  its military strength, an objective pursued by the United  States. In this regard, the United States is facing two vistas  which are in striking contrast to each other. Europe: After  the end of the Cold War, the Warsaw Pact was dissolved and the  confrontation between two major military blocs came to an end.  However, ethnic conflicts, territorial disputes, and religious  contradictions previously covered up by the Cold War were all  revealed. Europe cannot earn any "peace dividend"; on the  contrary, it has become a new center of turbulence. The civil  war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has not only shocked Europe but also  threatened stability in other regions of the world and posed a  challenge against the U.S. "leading position." Asia: Problems  in such hot spots as Cambodia and Afghanistan were successively  settled, mitigated, or turned into internal strife. Conflicts  there have calmed down. The parties concerned are carrying out  dialogue and negotiations on the nuclear issue on the Korean  Peninsula. Although there are difficulties and twists and  turns, the direct dialogue on an equal footing and negotiations  are favorable to the proper settlement of the contradictions and  problems. China is pursuing an independent and peace-oriented  foreign policy and is making great contributions to the  maintenance of peace and stability in Asia. As compared with  other regions of the world, Asia enjoys a rather stable  political situation. In such circumstances, it is not hard to  understand why President Clinton, who announced that the United  States "must lead the world," declared: "The core of our  security remains in Europe."    The so-called "promotion of democracy" means to promote the  political and economic systems of the West all over the world  and this will guarantee the security of the United States. In  this regard, there are different opinions inside the United  States. Former secretary of state Henry Kissinger recently  refuted the viewpoint that countries adopting Western-style  "democracy" will not launch a war and that countries adopting  the Western-style market economy will automatically become  "democratic." Kissinger said that "this was not the inevitable  result" but we will not discuss this here. In view of the  strategic needs in "promoting democracy," the United States  considers Europe as its cooperation partner. The United States  and Europe share the same cultural traditions, the same social  systems, and the same values. So, the "old friendship" will not  be forgotten.    Such characteristics and changes in the situations in Europe  and Asia, especially the increasing importance of economic  factors in post-Cold War international relations, have prompted  the United States to adjust its policies toward Europe and Asia.  Clinton explicitly pointed out: "While the focus of our  attention has shifted to the real global economic challenge, we  must not only direct our eyes toward the other side of the  Atlantic Ocean but also toward the other side of the Pacific  Ocean." The U.S. strategy of facing both oceans serves its  national interests. At the same time, such a strategy will also  provide more room for its diplomatic maneuvers. People have  noted that late last year, when the United States and Europe  were involved in a fierce dispute over the issue of farm produce  trade in the Uruguay Round of trade talks, Clinton frankly said  that if the talks failed, APEC would "provide us with the means  of expanding our market in the Asia-Pacific region." His visits  to Europe this year will give a similar hint to Japan, which  said "no" to the United States in their trade talks. Therefore,  President Clinton will continue to maneuver between his "old  friend" and "new friend" according to changes in the  international situation in order to safeguard the U.S. national  interests and will further readjust his diplomatic tactics to  deal with the two oceans.</p>

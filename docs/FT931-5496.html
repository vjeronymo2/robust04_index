			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Galliford subsides to Pounds 327,000 GALLIFORD, the specialist contracting and housing group, yesterday announced a drop in profits and a near-halving of its interim dividend. The shares dropped 8p on the day to close at 39p. The Leicestershire-based group blamed the damp British climate on top of inclement trading conditions for an 84 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.06m to Pounds 327,000. Mr Peter Galliford, chairman, said the results, for the half year to December 1992, should be seen in the light of 'the wettest autumn weather for many years and the combined effect on our employees in the field'. The interim dividend is cut from 0.95p to, 0.5p. Earnings per share fell to 0.27p (1.56p). Group turnover increased by 3 per cent from Pounds 105.9m to Pounds 109.3m. The group held Pounds 5m (Pounds 6m) cash at the bank at the end of December. It has a comparatively cheap stock of land.</p>

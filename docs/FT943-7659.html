			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK scoreboard is just a starting point for research on company R&amp;D spend Sir, It may help to pass the time for Dr Alan Smith ('Flaws inherent in R&amp;D scoreboard', August 17) and Dennis Henry ('Added value should be real value for R&amp;D', August 1) to shoot holes in the 'UK R&amp;D Scoreboard', but they seem to miss the point. I cannot speak for Company Reporting or the Department of Trade and Industry  -I merely write the introduction to the scoreboard in an attempt to provide some light relief from the tables of data - but as a long-time consumer of such data, I see the scoreboard as a beginning rather than an end. It is yet another source of information that an observer can use when trying to compare and contrast companies. Alan Smith seems to say that the only thing that matters is added value. He then goes on to say that this is 'not something that can be measured easily and quickly'. This comes after he accuses companies of accounting for R&amp;D in diverse ways. Imagine the fun and games that would ensue when trying to agree a definition of added value. The way to benchmark companies and their R&amp;D performance is to look at their operation in depth, not at tables of numbers. The numbers can, though, be a starting point. You need them before you can ask questions about added value. Alan Smith says that he is happy to support the R&amp;D scoreboard if it is 'going to encourage companies to spend more on R&amp;D'. Surely the point is not to persuade companies to spend more, but to convince them that they should look intelligently at their R&amp;D spending, perhaps with the aid of tools like the scoreboard, to see how it compares with that of others in their sector. They might then realise that R&amp;D is something that they can manage in the same way that they manage other aspects of their businesses. Added value is but one way of looking at performance. Many companies look at their performance in terms of quality and 'time to market' as much as added value. They should apply the same criteria to their R&amp;D spending.

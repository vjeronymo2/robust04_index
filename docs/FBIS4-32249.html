			<p>BFN     [Text] The Constitutional Court reviewed the case  initiated by 49 people's deputies of the Union of Democratic  Forces [SDS] in connection with the parliament's vote on the  structural changes proposed by the prime minister on 20 May.  Constitutional Court Judge Aleksandur Arabadzhiev reports the  court's decision:    [Begin Arabadzhiev recording] The prime minister has no  constitutional obligation to submit his cabinet's resignation  when the National Assembly rejects one of his proposals to  establish new ministries or make changes in the membership of  the cabinet. [end recording]    The prime minister has to resign when the National Assembly  votes no-confidence in the cabinet or in him personally, or when  the cabinet does not receive the vote of confidence it had  demanded. The rest, Mr. Arabadzhiev added, is a matter of  political culture and tradition.</p>

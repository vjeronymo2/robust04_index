			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Market):  Gold slides to fresh 6-year low THE GOLD price slipped to a fresh six-year low of Dollars 336.80 a troy ounce at Thursday morning's London bullion morning fixing, catching up with a heavy overnight sell-off in New York. But the New York opening found the gold market cautiously firmer, as holders of short positions covered ahead of the long holiday weekend, and by the close the London price had edged up to Dollars 336.85 an ounce, down Dollars 4.55 since the end of last week. The gold market had begun the week in a mildly bullish mood as buying was encouraged by news of the Russian cabinet's resignation offer. But the rise quickly ran into US selling, which undermined support in the Dollars 342-an-ounce area, and the London price ended the day 40 cents down. Dealers thought at that time that the market was likely to hold above Dollars 338 an ounce ahead of the Easter break. But on Tuesday it drooped under the weight of fresh wave of profit-taking after US retail sales figures proved to be no better than expected. And with concern for the stability of the Yeltsin regime continuing to ease, Wednesday saw the breach of the Dollars 338-an-ounce level. Dealers were not too downhearted, however, about the post-holiday prospects for the gold market. Most thought it was close to bottoming out - some said at Dollars 334 and others at Dollars 330 an ounce. That might be followed by a short-covering rally, they said, helped by Far East buying and a pick-up in demand from the jewellery business. Platinum and silver prices were also under pressure this week, the former - which ended Dollars 5 down at Dollars 344.50 an ounce - from further bouts of Japanese selling. The London cash silver price ended poised precariously at the psychologically significant Dollars 4-an-ounce level, down 15 cents on balance. Traders thought a breach of that level could quickly signal a further 10-cent loss for silver and a move into an area where speculative interest might evaporate. Most London Metal Exchange base metals contracts gained ground on Thursday, but only nickel, cash zinc and copper finished with net gains on the week. In the copper market the three months position closed at Pounds 1,291.50 a tonne, up Pounds 11 on the week. Earlier it had dipped to Pounds 1,270 a tonne before bouncing on news of a sub-level closure because of rock falls at Chile's giant El Teniente mine, although Codelco, the state company that runs the mine, said overall output would not be affected. The worries about the stability of the Russian administration also lifted aluminium prices briefly. But after reaching a 9-month high of Dollars 1,342.50 a tonne on Tuesday the cash price declined to Dollars 1,329 a tonne at Thursday's close, down Dollars 9.50 on the shortened week. Thursday's zinc price recovery saw the cash position gain Dollars 13 at Dollars 1,306 a tonne, up Dollars 2 on balance. But the market was still being distorted by the apparent supply tightness that prompted the exchange to warn traders last week that it was closely monitoring the situation. This week the three months price declined by Dollars 9 to Dollars 1,278.50 a tonne, so the cash premium, or 'backwardation' widened by another Dollars 11 to Dollars 27.50 a tonne. At the London Futures and Options Exchange coffee prices were down heavily from the outset on disappointment at the extremely modest progress made at last week's International Coffee Organisation talks on negotiations for a new price supporting coffee pact. After falling by Dollars 36 a tonne in the July position on Monday the market was steadier, but 'under siege', traders said, on Tuesday and Wednesday. The defences crumbled in New York on Wednesday night and by Thursday's close London's July price had lost another Dollars 19 at Dollars 801 a tonne, down Dollars 63 on the week. In the cocoa market too, it was activity in New York that sparked a heavy fall on Thursday. London's July futures price fell Pounds 19 yesterday to Pounds 619 a tonne, down Pounds 15 on the week. Traders attributed the US selling to liquidation by long holders as the near May position approached the start of its expiry period. Earlier London prices had been steadied by an unexpectedly big 21.1 per cent rise in UK first quarter bean grindings. A 21.2 per cent rise was reported yesterday for the Dutch grind, but analysts thought the figure was inflated by under-reporting in the corresponding period last year. Talks on a new international cocoa agreement with economic clauses begin in Geneva after the holiday, but serious negotiations still seem some way off and traders were not pinning any great hopes on bullish developments. 'We should clear the ground for serious negotiations on the withholding scheme,' the German delegate to the International Cocoa Organisation said yesterday.</p>

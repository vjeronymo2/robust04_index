			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Management: Pioneer who demands change at the top MURIEL SIEBERT's appointment as the first woman member of the New York Stock Exchange on December 28, 1967, was unusual enough to warrant a front page photograph and article in the New York Times. Since then, Siebert has become a familiar face, not just because she is a high-profile woman in a masculine world, but also because of her achievements in government - she was New York's superintendent of banks between 1977 and 1982 - and her work for charities. Siebert has been a pioneer in more ways than one. On 'May Day' in 1975 - when fixed commissions for stockbrokers were abolished in the US - her firm became one of the country's first 'discount brokers' to cut transaction fees charged to investors, a move that earned her many enemies on Wall Street. After more than two decades at the top, Siebert remains committed to her various causes - especially supporting women in business. She says: 'The men at the top of industry and government should be more willing to risk sharing leadership with women and minority members who are not merely clones of their white male buddies. 'In these fast-changing times we need different viewpoints and experiences, we need an enlarged talent bank. The real risk lies in continuing to do things the way they've always been done.'</p>

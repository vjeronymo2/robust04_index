			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Malaysia moves to trim sultans' powers THE Malaysian parliament begins debating measures today to limit the powers of the country's nine sultans, or hereditary rulers, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. In what is seen as one of the most crucial political acts in Malaysia for several years, the government, led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, wants to remove constitutional provisions which give the sultans, each of whom takes a turn as king, immunity from prosecution. The proposed amendments include abolishing the right of the sultans to pardon themselves and members of their families and provisions which forbid adverse comment being made in parliament about the royalty. While there is little doubt MPs will approve the amendments, there could be a crisis should the sultans not give their approval to the measures. Some have indicated they are unwilling to support the government's actions. There are also some doubts about popular support for the moves.</p>

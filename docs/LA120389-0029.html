			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD ALATORRE  </P> <P> I wish that Richard Alatorre would stay where he is and give up his crossover  dreams. I have not seen any convincing evidence that the election of a Hispanic  mayor in any large, or comparatively large, American city, such as Los Angeles  or San Diego, would be conducive to the concrete betterment of most Hispanics,  Latinos, Chicanos or whatever we wish to call ourselves.  </P> <P> I think that we should learn from the experience of blacks in this regard.  During the last 20 years, blacks have been elected mayors of some of the  largest urban centers in the country; yet, the rate of social problems among  blacks is now worse. The reasons for this apparent paradox are not hard to  find: In order to maintain their power base, mayors have to compromise with the  very same interest groups that benefit the most from prevailing arrangements.  Police departments, school boards and most of the other institutions that touch  and affect the lives of most minority citizens are beyond the mayors' control.  </P> <P> In situations such as these, it would be better for ethnic politicians such as  Alatorre to borrow a line from Voltaire's "Candide" and apply it to their own  lives: "Cultivate your own garden."  </P> <P> RAMON OCEGUERA  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

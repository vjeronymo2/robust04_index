			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Russians agonising over privatisation: Capitalism is almost unknown  - but if sell-offs fail, all fails THE Russian government is soon to embark on the toughest and most delicate part of its reform process: turning state property into private hands. If it fails, all fails. Only the creation of a property-owning class can institutionalise the market system which government ministers are struggling to tear out of the ruins of state socialism. It is an enterprise more fraught with danger, even, than the liberalisation of prices at the start of the year. Prices have been raised before, if not by so much, but private property and capitalist ownership and control are unknown to almost everyone in the former Soviet Union. Even before the 1917 revolution, it had only a tenuous and unpopular existence. The privatisation programme is already late, and has so far realised little of the over-ambitious target of Rbs92bn from sales set by the government for this year. That is because the ministers still agonise over a delicately balanced set of privileges and opportunities which they hope will allow this most decisive of reforms to take root in hard ground. Its lateness means that it will get fully under way just as unemployment, still very low, begins to rise in the second half of this year. The government thus faces an unenviable coincidence: the selling of companies which provided job security at the same time as job losses mount. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, said in a recent interview that three main tasks were to be achieved in 1993: the privatisation of small enterprises by auction or tender; the transformation of large enterprises into joint stock companies; and the creation of a system of privatisation vouchers to be distributed to citizens. On small privatisation, Mr Chubais admitted the government would resort to 'standard bureaucratic procedures', to force local administrators to privatise 50-60 per cent of shops by the end of this year, and to transform larger enterprises into joint stock companies and privatise part of these by the end of 1993. Regional governors, who are appointed by the Russian president, will be given quotas of businesses to be privatised, and will be dismissed if they fail to meet those quotas. Mr Chubais said: 'Normal bureaucrats don't want to be the first to privatise but they also don't want to be the last. The way is now clear. The decision to privatise is now a decision of the government and of President (Boris) Yeltsin. We have enough instruments to force local authorities to do the job.' A State Programme of Privatisation of State and Municipally-Owned Enterprises has been prepared by the government with the assistance of experts from the World Bank. It still has to be endorsed by the parliament  -as does a law on bankruptcy, which Mr Chubais said was now complete, and which will allow companies that cannot survive to go to the wall. The minister emphasised: 'There will be privileges for different parts of the population: it is very important that people do not feel this exercise is for the benefit of the old nomenklatura and the mafia.' Workers, for example, will receive 25 per cent of the equity in larger enterprises, and managers 5 per cent, both in the form of non-voting shares free of charge. A voucher system, which will allow all Russian citizens to receive shares in the companies as of right, is being worked out, and will be launched in the autumn, though this is an extremely complex task. For Russians who can afford to pay  - of whom a part would be drawn from those who had been high in the previous power structure, or who had acquired their money illegally  - there would be an open auction of shares, without any privileges. There will be resistance 'and so we must be quite flexible,' said Mr Chubais. 'But we cannot stop 'nomenklatura privatisation' (the system under which managers, sometimes in co-operation with the workers, take over the company by making themselves the owners of the shares). We have had no legal basis for privatisation until now: all privatisation has been semi-legal. The only way to curb spontaneous privatisation is to introduce a normal legal structure.' Foreigners will be allowed to play a part. The government intends to 'multiply the book value of the property (sold to foreigners) by some coefficient,' says Mr Chubais. 'There could be special auctions only for foreigners, but this is still to be decided.' In the energy sector, the object of most attention from foreign companies, a special programme of privatisation and exploitation rights is still being debated. The state oil corporation bosses, hostile to extensive rights for foreign companies, believe that all they need is more money and technology, and that with these they can themselves turn round the fall in production and exports. The experience of Nizhny Novgorod, to which Mr Chubais and his colleagues look with hope, has been offset by the experiences of Moscow and St Petersburg, where most shops have simply been handed over to the workers through fear that auctions would court too much unpopularity. Mr Chubais dismisses the capital as 'another republic', and insists on a more open system. It will need a steady nerve to see it through.</p>

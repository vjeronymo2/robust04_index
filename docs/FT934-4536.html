			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Judgment reserved in pub lease claim The High Court yesterday reserved judgment on a move by Courage, the brewer, to block a pub landlord's claim that it must renew his old lease instead of offering him new terms. Courage says it cannot renew Mr James Little's five-year lease because it could lead the company into breaching regulations aimed at freeing pubs from the control of the big brewers. Mr Little has refused to sign a new lease requiring him to pay more than double the rent.</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / International Company News: Williams' USDollars 200m refinancing The raising of USDollars 200m by Williams Holdings may arouse speculation that the acquisitive UK conglomerate is set to embark on further expansion. Only last February it bought Yale &amp; Valor for Pounds 330m. Williams said, however, that the proceeds from the issue to Prudential Insurance of America of fixed rate senior notes at 9.65 per cent, repayable between 2000 and 2002, were intended to refinance existing dollar bank borrowings of US subsidiaries of Yale &amp;Valor. The notes are guaranteed by Williams. Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman of Williams, said the proceeds wouldreplace bank borrowings, and strengthen the basis for the continuing growth of US businesses.</p>

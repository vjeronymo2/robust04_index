			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Arts: Il viaggio a Reims - Opera This piece d'occasion was devised by Rossini to celebrate the 1825 coronation of Charles X, allowed to disappear into obscurity immediately afterwards and then re-discovered after a gap of nearly 160 years. The first ever Royal Opera production has been mounted to mark several milestones. One is the composer's own 200th anniversary, which fell on February 29. (In the opera's finale, originally a hymn to Charles X, the name of Rossini replaces the king's in Balocchi's libretto and on the singers' lips, while his bust set atop a circling globe descends from the flies.) Another is the start of Britain's tenure of the EC presidency. A third is the launch of the six-month-long, cross-Britain European Arts Festival linked to the presidency; the festival administration sponsored Saturday's big screen relay in the Covent Garden piazza. These are all worthy ventures, significant occasions in their own right, so it is painful to have to report that three hours and 15 minutes of the most god-awful tomfoolery are being dished up for their benefit. In brief, the work is reduced in John Cox's production and Mark Thompson's designs to a series of bone-achingly tedious farcical sketches; the peculiar beauty, verve, charm and delicacy of the music are positively scarred by the stage routines. The excitement of the Viaggio a Reims re-discovery lay in large part in the delighted recognition that the cantata scenica was no sample of 'occasional' artificiality but a fabulous piece of Rossinian compositorial ingenuity and, furthermore, a light-as-air comic divertissement, set in a spa hotel, with two substantial linked purposes at its core. These were the celebration of the coronation via the singing powers of ten of the Italian vocal virtuosos of his day; and the creation of a vision of human peace, concord and harmony that makes the work at once historically special and universal. Covent Garden have undertaken their interpretation of these purposes with perfect wrongheadedness. The casting of the ten principal roles is, to put it bluntly, inadequate; and the light-as-air comedy is transmogrified into a tacky hotel caper firmly rooted in tired musicals and telly spectaculars equally. There are two John Coxes. Jekyll-Cox is a civilised and intelligent producer capable (in the Glyndebourne Capriccio and ENO Cosi) of elegant ensemble performance. Hyde-Cox is a farceur capable (in the Glyndebourne Cenerentola) of the most coarse-grained vulgarity. The Viaggio producer is Hyde-Cox, inventor of a string of much-repeated sight-gags: the exercising spa-patron gag, the dancing bellhops in yellow gag, the revolving door gag, the hooped petticoat gag, the hat gag, the apple gag, the English milord with his Scots flautist (]) gag, the St Trinian schoolgirls in specs with bowls of flowers gag, the luggage gag, the can-can gag, the Danish flag gag, and so on and on and on. (There is no Maastricht gag: some mistake surely . . .) The idea that the notes and words could serve as the opera's dramatic vehicle seems not to have entered Cox's head. The costumes are loudly coloured, extravagantly cut and typescreaming 'Comic Character]' so frenetically that any effort at wit or vivacity of delivery on the part of the people inside them is rendered entirely nugatory. My guess is that people who come to know the opera through this first Covent Garden staging - rather than through the 1984 DG 'premiere' recording or the Guildhall School's enchanting 1987 student production - will come to wonder why the company wasted time, energy and money on tackling it at all. After the Guildhall performance I wrote that it seemed 'likely to leave (at least) one London Rossinian with a blissful smile on his face for days afterwards'; that the opposite can confidently be predicted of this Covent Garden experience is perhaps the greatest outrage of all. Two of the ten principal singers might be called native Rossinians (though both seem some way beyond their best singing days): Della Jones as Melibea and Montserrat Caballe as the hotel patronne. Mme Caballe indulges in an ad lib relationship with the audience that begins amusingly but soon turns embarrassing; I feel sorry that this undignified, vocally fragile appearance may well provide the house with its final memories of one of the century's great singers. The rest can be catalogued as follows: one tenor (John Aler) of at least neat, musicianly vocal style, two sopranos (the gorgeous-toned Renee Fleming, the gently musical Sylvia McNair) who might in other circumstances have been guided to less unconvincing Rossini vocal manners, one hugely promising bass (Alastair Miles) no less ill-served - and a group of admirable Anglo-Saxon singing-actors entirely out of their Fach. The fact that there are no Italians in the cast is a general error and a particular weakness in the case of the buffo roles. The conductor, Carlo Rizzi, is Italian, and a trimly energetic musician - but also an unloving one, who rushes the ensembles unmercifully and who finds neither grace nor gaiety in Rossini phrasing. The Royal Opera have offered a run of high-quality performances this season. Sad that it should be broken, and the season concluded, with this absolute turkey. Sponsored by Friends of Covent Garden; in repertory until July 17.</p>

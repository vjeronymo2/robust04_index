In a statement today, he said that this action was  supposed to have been done earlier, but is still good  nonetheless. He said that according to the reports we have  received, the resolution on moving heavy weapons 20 km from  Sarajevo has been violated. He stressed the need to strike at  the forces that violate this resolution.</p>

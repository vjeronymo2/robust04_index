			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY HOPES AWARD WILL BOOST IMAGE  </P> <P> Inglewood officials are hoping the "All-America City Award" that the city won  recently along with nine other municipalities nationwide will go a long way  toward polishing the city's image.  </P> <P> City officials say they will use the honor to publicize Inglewood as a  middle-class, multi-ethnic city where residents and officials have joined to  reduce crime and beat back drug dealers.  </P> <P> The city will advertise the award by adding the "All-America" designation to  everything from official city stationery to street signs and the prominent  "Welcome to Inglewood" sign that greets visitors at the city's Manchester  Boulevard entrance.  </P> <P> "You'll definitely know you're in an All-America city," said Mayor Edward  Vincent. "We're going to have it on our driveways, our storefronts -- we're  going to have it everywhere that we're an All-America city."  </P> <P> Inglewood was the only city in California to receive the honor, given annually  by the National Civic League, after a two-day competition with 109 other  applicants in Chicago.  </P></p>

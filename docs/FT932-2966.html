			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries slip back after warning on deficit AFTER rising sharply on another set of positive inflation data, longer-dated Treasury prices fell back yesterday after a senior Clinton administration official warned about cutting the deficit too fast. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was unchanged at 103 7/8 , yielding 6.815 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was firmer, up  5/32 at 100 3/32 , to yield 4.057 per cent. In the morning, the long-awaited May consumer prices figures proved bullish for bond market sentiment. The Labor department announced that the consumer price index last month rose 0.1 per cent, and the 'core' rate (excluding the volatile food and energy components) rose 0.2 per cent. The data was slightly better than analysts had forecast, and following last week's smaller-than-expected rise in producer prices, it helped ease investors' fears about resurgent inflation. In particular, the May numbers make it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will now raise interest rates to curb inflationary pressures in the economy, and have reduced much of the uncertainty that has been dogging the bond market for the past month. Against this positive background, prices rose strongly in early trading. In the afternoon, the short end of the market held on to most of its gains as big hedge funds loaded up on shorter-dated securities, but the long end lost ground. It was hit by comments from Ms Laura Tyson, chairman of the president's council of economic advisers, who warned that if the deficit is cut too fast, the benefits of lower interest rates could be lost. GERMAN government bonds fell as hopes of lower interest rates receded before today's repo announcement. The September bund futures fell 0.20 to 94.86 during official trading, principally because of profit-taking following Monday's rally. In after hours trading, the contract recovered to 94.96. Sellers latched on to the Bundesbank's statement that today's repo rate would be variable. They inferred that the German central bank was not interested in steering the rate lower and that it would be held at 7.6 per cent again. PROFIT-TAKING left its mark on French government bonds in early trading. But the rate cut apologists moved in later and countered the selling pressure to leave long-dated bonds marginally firmer. The Bund-OAT spread narrowed to 18 basis points as investors moved along the French yield curve. The trend towards buying at the long end has prompted some concern that the imminent auction of FFr15bn-FFr17bn of five-year bonds will see poor interest, especially as there is already supply pressure from the impending issue of the so-called Balladur bonds. On the Matif, the June futures contract was four basis points higher at 118.70 by the official close and continued firmer in after-hours trading. UK government bonds slipped before the chancellor's Mansion House speech. September gilt futures lost most of the previous day's gains falling  5/32 to 104 1/2 . The chancellor's commitment to low inflation will be encouraging to the bond market but there is unlikely to be a great deal to latch on to in what is now seen as a general appraisal of the UK's economic position. Dealers will look to the release tomorrow of the latest unemployment data.</p>

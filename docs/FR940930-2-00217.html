The shares of the Trusts, except for money market funds, are currently sold at net asset value (``NAV'') subject to a conventional front-end sales charge. Each Trust has also adopted a distribution plan in accordance with rule 12b&hyph;1 authorizing it to pay LFBDS a distribution fee (the ``Distribution Plan'') (collectively, the Distribution Plans and the Administrative Services Plans are referred to herein as the ``Plans''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants propose to establish a Multiple Distribution system enabling each fund to offer investors the option of purchasing shares with either (a) A front-end sales load (which may vary among the Funds) (except for sales of $1 million or more which are subject to a CDSC for the twelve-month period following purchase and except in the case of the money market funds) and, in most cases, Plans providing for a distribution fee and/or service fee and/or shareholder servicing fee (the ``Front-End Load Option'' or ``Class A shares''), (b) without a front-end sales load but subject to a CDSC (which may vary among the Funds) and Plans providing for a distribution fee and/or service fee and/or shareholder servicing fee (the ``Deferred Option'' or ``Class B shares'), or (c) without a front-end sales load or CDSC, but subject to Plans providing for a distribution fee and/or service fee and/or shareholder servicing fee (the ``Level Load Option'' or ``Class C shares''). It is presently intended that the money market funds other than Landmark Cash Reserves (``LCR''), a series of Landmark Funds III, will offer only one class of shares which will be sold without a front-end load or CDSC but subject to Plans providing for a distribution and/or service and/or shareholder servicing fee. Any distribution arrangement of a Fund, including distribution and service fees and front-end and deferred sales loads, will comply with the NASD rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants also seek authority to create one or more additional classes of shares in the future, the terms of which differ from the Class A, Class B, and Class C shares only in the following respects: (i) Any such class may bear different distribution, service, and shareholder servicing fees (or may have no distribution, service, or shareholder servicing fees) and any other costs relating to implementing the Plans for such class or an amendment to such Plans (including obtaining shareholder approval of such Plans or any amendment thereto), (ii) any such class may bear any incremental difference in transfer agency fees, (iii) any such class may bear different class designations, (iv) voting rights on matters which pertain to the Plans, except as provided in condition 15, (v) any such class may bear any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to such class which shall be approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order, (vi) any such class may have different conversion features, (vii) any such class may have different exchange privileges, and (viii) any such class will bear only those printing and postage expenses (not otherwise payable by a shareholder servicing agent) relating to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxy statements (hereafter ``Class Expenses'') relating to that class of shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. After a shareholder's Class B shares remain outstanding for a specified period of time (not to exceed eight years), they will automatically convert to Class A shares of the same Fund at the relative net asset values of each of the classes, and will thereafter be subject to the lower aggregate distribution, service, and shareholder servicing fees under the Class A Plans applicable to the Class A shares. For purposes of conversion to Class A, all shares in a shareholder's account purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in respect of Class B shares will considered to be held in the separate sub-account. Each time any Class B shares in the shareholder's account convert to Class A, a proportional amount of Class B shares in the sub-account will also convert to Class A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Any other class of shares may provide that shares in that class (the ``Purchase Class'') will, after a period of time, automatically convert into another class of shares (the ``Target Class'') on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge, provided that, after conversion, the converted shares would be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in the NASD rule) and/or a shareholder servicing fee, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee and shareholder servicing fee to which the Purchase Class shares were subject prior to the conversion. Such a conversion feature will be described in the relevant prospectus. (The term ``Purchase Class'' hereafter refers to any class of shares, including Class B shares, with a conversion feature). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Non-state-owned  technological enterprises, which adopt flexible measures to turn  scientific findings into new products, have achieved an  important status in Shanghai's science and technology sector.    The city's 5,644 such companies registered a sales value of  8.7 billion yuan last year, compared with 900 million yuan  earned by 2,000 firms in 1992. Local officials estimated that  this year there will be over 6,000 non-state-owned technological  firms with a turnover of 10 billion yuan. In 1997, the figure  is expected to reach 20 million yuan.    Wang Huayu, a top official at the Municipal Science and  Technology Commission, said that the city is to speed up the  implementation of the share-holding system and absorb more  foreign money to solve the problem of fund shortages.    Shanghai, China's biggest metropolis with a population of 13  million, boasts 400,000 scientific and technological  professionals.    Taking advantage of the abundant talent resources, the city  has drawn up a series of preferential policies to encourage the  development of non-governmental enterprises.    So far, these companies have employed more than 140,000  people, and engage in the fields of computers,  telecommunications, aviation and new materials.    Ten of them claim an annual output value of over 100 million  yuan each, and another 150 make 10 million yuan annually.    This year the number of 100-million-yuan companies is  expected to reach 20.    And the city's 700 private enterprises in the industry are  also doing brisk business.    For example, the 34-member-strong Yangtian Group registered  62.44 million yuan in turnover last year, ranking third among  the city's nearly 6,000 firms.    The company's manager attributed its success to the sound  work force as 90 percent of the workers are technicians and  engineers.    In 1993 China had a total of 45,000 non-state-run  technological firms, employing 400,000 people and creating  annual profits of 50 billion yuan.</p>

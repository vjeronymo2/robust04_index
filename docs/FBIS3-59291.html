			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yang Bo (2799 3134) (vice chairman of the NPC </F> Financial and Economic Committee): "Comments on China's Current  Economic Problems"]    [Text] Vice Premier Zhu Rongji set forth "a few simple  rules to be observed by all concerned" respectively at two  recent national working conferences on finance and on  revenue-taxation. This step was a very directed one, being a  sound strategy for rectifying the previously existing chaos in  the financial and the revenue-taxation orders, as well as a key  step in intensifying financial and revenue-taxation reform,  which is going to play a key role in ensuring the sustained,  rapid, and sound growth of the Chinese economy.    Zhu Rongji's statement touched off widespread interest and  admiration both in China and abroad, with public opinion  favorable but still posing certain questions. I have recently  received letters from certain friends, asking for my comments on  several current problems and growth trends in the Chinese  economy. So I am taking this opportunity to express my personal  views, in response to my friends who are concerned about China's  economic problems, and as instruction for all experts and  academics.  <H5>  New Conflicts and Problems Under Current Conditions </H5>   In 1993, China's economy has continued to grow rapidly on  the  heels of 1992's 12.8-percent growth, with the first half of 1993  seeing GNP up 13.9 percent over the same period in 1992, retail  commodity sales up 21.6 percent, fixed assets investment up over  60 percent, foreign trade continuing to expand, a bumper  summer-grain harvest, and urban and rural incomes also growing  very quickly, for a generally good state of affairs. While  these are generally established facts, there is no use denying  that the advances have also seen the appearance of certain new  conflicts and problems. Some of these are quite glaring ones,  such as investment being too large in scale and irrational in  structure, too much currency put into circulation while capital  supply remains tight, increasing inflationary pressures and too  sharp price rises, and revenues being in a rather grim state,  all of which problems merit much attention. The appearance of  these problems is directly related to the chaos in the financial  and the revenue-taxation orders, such as the illegal lending  among financial institutions, the chaotic fundraising at high  interest rates by all parties, the construction on a scale  larger than capability, the new shops and projects going up  everywhere, the casual misuse and takeover of agricultural funds  and priority construction-project funds, the willful reduction  and exemption of taxes and interception of state revenue, and  the banking and the revenue and taxation sectors exploiting  their own facilities to operate various types of economic  entities in search of departmental interests, as well as being  affected by macroeconomic regulation and control steps not  having kept up in a timely fashion during the course of  conversion from the old system to the new. So rectifying our  financial and our revenue-taxation orders, by enforcing  financial and revenue-taxation discipline, intensifying  financial and revenue-taxation reform, and tightening our  macroeconomic regulation and control measures, has become a top  priority, being a smart countermeasure for promoting sound  growth and a good cycle for our national economy.  <H3>  The "Few Simple Rules To Be Observed by All Concerned" Have  Begun To Show Results </H3>   Have these "few simple rules to be observed by all  concerned"  been effective? My view is that they have. Let us take a look  at the results of their application in the last few months. 1)  Illegal lending has been curbed. Of the funds illegally loaned  by all financial institutions, some has been and some is being  recouped, basically by the set 15 August deadline. This was a  key step in restoring and establishing a normal financial order.  2) The wave of chaotic public fundraising at high interest  rates has been stopped, with the additional raising of deposit  interest rates having brought a clear rebound in urban and rural  savings deposits, in which individual savings deposits in banks  increased as much as 10 billion yuan in less than 10 days. The  previously very slow sales of treasury bills are now  satisfactory, with their treasury payment rate already topping  90 percent. This has had a very good impact in reducing  currency put into circulation, as well as in ensuring the prompt  payment of the funds needed for industrial and agricultural  production and infrastructure construction. 3) All areas are now  inventorying and dismantling the financial institutions that  were set up without PBC approval, strictly enforcing the  provision that nonfinancial institutions may not provide  financial services. The various economic entities set up by  banks and revenue-taxation departments at all levels are in the  process of being dislinked, with the injection of new credit  capital having been stopped. Meanwhile, all revenue credit  loans are being inventoried, with recoupment as necessary. 4)  We have stopped the enforcement of the tax reduction and  exemption provisions drawn up by all areas beyond their  authority, strengthening tax collection and control. We have  strictly controlled spending demand, particularly cutting back  on group purchasing power demand, with all areas and sectors  acting conscientiously. A general investigation of national  finance and taxation organized by the State Council is about to  begin.    It is not hard to see from a summary of these results that  while the "few simple rules to be observed by all concerned"  have been in effect for only a very short time, they have begun  to succeed. Of course, while we still need to do much work and  are faced with a difficult mission, I believe that if we  continue to act in such a down-to-earth manner, by making  rigorous demands, strictly enforcing orders and prohibitions,  intensifying reform, and tightening macroeconomic regulation and  control, it will not be long before our financial and  revenue-taxation orders will get back on a normal track, which  is precisely the prerequisite needed for building a socialist  market economy system.  <H5>  We Are Certainly Not in a Financial Crisis </H5>   Some friends have asked: Is China in a financial crisis? I  hold that this is not so, as the facts certainly do not support  it. As rectifying our financial order, enforcing financial  discipline, examining work flaws, and pushing forward with  financial reform have been to strengthen and improve our  financial work, in order to more effectively bring the  macroeconomic regulation and control role of finance into full  play in our overall national economy, we are certainly not in  any financial crisis. While we need to acknowledge that China  is now facing inflationary problems, this is occurring while our  economy is growing rapidly and our people's real living  standards are rising steadily, as well as appearing while our  national economic might is increasing and our market commodity  supplies are abundant, which is fundamentally different from the  conditions arising in some countries with economic recessions  and declining living standards, such as large amounts of  currency being issued beyond economic capability, skyrocketing  prices, and sharp currency devaluation. 1) As our currency issue  is now under strict central government control, being controlled  by the demands of overall national economic operations, serious  inflation will not and cannot occur. 2) While our  national-average retail price and cost of living indexes both  reached double digits for the first half of 1993, our real urban  and rural incomes increased even faster. The data corrected for  inflation show real incomes up an average of 13.5 percent for  city dwellers and about 7 percent for rural individuals. The  RMB still has very high prestige among the vast public, proof of  which is that urban and rural savings increased 124.4 billion  yuan in the first half of 1993. 3) China's foreign payment  capability is reliably ensured, and our international prestige  is high. The recent temporary foreign-exchange conversion-market  supply and demand imbalance and sharply rising exchange rates  were touched off mainly by market speculation, which was  unusual. Most recently, through our rectification of the  financial order and tightening of macroeconomic regulation and  control, our exchange rates quickly fell back, and are gradually  getting onto a normal track. This shows that China is certainly  not in a financial crisis.  <H5>  Foreign Investment Has Not Been Affected </H5>   Other friends have asked: Might not rectification of the  financial order, tightening of macroeconomic regulation and  control, and strict control of fixed assets investment affect  investment in China by overseas entrepreneurs? I hold that  while such concern is understandable, the reality will not  occur. China's policy of opening up to the outside world is  unshakeable, our large market is very attractive, and our  preferential policies on the use of foreign investment will not  change. The facts prove that foreign investment in China  continued to maintain a high growth momentum in the first half  of 1993. MOFTEC data for the first half of 1993 show 43,632  foreign-financed projects approved, with an agreed foreign  investment of $58.7 billion and an actually utilized foreign  investment of $9.4 billion, up respectively 234 percent, 300  percent, and 180 percent from the same period in 1992. Since  July, this momentum has certainly not slowed, with several large  import projects having been concluded. For instance, the Jilin  Industrial Chemicals Factory's import project for 100,000 tons  of high-carbon alcohol for an accessory installation to its  300,000-ton ethylene project, and the $30-million investment  contract between Suzhou City and the United States for a  joint-venture construction of the first stage of the  Puqiang-Suzhou Pharmaceuticals Plant, were signed in Beijing in  late July. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out very clearly  that the tighter macroeconomic regulation and control was not  an overall retrenchment, but rather a structural adjustment. I  hold that it will not only not affect foreign investment in  China but, as the macroeconmic climate further improves, will  even be bound to be favorable to attracting yet more investment.  We welcome investment by overseas entrepreneurs that is in line  with China's industrial policy.  <H3>  A Projection of the State of the Economy in the Second Half  of 1993 </H3>   What are our economic growth trends for the last half of  1993  and on into 1994? Are we likely to see sharp volatility? My  view is an optimistic one. Our state of economic growth can  only improve, and we will not see either stagnation or sharp  volatility. The Chinese Government has faced up to the  problems that are appearing in the midst of rapid economic  growth, having taken a series of key steps to intensify reform,  in order to solve them safely and steadily. The excessive  fixed assets investment scale has been strictly controlled, with  the irrational investment structure being adjusted, ongoing  projects being inventoried according to the principle of acting  in line with capability and the demands of industrial policy,  continuation or shutdown as necessary (for instance, we have  shut down construction on ones, such as unapproved development  zones, and certain duplicate construction projects), and a  shortening of our construction front. Our chaotic financial  and revenue-taxation orders are being rectified, with some  initial success. Excessive price rises have been strictly  controlled, with the previous sharp price rises due to inflation  for capital goods, such as rolled steel and cement, having  been curbed, and beginning to recede. Our agricultural  production has been reinforced, with a bumper summer grain  harvest, and expectations of a good harvest of fall crops short  of an exceptional disaster. Our industrial production  continues to grow at a higher rate in line with production  dovetailed with demand and improved efficiency. Our market  commodity supplies are abundant. Our foreign trade will also  continue to maintain a good momentum. All reforms,  particularly of our financial, revenue-taxation, and investment  systems, are advancing with emphasis. In short, I hold that  while our overall national economic growth rate for the last  half of 1993 will be somewhat slower than for the first half,  this will be rational and more balanced. As to the whole of  1993, our overall growth rate will not fall below 10 percent, to  surpass the annual plan approved by the first session of the  eighth national party congress.    The Chinese Government leadership is firm and strong. All  areas and sectors are conscientiously implementing the center's  macroeconomic regulation and control measures. The initiative  of the people of all nationalities throughout China to build  socialism is very high. The call sent forth by President Jiang  Zemin, according to the spirit of the key speeches of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping, to seize, treasure, and use well opportunities to  develop the economy better and faster, is increasingly  permeating the Chinese mindset. It can be projected that  China's economic growth in coming years will, in line with the  adjusted Eighth Five-Year Plan, grow in both a rapid and a  sustained and balanced manner. I am full of confidence in this.</p>

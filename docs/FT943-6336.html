			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Public is the beneficiary of local government review Sir, Your editorial stance on the local government review in England is well rehearsed. However, I must correct an error in your leader. The commission has not conducted 'postal referendums'. We are sending leaflets to 12m households as part of an unprecedented public consultation exercise and, on the returns so far, we expect to receive 1m individual responses. (The Royal Commission on Local Government in England, which in the 1960s studied local government for three years, received the views of 600 individuals in all.) All views submitted to us, together with the other factors we have to consider, will be taken into account before we send our final recommendations to the secretary of state for the environment later this year. We are not returning officers in a plebiscite - but public opinion, measured in a variety of ways, will of course be important. John Pearson, director, Local Government Commission for England, Dolphyn Court, 10/11 Great Turnstile, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC1V 7JU</p>

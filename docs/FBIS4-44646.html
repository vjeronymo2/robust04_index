			<p>BFN     [Text] Tests on the guidance system equipment for the  family of flexible anti-aircraft defense missile systems [FSAF]  are underway, based on data supplied by the EMPAR [European  Multifunction Aero-Radar] for which Alenia is responsible. The  acceptance tests on the antenna for the latter have already been  carried out at the Alenia plant in Rome (Via Tiburtina), to the  complete satisfaction of the Navy who placed the order. The  performance obtained during the tests was better than had been  specified by the French-Italian client. The program has  therefore been given full confirmation. It provides for the  necessary qualification tests on the EMPAR guidance system to be  set up and carried out at the Italian center for radar testing  and aboard the Italian naval frigate Carabiniere. This is one  of the most recent stages in the Italian-French program  developed by the Eurosam consortium, which was established in  1989 by Alenia (a Finmeccanica company) together with the French  companies Thomson-CSF and Aerospatiale and where 50 percent of  the personnel is engaged in research.    Two other important stages were completed at the end of  1993.  The first was the installation of the first Arabel guidance  system at the French air defense systems experience center  (SESDA) at San Mandrier near Toulon at the beginning of  December, after it had passed a series of intensive tests at  Thomson-CSF. Here the system was put through a long series of  tests in a marine environment. The first experimental prototype  of the Arabel electronic-scanning multiple-function radar had  already been tried out at the Cel testing center at Biscarosse  near Bordeaux, to confirm some technical choices.    Another guidance system for the ground version of the FSAF  is  currently being factory-tested and there are plans to install it  in the site shelter next year.    The Aster-30 missile was launched for the first time from  the  Biscarosse center using a real vertical ground launcher on 1  December. The goal of this test was to verify the interaction  between the missile and the launcher at the moment of lift-off,  the effects on the launching platform, and the behavior of the  missile at the start of its trajectory. This first launch of  the Aster-30, which was hailed by the French defense minister as  being one of the enterprises contributing to the progress of  European defense, follows a dozen launches of the Aster-15 that  had the goal of ratifying the basic functional systems of the  missile; such as the mixed aerodynamic and jet (PIF-PAF) flight,  the vertical launch, and the correct trajectory from the initial  interception stage for hypersonic targets in grazing flight also  at short range.    The first concrete realization of the Eurosam FSAF program  will be in 1996, with the installation of the self-defense  surface-air antimissile system (SAAM) aboard the new French  aircraft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle.</p>

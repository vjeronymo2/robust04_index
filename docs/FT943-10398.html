			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Departments show sharp spending rise Government spending on external consultants has increased sharply in recent years, the Cabinet Office Efficiency Unit report says. Spending rose nearly fourfold between 1985 and 1990, although it has stabilised at about Pounds 500m a year since then. The report says that it was Pounds 508m in 1992-1993. Whitehall quangos, the non-departmental public bodies such as the British Library and English Heritage, spent another Pounds 149m in that year. A further Pounds 70m was spent in 1992-93 on internal consultancy such as management services, internal audit, staff inspection and information systems support. Much of the spending on external consultancy goes on support for departmental programmes, such as assistance in developing defence equipment, projects to improve the competitiveness of industry and training projects. Just more than half of the money spent on external consultancy in 1992-93 went on this form of advice. Almost 30 per cent of the 1992-93 total went on information systems consultancy, helping Whitehall departments and agencies in computer projects. The remaining fifth was spent on traditional management consultancy, buying advice on organisation and structure, running market-testing programmes and providing specialist services such as legal advice. Two-thirds of external consultancy projects cost less than Pounds 20,000, while 9 per cent cost more than Pounds 100,000. The latter accounted for more than two-thirds of the spending, while projects costing less than Pounds 20,000 consumed 10 per cent of the total. A third of the management consultancy spending on projects costing more than Pounds 20,000 was to buy advice on market-testing and purchasing. Assistance on finance and accountancy issues took 17 per cent and advice on management issues almost a quarter. Seven departments and their agencies accounted for 85 per cent of spending on external consultants. The largest spender by far was the Ministry of Defence, with more than a quarter of the total. The spending on external consultancy was shared among 1,900 different firms or individual consultants. But 30 per cent of the total went to the 10 consultancies with the biggest share of government work. The two largest beneficiaries are both US information technology firms, CSC Computer Sciences and EDS-Scicon. This reflects the large computerisation projects under way in departments such as defence and social security. Other IT companies in the top 20 include Sema and Hoskyns. Seven of the world's biggest consultancies are represented in the top 20, with PA Consulting and Andersen Consulting at numbers three and four respectively. The global accountancy-related consultancies received 16 per cent of the spending. The Government's Use Of External Consultants. HMSO.

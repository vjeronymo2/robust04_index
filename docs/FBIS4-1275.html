			<p>BFN     [Text] Bujumbura, 25 Apr (PANA) -- A small section of the  Parachute Battalion of the Burundi Army were the plotters of the  failed coup d'etat late Sunday [24 April], the minister of human  rights said Monday in Bujumbura. The minister, Issa  Ngendakumana, who is the government's spokesman, told the  PAN-AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY in the Burundi capital that two trucks  filled with parachutists had gone to several barracks to  persuade other soldiers to join the plot.    But the director of communication at the Ministry of  National  Defense, Commander Sinarinzi, said that five junior officers  were leaders of the plot and that just one truck with five  parachutists aboard had attempted to carry out the coup. The  second truck, he said, was abandoned by its driver who  immediately reported the plot to the Special Investigation  Brigade. Sinarinzi said that the five arrests had been made and  that the mutineers were being interrogated.    This is the third coup attempt in Burundi in nine months.  The first was on 10 July 1993, on the eve of President Melchior  Ndadaye's inauguration. Ndadaye, the first democratically  elected president in the country, was killed in the second  attempt on 21 October. His successor, Cyprien Ntaryamira, died  on 6 April in a suspicious plane crash.    Sunday's fioled coup coincided with the ultimatum had been  largely ignored.    The same source said that 10 residents of Ruhero, a posh  central area of Bujumbura, surrendered their firearm licenses to  local authorities. However, firing continues in the northern  part of the capital killing and injuring soldiers and civilians.    Musaga, a relatively quiet suburb in the south of Bujumbura,  was again the scene of violent ethnic clashes Sunday. Four  people were wounded, police and local residents said. Armed  gangs attacked a military detachment based in the northeastern  province of Karuzi Sunday, severly wounding two soldiers, the  governor of the region, Mbonyumugenzi Frederic, said.</p>

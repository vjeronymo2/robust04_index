			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Dutch contest EU decision on information The Dutch government yesterday decided to start legal action against its European Union partners in an attempt to overturn their decision to limit public access to information on EU decisions. The Dutch decision to take the Council of Ministers of the 12 to the European Court of Justice comes after a warning on Thursday from Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, European commissioner in charge of the 'openness' policy, that the Commission would 'go it alone' with a more open system if the Council restricted public access to information. The Dutch move will cast an embarrassing spotlight on the much-vaunted open decision-making policy proclaimed by the last five summits of EU heads of government, in response to Danish voters' initial rejection of the Maastricht treaty in June 1992. The credibility ofthis stance was badly dented in December when the habitually secretive Council got a discretionary catch-all clause on confidentiality inserted into the new code of conduct on access to information, at the behest of Belgium, the UK, Germany and Portugal. The policy originally prescribed right of access to all EU information, except where monetary stability, national security, commercial confidentiality, privacy, or relations with non-member countries could be endangered. The Council wanted to add to these grounds for refusal provisions 'to protect the interests of the (EU) institution and safeguard the secrecy of thedeliberations'. This was watered down under Dutch and Danish pressure, but the compromise still gives EU institutions the discretionary right to rejectrequests for information they consider 'manifestly unreasonable, which is to say a request that could be contrary to the efficiency and good order of the institution'. The Dutch voted against this compromise, while Denmark assented in exchange for a review after two years. Dutch government officials want thiscode of conduct annulled, since it was put through by majority vote under Article 151 of the EU treaty, which governs internal regulations. They argue that thedeclared attempt to enhance the rights of European citizens can not be an 'internal' matter, and should be dealt with under Article 173, which requires unanimous assent. 'It's politically worthwhile to undo this decision,' Mr Piet Dankert, Dutch European affairs minister, said yesterday. 'We should do thisespecially because support for European integration is already in doubt becauseof too many bureaucratic and secretive structures.' Mr Pinheiro told journalists on Thursday that, in practice, 'I think it would be very difficult for the Council to follow a different route from the Commission' on access to information. But he warned: 'If they introduce some sort of arbitrary censorship,then we will go it alone.'</p>

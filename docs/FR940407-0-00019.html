			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, Utah proposed to revise its definitions of ``affected area,'' ``road,'' and ``public road'' at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200. Specifically, Utah proposed to revise its definition of ``affected area'' as follows, with the italicized language to be added: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ``Affected area'' means any land or water surface area which is used to facilitate, or is physically altered by, coal mining and reclamation operations. The affected area includes the disturbed area; any area upon which coal mining and reclamation operations are conducted; any adjacent lands the use of which is incidental to coal mining and reclamation operations; all areas covered by new or existing roads used to gain access to, or for hauling coal to or from, coal mining and reclamation operations, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->  except as provided in this definition;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> any area covered by surface excavations, workings, impoundments, dams, ventilation shafts, entryways, refuse banks, dumps, stockpiles, overburden piles, spoil banks, culm banks, tailings, holes or depressions, repair areas, storage areas, shipping areas; any areas upon which are sited structures, facilities, or other property material on the surface resulting from, or incident to, coal mining and reclamation operations; and the area located above underground workings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The affected area shall include every road used for purposes of access to, or for hauling coal to or from, coal mining and reclamation operations, unless the road (a) was designated as a public road pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is located; (b) is maintained with public funds and constructed in a manner similar to other public roads of the same classification within the jurisdiction; and (c) there is substantial (more than incidental) public use. Editorial Note: The definition of Affected area, insofar as it excludes roads which are included in the definition of Surface coal mining operations, was suspended at 51 FR 41960, Nov. 20, 1986. Accordingly, Utah suspends the definition of Affected Area insofar as it excludes roads which are included in the definition of ``coal mining and reclamation operations.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Utah proposed to revise its definition of ``road'' as follows, with the capitalized language in brackets to be removed and the italicized language to be added: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> ``Road'' means a surface right-of-way for purposes of travel by land vehicles used in [COAL EXPLORATION OR] coal mining and reclamation operations or coal exploration.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A road consists of the entire area within the right-of-way, including the roadbed, shoulders, parking and side areas, approaches, structures, ditches, and surface. The term includes access and haulroads constructed, used, reconstructed, improved, or maintained for use in [COAL EXPLORATION, OR WITHIN THE AFFECTED AREA OF] coal mining and reclamation operations  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> or coal exploration,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> including use by coal hauling vehicles [LEADING] to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> and from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> transfer, processing, or storage areas.

R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200 is in accordance with SMCRA and consistent with the Federal regulations. OSM finds that, except for some differences in wording, Utah's proposed amendment to its definitions of ``affected area,'' ``road,'' and ``public road'' at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200 is substantively identical to the corresponding Federal definitions of ``affected area'' and ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5 and ``public road'' at 30 CFR 761.5. As discussed below, these differences in wording are necessary to maintain consistency throughout Utah's regulations and make the proposed amendment conform to the Utah program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 1.

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Enterprise seeks out holes in space - Gary Mead reports on new ways to monitor promotional spending To watch 7 per cent of one's cash disappearing into a black hole each year might be thought madness. Yet when it comes to advertising in the printed media, 7 per cent of booked advertisements do not appear at all, appear in the wrong format, at the wrong time, or in the wrong position. Given that UK expenditure on advertising in newspapers and other publications is some Pounds 4bn annually, some Pounds 280m of UK advertising might be vanishing, uncontrolled and unnoticed, into a void. Advertisers and their agencies are under pressure to cut costs. Checking that print advertisements appear when and in a form which was paid for would seem an obvious step to take. Many do not. Advouch has been in business for eight years. It handles the print advertisement verification for about 60 per cent of the leading British advertising agencies, checking advertising worth Pounds 600m annually. Tony Law, managing director, believes that of the remaining 40 per cent of agencies, 'half do it themselves, the other half don't do it at all'. Law has identified that 7 per cent of his clients' advertisements are misplaced or forgotten altogether and believes this is probably an industry-wide phenomenon. Advouch's business is to make sure that the gap is plugged and that advertisers and agencies are getting what they paid for. The advertisements which fail to appear or appear incorrectly do so for a variety of reasons. According to Law, the problem is seldom incompetence or fiddling. Instead, printers suddenly find themselves with insufficient space and fail to run the advert, without alerting the advertiser or agency. In Law's experience, regional newspapers have the poorest record. Between December 1991 and April 1992, he found that 10 per cent of his clients' regionally-placed ads were failing to appear or appeared incorrectly, against 5.3 per cent in national newspapers, 5.4 per cent in consumer magazines and 4.2 per cent in trade magazines. Law calls his business the 'spit and sawdust' end of the advertising world, although it is heavily dependent on computer technology. The system holds details on 12,153 publications and a multitude of cross-references between agencies and publications. Each month the 22 staff deal with between 60,000 and 80,000 individual advertisement bookings, relating to 6,236 advertisers and 15,141 products. But does it really matter if advertisements do not appear on time, or at all? For large consumer goods manufacturers it is a debatable point but it can be crucial for recruitment advertising. Advouch's biggest client, Barkers LBW, an advertising agency which specialises in recruitment advertising, uses the service to check more than 20,000 advertisements a year; if a job advertisement fails to appear, Barkers - and its clients - know immediately; no-one applies. Advouch sends each of its clients a weekly activity report with a bundle of vouchers stapled to publications in which their advertisements have appeared. Without a voucher from Advouch stating that the booked advert has appeared correctly, the advertising agency can refuse payment to the publication. The whole process is about establishing trusted verifications, thus reducing cash-flow problems for all concerned. Computer technology has enabled Advouch to find a niche in an increasingly complex market; it is also enabling marketing directors to find their own niches among consumers who blithely pass by the 80,000 outdoor poster sites in Britain. NOP Posters, part of the MAI information services group, has just launched a new service with its subsidiary, Pinpoint Analysis. Called Posterpin, the service costs between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 40,000 a year. For that, subscribers get a desk-top processor from which to obtain a wide range of information on poster sites including details of consumer expenditure, wealth indices and consumer demographics. They can also scan maps of a specified area, pinpointing poster sites, who owns them, how many panels they have and their availability. Users of the system will be able to call on a database to give the numbers of - for example - premium canned lager drinkers living in the area. According to Pinpoint the new service 'offers not just a mapping procedure but also useful marketing information'.</p>

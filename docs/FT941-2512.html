			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / China probes labour exploitation: Complaints and sharp rise in disputes trigger government concern China is to investigate labour conditions in state and foreign enterprises in an attempt to counter complaints of exploitation and a sharp rise in disputes. Many of the complaints have been directed at foreign employers, who are accused of disregarding minimum standards set by the state. The move also reflects increasing government concern over labour unrest; restless workers in loss-making state enterprises facing closure are seen as a threat to public order. The Labour Ministry said its inquiries would cover all urban and township enterprises, whether Chinese or foreign-funded. The survey would run from April 1 to June 30. An official said inspectors would investigate whether enterprises had violated the law by using child labour or exploiting women. They would also check contracts, wages, working hours, insurance and welfare treatment. Persistent criticism of foreign businessmen by representatives of the All China Federation of Trades Unions has revived images of exploitative bosses left over from China's colonial past. A union official said in an interview that some foreign employers violated workers' rights 'randomly and openly'. 'They prolong workers' hours, cut or deduct their wages arbitrarily, neglect safety and sanitary requirements and even humiliate workers,' said the official.  'One employer even locked his worker in a dog cage.' The Labour Ministry's investigation coincides with growing signs of militancy among workers, including a recent call by labour activists for an independent trade union. The activists, who said their aim was to protect workers from exploitation in the current economic boom, were detained by the authorities. Since China opened to the outside world in the late 1970s, tens of thousands of enterprises with foreign involvement have been established, many of them benefiting from cheap labour. The Beijing-based China Electronic News reported recently that there were more than 10,000 labour disputes last year. Many occurred in the Shenzen special economic zone, adjacent to Hong Kong, which has attracted a flood of peasant labour to work in small processing concerns. The All China Federation of Trades Unions began a drive last month to double union membership this year in foreign-run factories and joint ventures. Less than 30 per cent of companies in which foreigners are involved are unionised. China's trade union law entitles unions to a seat on a company's board of directors.</p>

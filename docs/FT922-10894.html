			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Business Law: Digest of Hilary Term cases LEWIS v ROOK (FT, March 3 1992) In 1968, Lady Rook purchased a property, Newlands, in Kent. Included in the purchase were two cottages known as Nos 1 and 2 Hop Cottages on the south boundary of the property, the total acreage of which was 10.5 acres. The distance between No 1 Hop Cottages and Newlands was 175 metres. In 1979, Lady Rook sold No 1 for Pounds 33,000. Section 102(1) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979 provided that a gain on disposal of a dwelling-house was not chargeable to tax 'if the dwelling house or part of a dwelling-house has been the individual's only or main residence throughout the period of ownership . . . ' The General Commissioners' found that No 1 Hop Cottages formed part of the entity which comprised the dwelling-house of Newlands and Mr Justice Mervyn Davies upheld the Commissioners' findings. The distance of the cottage from the house was not of paramount importance in the context of the Newlands set-up and was a matter of degree, he held. Allowing the Inland Revenue's appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that apart from the 175 metres between the cottage and the main house, Newlands was on the northern boundary and the cottage on the southern boundary of a 10.5 acre estate, separated by a large garden with no intervening buildings other than the greenhouses and tool shed. Those facts led to the inescapable conclusion that the cottage was not within the curtilage of and appurtenant to Newlands, and so was not part of the entity which constituted Lady Rook's dwelling-house. KLEINWORT BENSON LTD v CITY OF GLASGOW DISTRICT COUNCIL BARCLAYS BANK PLC v CITY OF GLASGOW DISTRICT COUNCIL (FT, March 4 1992) Two banks, Barclays Bank and Kleinwort Benson sued the City of Glasgow District Council in two separate actions, for Pounds 389,431 and Pounds 807,230 respectively, in relation to sums paid under interest rate swap agreements. Following on the House of Lords' decision in Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham (1991) 2 WLR 372 that all such transactions were outside the powers of the local authorities and void ab initio, the banks claimed return of the sums on a restitutionary basis. On the present summonses, Glasgow sought declarations that the court had no jurisdiction in respect of the claims and asked that the actions be dismissed. The two actions came within the Jurisdiction and Judgments Convention 1968 (the Brussels Convention), which concerned 'civil and commercial matters'. Article 5(1) provided that a person domiciled in part of the UK might be sued in another part 'in matters relating to a contract, in the courts for the place of performance of the obligation in question'. The House of Lords having held that the swap transactions were void ab initio, the suggestion that the restitutionary claims were matters relating to a contract placed a severe strain on the language of Article 5(1). There was nothing in the cases to support such a conclusion, Mr Justice Hirst stated, in giving judgment for Glasgow and dismissing the actions for want of jurisdiction. OFFICIAL RECEIVER v NIXON (FT, March 6) The Official Receiver had been given leave to apply out of time for a disqualifying order against Mr Nixon from acting as a company director. Mr Nixon had been appointed as consultant to two companies and he had resigned shortly before the receivers were appointed. The companies had left unsecured liabilities of Pounds 1.54m, and Mr Nixon was charged inter alia with failing to keep proper accounts and of allowing the one company to trade while insolvent. In considering an application for leave to commence disqualification proceedings more than two years from when the company became insolvent (see section 2), the court should take into account (1) the length of delay; (2) the reasons for delay; (3) the strength of the case against a director; and (4) the degree of prejudice caused to him by the delay (secretary of state for trade and industry v Desai, CA, November 29 1991). In the instant case, the Court of Appeal stated, in dismissing Mr Nixon's appeal against Mr Justice Vinelott's decision upholding leave granted to the Official Receiver to apply out of time, the evidence had disclosed a sufficiently arguable case that Mr Nixon was either a shadow or de facto director in the context of the actions he had taken on the companies' behalf. POWDRILL AND ANOTHER v HAMBROS BANK (JERSEY) LTD (FT, March 10) Paramount carried on business as a charter airline and, in August 1989, an administration order was made in respect of the company. In the present proceedings, the joint administrators were alleging that in July 1989, the company had sums of Pounds 1.3m and Pounds 346,800 which were transferred from England to an account held by a Jersey company with Hambros Bank (Jersey). They asserted that the payments were transactions at an undervalue made when the company was unable to pay its debts and sought an order under section 238 of the Insolvency Act 1986 for the bank to restore the money to the company. The administrators obtained leave to serve proceedings out of the jurisdiction. At first instance, however, the judge acceded to the bank's application that that leave should be set aside. Allowing the administrators' appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that where a foreign element was involved, the court would need to be satisfied that the defendant was sufficiently connected with England for it to be just and proper to make the order against him. And in considering whether there was sufficient connection, the court had to look at all the circumstances of the case. If, in the present instance, the proceedings were to go ahead in England, the bank would not be precluded from raising the issue of whether there was sufficient connection with England as a defence. WEBB v WEBB (FT, March 11) Mr George Webb bought a flat in Antibes in France and transferred it into the name of his son, Lawrence Webb. The purchase price of FFr600,000 was provided by the father and was placed pending completion in an account in the son's name at the Antibes branch of Barclays Bank. Both father and son used the property as a holiday home but the father then sought to have the use of the property to the exclusion of the son and to have his son transfer it into his name. In the ensuing High Court action, the judge held that Article 16(1)(c) in the 1968 Brussels Convention, which stipulated that only courts of the contracting state have the jurisdiction to decide on property (rights in rem) of the contracting state in which the property is situated, was not applicable. Adjourning the son's appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that the proper scope of article 16(1) might depend on identification of the policy underlying the article. The European Court was the appropriate forum to identify the correct purposive interpretation of article 16(1) in its application to the facts of the case. MCALPINE HUMBEROAK LTD v MCDERMOTT INTERNATIONAL INC (FT, March 13) In a contract for construction of the deck structure of an off-shore drilling rig, placed with the defendants, McDermott, four subcontracts were awarded to the plaintiffs, McAlpine. Delays ensued and the costs actually incurred by McAlpine came to Pounds 2.59m but it claimed Pounds 3.54m, maintaining that that sum was due under the contract, or as damages for breach of contract. The judge found that the contract had been frustrated and awarded McAlpine a quantum meruit equal to its costs plus 10 per cent profit, less Pounds 1m already paid by McDermott. He dismissed McDermott's counterclaim. Allowing McDermott's appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that the inherent probabilities, the contemporaneous documents, and the overwhelming weight of the oral evidence, all pointed in one direction. The cause of delay in starting fabrication was McAlpine's failure to qualify its procedures. It had nothing to do with the causes found by the judge so that the contract had not been frustrated and the lump sum price had not been displaced.</p>

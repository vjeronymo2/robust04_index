			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lulu Yu in Beijing] </F>   [Text] An official of the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications yesterday revealed plans to commercialise  China's state-run telecom industry, a move intended to boost  efficiency and speed up telecom development.    An autonomous telecom authority would be spun off from the  ministry this year, to be given charge of all telecom  developments in the country and more power would be devolved to  regional authorities, Li Zhigang, the section chief of the  ministry's department of policy and regulation, said.    "We want to separate policy matters from commercial  operations to make the sector more efficient. There will be  more competition and greater liberalisation," Li said after  giving a speech at a business conference sponsored by the  Institute for International Research.    He said the establishment of China United Telecommunications  Corporation (CUTC), a state company responsible for its own  financing, was an example of increased competition in the  sector. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has had a  monopoly over all domestic and international services. This  would change after CUTC became operational.    Li confirmed CUTC was permitted to compete in almost all  areas, including the construction of the country's second  network, although the company was expected to initially  concentrate on mobile phones and value-added services in coastal  areas.    He said CUTC was likely to have registered share capital of  600m renminbi (about HK$533m [Hong Kong dollars]), around 40  percent of which could come from the Ministry of Electronic  Industry, the Ministry of Electric Power and the Ministry of  Railways.    Companies including China International Trust and Investment  Corporation, China Huaneng and China Everbright are considering  taking stakes. Li said CUTC would probably be established in  May.    He said China's telecom law, in the making since the 1950s,  was likely to be completed next year, giving a legal framework  to all telecom developments. Li told the business conference at  the Great Wall Sheraton Hotel that China's public telecom  switchboard capacity increased by 10.8 million lines, or 58  percent, to 29.36 million lines last year over 1992.    There were 5.86 million new telephone subscribers, a rise of  51 percent, and 185,000 more long-distance circuits, up 79.5  percent. "This means the year's overall telecom traffic had  increased by 68.5 percent," Li said.    He said at the end of last year, the penetration rate of  China's telephone lines was 1.46 percent, with the penetration  rate of telephone sets at 2.15 percent. The number of mobile  phone subscribers was 638,000 and pagers totalled 5.6 million,  an increase of 2.5 times and 3.6 times respectively over 1992.    Li said it was hoped that by 2000, on average every  household  in China would have one telephone, and the number of mobile  phone subscribers would reach 5 million.    The aim is for phone line penetration to reach 5.9 percent  and phone set penetration 7.5 percent (with big and medium  cities averaging 30-40 percent).</p>

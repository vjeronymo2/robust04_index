			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> VIOLA RECITAL IN PACIFIC PALISADES  </P> <P> Peter Hatch has been championing the distinctly undersung viola repertory  locally for many years. Since 1983 his principal forum has been an annual  concert series entitled "The Magic of the Viola."  </P> <P> The 1989 installment of the series began Sunday evening, with a program that  focused on showmen's tricks rather than any real magic. Capably played by  Hatch, the recital also inaugurated the new, 125-seat Pierson Playhouse in  Pacific Palisades as a public chamber music venue. With clear acoustics and  sight-lines, and a fine, resident Kawai grand, the hall could make a  significant addition to Westside musical life.  </P> <P> The violin music of 19th-Century virtuosos Henry Vieuxtemps and Joseph Joachim  is hardly heard today, let alone their viola music. Vieuxtemps' Sonata is a  quirky work of both gold and brass, while his needlessly revived Elegy proved  pure dross. Joachim's three "Hebraische Melodien" mines a characteristic vein  of earnest, long-lined brooding.  </P> <P> Hatch provided a wealth of firmly focused, clearly directed sound. His is a  rather reticent stage personality, and he came to grief tempermentally and  technically in Vieuxtemps' most eccentric, flamboyant passages.  </P> <P> The equally daunting challenges of Enesco's Concert Piece, however, were  cleanly nailed with conviction and elan. He made a cogent case for Hindemith's  Sonata, Opus 11, No. 4, and supplied three sweetly sung encores, one of his own  arranging.  </P> <P> Italian pianist Francesco Bencivenga had no easy task with most of these  accompaniments, and played them with imposing technical clarity and musical  sympathy.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Xia Jun (1115 0193) and XINHUA </F> reporter Chao Wen (6872 2429)]    [Text] Beijing, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- State Councillor Chen  Junsheng pointed out at the eighth national meeting on rural  reform experimental zones: The rural reform experimental zones  have provided rich experience for China's rural reform. In this  regard, we have achieved certain success, made some progress,  and gained some new experience. In the days to come, we should  make the experimental zones play an even better role in serving  central policies and exploring methods for rural reform across  the country.    Chen Junsheng said: Generally speaking, the situation in  agriculture and rural areas has been good since last year. To  enhance the good situation, the central authorities have adopted  some measures to increase agricultural investment, and all the  provinces and departments concerned have increased their share  of agricultural investment. Ensuring the supply of essential  agricultural products and steady increase in peasants' income  are two important objectives of rural economic development in  the 1990's. Arousing the peasants' enthusiasm is a new problem  which requires solution in work concerning rural reform  experimental zones. For this reason, it is necessary to  constantly study new circumstances and new problems, and to  explore new ways under the new situation.    On how to continue to run rural reform experimental zones  well, Chen Junsheng emphasized: First, we should readjust the  contents and arrangements of the experiment. Since the  experimental zones were set up seven or eight years ago, many  projects were conceived according to the situation then. For  this reason, it is necessary to make a proper readjustment of  their contents and pay attention to making breakthroughs in key  projects and to summing up experience. Second, it is necessary  to coordinate work among the leadership and departments of  various experimental zones. This is because experimental zone  work involves all quarters and requires the support and  cooperation of other departments concerned. Third, to  facilitate their experiments, the zones should be permitted to  go beyond some existing policies and systems. However,  experiments must be strictly kept within proper limits and  submitted to the state for approval; only the approved  experiments may be conducted. Fourth, it is necessary to  strengthen the cadre force of the experimental zones.</p>

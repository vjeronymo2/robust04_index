			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Project to sell royal warrant goods in US THE HOUSE of Windsor Collection a catalogue of products from up to 200 royal warrant holders - is to be launched in the US this autumn, with the aim of achieving sales of Pounds 71m by 1998. Mr Nicholas Wills, chairman of the Eclectic American Catalogue Company, which is responsible for the project, said the catalogue 'will be selling a lifestyle which has traditionally appealed to Americans who recognise the cachet that the royal warrant conveys'. He said about 60 per cent of the warrant holders offering products in the catalogue had not exported to the US before. Among royal warrant holders in the House of Windsor Collection will be companies ranging from bedding company Slumberland to small enterprises such as Bernard Weatherill, the Savile Row tailor, and Tom Smith, maker of Christmas crackers. The company aims to exploit a US speciality catalogue market valued at Dollars 35bn (Pounds 24.60bn) a year.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Leisures active Leisure stocks were among the market's best performers as dealers pointed to the recovery potential of the sector amid speculation of further cuts in UK interest rates. Forte, the sector's favourite blue chip, was firm all day, helped by good UK tourism figures for 1993 and higher predictions for 1994. There was also renewed speculation over the hotel group's intentions with regard to the Savoy Group, in which Forte holds a majority stake but only minority control. Rumours that Forte is willing to listen to offers for its 69 per cent stake in Savoy were dismissed by leisure analysts yesterday, who pointed out that Forte had spent much time and effort edging towards gaining control of the luxury chain. They also said that, with Savoy in closed season, a move by Forte, which has board representation, could have regulatory implications. However, the talk did lead some observers to conclude that the long-running battle over Savoy might be drawing to a close. Forte gained 5 at 264p, while Savoy 'A' fell 13 to 1050p. Multimedia considerations were again cited as the power behind Thorn EMI, 10 higher at 1092p, and Carlton Communications, 6 ahead at 933p. US support was said to have helped Rank Organisation rise 10 1/2 to 1081 1/2 p. Ladbroke shares held firm before fading in late trading to end 2 1/2 off at 209p. Although a dividend cut with today's results announcement is widely discounted, the overall trading picture is expected to be brighter. A rumour that the group would report the sale of its Texas home improvement chain, with Tesco one suggested buyer, found few supporters among food and leisure analysts. Tesco steadied at 226 1/2 p. The profits recovery in engineering group Vickers had been discounted and the shares closed 9 lighter at 183p. The company reported profits of Pounds 32.3m, against a previous loss of Pounds 36.6m. Several brokers increased their current-year profits estimates, including Strauss Turnbull which upgraded its forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 42m. NatWest Securities called the shares 'a fully valued recovery play'. Figures from GKN were also in line with market expectations and the shares recovered from early weakness to finish just a penny down at 536p. GKN signalled continued weakness in its European markets and that sentiment hit Laird Group. The stock fell 17 1/2 to 387 1/2 p. Reports that Vosper Thornycroft was in talks about acquiring the Swan Hunter shipyard left the shares 3 cheaper at 798p. The Tyneside shipyard has been in receivership since last May and a French shipbuilder indicated last month that it planned to make an offer for it. International mining group RTZ surrendered 21 to 846p, with Smith New Court said to have advised investors to sell the stock. Shares in Clayton Son (Holdings), which reported a past year's loss of Pounds 1.068m, surged 14 to 127p after it announced an agreed bid for the company. CRH, the Irish-based building materials group and the first of the big companies to report, succumbed to the general market malaise, the shares sliding 9 to 374p. However, analysts said the group's profits were at the very top end of market expectations, as was the dividend. UBS was taking a positive view on the stores sector, emphasising those retailers with large market shares particularly in sectors where there is overcapapcity in supply markets. Among these, Boots slipped 5 to 527p and Storehouse 3 to 233p. The drinks sector bounced back from Tuesday's weakness. Boddington produced good results and the shares steadied at 275p. Bass rose 6 to 524p and Grand Metropolitan 13 1/2 to 481 1/2 p. Whitbread, however, suffered from continued concern over the threat of imports by telephone from France, sliding 11 to 543p. Business services group BET relinquished 5 to 134p after Charterhouse Tilney downgraded current-year profits expectations. The broker reduced its forecast by Pounds 6m to Pounds 91m. Volume was 5.5m at the close. Nervous trading in Cookson ahead of tomorrow's figures left the shares 7 lighter at 253p. British Petroleum was the market's most heavily traded stock, the shares slipping to 347p at one point amid talk of renewed selling from the US, before stabilising and closing a net 6 1/2 off at 352 1/2 p; 12m shares changed hands during the day.</p>

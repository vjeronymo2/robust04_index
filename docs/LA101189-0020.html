			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHING EVOLUTION  </P> <P> I cannot believe that as we are about to enter the 21st Century, the state  curriculum commission is still debating whether the historical and observable  fact of biological evolution should be taught in biology classes in public  schools!  </P> <P> If the believers in a magical universe are able to legislate the creation myths  into biology classes, what is to prevent future equal treatment of astrology in  high school astronomy classes or the equal treatment of every imaginative form  of metaphysical speculation into physics classes?  </P> <P> I hope that the State Board of Education will not allow the rewriters of  natural history to force their myths on the schools.  </P> <P> ALAN ALBERT SNOW  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

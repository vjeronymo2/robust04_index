			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Toshiyuki Orita, Process Technology Center, Oki </F> Electric Industry Co., Ltd.]    [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   Resist removal at the final stage of a lithography process  is  one of the best-known processes in LSI manufacturing. Resist is  usually removed by dry/wet processes. The technology for dry  removal of resist using oxygen plasma (hereinafter referred to  as ashing) has been used widely for more than a decade. Problems  in the ashing process include damage such as charge-up and metal  contamination, and the ashing residue. This report describes  ashing technologies usable with 256M DRAMs.  <H5>  Damage </H5>   Damage produced in the ashing process can be divided into  four categories: metal contamination, charge-up, ion impact  damage, and UV irradiation damage. Each of these will be  described below.  <H5>  1. Metal Contamination </H5>   When an alkali metal (usually Na) is implanted in  SiO[.sup]2[/] during ashing, mobile ions are generated  varying the threshold voltage of MOS transistors. Similarly, the  implantation of heavy metal in an Si wafer or Si[.sup]2[/]  causes stacking faults, or a deterioration of the withstand  voltage of the gate-oxide film of MOS transistors. It is agreed  that the target value of metal contamination with 256M DRAMs  should be no more than 1 x 10[.sup]9[/]/cm[.sup]2[/].    With ashing using oxygen plasma, the metal oxides in the  resist cannot be removed due to the low vapor pressure, and  hence remain on the wafer surface. There are even cases in which  the metal penetrates the oxide film, depending on the processing  condition of the ashing. The major causes of this are ion impact  (knock-on), charge-up, and temperature, but the detailed  mechanism is not yet known.    Success in the reduction of metal contamination lies in  reducing the influence of charged particles, so the use of  down-flow ashing or ozone ashing is optimum for this purpose.  From the viewpoint of the process, studying the addition of  H[.sup]2[/]O,[.sup]1[/] or low-temperature ashing may be  necessary.  <H5>  2. Charge-Up </H5>   In the ashing process, charged particles in the plasma cause  charge-up and degrade the withstand voltage of the gate  insulation film. This charge-up can be evaluated by measuring  the V[.sup]fb[/] shift of MNOS diodes. With this method,  after previously identifying the relationship between the  voltage applied to the gate of MNOS diodes, V[.sup]a[/], and  the V[.sup]fb[/] shift (_D_V[.sub]fb[/]), the relative  potential and polarity of the gate electrode with respect to the  Si wafer is estimated from _D_V[.sup]fb[/] after plasma  processing. Figure 1 shows the structure of an MNOS diode, and  Figure 2 shows the relationship between the voltage applied to  the gate of an MNOS diode, V[.sup]a[/], and the  V[.sup]fb[/] shift (_D_V[.sub]fb[/]) when the voltage  application period is 1 minute. The detection limit in  _D_V[.sup]fb[/] evaluation is variable depending on the  sample structure and measuring method, but in general it is +/-  0.1 V with _D_V[.sup]fb[/]. Among the currently available  ashing equipment, the equipment with _D_V[.sup]fb[/] within  +/- 0.1 V uses the down-flow system as with coaxial ashing  equipment (with the electrode design optimized) and microwave  down-flow ashing equipment (with the chamber structure  optimized) or does not use plasma as with ozone ashing  equipment. The equipment providing smaller _D_V[.sup]fb[/],  while performing ashing processing in plasma, includes the  helical asher (_D_V[.sup]fb[/]  +/- 0.25 V) and microwave  asher (_D_V[.sup]fb[/]  0.4 V).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-07A> Figure 1. Structure of MNOS Diode </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-07A> Figure 2. Relationship Between Voltage Applied to MNOS </FIG>       With ashing equipment using capacity-coupling RF plasma or  surface-wave microwave plasma,[.sup]2[/] it is necessary to  reduce charge-up by applying the down-flow system in which the  wafer is separated from the plasma discharge area, or by  improving the uniformity of plasma density through the  optimization of the equipment or process.  <H5>  3. Ion Impact Damage </H5>   Ion impacts cause the knock-on of metals, sputtering and  crystal defects. Ion impact energy is determined by the  difference between the plasma potential and wafer potential.  Crystal defects can be evaluated by thermal wave measurement.  Figure 3 shows the results of thermal wave measurements by  irradiating four kinds of plasma. The down-flow (coaxial) ashing  equipment presents an identical thermal wave signal level to the  reference; the microwave ashing equipment, which exposes the  wafer to plasma, increases the signal level slightly; and the  O[.sup]2[/] RIE equipment (V[.sub]DC[/] = -100 V), which  uses a large ion impact energy, increases the signal level  drastically.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-07B> Figure 3. Thermal Wave Signals of Various </FIG>     <H5>   4. UV Irradiation Damage </H5>   When vacuum UV rays (_l_ = 140 nm or less) above the band  gap  energy of SiO[.sup]2[/] (8.8 eV) is irradiated, electron-hole  pairs are produced in SiO[.sup]2[/] and the holes are trapped  near the interfaces.[.sup]3[/] It has also been reported  that, in a photo-etching experiment, neutral traps were produced  by etching using UV rays with _l_ = 194 nm.[.sup]4[/]    As seen from the above, it is desirable to avoid UV rays  with  _l_ = 200 nm or less as much as possible.  <H5>  Problems in Resist Removal </H5>   As it is said that particles of more than one-fifth to  one-tenth the minimum fabrication size degrade the device  characteristics and decrease yield, the production of particles  with diameters of more than 0.05 to 0.02 m should be  minimized with 256M DRAMs (0.25 to 0.20 m process). There  has  been little research on the removal of these particles  (residues) in ashing, but the basic orientation may be to use  ashing for the removal of organic components (resist) and use a  wet process for the removal of inorganic components (metals,  etc.), contained in the resist. (It is desirable that ashing  turns the inorganic components into a state easily removable by  a wet process at the same time as removing the organic  components.)    Resist removal by the ashing process is specially difficult  in cases where the resist is hard to release due to modification  after high-dose ion implantation, for example, and in cases  where the reaction products attached during etching remain as  residues after aluminum etching or gate etching. These examples  will be described in detail below.  <H5>  1. Resist Removal After High-Dose Ion Implantation </H5>   When high-dose ions are implanted using a positive resist as  the mask, the rise in temperature due to ion impact degrades the  resist surface, causing a drastic drop in the ashing rate in  cases where the ashing is based on oxygen radicals. If ashing is  processed at high temperature to increase the ashing rate, a  phenomenon in which the resist splits into small pieces  (pumping) occurs, and the resist turns into a state in which  complete removal is impossible (a state in which oxidation is  difficult).    Figure 4 [photos not reproduced] shows a cross-sectional SEM  micrograph after the pumping of a resist. The pumping is  considered to be due to the emission of N[.sup]2[/] or other  degases from the lower part of the resist that has not been  degraded by high-temperature ashing. The pumping can be  prevented by eliminating the gases in the resist by applying UV  curing or hard baking to the resist before ion implantation.  However, a fine residue is produced in the case of ashing based  on oxygen radicals, even after UV curing or hard baking. For the  present, such residue is removed by post-cleaning.    The most effective method to remove the degenerated layer on  the surface is ashing using the reaction with ion impact. It has  been reported that H[.sup]2[/]O + H[.sub]2[/] RIE is  capable of complete dry removal of ion-implanted  resist.[.sup]5[/] However, as plasma processing, such as RIE,  is accompanied by the potential of charge-up, ion impact damage,  and contamination due to the chamber, such damage must be  reduced.  <H5>  2. Resist Release After Aluminum Etching </H5>   Figure 5 [photo not reproduced] shows a cross-sectional SEM  micrograph of the result of ashing with O[.sup]2[/] plasma  after aluminum etching. The residue shown in the photo is a  compound of the aluminum sputtered during etching. A similar  residue is also produced after via hole etching.    Figure 6 [photo not reproduced] shows a cross-sectional SEM  micrograph after via hole etching. This residue has previously  been removed by ashing and a chemical solution process, but it  has recently been reported that it can be removed by F +  H[.sup]2[/]O down-flow ashing and pure water  processing.[.sup]6[/]    The proposed mechanism is to substitute the aluminum  compound  with fluoride by F + H[.sup]2[/]O down-flow ashing and  dissolve it in pure water.    To deal with aluminum corrosion, a system has been  implemented in which the etching equipment, ashing equipment,  and wet tank are coupled to perform resist removal continuously  in vacuum.  <H5>  3. Resist Release After Gate Etching </H5>   Highly selective etching of poly-Si uses HBr gas. When  poly-Si etched with an HBr-type gas is ashed with O[.sup]2[/]  plasma, a residue is produced on the resist  sidewalls.[.sup]7[/] This residue is silicon oxide film  produced when SiBr[.sup]x[/] deposited during etching reacts  in the atmosphere. A similar residue is also observed in  low-temperature etching of poly-Si using Cl[.sup]2[/]  gas.[.sup]8[/] This residue can be removed by wet etching  (SiO[.sup]2[/]) but removal through ashing is being studied  to reduce the decrease of the film on the base SiO[.sup]2[/].  There has been a report that it can be removed by O[.sup]2[/]  + CF[.sup]4[/] down-flow ashing.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   Ashing methods which do not damage devices of the 256M DRAM  class may be low-temperature ashing of the down-flow or  ozone-type which cuts UV rays of _l_ = 200 nm or less.    Reduction of fine residue (with diameters of 0.05 to 0.02  m or more) is a concept left for the future.    Resist remaining after high-dose ion implantation can be  removed either by the complete-removal method using plasma or by  the method using ashing (down-flow or ozone system) based on  oxygen radicals by combining post-processing such as UV curing  and hard baking and post-cleaning. One of these methods may be  selected depending on the reduction of fine residue and damage  in the equipment using plasma.    There are cases in which reaction products deposited during  etching tend to remain as residue after post-etching resist  release. A method of adding fluorine-type gas has been proposed  to remove the residue, but since the addition of such gas  results in etching of Si and SiO[.sup]2[/], this requires an  improved selection ratio (with respect to Si and  SiO[.sup]2[/]), an improved ashing rate, uniformity, and  stable end-point detection. As the production of residue after  post-etching resist release is in large part affected by the  etching technology, new problems are expected to occur as  etching technology changes in the future.

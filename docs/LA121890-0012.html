			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> So the 49ers won at Anaheim Stadium and the Rams won at Candlestick Park. What  else is new? . . .  </P> <P> Don't blame this one on Cleveland Gary. . . .  </P> <P> Fred Claire shouldn't have to apologize for trading Hubie Brooks and keeping a  younger and better hitter, Kal Daniels. . . .  </P> <P> Less than 48 hours after the Dodgers dealt Brooks to the New York Mets for Bob  Ojeda, they sang happy birthday to Ojeda at a Stadium Club news conference and  wheeled out a cake big enough for 33 candles. . . .  </P> <P> Gary Carter would be a good pickup for a team whose candidates to back up  catcher Mike Scioscia are Carlos Hernandez and Barry Lyons. . . .  </P> <P> The Dodger-Giant rivalry is bound to heat up this season when Brett Butler-Kal  Daniels-Darryl Strawberry-Eddie Murray are matched against Willie McGee-Will  Clark-Kevin Mitchell-Matt Williams. . . .  </P> <P> So much for the depiction of Peter O'Malley as an owner who is satisfied to  have a winning team that makes money and won't spend that extra buck to win a  pennant. . . .  </P> <P> You would have thought that the Angels finished first in the American League  West last season, not 23 games out in fourth. . . .  </P> <P> Jack (the Ripper) Clark, a pull-hitting right-handed slugger, seems made to  order for Fenway Park. . . .  </P> <P> Bo Jackson's 88-yard run against Cincinnati was only the third-longest of his  Raider career. He went 92 against the Bengals last year and 91 at Seattle in  1987. . . .  </P> <P> Jackson and Eric Dickerson of the Indianapolis Colts each gained 117 yards  Sunday.  </P> <P> The difference was that Bo carried the ball eight times at the Coliseum and  Dickerson 28 times against the New York Jets at the Meadowlands. . . .  </P> <P> No Los Angeles NFL running back has been as exciting as Jackson since Jaguar  Jon Arnett was dodging, darting and dashing for the Rams from 1957-63. . . .  </P> <P> All four quarterbacks who went down over the weekend -- Jim Kelly, Phil Simms,  Jim Harbaugh and Steve DeBerg -- were playing on artificial turf. . . .  </P> <P> The Chicago Bears were more fun to watch when Mike Ditka was throwing temper  tantrums on the sideline. . . .  </P> <P> Peter Tom Willis, the rookie from Florida State, should develop into the best  of the Bear quarterbacks. . . .  </P> <P> Smiling Rodney Peete seems to enjoy his work. . . .  </P> <P> The New England Patriots aren't as good as their record would indicate. . . .  </P> <P> Late-season NFL cliche: "We can control our own destiny." . . .  </P> <P> You know the Broncos are having a lousy season when there are 11,042 no-shows  for a game against San Diego at Denver. . . .  </P> <P> There have been 13 sellouts for hockey at the Forum this season and only one  for basketball. . . .  </P> <P> Twenty Washington football players were named first- or second-team or  honorable mention All-Pacific 10. . . .  </P> <P> The new cradle of college football coaches is UCLA. Six of Terry Donahue's  former assistants are head coaches -- Jim Colletto at Purdue, Gary Blackney at  Bowling Green, Rich Brooks at Oregon, Dick Tomey at Arizona, Steve Axman at  Northern Arizona and Don Riley at East Tennessee State. . . .  </P> <P> Roy Firestone got three standing ovations -- and several sitting -- on opening  night at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas. . . .  </P> <P> All is peaceful in Naples, where Diego Maradona has returned to the starting  eleven. . . .  </P> <P> Harry Ornest, the former owner of the St. Louis Blues who was involved in a  scuffle with John Forsythe in the Hollywood Park Turf Club on Sunday, must have  seen too many hockey fights. . . .  </P> <P> KO magazine rates Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez, who defends his World Boxing  Council light-flyweight title against Rolando Pascua Wednesday at the Forum, as  the most feared fighter in the world. Ranked behind the 108-pound slugger are  the considerably bigger Michael Moorer and Mike Tyson. . . .  </P> <P> Patrick Ewing, who is eligible to become a restricted free agent next season,  will make at least $5.7 million if he stays with New York. . . .  </P> <P> Seattle would like to deal Dale Ellis as soon as he returns to the court and  displays his old skills. . . .  </P> <P> Cleveland, seeking a replacement for Mark Price, is among those teams  interested in Minnesota guard Pooh Richardson. . . .  </P> <P> Detroit isn't quite the same without James Edwards, who is injured. . . .  </P> <P> Morton Downey Jr., the controversial former TV talk show host, was one of the  organizers of the old American Basketball Assn. . . .  </P> <P> UCLA's No. 5 ranking in basketball is the Bruins' highest since late in the  1982-83 season. . . .  </P> <P> The Forum claims to have broken even financially on its first Chicago show, but  the local favorite, junior welterweight Louie Lomeli, got knocked out in the  first round. . . .  </P> <P> If Pete Sampras doesn't watch out, he'll give men's professional tennis a good  name.  </P></p>

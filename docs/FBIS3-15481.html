			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The new director of the Federal Counterintelligence  Service (FCS), Sergey Stepashin, has described the speculations  that FCS was carrying out an internal investigation or made any  arrests in the wake of the Ameses case as a conjecture. In an  interview with INTERFAX today, he said that apart from the  neighbors' suppositions of their disproportional expenses, the  Americans have no other evidence to prove that the Ameses worked  for the Russian intelligence.    Stepashin said he had met with Russian President Boris  Yeltsin shortly before he was appointed as FCS director, but he  declined to give any comments on it.    Asked whether the Russian special service will be reformed  once again, Stepashin said it was "quite a natural thing" under  the conditions when society is going through dramatic changes.  At the same time, he pointed out that the president's bid to  carry out no more purges in counterintelligence officers in  order not to squander the potential was strictly observed during  the present reformation.    Stepashin hoped that FCS will manage to retain its  high-class  professionals, and that they will efficiently fulfil their tasks.    According to the FCS director, Russia needs a stronger  special service capable of ensuring the state's security.</p>

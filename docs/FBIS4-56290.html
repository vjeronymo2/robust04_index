			<p>BFN     [Text] The Movement of Young Patriots [MOJEP] demands a  total embargo to resolve the current crisis. The secretariat of  MOJEP, as a political organization involved in the struggle of  the Haitian people for the return of democracy, peace, and  social security in the interest of all Haitians, is pleased to  send this letter to Haiti's four friendly countries, the United  States, France, Canada, and Venezuela, to solicit a total and  impartial blockade to force the criminals of Port-au-Prince to  hand over power to constitutional Haitian President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide. They have monopolized it since the  bloody military coup of 29 September 1991.    Dear countries friendly to Haiti, says MOJEP, we pray you to  please show understanding by granting us this request. We count  on your spirit of collaboration, says the letter signed by [word  indistinct] Herve, organization secretary general, and Louis  Bauduy Francois.</p>

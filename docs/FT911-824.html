			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil set to import Dollars 1bn worth of grain THE drought in Brazil's south-central region will force the country to import Dollars 1bn (Pounds 578.8m) worth of grains this year, according to the Technical Trade Co-ordinator (CIC), which forms part of the the Ministry of Economics. Argentina is likely to provide about 80 per cent of imports, strengthening the country's position as the world's biggest grain exporter. This figure includes plans to import up to 120,000 tonnes of soyabeans - traditionally one of Brazil's main export products. Heavy damage from the drought has led analysts to predict a 22 per cent drop in the soyabean crop this year, compared to 1990. The agency has also received government authorisation to import 13,000 tonnes of soyabean oil, and expects total foreign purchases of the product to reach 60,000 tonnes this year. Brazil will import between 800,000 and 1m tonnes of rice, said a CIC spokesman, including 350,000 tonnes from Argentina and Uruguay and the rest from the US, Thailand, Vietnam and other countries. The rice scheduled to come in from Argentina and Uruguay will bear no import tariff, while imports from other sources will be taxed at 15 per cent. Brazil will also take in about 1.5m tonnes of corn, and 3m tonnes of wheat from abroad, according to the CIC. Again, Argentina will be supplying the bulk of purchases. 'The prolonged drought in Brazil's key south-central growing area has been devastating,' said a CIC spokesman. 'This, coupled with tight agricultural credit, has led to severe shortages in all these products.'</p>

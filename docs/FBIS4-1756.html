			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 2 (XINHUA) -- The Beijing Municipal  Government has recently adjusted its water conservancy  construction program in a bid to fight more efficiently against  the worst drought in a century.    In the worst-hit of the farming areas administered by  Beijing  municipality, some people have to go as far as 10 kilometers to  fetch water for villagers and livestock.    Local officials said that changes have been made in  irrigation projects now under construction so as to concentrate  more funds and manpower on those for the purpose of fighting  against drought.    The government also decided that residents will temporarily  be moved out of a few villages where the water situation has  come to the worst.    Since the beginning of the year, Beijing had only 2.1 mm of  rain, while the total rainfall in 1993 was only one third of  that in a normal year.    Due to the sustained drought, the water stored in the  Guanting and Miyun reservoirs, the capital's major water  sources, dropped by 560 million cubic m compared with the same  period last year, the 12 medium-sized reservoirs by 45 million  cubic m, while most of the small reservoirs and pools have  nearly dried up.    Some 100,000 ha of the city's 160,000 ha of wheat farmland  is  now threatened by the drought.    Nearly 100,000 people and 10,000 head of livestock are  facing  water shortages. Some 10,000 people have to fetch water from  three km away, and some even from 10 km away.</p>

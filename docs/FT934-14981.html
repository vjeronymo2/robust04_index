			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Alternative port in storm over Hong Kong - Simon Davies on the implications of development plans for a mainland entrepot IN SPITE of Hong Kong governor Chris Patten's warnings last week of the enormous costs to both China and Hong Kong of delays to the expansion of the colony's port, Beijing must be feeling more sanguine about the issue. The day before Mr Patten's comments last Wednesday, one of Hong Kong's most influential businessmen signed up for an almost identical project in Yantian, which is just eight miles east of the territory's border with China. The acquisition of control of Yantian's port by Mr Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa group - a deal witnessed by China's premier Li Peng - inevitably raises concerns over whether Hong Kong's role as China's entrepot can be replicated. As Mr Patten told Hong Kong's Legislative Council last week, the colony's port remains crucial to its economic development. It employs 350,000 people and generates 15 per cent of the colony's gross domestic product. The boom in export processing in the Pearl River delta has been the main driving force behind Hong Kong's economy in recent years. In 1992, Hong Kong's throughput in TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) grew 29 per cent, making it the busiest container port in the world. Trade expands apace and the existing terminals will reach full capacity by mid-1995. This coincides with the planned completion of Container Terminal 9 (CT9), but as China continues to argue that its approval is necessary - ruling out funding for the consortia who were awarded the HKDollars 10bn (Pounds 850m) project - it is clear that it will not be operational until 1996. As Mr Patten warned: 'Ships will be turned away, and they may not return to use our port.' At the same time, rising costs and increasing congestion in the colony have already added to the attraction of constructing facilities in mainland China, which would be both cheaper and closer to the source of production. The newly-capitalised Yantian International Terminals will have constructed five 50,000-ton container berths by the end of 1995, creating handling capacity of 1.7m TEUs. The proposed CT9 will have four berths with capacity of 1.8m TEUs; but its estimated cost is about double the Yn5bn (at the official swap centre rate) being invested in Yantian. The Hutchison group, which controls around 60 per cent of Hong Kong's container throughput, has in effect hedged its bets. It will be a participant in Terminal 9, but it has also purchased 50 per cent of the port operations in the cities of Shanghai and Zhuhai - to the north of Macao - and it controls a consortium which will own 70 per cent of Yantian. According to Mr John Meredith, managing director of Hutchison subsidiary Hongkong International Terminals (HIT), the group is not anticipating future changes, but reacting to demand which already exists. In the case of Zhuhai, which will remain a feeder port, HIT will bring in more container business for Hong Kong, while the port in Shanghai is too distant to be deemed a serious competitor. Yantian, however, is one of only four international deep water ports designated by China, and it has the draught and infrastructure to absorb substantial shipping business which might otherwise go through the colony. Mr Meredith said: 'When we looked at Yantian five years ago, people only wanted to use Hong Kong. Now the demand is there.' Hong Kong does maintain substantial advantages to justify the higher costs of both construction and utilisation. Mr Tony Clark, secretary of Hong Kong's Port Development Board, maintains that it would take up to 10 years before China's ports could pose a competitive threat because of their tangled bureaucracy, inadequate infrastructure and lack of shipping support services. Yantian, however, has rail and road links already in place, and it will have a bonded zone, enabling it to by-pass customs procedures and operate as a trans-shipment centre. And it will be cheap. Hong Kong operators remain confident that the cake is growing so rapidly that there is enough for everyone. The Hong Kong government has forecast that its overall port traffic will increase by an annual average of 8 per cent between 1990 and 1996. Mr Clark said: 'Looking at the amount of cargo originating from southern China, it is very clear that Hong Kong alone will not be able to cope. China will need more than Hong Kong to sustain its trade.' This assumes Hong Kong is able to maintain the capacity and efficiency of its port in the face of the new competition, but the political impasse over Terminal 9 demonstrates no such assurance. Mr Patten claimed that if the project was delayed by just two years, Hong Kong's economy would lose HKDollars 20bn in the decade after 1997. With the signing of the Yantian deal, the resolution of the Terminal 9 dispute may have become less pressing for either Hutchison or Beijing. For Hong Kong, the outcome remains critical.</p>

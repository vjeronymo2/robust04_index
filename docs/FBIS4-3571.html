			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F> 1979 2429) in Beijing 20 April 1994: "Chinese Authorities Are  Seriously Worried About Stability"]    [Text] There were three noticeable slogans in the  resolution on developing the national economy adopted by the  Eighth National People's Congress at its second session last  March: first, to maintain "sustained, rapid, and healthy"  development of the national economy; second, to "grasp the  opportunity, deepen reform, open wider, promote development, and  maintain stability," this being the overall guideline for this  year's work in the whole party and country; third, to correctly  handle the relationship between "reform, development, and  stability." The first slogan is the strategy, and the last two  slogans are the tactics. The general spirit is to take economic  construction as the central link. The sustained, rapid, and  healthy development of the national economy is the foundation  for social stability and will also provide a favorable economic  and social environment for the smooth advancement of reform.  Stability is the precondition for reform and development, and  without a stable social environment, nothing can be  accomplished. Only by persisting in reform and opening and by  developing the economy can China maintain fundamental stability.    However, according to sources in Beijing, the strategy and  tactics for economic development laid down by the authorities  were not completely understood by local leaders at various  levels, therefore, they were not properly put into practice. In  view of this situation, the CPC authorities held a special  enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau in early April to  reiterate that leaders at the central, ministerial-provincial,  and prefectural-city levels must unify their thinking and should  fully understand and earnestly implement the principle of  ensuring the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the  national economy, and the meeting also stressed that in the next  few years, the whole party should give top priority to stability  and take it as the overwhelming task above everything else.  General Secretary Jiang Zemin also spoke at the meeting, and he  particularly mentioned the importance of stability.    Jiang Zemin said: How to properly handle the relationship  between reform, development, and stability is a key factor  concerning whether there is sustained, rapid, and healthy  economic development. "The central leadership holds that  development is the objective, reform is the driving force, and  stability is the guarantee. Stability is the precondition for  development and reform. Without a stable political and social  environment, development and reform are impossible. In this  sense, stability is of primary importance, and stability  overrides everything [wending yadao yiqie di 4489 1353 1090 0227  0001 0434 4104]. Without stability, nothing can be  accomplished. In fact, Western capitalist countries, developing  countries, and socialist countries as well, all give top  priority to the work of maintaining social stability. During the  period of the "two sessions" (referring to the Second Session of  the Eighth National People's Congress and the session of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), Comrade  Xiaoping once again pointed out that we had paid our tuition  fees in this regard and should now become clever. Eastern  Europe and the former Soviet Union were still paying their  tuition fees."    Jiang Zemin added: "The Central Political Bureau unanimously  understands the importance of stability overriding everything.  Therefore, it explicitly pointed out that all reform policies  and development measures which have a major impact on the  stability of the situation and social stability, and which may  cause major shocks to society, must be suspended immediately.  This is an attitude of being faithful to the people's  interests, to the state interests, and to the party's cause, and  is a realistic attitude. At the same time, this is also a major  criterion for judging whether leaders at various levels are  keeping in line with the central leadership [yu zhong yang bao  chi chi yi zhi 5280 0022 1135 0202 2170 0001 5268]."    People in political and economic circles in Beijing also  said  that since the beginning of this year, the Beijing authorities  have been continuously stressing the importance of stability.  Now, Jiang Zemin has further set forth the slogan that  "stability is the overwhelming priority [wending yadao yiqie  4489 1353 1090 0227 0001 0434]." This indicates that the  authorities's deep concern about instability outweighs their  considerations of reform and development. This is related to  the heavy tasks of reform this year. On the part of the CPC,  this year is a key year for implementing the "50 points" adopted  by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  for turning the planned economy into a market economy structure,  and is thus a year in which reforms will be carried out most  intensively. Reforms will at least be carried out in three  major fields. First, major reform measures will be adopted in  the fiscal and taxation, banking, and investment systems for the  purpose of establishing and improving the macroeconomic control  system; second, a modern enterprise system will be introduced in  state-owned enterprises; and third, price reform will be further  advanced in order to develop and improve the market structure.  All of these reforms must be carried out; otherwise, reform  will get nowhere. Although the reforms mentioned above cannot  be completed in one year, the main steps must be taken within  this year through careful arrangements so that significant  breakthroughs can be made in some key points. As reform has to  deal with tough issues and has to be carried out in many fields  at the same time, it could go beyond the people's endurance. If  the situation goes beyond the people's endurance, turmoil could  occur. Therefore, the central authorities also explicitly  pointed out that two principles must be observed in the process  of reform and opening: First, the principle of being generally  beneficial; that is, the adoption of any reform measure must  bring benefits to most people and must not cause most people to  suffer losses. Second, the principle of overall endurance; that  is, the overall endurance capacity must be taken into  consideration, reform measures that go beyond the people's  endurance should not be adopted even if the measures are  correct, and the timing of the adoption of such measures should  be decided according to current conditions.    The sources said that reform will be carried out according  to  the principles of general benefits and overall endurance, and  this means that reform measures will be adopted, but will be  adopted very prudently. This is correct. However, if the  authorities just stress that "stability is the overwhelming  priority," reform and development may be hindered. Without  reform, it will not be possible to build up a correct path of  development, and without development, it will not possible to  maintain stability over a the long term. Therefore, reform,  development, and stability are three interdependent things, and  the slogan that "stability is the overwhelming priority" may not  be appropriate.    The sources said that State Council Vice Premier Zhu Rongji  also spoke at the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau. He  said that in order to ensure the sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy, an important factor is to  consolidate party and government leading bodies at all levels.  There are three criteria for judging whether a party and  government leading body is a good one: 1) whether it  consistently takes economic construction as the central task; 2)  whether it is honest and incorrupt and is carrying out  down-to-earth work; and 3) whether it keeps in line with the  central leadership.    People in political and economic circles in Beijing say that  as explicit principles and policies for developing the national  economy have been laid down, Zhu Rongji grasped the key link by  stressing the role of leading bodies at all levels. Zhu set  forth three criteria requiring leading bodies to focus attention  on the central task without deviation, perform public duties  honestly without corruption, and obey the central authorities  for the sake of the overall public interest.    They said that there are still many problems in China, and  the most prominent problem is that some localities are not  obeying the central authorities. For example, inflation could  not be effectively curbed and was getting more and more serious,  and this was related to the fact that the local authorities were  still doing: things in their own way without regard to central  instructions. Beijing and Guangdong were criticized by the  central authorities for raising prices.    The sources said that these local leaders were daring to do  this even while Deng Xiaoping was still alive; once Deng passed  away, there would be a situation of separatist rule by local  lords. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct education for party  and government leading cadres in this regard and make them  understand: In the past 15 years since the beginning of reform,  the general trend was the devolution of power, with the central  authorities delegating powers to the local authorities; however,  at the present stage of building the market economy system, the  situation in which "the central government is poor while the  local governments are rich" must be changed, because only when  the central government has sufficient financial resources can  local governments also benefit. However, in today's market  economy, it is very hard to make people accept the idea of  taking the whole country into account. The best way is to  establish a legal system by means of legislation so that the  distribution of wealth can be determined by laws. This will be  an extremely arduous project of legislation!</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / US heaps praise on Russian premier The government of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin deserved 'much praise', Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, said yesterday in Moscow. His remarks underlined the strong support now being shown by the west to a government accepted as reformist, even after losing its best known reformers. Mr Brown is in the Russian capital with a team of US chief executives for talks with senior ministers, including Mr Chernomyrdin, on investment and trade. Their aim is to maintain the momentum of support for Russia, which was greatly accelerated last week with the conditional offer of a Dollars 1.5bn loan from the International Monetary Fund. The commerce secretary said yesterday 'the steps he (Mr Chernomyrdin) has taken have given us great confidence on the future - steps to hold down inflation, steps that represent fiscal prudence'. On the IMF loan deal - reached last week in talks in Moscow between Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Michel Camdessus, the Fund's managing director - he said it was 'terribly important, not only in practical terms. It also sends an important signal, it creates momentum'. Mr Brown's remarks came after a strong attack on the extension of the loan by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former deputy premier for finance, who said at the weekend that the government's policies would change 'in the wrong direction' once the loan was advanced. While Mr Brown was complimentary about Russia's macroeconomic stance, he was critical of the barriers met by foreign businessmen working in and with Russia. He said that rapidly varying taxes, recently imposed high tariff barriers and delays in the Russian parliament approving legislation were all 'major disincentives' to investment in the country. 'There must be some consistency (in taxation) - it's unrealistic to expect that companies will come if tax changes constantly,' he said. He stressed, however, that the message he wished to send was one of support. The US government and private sector were anxious to be supportive during Russia's transition to a market-driven economy. 'This is an economy which is moving in dramatic ways and we want to be as helpful as we can. There will be fits and starts, there will be bumps along the way. We want to be sure that these bumps do not cause disincentives that will make American businessmen want to pull away.'</p>

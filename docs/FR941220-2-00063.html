			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two letters from financial services firms seek a clearer definition of ``inactive status'' as used in the Regulatory Element. The letters have questions regarding the disposition of monies earned, but not paid, prior to inactive status, and the allowable level of interaction between an individual on inactive status and his or her member firm. One writer asks whether inactive status should be treated as a disciplinary event, while the other writer believes that the rules should state clearly that inactive status is in no way a disciplinary event. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four commenters address the re-entry provisions of the Regulatory Element. These concerns range from technical wording of the re-entry provision, to stating that the fine threshold is unfair with respect to technical violations and ambiguous in cases where several individuals are held jointly and severally liable, to stating that the provision regarding disciplinary actions is overly harsh. One commenter believes that the provision allowing the SEC, SROs, and state regulators to require a registered person to re-enter the Regulatory Element should be deleted, or at least changed to require a showing of cause. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter believes that Central Registration Depository (``CRD'') <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  support would help firms comply with the Regulatory Element. Specifically, CRD could be used by firms to identify registered persons and their length of service to determine how many of their registered persons would be subject to the Regulatory Element in each of the next few years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> CRD is a computerized filing and data processing system operated by the NASD that maintains registration information regarding registered broker-dealers and their registered personnel for access by state regulators, SROs, and the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One letter offers broad insights and recommendations for a continuing education program, but does not contain specific reactions to the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four letters were received from financial services firms that expressed concerns regarding the costs of complying with the Firm Element. Generally, these firms state that the Firm Element could have a disproportionately burdensome effect on smaller firms, as compared to larger ones. To mitigate these effects, the commenters suggest that the NASD prepare and administer training programs, or, alternatively, that subsidies be provided to smaller firms to help them comply with the Firm Element. Another commenter recommends a video via satellite program that would enable firms to secure qualified speakers, and be assured that the material provided would comply with the Firm Element.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two letters regarding the Firm Element have questions about those to whom it would apply. The first letter asks whether municipal securities brokers fall under the definition of ``covered persons'' for this part of the program. The second asks whether the Firm Element applies to sales assistants who are registered persons, or whether an accommodation for such persons could be made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Five letters comment on the standards for the Firm Element. The first commenter asks how and what information should be maintained regarding the program and offers suggestions. The second commenter believes that the Firm Element should focus on suitability, and favors some form of pre-approval regarding the contents of a firm's program. The third commenter asks whether a firm may include relevant compliance matters in the Firm Element so that it may meet its ``annual compliance interview/meeting'' requirement under the NASD Rules of Fair Practice. The fourth commenter believes that the Firm Element content requirements are too vague to ensure proper compliance. The fifth commenter questions the usefulness of feedback from the Regulatory Element in developing an appropriate Firm Element.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two financial services firms comment on the provision allowing the NASD to require members to undertake specific training. The first letter seeks a definition of the phrase ``class of covered registered person,'' stating that such a class should be clearly identifiable by firms. The second letter states that to grant the NASD discretion to mandate specific training for certain individuals or groups could have potentially arbitrary results that could place certain firms at a competitive disadvantage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four industry associations submitted letters in response to the proposal. Two associations, the Securities Industry Association (``SIA'') and the Security Traders Association (``STA''), are comprised almost entirely of people potentially affected by the proposal. The other two, The Association for Investment Management and Research ``AIMR'') and the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards (``CFP''), are active in the continuing education field and have many members who are potentially affected people.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The STA strongly supports the proposal, and expresses its desire to help implement the program. The SIA also supports the program, but believes that several of its aspects merit further consideration. The SIA believes that the NASD and the Council should develop standards to determine when registered persons may be required by regulators to re-enter the Regulatory Element, and the power of the NASD arbitrarily to prescribe specific training for a member firm. The SIA also supports in-house administration of the Regulatory Element, with appropriate controls. Lastly, the SIA seeks clearer guidelines to determine the adequacy of a given Firm Element training program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the AIMR and the CFP each endorse the proposal, both are concerned about overlap for individuals who hold their designations and are also subject to this proposal. Both groups desire to work with the Council to minimize the impact caused by the overlap between the proposed rules and the existing requirements of the AIMR and CFP on individuals who would be subject to both regimes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two parties that are active in the continuing education field responded to the proposal, the Securities Education Institute, Inc. (``SEI''), and the American Institute for Continuing Education (``AICE''). Both focus on the differences between the proposed program and programs that already exist in the insurance industry. Both seek more information regarding the Firm Element so as to help NASD members and independent training providers meet the program requirements. The SEI believes that administration of the Regulatory Element should not be limited to the NASD testing centers or to those firms with the proper in-house delivery means. Instead, interactive programs similar to those the SEI provides to the futures industry should be used (these would include safeguards already authorized by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

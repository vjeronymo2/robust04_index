			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 2 SAPA -- The cars of Umkhonto we  Sizwe [MK, Spear of the Nation] chief-of-staff Siphiwe Nyanda  and other commanders of the african national congress' military  wing were stoned by drunk MK soldiers at the Wallmannstal  assembly area, near Pretoria, on Monday [2 May], the area's  combined military centre said.    In a statement, the Wallmannstal Joint Operations Centre  [JOC] said MK soldiers at the assembly area were dissatisfied  with their pay and food.    Mr Nyanda, "chief-of-staff of the MK contingent of the  non-statutory element of the South African National Defence  Force (SANDF)", was called to explain the situation to the  disgruntled soldiers. During a meeting with the soldiers, a  small group of drunk troops stoned Mr Nyanda and other MK  commanders' cars.    Mr Nyanda asked the SADF contingent of the SANDF for help to  keep order, the JOC said.    The situation was brought under control and disciplinary  action would be taken after a thorough investigation, it said.</p>

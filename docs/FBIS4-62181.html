			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 13 (YONHAP) -- North Korea keeps  shunning a Russian expert's witness of the disintegration of a  submarine they had purchased from Russia supposedly for use as  scrap, it was learned here on Friday.    Officials at the Russian Defense Ministry said his Ministry  had several times asked North Korea to accept a Russian expert's  witness of the disintegration of a discarded Russian submarine  delivered to them last December. But, North Korea has not  affirmatively responded, they said.    Western sources here said North Korea seems to have already  begun disintegrating the submarine.    "As they reject a Russian expert's presence, there is the  strong possibility that they may recycle the submarine for  military purpose," the sources said.    They said that despite North Korea's rejection of such  witness, the Russian Pacific Fleet has decided to deliver more  discarded submarines to North Korea.    Last November, North Korea signed a contract with Russia for  the purchase of 12 discarded Russian submarines for use as  "scrap."    The contract provides for a Russian expert's witness of the  disintegration of the submarines delivered so as to dispel the  possibility of them being recycled militarily in North Korea.    One of the submarines was delivered to North Korea last  December and a North Korean tugboat is presently in Vladivostok  preparing to tow another.</p>

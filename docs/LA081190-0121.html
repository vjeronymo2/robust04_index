			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PHIPPS GEARS UP FOR THE LONG HAUL;  </P> <P> MOTOR SPORTS: SIMI VALLEY DRIVER CLOSING IN ON POINTS LEAD AS HE SEEKS HIS  FOURTH CONSECUTIVE WINSTON 100 VICTORY AT SAUGUS.  </P> <P> It's August. It's hot and it's sticky. Dave Phipps' kind of weather.  </P> <P> These are the dog days when Phipps labors in the garage of his Simi Valley home  well into the night, with no air conditioning, working "until my bones fall  asleep," to find an edge for his Sportsman division car.  </P> <P> After all, can you find a hotter driver at Saugus Speedway right now?  </P> <P> On July 7, Phipps was languishing 65 points behind points leader and defending  champion Will Harper of Tarzana. Now, Phipps is second, just 38 points behind  Harper entering tonight's Winston 100 at Saugus -- 60 laps more than a regular  Sportsman race.  </P> <P> This annual race -- worth double points in the standings -- has been won by  Phipps three years in a row.  </P> <P> "He's one of the guys I always think of," Harper said, looking ahead to the  100-lap race. "I always visualize a race before, and I can visualize Dave being  right there. He's definitely one of the first guys I'm thinking about."  </P> <P> It is not just tonight's event that concerns Harper. It's the next four  weekends of Sportsman driving as the Saugus season heads into the homestretch.  </P> <P> "He's definitely one of the guys I'm thinking about for the rest of the  season," Harper said. "He's a strong finisher."  </P> <P> Phipps, an unassuming 42-year-old with 11 years of driving experience,  downplays the compliments. How does Phipps explain his three consecutive wins  in the Winston 100?  </P> <P> "Probably luck," he said seriously. Phipps' modesty belies the fact that he is  a three-time Saugus Speedway points champion in the Sportsman division -- in  1984, 1987 and 1988.  </P> <P> In truth, Phipps did receive a break in the '89 Winston 100. After leading for  92 laps, Harper became entangled with some cars he was attempting to lap.  Phipps, driving patiently in second place, zipped in for the win.  </P> <P> "Will had me beat, and there wasn't much I could do about it," Phipps  acknowledged. "I was just in the right place at the right time."  </P> <P> But in 1988, Phipps led the final 40 laps. And in 1987, he passed Rich DeLong  Jr. on the 99th lap. It seems, after all, there is more to Phipps' success than  just luck.  </P> <P> "One thing is for sure, he doesn't have any leprechauns," Harper said. "He has  experience. That's why he wins. He's got experience and talent and dedication  and that has enabled him to take advantage of situations the last three years."  </P> <P> The stage seems set for Phipps this year too. He finished second and third in  his last two Sportsman races, displaying skilled driving in both races in  jockeying for position after starting back in the pack.  </P> <P> "I really look forward to these 100-lap races," he said. "I really enjoy them.  Maybe some of it is experience. I really don't know what I do other than that.  I probably put a little extra effort into putting the car together, make sure  everything is tight and adjusted. You know, this is two and a half times a  regular 40-lap, but it's over before you know it. It's still a sprint race.  </P> <P> "When momentum is with you, it's like any sport. Momentum gives you confidence.  If you think you can do it, you can. And I feel like I have a really excellent  chance of winning this race. Now, I mean, I don't feel like other guys  (shouldn't) bother showing up. . . ."  </P> <P> Phipps' voice trails off into laughter. But he's correct in anticipating a  hungry pack of drivers. Consider that coming into tonight's race, six drivers  are within 54 points of Harper. Right behind Phipps (218 points) in the points  standings are some young, hard-charging drivers such as Reseda's Larry Krieger  (215), Northridge's Keith Spangler (213) and Simi Valley's Craig Rayburn (208).  And Reseda's John Cran (205) and Carson's Gary Sigman (202) aren't far behind.  </P> <P> Put it all together and Phipps and his streak are facing a stern challenge.  </P> <P> "The other guys are getting experienced too," Phipps said. "They aren't really  beginners and they aren't going to quit. But I've done it before and I feel  like I can do it again."  </P> <P> Phipps, in fact, is so geared up for the race that he is hoping that race  officials will go with an inverted starting field, meaning the fastest cars  start at the back. Phipps believes it will make things a little more exciting.  And what's wrong with a little excitement, he reasons.  </P> <P> "I hope the fast car doesn't start in the front," he said. "It's much more of a  dull show. I'd rather see several guys compete for a position."  </P> <P> Other drivers can only cringe at hearing that. It seems, gentlemen, that Dave  Phipps is ready to start his engine.  </P></p>

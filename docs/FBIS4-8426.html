			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Athens by correspondent Andjelko Perincic] </F>   [Excerpts] Dr. Mate Granic and Karolos Papoulias, the  foreign ministers of Croatia and Greece, agree that there is  great scope for the comprehensive development of relations,  especially economic relations, between the two countries.    Minister Granic, who arrived in Athens from Ankara this  morning, had private talks for longer than expected with his  counterpart and host, Papoulias. Afterwards they were joined by  other members of the delegations and after the talks which are  now over, and which lasted several hours, the two ministers  spoke to journalists. [passage omitted]    The Croatian minister assessed that Greece could play a  positive role in the peace process. This relates above all to  the implementation of the Washington agreement and the inclusion  of the Serbs in the negotiations on a federation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The EU, currently presided over by Greece,  should play a more active role in this process. [passage  indistinct]</p>

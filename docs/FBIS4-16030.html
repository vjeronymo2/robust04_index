			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> Diplomatic Correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and  others]    [Text] As INTERFAX has learned from Russia's foreign  ministry, on Tuesday the UN Security Council will examine the  situation in former Yugoslavia following NATO's air strikes on  the Serb positions at Gorazde (Eastern Bosnia).    In an interview with INTERFAX, a top Russian diplomat  forecast a tough talk in New York.    In his words, the Russian representative will apparently ask  why Moscow was informed of the decision to use force in  Bosnia-Herzegovina post hoc. In terms of politics, such an  attitude toward Russia as a partner is inadmissible. However,  in practical terms, not everything is unequivocal, the diplomat  said. How smart we would be, if information on strikes would  reach us a few minutes before their delivery, as happened to  Britons, if media are to be believed. In this case, Russia's  "no" might be ignored for purely technical reasons: The  mechanism of a war machine is already in motion.    The diplomat stated that Russia is now the only country that  the Bosnian Serbs agree to deal with. After what happened they  have abandoned contacts with UN, charging this organization with  a pro- Moslem slant. Mediation has been conducted by the  Russian President's Special Envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister  Vitaliy Churkin. Apparently, his current efforts would be  unnecessary, if Russia had been told about the decision to  strike on Bosnian Serbs in advance, he suggested.    He regards as extremely unlikely the possibility of NATO's  further air attacks against Bosnian Serbs without consultations  with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]. Hypothetically, this could  be the case only if Serbs downed a NATO plane, he said.    In his opinion, all three sides -- the Serbs, the Moslems,  and UNPROFOR need restraint more than anything else. If the  parties stir further hostilities, the situation may get out of  control, he said.</p>

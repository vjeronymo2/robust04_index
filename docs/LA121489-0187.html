			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> GTE Agrees to Cash Settlement: GTE Corp. has accepted $4.5 million from Home  Shopping Network as a cash settlement that ended a $100-million damage award  against the television retailer. The two sides announced in November they had  reached an undisclosed settlement, but the dollar amount became public through  filings to the Florida Public Service Commission. GTE has said its legal costs  exceeded the settlement. The PSC has to determine whether those costs should be  passed along to ratepayers or to shareholders.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] An element of the terrorist monafeqin [hypocrites --  pejorative reference to Mojahedin-e Khalq] involved in the  bombing of the holy shrine of the [Imam] Reza, may peace be upon  him, has been identified, announced the Ministry of  Intelligence. The spokesman for the ministry distributed the  picture of the individual and called on the Iranian public to  help arrest him, IRNA reported.    The individual, Mahdi Nahvi, was identified after another  monafeqin element was arrested while trying to place a bomb at  the Makki Sunni mosque in Zahedan last Thursday [23 June].    The spokesman called on the Iranian people to inform the  ministry's information headquarters -- telephone number 113 for  provincial centers and 233031 in Tehran -- should they come into  contact with him or have any form of information on him.</p>

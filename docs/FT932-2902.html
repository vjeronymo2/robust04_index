			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Rising yen deals fresh blow to Nissan - The Japanese carmaker's president talks to William Dawkins and Michiyo Nakamoto NISSAN recently aroused a stir when it became the first Japanese carmaker since the second world war to announce a plant closure. The pain, while mild by the standards of the wholesale job cuts experienced by the US and European car industries, is not yet over, it was revealed yesterday. Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, Nissan president, said his restructuring plan had not taken account of the blow to export earnings dealt by the yen's unexpectedly steep rise. This was the first time that the yen had appreciated significantly against both the dollar and the D-Mark, hitting Nissan's price competitiveness in both the US and Europe, its main export markets, he explained. Nissan's options included price rises and another round of cost-cutting, although there was no definite plan yet, he said. This comes after a year in which Nissan made its first loss as a listed company and had to announce the shut-down of the Zama car assembly plant near Tokyo, the main part of a plan to shed 5,000 jobs out of Nissan's 53,000 Japanese workforce over the next three years. The company will not make any redundancies but will rely on natural wastage, yet the need to shrink the business is a heavy blow to the pride of Japan's second largest car and truck group. Nissan's workforce might already seem lean by European car industry standards, a reflection of the fact that Japanese carmakers sub-contract more components to outside suppliers than do European manufacturers. Nissan reckons that subcontracted components represent 70 per cent of its manufacturing costs, as against the 60 per cent or so claimed by French car makers. Even so, Mr Tsuji warned that he might have to wield the knife again. Nissan had cut costs in previous downturns, 'but then we tended to put on more weight, more fat than before' when a recovery materialised, he said. This time, Nissan would need to stay smaller, said Mr Tsuji, a man of gravity whose engineering background is said to have earned him the respect of Nissan manufacturing staff at the sharp end of the job cuts. The closure of Zama would not have a big impact on Nissan's financial position, Mr Tsuji says. But clearly Nissan believes the move was essential to adjusting to what it fears is a long-term market decline. 'Until now we could always expect an increase in demand and we set our production capacity accordingly. But we can no longer expect demand to meet the 2.5m units per year capacity Nissan has.' The three-year plan aims to slim capacity to 2.3m units annually. The Japanese car market looked set for a recovery in the next six months or so, but Mr Tsuji saw no sign of an upturn in Europe, where Nissan sales volumes fell 10.4 per cent in the first five months of the year in a market down 17.3 per cent. Asked about the outlook for his Japanese competitors, Mr Tsuji said that the 11 car and truck makers could all survive on condition that they did not poach each other's market specialities. This contrasts with a widespread view in Japan that the nation's car industry will need deep restructuring. The other cloud on the Japanese car industry's horizon is the growing trade friction with the US and the European Community. Tensions with the Clinton administration posed more of a problem than did the EC's fresh bout of anxiety over Japanese car imports and local production, Mr Tsuji said. Local content for Japanese carmakers was lower in the US than in Europe and Mr Tsuji recognised the need to increase that content in the face of the tensions. Here, it was a strength for Nissan to have a Mexican plant which exported engines and transmissions to Nissan's car assembly plant in Tennessee. Vehicle demand in Latin America was so strong that Mr Tsuji saw no room for Nissan Mexico to export vehicles to the US. The European Commission's attempts to reduce Japanese car export quotas to the Community and to count Nissan UK's production in the quotas were 'unfair and unreasonable,' he said. The pressure for tighter quotas, mainly exerted by France and Italy, was a response to the much steeper fall in European car demand than had been anticipated in the 1991 Japanese car imports accord. However, Nissan had no intention of changing its UK business plans in the light of all this. 'We should be regarded as a fully-fledged member of the EC,' Mr Tsuji said. Like other Japanese car-makers, Nissan was studying the fast-growing Chinese market. But Mr Tsuji was cautious about Nissan's ambitions there. 'We still do not know how aggressive we should be in the Chinese market. The future of China is still uncertain,' he said. Clearly, Nissan will think hard before embarking again on the breakneck expansion of the past. Mr Tsuji does not deny that the Japanese group is at an important watershed.  -------------------------------------------------------------                          NISSAN CAR SALES  -------------------------------------------------------------                                                      % change                 1992     % share    1991    % share     92/91  ------------------------------------------------------------- USA*          414,011      5.0    412,388     5.0       +0.4 West Europe   437,839      3.2    439,218     3.3       -0.3 Japan         885,648     19.9    999,662    20.5      -11.4  ------------------------------------------------------------- *Including Infiniti Source: Automotive Industry Data  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Arts: Piano duo par excellence - Concert Two pianists on a single concert platform, whether performing on one instrument or two, tend to be assigned to the fringes of the musical profession. The dazzling qualities of Yaara Tal and Andreas Groethuysen, whose recital at the Wigmore Hall on Wednesday formed their London debut, helped shed new light on why this general marginalising process has come about, and why - at least on such occasions as this - it can seem so wastefully unjust. The domestic background to the two-pianist performance tradition has much to do with it (before the arrival of the gramophone, the transcription of orchestral and operatic works for four pianistic hands was the most popular way of disseminating them throughout the the music-loving public). But too often, once the novelty has worn off, the concert-hall pairings of even the most celebrated pianists can prove more enjoyable for the executants than for the audience. Not this time. The European reputation of this young team preceded them here  -the Israeli Tal and the German Groethuysen have been working together for eight years, with already six records on the Sony label to their credit. The pleasures of listening to them on Wednesday, in an entirely four-hand, single-keyboard programme, revealed themselves as exactly those of the best chamber-music-making: all freak elements of muscularity, gymnastic display and co-ordinated trickery had been purged from the experience. These two are both superb individual artists - Tal sparkles on the higher lines, Groethuysen's suave yet solid tones amply fill out the lower - whose personalities and characteristics contrast and balance each other with satisfying exactitude. As in the best chamber-musical team-work, the highest degree of ensemble co-ordination can be taken for granted: it is always directed outwards, beyond the frissons of the immediate moment. They opened with a 'display' sonata (in C minor, Op. 10) by Czerny, the Beethoven pupil and noted piano pedagogue. What might in other circumstances have sounded merely facile and flash was here continually exquisite, bold and charming. In Schubert's F minor Fantasia their delicacy of sculpted phrasing and expertise in range of dynamics could perhaps be criticised for diluting the essential ruggedness of the invention. On the other hand, it was not wilting, languid delicacy and expertise, and it touched veins of pathos in the music rarely even hinted. After the interval Brahms's 16 Waltzes, Op. 39, mounted a catalogue of melodic verve exactly tempered by rhythmic subtlety. The finale, an unattributed transcription of Mendelssohn's C minor Piano Trio, Op. 66, summed up every quality that had made the recital so rewarding, and added thereto a controlled large-scale bravura that sent one out of the hall on a cloud of happiness and elation. I cannot wait to hear this duo again.</p>

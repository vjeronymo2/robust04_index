			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Observer: Heavy artillery GPA's complaint to the European Commission that the membership rules of the FT-SE 100 Index discriminate against Irish companies raises the intriguing possibility of a head-on confrontation between past and present competition commissioners. Peter Sutherland, Brussels' competition watchdog until 1988, is now a non-executive director of the aircraft leasing company and chairman of AIB Group, another Irish company piqued by the FT-SE 100 steering committee's policy. And if that is not enough EC competition clout to be going on with, Sutherland's 'chef de cabinet' in Brussels, Richard O'Toole, also now works for GPA as its official Irish mouthpiece. Sir Leon Brittan, the current commissioner, has nothing but praise for Sutherland's work in Brussels, but if he decides to take sides against his predecessor he may find himself accused of 'trying to defend the indefensible'. That was the charge Sutherland levelled at Peter Jones, the index steering committee's chairman, in a letter to the FT in April.</p>

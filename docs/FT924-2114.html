			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Greenway makes name as a parliamentary sketchwriters' delight MR Harry Greenway has made his name at Westminster as a parliamentary sketchwriters' delight - never stumped for words and supporting a bewildering variety of causes, Alison Smith writes. A regular participant in the questions to ministers that open each day's proceedings, he has achieved heights of publicity that his greyer colleagues must envy. While some of his causes are populist - such as his long-standing concern on animal welfare - he is not above speaking his mind on more local issues. Memorably he asked for rice pudding to be served more often in the House of Commons cafeteria and complained about the price of humbugs in the Commons kiosk. A devotee of Mrs Thatcher, in March 1989 he tabled a Commons motion congratulating her on becoming a grandmother. Before entering politics Mr Greenway was a deputy headmaster at a school in south London, and education has remained one of his specialist areas, with religion and the arts. Until the April election he was a member of the cross-party education committee. He now serves on the employment select committee. He has been MP for Ealing North since 1979, increasing his majority from just over 1,000 when he was first elected to 15,000 in 1987, although in April this year it slipped back to just under 6,000.</p>

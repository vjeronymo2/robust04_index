			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The People's Party's [PP] executive committee is  this evening analyzing the results it obtained, after having  tasted victory. The PP has said that it will wait until the  government reacts and draws conclusions for national policy  after what has happened in the European elections. The PP does  not intend at present to submit a censure motion. A news  conference was scheduled to be held after the PP executive  committee meeting. Antonio Criado is at PP headquarters in  Madrid:    [Criado] The executive committee has been meeting for two  hours, discussing the 12 June elections. Javier Arenas, who was  a candidate in yesterday's elections, has just emerged and  expressed his satisfaction at the result in Andalusia because he  said that a political era has finally ended in Andalusia. As we  said, this news conference has just begun. According to what  RNE has been able to learn, the PP insists that results in the  European elections are a clear response from the people and have  domestic political consequences despite the European nature of  the elections. The PP awaits the government's decision. They  call on Felipe Gonzalez to take actions.    In statements to RNE, Mariano Rajoy, the PP's deputy  secretary general, said that it would be silly for the  government to try to carry on as normal not only by not taking  on political responsibility but also without even knowing if it  had sufficient support in the Congress of Deputies. He  highlighted several scenarios ranging from a no-confidence  motion to the calling of general elections and Felipe Gonzalez's  resignation. Regarding the presentation of a censure motion,  which it is up to the PP to submit, he said that he is not  convinced by this.    [Begin Rajoy recording] I think that we as the party of  opposition have to give an alternative and facilitate a way out  of the present situation. I think that it is very difficult to  facilitate that way out through the presentation of a censure  motion that could have a political effect but that later in  practical terms would come to nothing. Therefore, I don't rule  out the presentation of that censure motion, but personally I do  not think that it is the most correct formula to use to solve  Spain's problems at present. [end recording]    [Criado] Mariano Rajoy also said that Felipe Gonzalez's  continuation as prime minister is now no longer positive or good  for Spain's general interests. Rajoy will give an official news  conference tomorrow to discuss what was said during the  executive committee meeting. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Arts: This 'Nutcracker' has true magic - Clement Crisp, to his surprise, enjoys a schools matinee in Birmingham The time is 1.59 pm 'Only a minute to go, Miss' says an urgent infant voice to its teacher. The house-lights go down. A buzz and twitter as of a million birds fills the theatre. The first notes of the overture - not the most boisterous of musical beginnings - and the house is hushed. The Birmingham Royal Ballet is giving a schools matinee in its home theatre on Thursday afternoon, and the red and gold disease, that most welcome of childhood ailments, infects the whole assembly, as the young succumb to the magic of the theatre. And, surrounded by an infant horde to whet the appetite of a Herod, I enjoyed The Nutcracker - which I had scarcely expected to do under these circumstances - and equally enjoyed the children's response to the production. There could be no better introduction for newcomers to ballet, or the theatre. Sir Peter Wright's staging is a joy. It has true magic, lively action, clever (but not too clever) ideas - Clara as a young dancer; Drosselmeyer as a conjuror - and splendid designs by John Macfarlane that provide their own magic and excitement. Best of all this staging conveys a sense of wonder, about the tale itself and about the fact of being in a theatre. This is in part owed to Wright's feeling for the score. At its finest, and it is at its finest throughout Act 1 and much of Act 2, Tchaikovsky's genius finds sublime ways to suggest the enchantments of childhood and the nostalgia an adult feels for them. There is tenderness and sadness in the music, which speak very clearly in the adagio that precedes the Snow scene, and in the great pas de deux. The party and the mouse-battle find the composer writing at his most brilliant, and underlying the score is a thread of melancholy. Wright shows us these matters without undue emphasis; like the music, his staging touches lightly on profound feeling. The score sounded well with BRB's orchestra under Anthony Twiner, and the young listened and watched with attention and a huge responsiveness. They gasped at Joseph Cipolla's sleight of hand as his Drosselmeyer pulled off trick after trick - it is a fine reading. They thrilled on in-drawn breath to the grand transformation of the Christmas tree. They were held by the mouse-battle (here an elite corps of super-rats fighting a losing campaign). They cheered each number on that via crucis of dance tedium which is the second act divertissement, laughing at the Chinese dance (the best thing one can do to this ancient bore) and clapping along with the trepak - a Russian dance - maintaining strict tempo. The production, which is an unfailing delight even to as hardened a Nutcracker-lag as I now am, puts not a foot wrong for newcomers. And the tots gave fullest voice in appreciation of Sandra Madgwick and Peter Boal, the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Prince. Miss Madgwick was delightful. The dance was serene, her manner was radiant, the delicious ring of the celeste was deliciously matched in her steps. Peter Boal, a guest from New York City Ballet, is a true danseur noble, and he brought an easy dignity and impeccable technical manners - sure phrasing; clean bravura - to the demands of variation and coda. Everything about the afternoon was at its best, and the children told the dancers just how well-worthwhile such matinees are. BRB's artists play the piece with great warmth and charm. The Nutcracker should be a part of every child's memories: how good that Thursday's audience will have such a golden performance to treasure. Birmingham Royal Ballet brings the staging to the London Coliseum from December 22 until January 7.</p>

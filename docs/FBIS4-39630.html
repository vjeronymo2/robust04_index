			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Golts: "Celebration in Normandy: </F> Grand Spectacle Or Missed Chance?"]    [Text] It seems that the organizers of the celebration of  the 50th anniversary of the allied landing in Normandy have  expended on its organization almost as many resources as they  did half a century ago on the actual operation. Judging from  press reports it was indeed a grand affair. Up above, World War  II aircraft, including the legendary Spitfire, gave way to  modern fighters; while demonstration airborne assaults gave way  to amphibious landings. Fifteen warships took part in the naval  review, including the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier George  Washington. Amphibious vehicles put ashore bearing the colors of  the units which took part in the landing. There were also  grateful speeches addressed to the veterans by leaders of the  states whose soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy, along  with parades and wreath-laying ceremonies.    Yet for all the solemnity of the celebrations and the  genuine  enthusiasm of their participants, what took place prompts the  feeling that something extremely important was left unsaid and  undone. The country -- Russia -- without which neither the  Normandy landing nor victory would have been possible took no  part in the celebrations. Unfortunately, the Cold War has also  cast its shadow over our common victory (let us recall that it  was then that the actual "united nations" concept appeared).  For many years our former allies, who had become our enemies,  kept silent about the other side's role in crushing fascism.    Now that confrontation has become a thing of the past, a  chance has appeared to break the habit of dividing the great  victory into "ours" and "not ours." So far this chance has not  been taken. What a great pity. After all, what is the point of  organizing such celebrations? Above all, of course, it is to  pay due respect to those who achieved this feat.    But something else is important: Such celebrations are  necessary to remind us of the unity of mankind in opposing the  forces of evil. And today are not fascism, aggressive  nationalism, and dictatorships of various types and sorts not  throwing down a challenge to freedom? Today is there no need to  oppose these challenges with combined efforts? Nowadays, when  East and West -- with considerable difficulties -- are trying to  create a new European and global security architecture by  overcoming their own prejudices and fighting other people's,  many people are seeking a historical linchpin for new  cooperation. The brotherhood-in-arms of World War II could be  such a linchpin. The chance to demonstrate this was missed in  Normandy. The 50th anniversary of victory presents another  chance to show that the division of the world has been done away  with. Let us hope that the politicians are perspicacious enough  not to miss that one as well.</p>

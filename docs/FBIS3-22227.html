Hotovchyts, minister for issues  of protecting the population from the consequences of the  accident at the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant, had a  conversation with Finland's Ambassador Extraordinary and  Plenipotentiary in Ukraine Erik Ulfstedt at the latter's  request. The minister briefed the ambassador on what is being  done to eliminate the consequences of the accident and to  protect the population from them, and he explained how Ukraine's  difficult economic situation affects this activity.    The ambassador pointed out that the conversation helped him  to get a better understanding of the size of the catastrophe and  of the need to urgently resolve the relevant problems, and he  promised to inform his government about them. He showed  interest in the minister's individual proposals on cooperation,  in particular, on ways to utilize the timber from the zones  contaminated with radiation.</p>

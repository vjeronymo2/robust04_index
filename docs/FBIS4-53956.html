			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Japan's economy is poised  for recovery but prevailing downward indicators make continued  caution necessary, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Bank of  Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said Tuesday [24 May].    "The time is ripe for the economy to recover, with personal  consumption showing improvements," Fujii said in a speech read  by Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito at a meeting of the National  Association of Shinkin Banks.    Mieno said, "The economy is showing signs of hitting bottom,  with some indicators pointing to improvements in economic  activities led by personal consumption."    The central bank chief also cited various factors that  underscore the improvement of conditions over the same period  last year when the economy fell off after showing signs of  recovery. They included progressing inventory adjustments and  corporate restructuring, the spreading effects of the latest  fiscal and monetary measures and recovering overseas economies  led by the United States.    Fujii also repeated his "confidence" that the record 15.25  trillion yen stimulus package launched in February and the  fiscal 1994 budget would "contribute greatly to putting the  economy on a full-fledged recovery." But the two financial  leaders noted that the economy also faces possible downward  trends.    Fujii said, "the economy remains sluggish with tough  situations prevailing in capital investment and labor."    Mieno said, "cautious watching is still necessary" to see if  the recent improvements are sustainable enough to spread to the  overall economy.    "We must also keep in mind that negative factors prevail,"  he  said, citing continued volatile currency rates, "strong  adjustment pressure" on labor, and time needed for balance-sheet  adjustments by companies and financial institutions after the  collapse of the "bubble" economy boom in the late 1980s.    Regarding exchange rates, the central bank chief said,  "further careful watching is necessary," suggesting his  unchanged stance of intervening in currency markets to stem  excessive volatility.    Mieno called for continued positive efforts by banks to  clear  nonperforming loans, saying that liquidations are still  "mid-way," although emergence of new bad loans is slowing down.</p>

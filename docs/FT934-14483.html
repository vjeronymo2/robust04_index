			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Too reliant on litigation Sir, Your leader, 'Cutting red tape' (October 11), took a refreshing view of the rule-making process. Sadly, the radical suggestion that the government should set the regulatory objectives and leave the rest to litigation goes a bit far. Clear statement of the general principles makes legislation infinitely easier to understand. But often the implications need to be spelt out in some detail, especially where penalties or heavy damages may be the result. English courts only award compensatory damages, so large damages always mean that someone has already suffered a large loss or injury. A lot of regulations serve the function of instruction manuals rather than general laws. The dangers they are designed to avert may not be obvious to those involved. For example, many people are unaware of the risks of using the same knife to cut raw and cooked meat: the regulations aim to stop an outbreak of food poisoning, not to penalise careless or ignorant restaurateurs. The vice in most regulations is the way that the detail is organised. Far too often it follows the convenience of the drafter, not the reader. The unmanageable bulk of regulations is aggravated by the baroque way in which they are usually written. The areas covered by regulation may not be capable of much reduction. You rightly point out that one person's regulation is another person's protection. What could be done is to re-organise the whole body of regulations, setting them out in a logical structure. This would show up inconsistencies and obscurities in the present texts. A drafter dedicated to logical exposition would use more coherent and accessible language. Of course, this would cost quite a lot of public money. But the present alternative inflicts this cost, many times over, on the population at large in terms of time wasted trying to abide by the law.

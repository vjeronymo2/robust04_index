			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Minorco to restructure Chilean side Minorco, the Luxembourg-based mining and mineral resources company which is part of Anglo-American, the South African conglomerate, plans to restructure its Chilean operations in a move expected to raise up to Dollars 230m for its Mantos Blancos subsidiary. Under the plan, yet to be approved by Mantos Blancos shareholders, Mantos Blancos will sell its 49.9 per cent interest in Minera Mantos Minorco (MMML) to a wholly-owned offshoot of Minorco for Dollars 110m. Minorco already controls the other 51.1 per cent of MMML, a company formed in December 1992 to buy a one-third interest in the Collahusi copper joint venture with Chevron Exploration Corporation of Chile. Mantos Blancos, which is 74.9 per cent owned by Minorco, will also try to raise a further Dollars 120m through a rights issue. The rights issue will not be underwritten. Of the funds raised, Dollars 146m will be earmarked for Mantos Blancos' Santa Barbara/SX-EW project, which will expand the company's total copper reserves to 116m tonnes from 53m tonnes and extend the life of mine to the year 2010. The remainder will go to the Mantoverde copper project.</p>

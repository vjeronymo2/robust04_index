			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Linread advances 63% to Pounds 714,000 LINREAD, the fasteners manufacturer, reported a 63 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits despite faltering demand for its motor and aerospace components. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 714,000 in the six months to July 3, compared with Pounds 439,000 a year earlier restated from Pounds 1.05m for FRS 3 and FRED 4. Although turnover was only slightly down at Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 20m), Mr Peter Harrisson, chief executive, warned that deepening recession in continental Europe would hamper second half performance. 'The market is damned ugly. We don't see a massive upturn before 1995 - trading profits plateaued during the first half of this year and look unlikely to improve. Mr Harrisson said changes within the group, combined with tight management of working capital and reduced stocks, would strengthen the balance sheet and enable expansion when the market improves. A significant cut in gearing, from 50 per cent at the end of last year to 26 per cent, and in associated interest payments, allowed the company to lift the interim dividend to 1.57p (1.5p). Earnings per share showed a sharp improvement to 3.74p (0.62p). However, Mr Harrisson said: 'I'm not even cautiously optimistic about the future. Europe is depressed and recovery in the US is only slow. We don't see any evidence of green shoots.' His verdict reflects an interim loss by the company's commercial products division; no sign of improvement in the aero-engine market; and a 20 per cent fall in car sales in continental Europe.</p>

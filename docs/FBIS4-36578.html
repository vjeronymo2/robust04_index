			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Our special correspondent in Yemen, Ahmad Birru,  has reported on the atmosphere prevailing in Sanaa in the wake  of UN Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi's talks and the cease-fire decision.  [passage omitted]    Ahmad Birru met with Brahimi and asked him about the results  of his contacts with the Sanaa officials yesterday and today and  the talks he will be holding with the southern officials. He  also asked him to give an evaluation of the seriousness of the  new cease-fire decision. Brahimi said:    [Begin Brahimi recording] I had the honor to hold a long  meeting with his excellency the president of the republic at  noon today. I will be meeting a number of party leaders.  Tomorrow I will meet with members of parliament. I will then  leave Sanaa to continue my contacts elsewhere.    Perhaps at 1500 [1200 GMT] you heard a news item from Sanaa  radio to the effect that the Government of the Republic of Yemen  has decided to implement a cease-fire as of 1800 [1500 GMT]  today. We greatly hope that this time the cease-fire will hold.  Moreover, the brothers in the Yemeni Republic affirm that they  are prepared to enter into a dialogue with the other side but on  principles which they believe are essentials for such a  dialogue. I believe that this is an encouraging beginning. We  hope that little by little, this country will be extricated from  its current affliction. [end recording]    Our correspondent was careful to explore all aspects of  Brahimi's mission in Sanaa and directed the following questions  at him:    [Begin recording] [Birru] The Yemeni Government is prepared  to hold a dialogue with the other side. Does this mean that the  exception to the leaders of the secession has been waived?    [Brahimi] They say that they have certain principles. It is  not for me to list these principles because if we forget one of  them, we will have problems. You may ask the Yemeni brothers  and they will tell you what they are. Whether or not these  principles will be acceptable to the other side, we do not know.  However, I consider it to be a good step when I am told that  they are prepared for dialogue but with certain conditions.  Well, I say you are welcome, let us see these conditions and  consult with the other side.    [Birru] Will you meet with the leaders of the other side in  Aden, al-Mukalla, or in an Arab country?    [Brahimi] The important thing is to meet with the brothers  and talk to them. The venue is immaterial. This means we will  make the necessary arrangements for this to take place.    [Birru] The answers you received in Sanaa were positive and  encouraging?    [Brahimi] Undoubtedly.    [Birru] Will you return to Sanaa shortly?    [Brahimi] I think I will return to Sanaa but I do not know  when.    [Birru] Thank you. [end recording]    Brahimi did not reveal the place for which he will be  leaving  tomorrow to meet with the southern leaders. However, sources  close to him said that he will be leaving for the Jordanian  capital, Amman, where he will meet with southern Yemeni leaders,  among whom is believed to be 'Ali Salim al-Bid.</p>

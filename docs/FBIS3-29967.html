Sucharit said he had contacted Khammouane  Province Governor Inpong Sai-gnavong for clarification on this  issue.    The Thai-owned United Tour Company cited many  inconveniences,  including the collection of border passage fees by the Lao  authorities and the intended monopolization of the tourism  industry in the Lao province.    The governor of Nakhon Phanom Province said that the  provincial authority, together with the provincial Tourism  Office, are trying to solve the problem in such a way that  relations between the two countries will not be affected. Laos  is in the process of changing many policies, and new regulations  might be adopted.    Phairot Prokkaeo, director of Nakhon Phanom Province's  Tourism Office, said that this is the first complaint about  unfair treatment of Thai tour agencies by the Lao authorities.  His office is waiting for more information from the Lao side.  The solution to the problem might require joint efforts by the  governors of the two neighboring provinces. Considering the  nature of the problem, there could be some misunderstanding  between the United Tour Company and the Lao authorities.    A tourist industry source in Nakhon Phanom Province revealed  that two tour agencies -- namely Siphanom Tour and United Tour  Companies -- are operating in the province, while the governor  of Khammouane Province plans to set up a provincial tour agency  to be officially called the Khammouane Tourism Company. The two  Thai companies will be required to maintain regular contact with  the Lao company in sending tourists to Khammouane Province.</p>

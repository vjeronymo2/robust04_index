			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Boost to US growth prospects: Consumer prices flat although inflation fears stalk Wall Street Reports of a zero increase in consumer prices last month and a sharp fall in the trade deficit in December to Dollars 7.4bn added credibility yesterday to the Clinton administration's forecast of sustained non-inflationary growth. On Wall Street, however, this encouraging news was overshadowed by traders' negative reaction to a report on regional economic conditions by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The bank's index of manufactured goods' prices rose sharply, raising fears in an already jittery market that inflation would rise later this year, forcing the Fed to tighten monetary policy more aggressively. After a rally in early trading, the bond market went sharply into reverse. By late afternoon the long bond was down 1 1/4 points, pushing the yield above 6.5 per cent. Share prices also fell sharply in volatile trading. The consumer price index was flat last month and up by only 2.5 per cent in the year to January. Most analysts had predicted an increase of about 0.3 per cent. Inflation was held down by the decline in world oil prices, which caused a 0.8 per cent fall in US energy prices, and by changes in seasonal adjustments. In recent years, blips in consumer prices in the first four months were wrongly interpreted as a sign of increasing inflationary pressure. The 'core' consumer price index - which excludes the volatile components of food and energy - rose 0.1 per cent last month and by 2.9 per cent on an annual comparison. The merchandise trade deficit fell from Dollars 9.7bn in November to Dollars 7.4bn in December, the lowest shortfall in a year. However, the deficit for 1993 as a whole rose to Dollars 115.8bn, against Dollars 84.5bn in 1992. Analysts had forecast a deficit in December of about Dollars 10bn. The better than expected figures will probably result in an upward revision to economic growth in the fourth quarter to 6.0-6.5 per cent, against the 5.9 per cent initially reported. The trade improvement, however, may not be sustained. Exports were boosted in December by an erratic increase in aircraft sales and by the decline in oil prices, which held down imports. Mr David Rolley, senior economist at DRI-McGraw-Hill, the forecasting group, said import volumes were likely to grow twice as fast as exports this year, reflecting faster growth in the US than elsewhere. The trade deficit would probably rebound to Dollars 12bn-Dollars 13bn by mid-year and hit Dollars 15bn by the end of the year.</p>

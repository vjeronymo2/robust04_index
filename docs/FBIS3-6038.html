At a press meeting Wednesday [9 March], Finance Minister  Hirohisa Fujii described the economy as "mixed" in a "delicate  stage," backing off from his Sunday comment at an informal  speech that it is his personal view the economy has hit bottom.    On the same day, Bank of Japan governor Yasushi Mieno told  reporters, "If the economic trend is poised to change, it's  natural for long-term rates to rise but our assessment suggests  that a more careful watch is necessary."    Mieno reiterated that the economy remains mixed with a  further watch necessary over the "sustainability and  expansionary potential" of the recent upward signs.    With economic indicators increasingly showing improvements  over the past two months this year, the yield on the benchmark  government bond issue dropped more than 1 percentage point to  briefly top 4 percent for the first time since before the  central bank last cut its official discount rate to a record-low  1.75 percent.    Mieno advised against prematurely judging the improvements  shown in some consumption and production indicators, with bad  memories apparently fresh in the mind of economic policy makers.    At about the same time last year, financial authorities  declared that the economy was poised to recover, given some  clues in consumption and production. But against their  expectations, the economy slipped further on the yen's sharp  rise and the cold and wet summer.    With hopes dashed, overly pessimistic corporate and consumer  sentiments rose and still undermine the overall economy,  economists said.    This time, premature optimism poses a clear risk -- the  continued rise in long-term rates further undermining corporate  capital investment and putting a brake on housing spending, they  said.    The higher market rates resulted in a round of hikes in  long-term prime lending rates charged by banks to major  companies. In addition, rates on private housing loans linked  to the prime rates are certain to increase in April.    Mieno said higher long-term rates are "obviously negative"  for the economy but it is just one of many factors determining  business conditions.    Mieno said overestimated market reactions will be "digested  in the basic economic current" and an "immediate impact is  unlikely from the higher interest rates."    Fujii also said the bond market is overreacting and a  correction is inevitable.    The Finance Ministry has its own reasons to stop long-term  rates from rising since the latest rally in the bond market is  partly blamed on its oversupply of government bonds.    The ministry said it plans to issue a record 36.53 trillion  yen in government bonds in the coming fiscal year, up 6.61  trillion yen from its original plan in the initial fiscal 1993  budget.    That will break the record 29.92 trillion yen initially  planned for the current fiscal year ending March 31.    On top of the two straight years of record-breaking bond  supply, the ministry plans to increase placement in the private  sector in fiscal 1994 because of tight budgets in the private  sector led by its trust fund bureau.    Private-sector issuance is to rise 7.56 trillion yen from  this fiscal year's initial plan to 28.76 trillion yen but the  amount for the public sector will fall by 95 billion yen to 7.77  trillion yen.    A ministry financial bureau official told reporters in  announcing the bond plan in February that there was "no big  concern" over rising rates as the economy remained stagnant and  credit policy loose.    BOJ governor Mieno said increased bond issuance is one  reason  for higher long-term rates, although several other factors  existed, such as a correction from excessive hopes for lower  rates on the recent rally in stock prices.    Meanwhile, Mieno also made cautious comments in explaining  the economic mix to avoid giving an overly pessimistic  impression.    He stressed that the economy is in better shape than it was  a  year before, citing progressed inventory adjustments, expected  effects from the latest 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package and  the recent "state of remission" of the yen's rise.    Indeed, the latest developments seem to pose a double-edged  sword -- higher rates if taken positively and dampened sentiment  if taken negatively to stymie a recovery.</p>

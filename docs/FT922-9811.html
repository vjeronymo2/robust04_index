			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: A question of motive The market reaction to yesterday's cut in UK interest rates was notable for its scepticism. Though sterling held up fairly well, gilts dropped by more than half a point. The equity market, despite Monday's record close on Wall Street, was barely changed. Three-month money, far from moving to discount the next cut as usual, stayed slightly above the new rate of 10 per cent. Rather than accepting the cut in a spirit of gratitude, the markets are asking themselves what the government is worried about. The immediate suspect is economic recovery. Independent evidence suggests that retail sales may not after all be enjoying a post-election blip, even though spending in March was supposedly depressed by the election's approach. Sales at John Lewis, for instance, were down 4 per cent in the week to April 25 and unchanged over 13 weeks. But the pattern of consumer spending is still too murky to permit conclusions. Nor is it obvious why a newly re-elected government would bother to take risks on sterling and inflation merely to bring recovery forward a month or two. It may be that the pressure to cut rates comes more from the fragility of the UK financial system. If so, the market was wrong to mark down the stores sector yesterday. It should have concentrated instead on property and the banks. But the authorities might argue that the risk in cutting rates is not as great as it looks. The amount of spare productive capacity in the economy perhaps argues against inflationary pressure for a while yet. But in currency terms, the risk remains palpable. The market may not be quite sure what bothers it about yesterday's move. It may be right to be slightly bothered just the same.</p>

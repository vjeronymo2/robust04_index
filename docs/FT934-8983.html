			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Royal Doulton promises 3p dividend after demerger ROYAL Doulton, the fine china company, yesterday announced that it intended to pay a dividend of 3p to shareholders after its demerger from its parent, Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times. The group made the announcement in its listing particulars document, published after some initial difficulties late yesterday. The particulars stated that on a pro forma basis, Royal Doulton would have paid a notional full-year dividend of 6.6p. The document also warned shareholders not to expect a robust performance from Royal Doulton in 1993 as profits would be hit by redundancy costs and short-time working. Pearson will offer 54.9m Royal Doulton shares on a one-for-10 basis. A rough guide to the price at which Royal Doulton may start trading on December 2 can be found in a listings footnote. Pearson has agreed to buy from Royal Doulton shares at 244p, if necessary. This is likely to occur only if Pearson issues more of its own shares before then. On a pro forma basis, Royal Doulton has net debt of Pounds 39.5m. Gearing, normally high at this time, is 38 per cent. The particulars also state that Royal Doulton's first-half results - which show a deficit of Pounds 3.8m - include a Pounds 2m exceptional charge for losses on the sale of the Canadian Financial Post newspaper group to another Pearson company. Pearson last year transferred the Post into Royal Doulton Canada for tax reasons. The demerger got off to a shaky start yesterday as the stock exchange recalled early copies of the particulars. It is believed that the document contained errors over holdings in Royal Doulton which Lazard Investors and associated companies of Lazard Freres will have after the demerger. Lazard Brothers is sponsoring Royal Doulton's introduction to the official list. Pearson has a stake in the Lazard investment banking group. Some 25 to 30 incorrect copies of the document were collected from analysts who had attended a meeting. Meanwhile, Pearson said its third-quarter pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 61.7m to Pounds 100.6m. The shares rose by 16p on the news to 574p.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Invesco increases assets in UK Invesco has purchased the UK index-matching fund management business of the US based Bankers Trust which manages Pounds 1.2bn in assets. The move will increase Invesco's assets under management in the UK. The company has been losing institutional pension fund clients in recent years reflecting mediocre performance and adverse publicity about its role in handling pension scheme assets for the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Invesco, which has made numerous senior management changes over the past year, has said it wants to concentrate on building up its fund management capacity in Europe. Mr Norman Riddell, chief executive of Invesco's European operations, said 'This acquisition gives us access to market a product on the Continent.' While he does not see significant interest in passive management in the UK, Continental pension funds are much more likely to be interested because it is a lower cost, low-risk way of gaining access to the UK stock market. Invesco is paying up to Pounds 600,000, with up to Pounds 300,000 in further payments depending on assets under management. A number of clients are US pension funds who must agree to their fund manager having a change of ownership. BT has specialised in so-called passive management techniques in which funds are invested to mimic the performance of an index.</p>

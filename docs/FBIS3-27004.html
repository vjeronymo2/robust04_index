The necessity of adhering to the principle of grasping with  both hands in the course of socialist modernization is an  important part of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics.    In Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, there are many important expositions on "grasping  with both hands and grasping firmly with both hands." For  example: "We are building two civilizations. One is material  civilization and the other is spiritual civilization." ("Speak  With Facts"); "In the four modernizations, we must grasp with  both hands and it will not do to grasp with only one hand.  Grasping with both hands means grasping construction with one  hand and grasping the legal system with the other." ("Speech at  the Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of  the Central Committee"); "In a socialist country, a genuine  Marxist political party must, after becoming the ruling party,  devote itself to developing the productive forces, and on this  basis gradually improving the people's living standards. This is  the building of material civilization. For quite a long period  in the past, we overlooked the development of the productive  forces. Therefore, at present, we have to pay special attention  to the building of material civilization. At the same time, we  also have to build socialist spiritual civilization. The most  fundamental thing is to enable the broad masses of people to  have communist ideals, morals, and culture, and to observe  discipline." ("Build Socialist Material Civilization and  Spiritual Civilization"); "It is necessary to persist in  grasping with both hands. It is necessary to grasp reform and  opening up with one hand and to grasp cracking down on various  kinds of criminal activities with the other. Both hands should  grasp firmly." ("Gists of Remarks Made in Wuchang, Shenzhen,  Zhuhai, and Shanghai") These expositions on grasping material  civilization with one hand while grasping spiritual civilization  with the other, grasping economic construction with one hand  while grasping democracy and the legal system with the other,  grasping reform and opening up with one hand while grasping  cracking down on crimes with the other shine with the  ideological brilliance of dialectical materialism. All things  in the world are interrelated and interdependent. This is  particularly true of a series of major issues we meet with in  the course of socialist modernization. For example, persisting  in reform and opening must be closely combined with persisting  in cracking down on criminal activities. If we do not severely  punish criminals committing economic crimes and other criminal  offenses or do not strengthen the building of honest  administration, reform and opening up will be seriously  interfered with. On the other hand, if we do not carry out  reform and opening up, do not greatly increase the country's  comprehensive strength and raise the cultural level of society,  or do not improve the people's living standards, we cannot  thoroughly do away with various criminal activities or  corruption. Upholding grasping with both hands and grasping  firmly with both hands means upholding the doctrine that  everything has two aspects in the theory of knowledge in  dialectical materialism. In the process of modernization, we  must uphold the doctrine that everything has two aspects  advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Only in this way can we  handle various kinds of complicated issues and contradictions  dialectically and in an all-round manner and make fewer mistakes  or detours in our work.    The building of material civilization and the building of  spiritual civilization are mutually conditional and promote one  another. The building of material civilization is the  foundation of the building of spiritual civilization. We must  firmly grasp the center of economic construction and should not  let go our hold. "Not upholding socialism, not carrying out  reform and opening up, not developing the economy, and not  improving the people's standard of living can only be a blind  alley." ("Gists of Remarks Made in Wuchang, Shenzhen, Zhuhai,  and Shanghai") All comrades engaged in the building of  spiritual civilization should firmly establish the idea of  serving economic construction, reform, and opening up. Only by  correctly locating our position of serving economic  construction, reform, and opening up can we realize the value of  our work. In his important remarks made during his inspection  tour of the south, Comrade Deng Xiaoping scientifically put  forward the standard for assessing the correctness of the work  in economic construction, reform, and opening up: We "should  mainly see whether or not it is conducive to developing the  productive forces of the socialist society, whether or not it is  conducive to increasing the comprehensive national strength of  the socialist state, and whether or not it is conducive to  improving the people's living standards." Undoubtedly, this is  also the only correct standard for assessing the building of  socialist spiritual civilization.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always stressed that the building  of socialist material civilization and the building of spiritual  civilization should be grasped simultaneously and has attached  great importance to the special role played by socialist  spiritual civilization in modernization. As early as the  beginning of reform and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping  pointed out: "While building a high degree of material  civilization, we should raise the level of science and culture  of the entire nation, develop a noble, rich, and colorful  cultural life, and build a high degree of socialist spiritual  civilization." ("Congratulatory Speech at the Fourth Congress  of the Literature and Art workers of China") Comrade Xiaoping  also said: "The most fundamental thing in building socialist  spiritual civilization is to enable the broad masses of people  to have ideals, morals, and culture, and to observe discipline."  ("Build Socialist Materialist Civilization and Spiritual  Civilization") Grasping the building of material civilization  and spiritual civilization with both hands is a prominent  characteristic in the socialist modernization of our country.  Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "If the building of spiritual  civilization is not strengthened, the building of material  civilization will be damaged and we shall make detours. We  cannot succeed in our revolution or construction by depending on  material conditions alone." ("Speech at the CPC National  Congress")    The historical experience of reform and opening up in the  past 10 years and more have repeatedly proved that whenever we  adhere to the principle of "grasping with both hands and  grasping firmly with both hands" which Comrade Xiaoping has  always stressed, the cause of socialist modernization will  become more prosperous every day and will develop smoothly, and  whenever we deviate from this basic principle and whenever we  make the mistake of grasping firmly with one hand while relaxing  the grasp of the other, the cause of socialist modernization  will be interfered with and damaged. We must keep firmly in  mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's earnest instructions, learn from  past experience and lessons, and ensure the healthy and steady  development of the cause of socialist modernization.  <H6>  II. </H6>   Press and publication work is an important part of the  building of socialist spiritual civilization. Doing a good job  in press and publication work has an important bearing on  properly carrying out the building of the two civilizations.  The press and publication sector has the mass media in its  hands. In a modern society, it plays a specially important role  in spreading information, promoting the development of the  economy, science, and culture, forming public opinion, winning  people's support, and stabilizing the social and political  situation. Without powerful and efficient information-  spreading systems and without public opinion for guiding society  which is in line with the direction of development of  modernization, it is difficult to imagine the possibility of  attaining success in modernization. Comrade Xiaoping once said:  "Strengthening the party's leadership over the ideological front  and overcoming the weak and lax situation have become a pressing  task of the whole party. In addition to the theoretical and  literature and art circles, education, the press, publication,  radio, television, mass culture, mass ideological and political  work, and other sectors also have similar or other pressing  problems to solve. The work of the entire ideological front  needs to be strengthened. We should solemnly put this question  before the whole party and on the important agenda of the CPC  Central Committee and local CPC committees at all levels. After  the center of work has been shifted to economic construction,  the whole party should study how to adapt itself to the new  conditions, strengthen the party's ideological work, and guard  against the tendency of immersing ourselves in economic work and  ignoring ideological work." ("The Party's Pressing Tasks on the  Organizational Front and the Ideological Front") These  instructions of Comrade Xiaoping have great significance in  giving guidance. Press and publication work can only be  strengthened and should not be weakened. This has been proved  by the practice of many years. At present, there are across the  country more than 500 publishing houses, 200 audio-video  publishing houses, 2,000 newspapers, and 7,000 magazines. In  addition, there are more than 100,000 points and networks for  selling books and magazines and 4,000 printing houses with  regular customers. Since the press and publication industry is  developing so rapidly and its scale is so big, only by giving it  correct guidance and exercising efficient management will it be  possible for it to develop healthily and to provide a powerful  spiritual propelling force, intellectual support, a public  opinion environment, and an ideological guarantee for reform,  opening up, and economic construction. This is an important  issue which has a bearing on the success of modernization.  Comrade Xiaoping has put forward, precisely at this high  strategic level, the necessity of regarding the strengthening of  the work of the ideological front, including press and  publication, as a very pressing task of the whole party.  Comrades working on the press and publication front must  seriously understand the earnest hope of Comrade Xiaoping, work  hard, explore boldly, and go all out to fulfill their duties.  CPC committees and governments at all levels should also  strengthen at this high strategic level press and publication  work and the building of the press and publication organizations  and workers so that the party can really exercise leadership  over press and publication work.    In the course of the gradual establishment of the socialist  market economy structure, the core of strengthening the  management of press and publication lies in strengthening the  legal system and strictly carrying out management according to  law. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "It is especially necessary  to grasp legislation work firmly, including the legislation of  laws and regulations governing rallies, societies, parades,  demonstrations, the press, and publication." ("China Brooks No  Chaos") To speed up legislation on the press and publication is  the most urgent task in press and publication work at present.  We should seriously study new situations and new problems  emerging in the press and publication under the conditions of  the socialist market economy, extensively solicit the views of  various circles in society, and speed up the drafting of the  "Publication Law" and the "Journalism Law." At the same time,  we should also speed up the formulation of regulations and rules  concerning the press and publication and strive to raise the  level of the legal system for the management of the press and  publication. We should, through strengthening management  according to law, make due contributions to maintaining the  normal operation of the press and publication and to social  stability. Publications, published legally or illegally, which  are found to have serious political mistakes, to be harmful to  nationality solidarity, to violate foreign policies, to  propagate pornography, or to be vulgar, will often become  factors causing social instability and will interfere with the  overall situation of economic construction, reform, and opening  up. Regarding such publications, we should, on the one hand,  strive to take preventive measures, and, on the other hand, mete  out stern punishment according to law in order to put an end to  the recurrence of similar problems.    The press and publication is an important part of the  party's  ideological work and is also a rising industry of the national  economy system. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out that "development  is the last word [fa zhan cai shi ying dao li 4099 1455 2088  2508 4289 6670 3810]." Under the historical conditions of the  gradual establishment of the socialist market economy structure,  development and prosperity are also the last word of the press  and publication. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, the reform of the press and publication has  taken a very big step forward and its operation and management  level has risen greatly. Most publishing houses have changed  from being of a production type to being of a  production-management type. In the sales link, the requirements  of "one main body, three multiples, and one fewer" (the  state-owned Xinhua Bookstore as the main body; multiple  channels, multiple economic compositions, and multiple  purchasing and marketing forms; and fewer circulation links) and  "one delegate, two removes, and one cooperation" (delegate power  to invigorate state-owned bookstores; remove restrictions on  wholesale channels to invigorate the book and magazine market  and remove restrictions on purchasing and marketing forms and  sales discounts to invigorate the purchasing and marketing  mechanism; and strive to develop lateral cooperation) are  gradually being satisfied. In the course of technical  transformation, more and more book, newspaper, and magazine  publishing enterprises are using the technology of "laser  photo-typing, electronic scanning, offset printing, and  automatic binding." The era of "lead and fire" has basically  ended in the printing of newspapers of party committees at the  prefectural and city levels and above. All this has been  brought about by reform and opening up and is the result of  great efforts made by the party and the government in developing  the press and publication. At a time when reform and opening up  have entered a new stage of historical development, there is  still much work to do to deepen reform and speed up development.  For example, further efforts are needed in the reform of the  operation and management structure of publishing houses,  newspapers, and magazines; further efforts are needed in the  implementation of the director responsibility system in  publishing houses; further efforts are needed to study how to  establish and improve the book and magazine management structure  and the mechanism to guarantee the quality of books and  magazines; and great efforts are also needed to resolve the  question of what channels and methods should be used to enable  state-owned book and magazine distributing enterprises to play  their guiding role among wholesalers of books and magazines and  to enable retailers of various economic compositions to display  their skills. It is necessary, through deepening reform, to  establish a new publication structure which is in keeping with  the socialist market economy structure, which can meet the needs  of the building of socialist spiritual civilization, and which  reflects the laws of development of the publication industry  itself; and it is necessary, through deepening reform, to  establish a good operation mechanism and an effective management  structure. In the course of the historical process of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, the press and  publication sector should have greater and faster development  and should make even greater contributions to the revitalization  of the Chinese nation.    Under the conditions of the socialist market economy, the  press and publication will, for a long time to come, face the  question of how to properly handle the relationship between  social benefits and economic results. That the press and  publication organizations have attached importance to operation  and management and to economic results is in fact a gratifying  change brought about by reform and opening up in the past 10  years and more. The reason is very simple. When the press and  publication organizations have universally assumed sole  responsibility for their own profits and losses, it will be  difficult to ensure social benefits without attaching importance  to economic results. However, the problem is that at present,  "money worship" and "putting money before anything else" are  having a serious erosive influence on press and publication  workers and the phenomena of "paid news reports," "selling book  title registrations," and so on have seriously affected the  healthy development of the press and publication sector.  Comrade Xiaoping once pointed out sharply: "The tendency of  `putting money before anything else' and commercializing  spiritual products has also appeared in other aspects of  spiritual production. Some people who unworthily occupy places  in literature and art circles, publication circles, and cultural  circles have simply become merchants who are bent solely on  profit." ("The Party's Pressing Tasks on the Organizational  Front and the Ideological Front") Through summing up the  experience and lessons of the press and publication work in past  years, it is not difficult to see that many problems in the  press and publication sector are of course caused by ideological  understanding, but more of them are caused by the desire to reap  great profits and by the "worship of money." Therefore, we must  persist in putting social benefits in the most important  position and, with this as the prerequisite, unify economic  results with social benefits. At the same time, it is necessary  to adopt measures related to structure and rules to eradicate  the influence of "money worship" and to ensure the healthy  development of the press and publication.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping's expositions on persisting in  "grasping with both hands" and grasping firmly with both hands  are guidance for press and publication work. So long as we  seriously grasp their essence and use them to guide practical  work and so long as we adhere to the correct orientation, carry  out management according to law, deepen reform, and promote  prosperity, the press and publication sector will certainly  develop further.</p>

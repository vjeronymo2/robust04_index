			<p>BFN     [Text] While carrying out investigations and studies in  Guilin Prefecture, regional party Secretary Zhao Fulin pointed  out: Proceeding from the practical conditions in our region, we  must treat the efforts to increase grain output and make money  to ensure a good crop and the wealth of our people as a guiding  principle for agricultural development. Meanwhile, it is  necessary for us to take practical measures to conscientiously  work for increasing grain output in a steady way, and for  continuously enhancing peasants' incomes to maintain a  sustained, comprehensive and coordinated rural economic  development.    On 15-19 May, Zhao Fulin successively conducted  investigations and studies in Guanyang, Pingle, Yongfu, and  Lingchuan Counties of Guilin Prefecture. He went to the fields,  visited peasant households, forest farms and orchards, and went  deep into large specialized households in farming and breeding  and township and town enterprises to find out about the  situation of agricultural production and township and town  enterprises. Guilin Prefecture has been increasing its grain  output for years running. Last year, on the basis of greatly  adjusting its farm production structure, per capita consumption  of grain by peasants in the prefecture was 446 kg. Its  diversified economy and township and town enterprises have been  developing considerably. Zhao Fulin affirmed the achievements  of Guilin Prefecture. Wherever he went, he discussed with  county, township, town, and village cadres and the masses the  way to correctly handle relations between increasing grain  output in a stable way, developing diversified economy, and  expanding township and town enterprises, as well as measures for  speeding up development.    Zhao Fulin pointed out: Handling well the above-mentioned  relations is an inherent need of the development of agriculture,  and the correct path for promoting a benign agricultural cycle  and sustained, comprehensive and coordinated development of our  rural economy. It is also needed by our efforts to guide  peasants to become rich and advance toward small-scale  prosperity, and to preserve social stability. With regard to  the way to increase grain output and make more money to ensure a  good crop and people's prosperity, Zhao Fulin stressed that the  following work must be done effectively:    We must first enhance and unify our ideological  understanding. Zhao Fulin stressed: Only by developing grain  production can we stabilize the livelihood of our urban and  rural residents. Only thus can rural areas develop forestry and  fruit undertakings, animal husbandry, aquatic production, and  other undertakings which rely on meat and grain. In the  meantime, only by developing diversified economy and township  and town enterprises can we increase peasants' incomes and  gradually improve their living standard and quality. Only thus  can we arouse peasants' enthusiasm in farming and producing  grain.    Zhao Fulin continued: Judging from our region's conditions  for agricultural production, it is a unified matter to increase  grain output and develop diversified economy, because they help  each other. Therefore, grasping a stable increase in grain  output will not affect the development of diversified economy.  It is not necessary to base the development of diversified  economy on a reduction in the acreage under grain or in grain  output. Increasing grain output does not conflict with making  money. Leading cadres at all levels must unify them well in  both understanding and practice. While grasping the stable  growth of grain output, they must also vigorously develop  diversified economy to achieve comprehensive agricultural  development, and ensure that we reap a good crop and that our  people are wealthy. It is necessary for us to take practical  and effective measures to ensure a stable increase in our grain  output.    Zhao Fulin added: Agriculture is the foundation of our  national economy, while grain is the core of this foundation.  We must never waver in this basic idea at any time or under any  circumstances. To ensure a stable growth in our grain output,  an important thing for us to do is that we must conscientiously  implement the policies of the central authorities, and the  preferential policies for grain production in particular. We  must establish and perfect our grain storage system, and pursue  a grain purchase protective price. Even in a bumper harvest  year, we must not delay in purchasing grain, and never issue  IOU's. We must ensure that peasants are not adversely affected  by great increases in grain output so as to arouse and protect  their enthusiasm in producing grain. In the meantime, we must  rely on science and technology to increase yield per unit area,  and multiple cropping to raise the total output of grain. It is  necessary to vigorously develop diversified economy and township  and town enterprises to further boost peasants' incomes.    Zhao Fulin emphasized: Under the prerequisite of steadily  increasing grain output, we must persist in sticking to the  principle which is beneficial to giving play to our strong  points, conforming to market demand, and attaching importance to  efficiency to greatly develop diversified economy. Various  localities must suit measures to local conditions to greatly  adjust rural production setups, develop their strong points and  avoid their weaknesses, and make use of their own favorable  conditions. Marketability and efficiency determine what they  plant, breed, exploit, process, and develop.    Zhao Fulin pointed out: In light of the practical  conditions in our region, we can mainly develop our diversified  economy in the following ways:    1. Making use of hills and waters. This means we can develop  forestry, orchards, and breeding undertakings on hills and  mountains, and the aquatic products industry in waters. To  become rich, we must plant more trees. In the future, our  region must not only increase the acreage under fruit trees, but  also attach importance to transforming low-yield orchards. In  particular, we must pay attention to developing famous, special,  excellent and rare fruits to enhance our economic efficiency.  There are vast grasslands in our region, and we have huge  markets because of being close to Guangdong, Hainan, Hong Kong  and Macao. We have good conditions for developing animal  husbandry. We can raise large quantities of pigs, cows,  chickens, ducks, milch cows and so on. We must stabilize the  acreage under sugar cane. Some localities must make use of dry  land to expand the acreage under sugar cane to meet the pressing  capacity of the existing sugar refineries. There are pools,  reservoirs and fish ponds in our region, and the area for  fresh-water fishery has reached nearly 2 million mu. A  considerable part of this fresh-water fishery area has not yet  been utilized. It is necessary for us to develop fresh-water  fishery. In the meantime, we must fully utilize the sea in our  region to speed up the pace of developing our sea fishery. We  must work hard for several years to ensure that total output  value of aquatic products in the coastal counties and cities  will exceed or be equal to the output value of their planting  and breeding undertaking on land. It is necessary for us to  create several additional cities and counties relying on sea  resources.    2. Making use of winter agriculture: Our region has a  temperate winter climate. It is beneficial to making use of  winter idle farmland to develop the winter farming and breeding  undertaking. In the future, the areas of winter agriculture  must be increased year by year. We must strive to eliminate  winter idle farmland in two or three years.    3. Making use of city suburbs. Rural areas in city suburbs  must be developed around the needs of cities, and grasp well  vegetable basket projects by developing vegetables, pig-raising,  fishery, chickens, ducks, eggs, milk, and so on. This will not  only ensure sufficient market supplies in cities, but also  increase the income of peasants in city suburbs.    4. Making use of science and technology. We must devote our  main efforts to producing high-quality vegetables, fine-breed  pigs, precious fish, and rare birds and animals to significantly  increase the economic efficiency of our farming and breeding  undertaking.    Zhao Fulin stressed: It is necessary for us to vigorously  develop township and town enterprises. Due to the fact that our  region was late in starting its township and town enterprises,  we must now attach importance to developing undertakings related  to resources. We must stick to the principle of the  simultaneous movement of wheels, and multitrack advance. While  attaching importance to developing rural collective economy, we  must also pay attention to the development of individual and  private economy. We must deepen rural reform to promote  simultaneous development of grain and diversified economy with  emphasis on promoting the shareholding system and the  shareholding cooperative system. We must exercise land use  rights in a flexible manner. Through the rural shareholding  system, we must speed up and optimize the composition of the  elements of production, including land, work force, funds and  technology. We must speed up rural water conservancy works  projects, and improve conditions for agricultural production.  This will provide a guarantee for the stable growth of grain  and the development of diversified economy. On the basis of  improving the contract responsibility system on a household  basis with remuneration linked to output, we must exercise land  use rights in a flexible manner. We must mainly allow peasants  to use land as their share in joining rural shareholding  cooperative economic organizations. In some localities, land  transfer with compensation such as leasing should be allowed.  With regard to barren hills, hillside fields, waters, and sand,  other forms of transfer should also be allowed.    Zhao Fulin continued: Through promoting the shareholding  system and the shareholding cooperative system, we must  establish and improve our service system and speed up our  comprehensive agricultural development. In the meantime, we  must gradually realize specialization in our agricultural  production, unification in operation, the combination of  industry and agriculture, large- scale operation, and mutual  supplementation of the strong points of grain and diversified  economy aimed at common development.</p>

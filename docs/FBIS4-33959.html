			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Antonio Roman and Candelaria Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas State, 8 Jun -- The State  Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations (CEOIC) has stated  that in agricultural matters, the various levels of government  have not kept to the agreements, their proposals are incomplete  and they seek to deprive jurisdiction, and the truth is that  "they do not intend to definitely resolve the Chiapas land  problem."    CEOIC, which represents 280 organizations, today warned in a  communique that "events continue moving toward a confrontation."  The organizations demand a "break of the military blockade"  surrounding the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN),  respect for human rights in Chiapas, and a clear development and  financing policy for Chiapas land.    Upon releasing the CEOIC communique, Arturo Luna Lujan,  organization secretary for the Independent Agricultural and  Peasant Workers Central Organization [Central independiente de  Obreros Agricolas y Campesinos -- CIOAC] said that due to  noncompliance by the federal and state governments, the peasant  associations will start a permanent sit-down strike opposite the  Tuxtla Gutierrez government palace.    One must remember that on 14 April, during one of the most  critical moments of the land takeover, the CEOIC and several  federal and state government entities, signed a truce agreement  regarding the agrarian situation in Chiapas. In this truce  agreement, peasant organizations that comprise CEOIC pledged to  suspend the occupation of properties and land, while government  authorities pledged to resolve the state's agrarian problem.    Among the main agrarian problems afflicting Chiapas are an  enormous land tenancy, much agrarian backwardness, multiple  presidential resolutions that have not been carried out, and  hundreds of unfulfilled land requests.    Currently, despite the fact the exact area is not known, it  is reported that about 50,000 hectares have been taken by Indian  and peasant organizations in several places in the state, and a  further 40,000 hectares within the conflict area, mainly in  Ocosingo, Altamirano, and Las Margaritas Municipalities -- the  latter being where the EZLN is located.    At the same time the CEOIC and government were signing the  agreement on 14 April, negotiations were also begun with other  government entities at the federal level, such as with the  Social Development and Government Secretariats, with which a  series of measures and meetings were agreed upon to deal with  the various demands presented by the groups that comprise CEOIC.    "Despite these agreements, the replies have been  noncompliance, proposals have been incomplete and seek to  deprive jurisdiction, and a there is a lack of desire to resolve  once and for all the Chiapas land problem," the brief CEOIC text  states. It regrets that despite all its efforts to reach true  peace, with justice, democracy, and social development, events  advance toward confrontation.    That is why to solve their demands, the CEOIC demands the  presence and commitment of Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno;  Secretaries Victor Cervera Pacheco, Carlos Rojas, and Carlos  Hank Gonzalez, for Agrarian Reform, Social Development, and  Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources, respectively; Jorge Madrazo  Cuellar, president of the National Human Rights Commission;  Humberto Benitez Trevino, Attorney General of the Republic; and  Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation  in Chiapas State.    Peasant leader Arturo Luna Lujan said that CEOIC members  watch the weeks go by without receiving a definite reply from  the authorities because until now all they have received have  been written proposals. This situation has generated a climate  of uncertainty and desperation, therefore the council peasants  have decided to resort to a permanent sit-down strike as a way  to exert pressure on the federal and local governments to give a  positive reply to these demands.    When referring to the number of strikers, Luna Lujan said  there will be between 2,000-5,000 peasants and Indians, but the  numbers could increase gradually as the days pass without true  solutions.    We are asked not to takeover land, not to hinder the peace  and reconciliation process, but the authorities "do not make the  slightest effort to keep their word or to contribute to the  creation of a climate of stability that leads to a favorable  situation for signing the peace agreements," he concluded.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Caracas fund to buy poor quality loans from banks The Venezuelan government plans a fund to buy poor quality loans from ailing banks as part its effort to restore the financial sector to health, according to Mr Enzo del Bufalo, head of the economic planning office (Cordiplan). Six private banks are believed to be dependent on government financial assistance following heavy withdrawals in the wake of the collapse in January of Banco Latino, the country's second largest bank. Mr del Bufalo stressed that the proposed fund, apart from helping to stabilise the banking system, is also expected to play a role in easing pressure on the country's international monetary reserves and reducing inflation. The fund will buy bad loans from selected banks in order to improve their financial performance. In return, the government will demand they reduce purchases of US dollars for their own accounts, thus taking pressure off Venezuela's international reserves. The country's monetary reserves fell by Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.15bn) during the first quarter of this year, compared with a decline of Dollars 519m during all of 1993. However, the pace of reserve loss slowed considerably in March of this year, and the government still has reserves of around Dollars 10.9bn, equivalent to over a year of imports. The government also expects borrowers whose bank loans are taken over by the fund to renegotiate payment terms. In return for more favourable arrangements, the government will ask beneficiary companies to keep price rises for their products below a 2.5 per cent monthly target. Banco Latino, closed since January 13, has been re-capitalised by the government and re-opened under full government control on Monday. It has resumed most normal financial activities. Mr del Bufalo also said the government would urge direct talks between business owners and employees aimed at replacing the existing system of worker severance benefits with pension funds. Under current Venezuelan legislation, employers are required to set aside one or two months pay for each year of employee service, and to pay market interest rates on this sum.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Questions on Europe: 'Tighter rules on lobbying needed' David Bennett, 45, is managing director of the London-based public affairs company Beaumark, specialising in EU affairs. A former employee of the European Commission and British Gas, he stood unsuccessfully for the Liberal Social Democratic Alliance in the 1983 and 1987 UK elections and for the European parliament in 1984. The amount of influence over MEPs by industry lobbyists has attracted concern. What changes are needed covering contacts between lobbyists and MEPs or MEPs' staff? The rules on conduct of EU officials, MEPs and their staff in relation to transfer of Commission documents and information need to be tightened. Until the parliament agrees a method for the full declaration of MEPs' outside business and consultancy interests, it will be difficult to establish effective codes of practice for external lobbyists. Can British MEPs set a lead in trying to bring about greater transparency? The Westminster model of disclosure sets an appropriate standard for MEPs to follow. British MEPs could take the initiative by introducing full disclosure of their outside interests. This would reassure the British electorate that they operate in a comparable way to their Westminster counterparts. It might spur MEPs from other countries to follow suit. How many lobbyists do you consider are active in Brussels and Strasbourg in building relations with members of the European parliament? The best estimate is 140 public affairs consultancies, 160 law firms, 572 trade associations and professional associations and 58 regional and local authorities. The Commission estimates that there are 3,000 interest groups with links to EU institutions, employing 10,000 people. What are the prospects for a code of practice? Twenty leading public affairs companies, including Beaumark, are discussing a draft code of practice with the Commission. How rewarding is this business for European lobbyists? Typical annual turnover of companies active in the EU public affairs field is Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 700,000. The leading company claims turnover of more than Pounds 1m. Beaumark's this year will be Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 400,000. Are you concerned that some lobbyists may gain access to information under false pretences, for instance, by posing as journalists? Yes. There should be clear separation between journalists covering the parliament and lobbyists. Where there are doubts, the status of the 'journalist' concerned should be reviewed.</p>

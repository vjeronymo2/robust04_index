			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Ambulance software was a first, company admits SYSTEMS Options, the small, Hampshire-based company that developed the London Ambulance Service's troubled computerised dispatch system, had not written large command and control software before the LAS contract, its managing director admitted yesterday. It has developed fire service department software for several counties, including Hampshire, Staffordshire and Cleveland. The software, costing about Pounds 2,000 a module, manages personnel records and the location of water hydrants. One of its biggest contracts was for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. Command and control (C2) software lies at the heart of any computerised dispatch system and is the key to its speed and efficiency. A number of UK software houses have built C2 systems for the police or military customers and all agree that they are complex and difficult to develop. Mr James Pedroza, managing director and co-founder of Systems Options, said there was no alternative to developing C2 software from scratch for the LAS. 'Nobody has ever tackled a system that large before,' he said. 'The reason we were able to do it was our experience in geographical information systems (software which enables, for example, vehicles to be located on a computerised map) and in connecting personal computers to mainframe computers.' The LAS deals with an average of 2,300 calls a day, compared with a few hundred for ambulance services elsewhere in the country. Mr Pedroza, 45, started Systems Options in 1984 with a number of colleagues after they left Wootton Jeffries - a well-regarded UK computing services company now no longer in existence - where he was in control of software development. Before that, he taught mathematics at a South American university. Systems Options remains virtually unknown to the rest of the computing establishment. Mr Pedroza said it was a technologically oriented company chiefly interested in developing systems for local government. It has no sales force and obtains sales leads principally through personal recommendations.</p>

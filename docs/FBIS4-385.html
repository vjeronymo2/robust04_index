			<p>BFN     [Text] Rwanda -- Jean Kambanda, the head of the provisional  government said that the famous Presidential Guard -- accused of  being responsible for the violence in Kigali in the past few  days -- cannot be blamed for everything:    [Begin Kambanda recording] I cannot say that the  Presidential  Guard has control of the capital. The Presidential Guard cannot  be singled out. I have the impression that the Presidential  Guard has been considered to be different from the rest of the  Army. What I can say is that, all in all, our soldiers remained  quite calm and behaved well. Here and there -- among the  soldiers of the Presidential Guard and others -- there have been  some undisciplined troops. Because of some undisciplined  troops, we cannot say that the Rwandan Army took an active part  in the massacres. [end recording]</p>

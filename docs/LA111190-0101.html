			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPOTLIGHT / FACTS, FIGURES AND COMMENTS FROM SATURDAY'S GAMES;  </P> <P> NOTEWORTHY  </P> <P> Ty Detmer moved past Jim McMahon as Brigham Young's career passing leader with  9,670 yards, the fifth-highest total in Division I history.  </P> <P> J.D. Carlson of No. 19 Michigan tied a school record with five field goals in a  22-17 victory over No. 17 Illinois. Carlson kicked field goals of 28, 51, 19,  18 and 18 yards to tie the record set by Mike Gillette in a 22-7 victory over  Minnesota Nov. 5, 1988.  </P> <P> Houston's 45-25 loss to Texas means that, for the first time since 1936, no  major college team will go through the regular season unbeaten and untied.  </P> <P> Joe Segreti scored three touchdowns to tie Gordie Lockbaum's Holy Cross record  of 44 in a 48-0 victory over Fordham. Lockbaum set the record from 1983 to  1987.  </P> <P> Jeff Shudak kicked a school-record five field goals, including a 36-yarder with  14 seconds left to give Iowa State a 27-25 victory over Missouri. Shudak also  kicked field goals of 33, 26, 51 and 41 yards to break the school record of  four that he shared with three others.  </P> <P> Tennessee's Andy Kelly completed 35 of 60 passes -- both school records -- and  Carl Pickens caught a school-record 13 passes for 163 yards in the Volunteers'  34-29 loss to Notre Dame.  </P> <P> Darian Hagan's four touchdown passes in Colorado's 41-22 victory over Oklahoma  were a school record. With the victory, Colorado became the first team other  than Oklahoma and Nebraska to win consecutive Big Eight championships.  </P> <P> California's 28-3 victory over Oregon assured the Golden Bears of their first  winning season since 1982. Oregon quarterback Bill Musgrave was knocked out of  the game in the second quarter after suffering a collarbone injury. X-rays were  negative.  </P> <P> BIG PLAYS  </P> <P> Brad Daluiso kicked a 43-yard field goal with 10 seconds left to give UCLA a  25-22 victory over No. 2 and Rose Bowl-bound Washington.  </P> <P> Greg Frey hit Bobby Olive with a three-yard touchdown pass with one second to  play, giving Ohio State a 27-26 victory over No. 6 Iowa.  </P> <P> Scott Sisson's 38-yard field goal into the wind with eight seconds remaining  gave No. 7 Georgia Tech a 6-3 victory over Virginia Tech.  </P> <P> Anthony Harris caught a 10-yard touchdown pass from Brett Favre with 46 seconds  left to give Southern Mississippi a 13-12 victory over No. 15 Auburn.  </P> <P> Steve Ballard's 12-yard touchdown reception from Deron Smith with 22 seconds  left gave Tulane a 26-24 victory over Syracuse.  </P> <P> </P> <P> IN QUOTES  </P> <P> Cincinnati Coach Tim Murphy, after his team lost to Florida State, 70-21: "We  had our best day offensively since I've been here."  </P> <P>  Louisville's John Gainey, whose interception preserved a 17-10 victory over  Boston College: "We got into a huddle and said, 'No Hail Mary passes.' I was  going to either knock it down or take it. I took it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> STREAKS  </P> <P> Brigham Young's Ty Detmer, who passed for 484 yards against Wyoming, has 21  consecutive games of at least 300 passing yards. . . . Virginia's Herman Moore,  playing despite two sprained big toes in a 24-10 victory over North Carolina,  caught a touchdown pass for the ninth consecutive game, an NCAA record. He tied  another record by catching a scoring pass in his 10th consecutive  regular-season game.  </P> <P> Illinois has lost five games in a row to Michigan and hasn't won at Ann Arbor  since 1966. . . . Georgia Tech extended its home-field winning streak to 12  games. The Yellow Jackets are unbeaten in their last 13. . . . Penn State won  its seventh game in a row, 24-10 over Maryland. The Terrapins have lost 32 of  34 games to the Nittany Lions and have lost 20 in a row at Beaver Stadium. . .  . Wisconsin tied a school record with its 11th consecutive Big Ten loss, 20-7  to Indiana.  </P> <P> Arkansas' 0-6 conference record is their worst since 1942. . . . Vanderbilt's  28-21 loss to Kentucky was the Commodores' 22nd consecutive Southeastern  Conference loss on the road. . . . Nebraska's 41-9 victory over Kansas was the  Cornhuskers' 22nd in a row over the Jayhawks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DEFENSE  </P> <P> Rod Smith's interception on the goal line with 46 seconds left ensured No. 1  Notre Dame's 34-29 victory over No. 9 Tennessee.  </P> <P> Florida's defense, ranked first in the Southeastern Conference and second  nationally, forced three turnovers in a 38-7 victory over Georgia. Tim Paulk's  fumble recovery set up one touchdown, Paulk's 36-yard interception return for a  touchdown gave the Gators a 14-0 lead 31 seconds later, and Richard Fain's  interception led to another touchdown for a 24-7 halftime lead.  </P> <P> North Carolina State sacked Duke quarterbacks seven times and intercepted five  passes in a 16-0 victory. Duke scored 57 points last week against Wake Forest.  </P> <P> Alabama's defense held Louisiana State to a field goal and has gone four  consecutive games without giving up a touchdown.  </P> <P> After falling behind, 27-0, in the third quarter, Utah stymied New Mexico,  intercepting three passes and recovering two fumbles on the way to a 29-27  victory.  </P> <P> Texas Tech intercepted five passes, and Ronald Ferguson returned one 75 yards  for a touchdown, in a 40-28 victory over Texas Christian.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FIGHTING WORDS  </P> <P> The Iowa State-Missouri and Temple-Pittsburgh games were both interrupted by  brawls. One fight started after Iowa State's Shawn Walker intercepted a pass  late in the third quarter. Missouri players ran across the field to join in  action. One player from each team was ejected -- Iowa State's Malcolm Goodwin  and Missouri's David Frisch. At Pittsburgh, Temple was apparently inspired by a  fight in the first quarter. With Pitt leading, 6-0, the game was halted by a  10-minute fight along the Temple sidelines after the Owls' Tony Schmitz  intercepted a pass. Several Temple staff members, including Coach Jerry Berndt,  suffered bumps and bruises. Temple defensive lineman Alfonso Taylor was  ejected.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOMEONE HAD TO WIN  </P> <P> They didn't do much of anything right at Cheney, Pa., in game between Morgan  State and Cheney. Playing in rain on a sloppy field, the teams combined for 20  fumbles; Morgan State lost all four of its fumbles and Cheney lost half of its  16. Fittingly, Morgan State won, 2-0, on James Dozier's block of Mark Williams'  punt in the fourth quarter. No one recovered the ball, Morgan State getting the  safety when it went out of the end zone. The loss was Cheney's 14th in a row.  Morgan State is 1-10.  </P></p>

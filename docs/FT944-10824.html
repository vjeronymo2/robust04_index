			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Company fined over missing trade statistics Intrastat, the system for collecting trade statistics among European Union countries, has acquired teeth. This week magistrates in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, fined Dams International, a furniture dealer based in Liverpool, a total of Pounds 11,550, including Pounds 300 costs, after it pleaded guilty to failing to supply Customs and Excise with information on goods acquired from and supplied to EU countries. Dams, which has annual turnover of about Pounds 12m and exports of Pounds 1.5m to the EU, is the first UK company to be prosecuted for failing to supply statistics under the system introduced in January last year to provide trade figures in the European single market. It is one of 31,000 businesses registered for value added tax with annual EU trade of more than Pounds 140,000 that are required to supply data on so-called supplementary declarations. These forms, which must be sent to Customs within 10 working days of the end of the month, oblige companies to fill in nine boxes on each type of goods traded. They provide 97.5 per cent of the statistics for Intrastat. The remaining 2.5 per cent are drawn from smaller VAT-registered businesses which have to complete two boxes on their VAT returns showing the value of goods supplied to and acquired from EU countries. According to Customs and Excise this is the only contribution that 150,000 companies make to the compilation of national statistics. Customs and Excise is generally satisfied with the level of compliance of UK companies. Fewer than 200 cases of non-compliant traders are under consideration. But this case is a sign that the agency is prepared to take recalcitrants to court when all other means of persuasion have failed. Customs acted after Dams failed to supply monthly details from January 1993. The officials made a compliance visit in July last year, sent a warning letter in November and another warning letter by recorded delivery in January. In March a prosecuting officer interviewed company officials under caution. Customs and Excise offered the company a 'compound penalty' of Pounds 3,450. This is an administrative fine, offered to all first offenders in lieu of court proceedings, and has been used to settle with about 10 offending companies. Dams paid the penalty, started to produce monthly returns for Intrastat, but failed to produce 16 missing monthly returns. Customs decided to prosecute as a last resort. After Dams produced one of the missing declarations the company was charged with 15 offences of failing to provide the information. It pleaded guilty to Southend magistrates on Monday and was fined Pounds 750 per offence, compared with maximum possible fine of Pounds 2,500. Mr Paul Nelson, Dams' company secretary, said problems with the computer system caused the failure to comply with the Intrastat rules. He was having to work through 2,000 invoices a month to complete the forms and the job was too time-consuming. The case has puzzled Customs officers, however. Officials say the Intrastat system is less burdensome than the declarations that were previously required. The net annual saving to UK businesses of the new system has been estimated at Pounds 135m. The high level of compliance has increased official confidence that the figures give an accurate picture of Britain's trade with the EU.</p>

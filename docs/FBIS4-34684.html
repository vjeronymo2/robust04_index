			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Tungurahua Governor Santiago Barrilla reports that  the situation in his province has started to improve and that  the government's emergency decree has been very positive.    [Begin Barrilla recording] The emergency decree has been  very  positive to balance the economic, social, and cultural  activities, especially in (?Apat) City. We are also normalizing  activities related to the supply of agriculture products. In all  the cantons, with the exception of Figaro and Cevallos, the  situation has normalized. The reports from Figaro indicate that  it is no longer a peasant protest but that political agitators  have taken over. We have been told that the Figaro and Cevallos  municipal council presidents are the ones inciting against the  government. The agriculture sectors are not protesting. In  Salasaca, between Pelileo and Ambato, there are still groups  that resist and do not allow vehicles to pass. [end recording]</p>

Now too  they are capable of resolving their problems. BAKHTAR's  political commentator writes:    The experience of the past 19 months in Afghanistan reveals  that the mediation efforts of Afghanistan's neighbor  extinguished the fire of war for a limited period. A few days  later the fire of war has been rekindled and is destroying the  people. To cut the roots of fighting for good and to create a  reliable calm in the country, it is necessary for the mojahedin  to come together and resolve their problems.    Despite the fact that the Islamic State of Afghanistan  respects the efforts of all peace seekers and well-wishers and  follows their proposals to the best of its abilities, this time  it wants a cease-fire to take effect with the party of Golboddin  Hekmatyar through an understanding inside the country. But the  jihadi parties should not support the atheist and infamous  militia, nor should they provide grounds for their further  existance. The Jalalabad agreement and the Mecca Convention  resolved the problem of Afghanistan in a shallow and temporary  way -- the roots of fighting and the problems stayed and so we  saw a resumption of the fighting. The important point is that  the other side accepts negotiations only after suffering defeat  militarily. Now the putschist coup d'etat has failed and  Dostam's militia have lost their positions and fortifications.  The supremacy of the state has been established following the  downing of eight aircraft by the air force of the Islamic State  of Afghanistan and the destruction of six aircraft on the ground.    Outside the country, too, the Babrak-Dostam-Golboddin  triangle's political effforts have failed. This anomalous and  unnatural coalition created such an atmosphere for themselves,  both militarily and internationally, that they should be  considered as having no specific identity or policy. Even  international observers have been faced with uncertainty about  the real identity of this triangle -- the public alliance of the  Muslim extremist Golboddin with very infamous communists.    From the outset the Islamic State of Afghanistan has stated  its policy in this battle: a cease-fire with the mojahedin of  Hezb-e Eslami and continuation of the jihad until the  elimination of Dostam's militia. And no one is as well  qualified as the Afghans themselves to draft the details of a  cease-fire and its implementation.</p>

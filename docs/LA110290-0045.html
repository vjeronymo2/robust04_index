			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A CLASH OF STYLES;  </P> <P> WESTLAKE TO SHOW OFF ITS SHOWTIME OFFENSE; THOUSAND OAKS COUNTERS WITH ITS  BRUTISH BRAND  </P> <P> Two teams with styles as different as the lambada and the waltz will step out  at 7:30 tonight at Thousand Oaks High in a football game for the Marmonte  League lead.  </P> <P> Westlake, the area's top-ranked team, is sleek, cerebral and sassy. A creative  young coach and a wealth of skill-position players have made the Warriors the  nouveau riche of football in the Conejo Valley, headed for the playoffs for the  second year in a row after last qualifying in 1982.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks, the No. 1 team in last season's final Times Valley poll, is  predictable and proud of it. The Lancers are old money, a safe bet to make the  playoffs, where they are 8-5 in yearly visits since 1984.  </P> <P> Westlake (8-0, 5-0 in league play) turns a game into a show, employing  entertaining sleight of hand and playfully asking, "Guess what's behind door  No. 1?"  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks (6-1-1, 4-0-1) lowers its head and bashes down the door.  </P> <P> Westlake's offense runs the gamut of gimmicks, including a double forward pass  and a formation that places every lineman far to one side of the center. On  another play, the kick holder appears to have forgotten the tee. He dashes to  the sideline to retrieve it. The ball is snapped and he becomes a pass  receiver.  </P> <P> Can something new be expected tonight? "Of course, always," Jim Benkert,  Westlake's second-year coach, said gleefully.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks, on the other hand, ran a simple reverse against Royal last week  and second-guessers came out of the woodwork. The play resulted in a fumble and  enabled Royal to kick a last-second field goal and forge a 26-26 tie.  </P> <P> "Our offensive coaches have been doing a tremendous job for several years and I  have the highest respect for their decisions," Bob Richards, Thousand Oaks'  eighth-year coach, said stoically in response to the criticism.  </P> <P> The teams' wildly divergent approaches also are apparent in their preparation  for this game; Westlake went theatrical while Thousand Oaks tried to conduct  business as usual.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WESTLAKE'S AGENDA  </P> <P> Monday: Read gut-wrenching letters from 32 former Westlake players who  expressed their deepest regret at having been soundly beaten by Thousand Oaks  in 1989 (25-0) and '88 (24-6). Watching this year's Warriors gain revenge would  enable them to pick up the pieces and go on with their lives, they write.  </P> <P> Tuesday: Cover tackling dummy with Thousand Oaks jersey. Proceed to repeatedly  maul said dummy.  </P> <P> Wednesday: Break out limited edition T-shirts emblazoned with a motivational  slogan designed for this game. "We are emphasizing Thousand Oaks, that makes  this game special," Benkert said.  </P> <P> Thursday: Light drills, heavy on the gusto.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS' AGENDA:  </P> <P> Monday: Anything associated with Westlake is conspicuously absent. A banner  hanging in the locker room simply states: "A championship: Who wants it?"  </P> <P> Tuesday: No Westlake jerseys in view. In fact, no tackling dummies are in view  -- all Lancer hitting drills are live. However, a selected quote by a Westlake  player from a recent newspaper article is taped to some lockers.  </P> <P> Wednesday: Rob Elliot, the Lancers' line coach, breaks out a few choice songs,  including "Bad to the Bone." No mention of Westlake or Warriors in the lyrics.  </P> <P> Thursday: Polishing plays with a gleam in their eyes.  </P> <P> "All we are doing is preparing for a championship game in November," Richards  said. "Emotion will carry you part of the first quarter. Then it comes down to  the personal confidence of the players. Both teams will have (adversity) during  the course of the game. How they respond to that adversity will determine the  outcome."  </P> <P> The closest Westlake came to adversity last week in a 56-6 win over Simi Valley  was the holder forgetting to take the field on an extra-point try with Westlake  ahead, 36-0.  </P> <P> The Warriors' reaction? They stood on the sideline and laughed, coaches and  players alike. Greater intensity will be required tonight.  </P> <P> "We've turned it up a notch," said Arash Mobayen, a Westlake starter at  fullback and linebacker. "We're working harder than before."  </P> <P> Westlake might be coming off a laugher, but Thousand Oaks believes its finish  last week was a crying shame. The Lancers blew a 26-13 halftime lead.  </P> <P> "We had a little letdown in the second half, we just broke down," said Bryce  Elliot, a two-way lineman and Rob Elliot's son. "I think it was partly because  we were looking forward to Westlake."  </P> <P> A Lancer actually uttering the "W" word? It was inevitable. In fact, a note  plastered on a locker-room soda machine says something to the effect of, "You  think Royal's postgame celebration was something? Wait until you see Westlake's  if they win."  </P> <P> Familiarity also adds to the intrigue. Many Westlake players live in adjoining  Thousand Oaks and the players have had plenty of opportunities to cross paths.  </P> <P> "We all know each other, we just had to go to different schools," Westlake  lineman James Gillespie said.  </P> <P> Some of the acquaintances are friendly, like that of Westlake two-way starter  Dave Monheim and Thousand Oaks quarterback Scott Peterson, who starred together  on youth basketball teams.  </P> <P> Others are less so. Defensive lineman Dave Acosta, Thousand Oaks' leading  tackler, made a special request of Elliot, his position coach. "Dave wants to  line up across from (Jim) McCrossan," Elliot said. "I told Dave I think we can  work that out."  </P> <P> Acosta and McCrossan belonged to the same gym in the off-season.  </P> <P> "I know Acosta, we're not friends," McCrossan said. "At the gym there were  verbal confrontations. Just about the schools, nothing personal. Just  disagreements."  </P> <P> About all these teams agree on is that tonight has not come soon enough.  </P></p>

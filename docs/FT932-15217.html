			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Long and winding road to recovery: Michael Cassell follows an export manager to the front lines of the battle to boost UK sales abroad Mr Ed van Der Heijden tunes his car radio to the BBC while he speeds towards Antwerp and a hotel bed. A highway exit sign beckons motorists to nearby Boom as Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, unveils his Budget for sustained recovery. There is to be extra help for Britain's exporters. Mr van der Heijden knows a lot about exporting. He also knows a great deal about deep fryers, coffee grinders, rice cookers, blenders and mixers. Ask him anything about German buns, Belgian bread or Danish meatballs. Test him on calibrated food pushers, juice centrifuges or cordless kettle jugs. As an export manager for Kenwood, the Hampshire-based manufacturer of food preparation appliances, Mr van der Heijden, 49, is a mastermind on his products and his marketplace. That is a requirement of the job if you battle daily for business against big guns such as Philips, Moulinex, Braun and Bosch. Kenwood, with a strong brand name behind it, annually turns out 1.75m appliances from its Havant factory and survives on exports. Two-thirds of its Pounds 100m annual sales are made outside the UK, one-third of them in continental Europe. At Kenwood's heart is the Chef, a food mixer launched 45 years ago and which has since whisked and beaten its way into more than 7m kitchens. Something of a cook himself, Mr van der Heijden talks of the appliance in reverential tones. He and his colleagues are at the sharp end of Mr Lamont's calls for an export-led recovery. His job relies on encouraging and cajoling distributors and agents to sell Kenwood. His salary is performance-related; fewer sales mean less take-home pay for him and lower earnings for Britain. The completion of the single market, with its 344m customers, means little for companies already well entrenched on the Continent. Trading barriers may be down but markets are still characterised by wide differences in pricing, distribution and retailing patterns. There is no such thing as common pricing. The Chef, for example, costs twice as much in Switzerland as in the UK. While big, national retailers ease the logistics of distribution in the UK, a proliferation of small independent businesses in Germany means more complicated supply chains. There may have been big strides towards technical harmonisation across the EC but UK consumers still often find themselves expected to pay extra for a three-pin plug. For Kenwood and other British companies selling in Continental Europe, the more immediate challenge lies not in adapting to structural change but in winning orders. Deepening recession means shops empty of goods and falling sales. But Mr van der Heijden relishes the challenge. His particular patch includes Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg and some former communist countries. A long-time UK resident, German-born, with a Dutch father and English and Danish former wives, he can talk small appliances in four languages. Kenwood's man has today notched up a few more of the 25,000 miles a year he drives to help win sales. The company's pioneering founder, Kenneth Wood, may have buzzed about Europe in his own executive aircraft, but Mr van der Heijden stays firmly on the ground. When he started, he had to scour Europe for sales in his own, ageing Mercedes. 'If I did more than 200 miles, my mileage allowance was halved. Every bit of the route had to be approved in advance, to make sure it was the shortest.' In 1989, however, Kenwood's executive directors, led by a former Treasury official, Tim Parker, organised a management buy-out from Thorn-EMI and last July the company floated on the London Stock Exchange. Now Mr van der Heijden has a 5-series BMW and is not afraid to use it. His long day had begun in the Netherlands at the offices of Beska Nederland, a Kenwood distributor near Eindhoven owned by Henk Beckmann, whose ocean-going yacht testifies to his success in importing electrical appliances. Nicola, his daughter, is product manager. She says British electrical products now enjoy the confidence of Continental consumers. 'Kenwood products are as good as any. Reliability is excellent; prices are stable and competitive'. As Mr van der Heijden leaves the room to take a telephone call from a Polish customer, Mr Beckmann welcomes Kenwood's recent expansion into products such as shavers and hair dryers. But he adds: 'They left it very late. They were seen as a one-product company without the range needed to take on the competition.' With a Pounds 50,000 order in the bag, Mr van der Heijden returns to explain that Beska can now import some Kenwood-designed products direct from the company's new, low-cost production base in China. Quality is guaranteed, he says, drawing a discreet veil over a recent setback with an early consignment of Chinese-made coffee-making machines. Mr Beckmann looks over a draft contract to extend his Kenwood partnership for another four years. He has one big complaint, shared by other Kenwood suppliers: 'There is nothing like enough spent on advertising. The competition spends millions.' Kenwood accepts the criticism but cannot escape its status as a second division manufacturer without the financial resources available to big league players such as Bosch and Braun. Distributors must, therefore, play a large part in promoting products. After a quick Taiwanese meal, Mr van der Heijden checks out a huge electrical superstore at Cuijk. Kenwood products seem swamped; Mr van der Heijden admires an in-store video promotion by Philips and wants the same. More store visits follow. Next morning, he is in Aartselaar, near Antwerp, for a meeting with Jacques van den Bogaert, the growling proprietor of Asogem, Kenwood's Belgian distributor. Thirty years ago, Mr van den Bogaert struck a deal with Kenneth Wood over a bottle of Scotch. His business now sells more than Pounds 2m of Kenwood products a year, less than Kenwood sales in France, Austria, Denmark or Germany, but still an important market. The conversation is conducted in English, French and Flemish. Mr van den Bogaert generally holds Kenwood in high regard but reckons it has been slow off the mark with new products: 'Belgium buys 600,000 coffee-makers a year. What have I got to offer from Kenwood? - nothing.' Patience, says Mr van der Heijden, the Kenwood models are on their way. Mr van den Bogaert is also concerned about Kenwood's prices. 'Why aren't they reflecting the near-20 per cent devaluation in sterling?' he asks. Kenwood, Mr van der Heijden reminds his customer, has changed to invoicing in local currencies in order to stabilise selling prices. 'Devaluation was a bonus but we bear the risk on currency fluctuations. He didn't phone up offering to take lower margins when sterling strengthened,' says the export manager. Mr van den Bogaert laughs but is not amused. He adds: 'They (the British) are financially very bright but still not commercial enough.' But Thierry Vander Elst, Asogem's commercial director, balances the criticism by heaping praise on the commercial section of the local British consulate: 'It is excellent. They leave the others standing.' Lunch at the local tennis club ends in a skirmish about plans to expand the network of family-run Kenwood dealer centres around Belgium. Asogem had originally suggested up to 150 but now talks of 75. It is the first Mr van der Heijden has heard of the plans. He next drives to Brussegem near Brussels, where Agnes Willems runs just such a Kenwood centre. She seems unhappy about selling quality products marked 'Made in China'. It is early evening and the man from Kenwood is done for the day. He sets off for the Luxembourg border and another hotel. At the weekend he will be home to see his 15-year-old daughter and to plan the next trip. He says he still loves his job, but insists that he works to live, not the other way round. But ask him for a personal ambition and he instinctively responds: 'Five per cent of the European market for mens' shavers - that would be great.'</p>

Democratic leader of whip in the House of Representatives  Richard Gephardt said the United States must deploy Patriot  missiles in South Korea, resume the "Team Spirit" nuclear war  exercises and additionally dispatch U.S. troops to South Korea.  Republican leader of whip in the Senate Robert Dole also made  such remarks, crying for "a deliberation of economic sanctions  against North Korea."    Meanwhile, U.S. State Secretary Christopher, in his  interview  with CBS, openly revealed the intention to put pressure on the  DPRK by abusing "a resolution of the United Nations" and thus  bring the situation of the Korean peninsula to a hopeless phase.    All this clearly indicates that the U.S. hardline  conservatives are invariably pursuing the reckless policy of  isolating and stifling the DPRK.    Any pressure and sanctions, however, can never work with the  DPRK. The Korean people value peace. But, they will not  tolerate anyone who dares infringe upon the nation's sovereignty  and dignity.    The U.S. war-thirsty elements would be well advised to stop  running rashly, clearly knowing of the DPRK where the leader,  the party and the popular masses are united in one mind.</p>

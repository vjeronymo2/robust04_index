			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria April 18 SAPA -- Law and Order Minister  Hernus Kriel should address police members' grievances instead  of accusing them of radicalism, the SA [South African] Police  Union [SAPU] said on Monday [18 April].    SAPU National Organiser Gerhard van der Merwe was reacting  to  Mr Kriel's response to a vote of no-confidence in him, passed at  a SAPU meeting in Cape Town on April 15. The vote of  no-confidence was accepted after Mr Kriel's office denied the  SAP [South African Police] had morale problems, said Mr van der  Merwe. "His response to the vote was that SAPU should stop  trying to overtake Popcru (the Police and Prisons Civil Rights  Union) in radicalism. The obvious thing to do would be to  effectively address these grievances rather than accuse SAPU of  radicalism," he said.    Mr Kriel's attitude aggravated the already volatile  situation  at grassroots level and was not in the interests of the police  or South Africa.</p>

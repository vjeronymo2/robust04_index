			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Om Prakash: "Dunkel Will finish Off the Small </F> and Marginal Farmers"]    [Text] New Delhi, 20 December--If we consider our fears to  be valid, the small and marginal farmers will be totally ruined  when the Dunkel proposals are implemented. The prices of  sugarcane, tobacco, and peanuts will fall on the first day. The  practice of announcement of the approved price at the time of  sowing will stop. Various types of agriculture will come to an  end. It is necessary to consider these fears to be true because  the statements made by the government's department secretary,  Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji, and by U.S. Vice President Al  Gore support these fears.    Pranab Mukherji said in the Parliament that it is not  necessary to raise a fuss over the subsidy to the farmers and  the cheap grains sold in the ration shops. It is important to  consider how much help the government is able to provide. It  should be remembered that the issue of subsidies over  fertilizers, electricity, and water to the farmers is stuck in  Manmohan Singh's economic policies. The efforts were to reduce  these subsidies. It is said that the government is not in  position to give these subsidies. The amount of grains provided  to the ration shops was reduced by 25 percent last year. It is  clear that the government is not able to increase the subsidies  under these two plans.    The Dunkel proposals clearly ask for the grains kept for  domestic use to be accounted for and records of it kept. The  quantity needed must be declared in advance. Additional  purchases or storage to this declared amount will not be  permitted. The government will purchase and sell grains at the  market rate. There is one exception here. Grains at reduced  rates with government subsidy can be provided to a specific  group. However, account of this subsidy must be kept and shared.  This exception can be made only for feeding for survival.    Dr. S.K. Sinha, director of the Indian Agricultural  Institute, says on the results of this system, "There will be no  determined price for agricultural production. The open market  rates will be followed. The government will not be able to levy  any thing. It will have to purchase and sell at the open market  rate. Even if the government keeps the present subsidies, the  grain prices in the ration shops will be higher." The records of  all these are required to check subsidies given by the  government if it sees the prices in ration shops increasing. The  GATT committee will meet to discuss it to discuss this subsidy  and decide whether it should be approved. Why are all these  restrictions being imposed on agriculture? Just to make sure  that the third world countries do not grow more grains than are  needed. It is being done because when the people began to  migrate to cities after the World War II, these industrialized  nations had to provide 200 percent subsidy to farmers in order  to keep them there. This did save their agriculture, but they  have had to destroy huge amount of grains in order to control  the international market rates. They also have to make  arrangements to sell this, therefore, they have determined that  three percent of grains consumed must be imported in the first  year, 3.5 percent during the next five years. This amount will  increase to five percent in the sixth year.    India's future will depend on one exemption. It will not be  required to import grains if the trade balance is not in its  favor. India does not have the balance of payment problem now  because of the money received in loans. We have been importing  oil to keep the domestic prices low. Therefore, whether we will  get this exemption or not, only the future will tell. What will  happen during the next six years? Anwarul Huda, our former  special commerce secretary and now assistant director of GATT,  says that our balance of payments is not going to improve in six  years, therefore, we will be protected from this required  import. Commerce Secretary Tajender Khanna says, "Not now, but  it is possible that after six years, we may be forced to  import." J.C. Pant, special agriculture secretary, says, "the  difference between three and five percent appears to be very  small, however, keeping in mind India's population and domestic  consumption, even this three percent is not a small amount. We  should oppose it. Let us say, we have to negotiate again in six  years, our opposition now will help us at that time."    Now let us hear what Al Gore said. He said, "At present we  are trying to save the plants that are becoming rare. First,  because of environmental pollution. Second, multinational  companies are giving consistency to such plants for major sale  in the world market." The patenting of genes and biotechnology  is being done to benefit these multinational companies. How the  farmer will have to depend on multinational companies for seeds  every year is clear from Pranab's comment that there will be a  law to stop farmers using his seeds a second time. However, the  question is of the new hybrid seed. How will it work? Our  Commerce Secretary Tajendar Khanna explains, "The multi-national  companies can cause havoc here over producing and selling seeds.  We should have a national policy stopping multi-national  companies from coming here." We know that they are ignoring the  issue of farmers and seeds because it is not easy to stop it. If  the farmers get certain types of seeds in small quantities one  year and they produce it in large quantities the next year,  sharing it will not be a barter deal; it would be a sale and  they must pay royalty on it. Let us look at India's Green  Revolution for comparison. The seeds that our farmers use were  procured from genes taken from Japan in 1963 and developed by  our agricultural scientists. Genes for various rice varieties  were brought from China. It was made possible because at that  time the goal was to provide grains to everyone in the world.  The goal now is to get royalty from every field.    There will be no campaigns to determine approved prices now.  The campaign will be to reduce the prices of sugarcane, tobacco,  and peanuts as much as is raised. The government says that the  subsidy for these three crops is less than 10 percent. Those  outside the government figure this subsidy to be about 30  percent. The international prices of these three crops are lower  than in our country. Thus, when all this is put together, it is  clear that the days of agricultural subsidies are gone.</p>

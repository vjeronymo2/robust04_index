			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> CHARGES AGAINST SANDERS DROPPED  </P> <P> Charges stemming from an Aug. 6 altercation between Columbus Clippers  outfielder Deion Sanders and two Richmond fans were dismissed today after  Sanders agreed to make a donation to benefit handicapped fans here.  </P> <P> Ken Ross and Chris S. Burke, fans of the Richmond Braves, swore out assault  warrants against Sanders, who with his companion, Carolyn Chambers, obtained  assault warrants against Ross.  </P> <P> The altercation occurred after Sanders was lifted for a pinch hitter in the  ninth inning of a Clippers-Braves game. He apparently went straight to the  locker room, changed clothes and confronted Burke and Ross, who he believed had  been harassing Chambers.  </P> <P> The New York Yankees, the parent team of the Clippers, said they have fined  Sanders and might take other action.  </P></p>

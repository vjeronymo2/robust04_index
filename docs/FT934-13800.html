			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Arts: Christa Ludwig's farewell tour - Recital The generation of singers that burst on to the stage after the war is gradually taking its final bow. Earlier this year Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau retired with unexpected suddenness, leaving probably the last of his long-serving German contemporaries to continue progress on her own, more patiently orchestrated tour of farewells. It is extraordinary to think that Christa Ludwig made her professional debut as long ago as 1946. Since then she has been at the top of her profession, a warm, glowing, Germanic mezzo-soprano with power enough to conquer some of the summits of the operatic repertoire. However ambitious she was, stretching up to Beethoven's soprano Leonore, embracing Wagnerian heroines, the voice never suggested she had gone too far. Farewells have already been said in Salzburg, New York and Paris. A pair of recitals at the Wigmore Hall and a concert with the Philharmonia next February constitute her final London appearances. A tear was in the singer's eye as she finished her encore at the second of the recitals on Monday, but the evening seemed more a cause for rejoicing that she can still sing so much so well, some passing problems with intonation apart. The programme was illustrated with the leaflet advertising her debut recital in London. That was at the Wigmore Hall in 1957 - interesting to note that she was already described as 'the great mezzo-soprano', although she had only recently made her first major recordings. Clearly the word had got around. Two of the songs that she sang then were in Monday's selection, and were among her most successful: Mahler's 'Rheinlegendchen' and 'Ich bin der Welt abhanden gekommen'. The latter exemplifies the very best of Ludwig. When she sings that she 'rests in a quiet realm', music and singer seem spiritually at one. The song's expansive, late romantic vocal lines, unfolded as though time is of no importance, could not be better suited to this voice. The sound, always at its most beautiful in the lower middle, simply pours out, relaxed, free from tension, expressive of deep-seated Mahlerian calm. Part of that is achieved because she does not try to seize upon the words in the intense style of a Schwarzkopf or Fischer-Dieskau. Ludwig's way has been simpler and to that extent less memorable in what she has had to say than they were. But this was not the occasion to complain. By the time Charles Spencer allowed the final notes of Strauss's 'Morgen' to die away, the singer's unforced eloquence had unarguably made her case for her - a moving end to a reign of nearly half a century.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (8): Domestic luxury car sales accelerate - Toyota and Honda WHEN Japanese domestic vehicle registrations went into reverse last year for the first time since 1984, luxury cars were the only market segment to buck the trend, with sales up an impressive 42 per cent. It therefore comes as no surprise that the nation's naturally competitive car industry executives are stepping on the gas to overtake one another in this lucrative and fast-growing market. To do so, vehicle designers and marketing officials must steer towards luxury car buyers whose profiles are in some respects significantly different from those in Europe and North America. 'The content of the Japanese market is very different,' says Mr Junzo Shimizu, deputy general manager of overseas planning for Toyota. 'In the American luxury auto market you're talking mostly about private cars. In particular, lately there have been a lot of baby boomers and what are called yuppies or dinkies (double income, no kids). These are often relatively wealthy people in their mid-40s. 'In contrast, the Japanese luxury car market is a strange one, like no other in the world. The main group of buyers are individualistic corporate presidents, or private business owners. There is also no system in which large company employees are provided with (self-driven) cars.' Mr Shimizu estimates that owners of small companies comprise 50-60 per cent of the Japanese luxury car market, individuals 30-40 per cent and large companies less than 10 per cent. This contrasts sharply both with corporations' small portion of luxury car sales in the US and their roughly 80 per cent share in Europe, he says. Meanwhile, the emergence of a well-heeled class of owner-managers has been the critical fuel for the recent acceleration of domestic luxury car sales, says Mr Hiroo Watanabe, managing director of Honda's research and development centre in Wako, where the number three Japanese auto maker conducts product planning, styling and other design work. 'The corporate market has changed a great deal in the past five or 10 years. In the past, company cars were chauffeur-driven with priority given to the rear seat. But lately, with owners driving themselves around, the front seat is equally emphasised,' he says. The importance of this market is not missed by foreign competitors. For example, General Motors of the US has recently run advertisements in local newspapers showing its Buick Park Avenue and headlined simply: 'Company image.' Increasingly affluent salaried employees also have been buying up a significant share of Honda's range of relatively small luxury cars, Mr Watanabe adds. 'The average buyers are fairly young. Many are in their thirties and some in their late twenties. There is also quite a number of salarymen (salaried workers), which wasn't the case in the past.' Just how rapidly the market will grow over the next few years is open to question. Economic difficulties are leaving many target customer groups feeling far less affluent than in recent years. 'During the bubble economy era, people invested in stocks and land, got a lot of money and bought expensive cars. But now the reverse reaction is rather severe and I'd say growth is likely to slow,' says Mr Shimizu. 'We'll be pleased if sales increase, but in the near future I don't think there will be a large rise.' He also describes the rapid sales gains for cars with engines of 2,000cc or over - called three-number vehicles in Japan due to their license plate designation - as a one-time response to a dramatic tax cut two years ago. Over the longer term, both officials said they expected the market for three-number cars to increase steadily. That is not to say the ratio to total car sales will necessarily match North American standards. For one thing, the post-war American baby boom involved a decade of high birth rates, which are now translating into showrooms filled with affluent middle-aged car buyers, notes Mr Shimizu. In Japan, birth rates jumped for a far shorter period, he says. Another impediment to dramatic increases is the high dependence of luxury car sales on drivers in leading urban areas. They are especially plagued by clogged roads, expensive parking and market saturation. Nationally, the mid-range Corolla leads Toyota sales, while in Tokyo the luxury Mark II and Crown models top the list, Mr Shimizu notes. Fortunately for car makers, the luxury vehicles that do roll out of domestic showrooms are money machines, thanks to the willingness of Japan's gadget-loving drivers to pay up for lucrative options. 'Americans look for value while Japanese customers have more of an attitude that anything is okay,' says Mr Shimizu. How far does Japanese drivers' willingness to pay for the latest high-tech gadgets go? According to Mr Shimizu, one indication is the 20 per cent of Toyota's top-of-the-line Celsior models, known as the Lexus abroad, that leave showrooms with satellite sensor navigation systems costing the equivalent of Dollars 5,000 - an option not even available in the US. Overseas, luxury cars are also highly profitable for car manufacturers, which has prompted the three Japanese leaders to set up separate subsidiaries with distinct brand images in North America: Toyota owns Lexus, Nissan the Infiniti line and Honda markets its high-end vehicles as Accura. The Toyota and Honda officials said their companies were not seeking under export quotas to the EC to replace large shares of lower priced cars with luxury models or set up independent sales arms as they have in the US. 'Toyota is a volume manufacturer, unlike Mercedes Benz and BMW, so we are not looking to increase luxury car sales while those for regular cars decrease,' says Mr Shimizu. In fact, Toyota sold just 2,100 Lexus cars in the EC last year, compared to 38,000 in the US and 32,900 at home, which helps explain why it is still operating like an upstart in the luxury market. 'We offer many options in the US. But in Europe we sell so few (luxury) cars that we equip them with what would be considered close to the full range of options in America,' the Toyota executive says.</p>

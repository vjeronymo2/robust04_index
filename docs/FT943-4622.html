			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Chiapas unrest worsens A regional leader of Mexico's opposition Democratic Revolution Party has been shot dead in the troubled southern state of Chiapas, Reuter reports from Mexico City. Mr Roberto Hernandez Paniagua, who was the centre-left party's head in the town of Jaltenango de la Paz, was shot several times as he cycled to a school where he was a teacher. The shooting followed several days of growing unrest in Chiapas, where PRD supporters have protested at the results of the state's gubernatorial election on August 21. The PRD claims its candidate won the race but that the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party was given the victory because of massive electoral fraud.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Hoskins transforms with two purchases Tiny USM-traded Hoskins Brewery is set to emerge as Halkin Holdings, a tobacco accessories and airport shops supplier with a real ale brewery and three pubs, Mr Howard Hodgson, its new chief executive, said yesterday when announcing interim results. The company reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 830,000 for the six months to September 30, against profits of Pounds 50,000 in the comparative period. Sales fell to Pounds 330,000 (Pounds 812,000) and there were exceptional charges of Pounds 529,000 (Pounds 35,000) relating to costs of management changes and reflecting the dimunition in value of some properties. The company also showed a Pounds 283,000 provision to cover the loss on the sale of a loss-making pub. Losses per share were 14.2p, compared with earnings of 0.87p last time. Mr Hodgson, a stock market darling in the 1980s, announced the transformation through two linked acquisitions for Pounds 19.5m funded by three separate share issues to raise Pounds 15m. Hoskins' new board announced a Pounds 9.5m partial cash alternative offer for LGW, which imports and distributes branded goods such as watches and jewellery through shops based at Gatwick Airport. Two of LGW's directors and another principal shareholder, accounting for 80.6 per cent of the issued capital, have irrevocably undertaken to accept the offer. The offer is conditional on the brewery's Pounds 10m cash acquisition of Ronson, a manufacturer of cigarette lighters and other smokers' requisites, as well as household aerosol products and writing instruments. The new board plans to fund these acquisitions with a placing, subscription and rights issue which together will raise Pounds 15m through the issue of 25m new shares at 68p apiece. Of the proceeds, Pounds 10m will be payable to Ronson and Pounds 5.1m will be available to satisfy acceptances in full by LGW shareholders of the partial cash alternative. The issue price compares with the middle market quotation of 78p per share on December 8 when Hoskins shares were suspended. On completion of the Ronson deal, Ronson will subscribe for 2.94m new Hoskins shares at 68p which the company has agreed to retain for 12 months. Peel Hunt have conditionally placed Pounds 16.2m shares with institutions at 68p and shareholders will be offered new Hoskins shares at the same price on the basis of a 1-for-1 rights issue. The placing and rights issue have both been fully underwritten by Guiness Mahon, save for 755,000 shares to be taken up in accordance with undertakings received by the company. The board also proposed a capital reconstruction for which the company needs court approval and, in common with most of yesterday's proposals, will have to be agreed by shareholders at a special meeting on January 12. Shares in Hoskins were suspended on December 8 and the Stock Exchange has indicated that dealings will recommence on the USM but will be suspended for a second time on January 11.</p>

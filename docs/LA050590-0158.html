			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ECONOMY SLOWS AS JOBLESS RATE SWELLS TO 5.4%  </P> <P> The nation's economy created virtually no jobs at all in April and unemployment  rose slightly to 5.4% in an unexpected signal of economic weakness, the Labor  Department reported Friday.  </P> <P> For the first time in several years, private payroll employment has declined  for two consecutive months, pushed downward in part by weakness in construction  and manufacturing. Even the service sector, the big job creator of the 1980s,  showed signs of softness.  </P> <P> The weak April report, the first statistical snapshot of the nation's economic  performance last month, sharply reduces the likelihood that the Federal Reserve  Board will attempt to crack down on a still-stubborn rate of inflation by  raising interest rates.  </P> <P> "The economy is in low gear, the goods-producing sector is in trouble, so the  next question for the Fed shouldn't be whether to tighten, but when to ease,"  said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover in New York.  </P> <P> "I hope the Fed doesn't wait until the slump arrives before they ease up,"  Kellner added. "Our main threat now is no longer inflation. It's recession."  </P> <P> April's 5.4% civilian unemployment rate was up from 5.2% in March. The overall  unemployment rate, when members of the armed forces who live in the United  States are taken into account, was 5.3% in April, an increase from 5.1% in  March.  </P> <P> "Taken together, the data for the past two months appear to paint a very weak  employment picture," Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor  Statistics, told Congress' Joint Economic Committee in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> But she noted that the softness appeared in part to be a correction of  unusually strong job growth in January and February, which "probably overstated  employment strength and may have contributed to the weaker data that we are now  seeing."  </P> <P> Estimates of civilian unemployment in California tracked the national averages  exactly, at 5.4% in April, compared with 5.2% in March.  </P> <P> Total non-farm employment as measured by the government's monthly survey of  businesses increased by a mere 64,000 in April. In fact, it was only government  hiring of 80,000 temporary Census workers that kept last month's job creation  out of the negative column.  </P> <P> Manufacturing employment declined by 22,000 in April and jobs in durable-goods  industries such as automobiles fell 30,000. Norwood noted that some 300,000  jobs have been lost in the manufacturing sector over the last 13 months.  </P> <P> Some of April's job-creation weakness reflected the fact that unusually warm  weather early in the year exaggerated Labor Department records of new jobs,  especially in construction.  </P> <P> On average, new job creation this year has been about 225,000 a month, or about  175,000, excluding the Census hires. The monthly average in 1989 was 200,000;  in 1988 it was 275,000.  </P> <P> "Private employment has dropped now for two straight months -- and that hasn't  happened since 1986," said David Wyss, an analyst with Data Resources Inc. in  Lexington, Mass. "That has to be a bit scary. This should take a lot of  pressure off the Fed to tighten."  </P> <P> Economists generally agreed that the picture so far this year is consistent  with the widespread impression of an economy that is slowing but not crashing.  </P> <P> Yet the job slump in April caught many observers by surprise. The consensus  forecast was a steady unemployment rate of 5.2% and job creation, excluding  Census workers, in the 175,000 to 200,000 range.  </P> <P> "At first sight, the April report is a shocker, much worse than expected," said  Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch in New York. "But if you look  at the details, it wasn't quite so bad."  </P> <P> Steinberg said the loss of 100,000 construction jobs in April appears to be a  statistical aberration caused by the effect of earlier, seasonal adjustments  that were themselves somewhat illusory. He noted that total construction  employment stood at 5.3 million in April, about the same level as in December.  </P> <P> Of more potential concern was a slowdown in the rate of growth in service  industry employment, which was up 51,000, excluding government hiring, after  bigger gains in previous months.  </P> <P> "The service sector has been the mainstay of jobs growth for a decade,"  Steinberg said, "and we might be seeing the beginning of a slowdown there."  </P> <P> Other data released in the past week showed that goods inventories declined in  March, factory orders and export sales rebounded and domestic consumption  seemed sluggish -- all signs that exports are more likely than services to  propel growth in coming months.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that factory hours and overtime  declined slightly in April, while the average work week for the month was  unchanged -- both signs of lessening inflationary pressure on wages.  </P> <P> The average hourly wage rose only 3 cents to $9.95, despite a mandatory 50-cent  increase in the minimum wage to $3.85, effective April 1.  </P></p>

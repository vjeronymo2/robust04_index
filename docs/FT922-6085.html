			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Honda announces first motorcycle venture in China - The Japanese company's willingness to commit capital to the joint venture company is a measure of its confidence in the Chinese market HONDA Motor of Japan yesterday announced that it would establish the first motorcycle production joint venture in China, which is quickly becoming one of the world's most lucrative motorcycle markets. The Honda announcement of a joint venture in Guangzhou, in the south, is likely to be followed by a similar project by Yamaha Motor, which at present is negotiating the terms of a production venture with Chinese government organisations. Honda already has technical assistance projects with Chinese partners in four cities, but its willingness to commit capital to the Dollars 17.6m (Pounds 9.7m) joint venture company, Wuyang-Honda Motors (Guangzhou), is a measure of its confidence in the Chinese market. The Japanese company will have a 35 per cent stake in the project, with state-run Guangzhou Motorcycle taking the majority stake. Honda will also have three representatives on an eight-member board. Using an existing factory, the joint venture company expects to produce 50,000 motorcycles of 125cc engine capacity in the first year, and plans to double the output by 1995. Production will begin in August and the new company will have 1,500 employees. The exact number of motorcycles in China is unclear, but the Japanese industry estimates that there were 1.8m units sold last year and that the total number is around 7m. Sales in 1990 are reckoned to have been between 1.1m and 1.2m. Honda's technical assistance projects, which began operations in 1982, produced about 224,000 bikes last year, and the total this year, including the new joint venture, will be about 330,000. This is expected to rise to some 500,000 by 1995. 'The market is booming at the moment, so we don't plan to use the new factory for exports,' a Honda official said. However, a shift in political winds could hurt the motorcycle market, as the Communist Party limited sales after crushing the pro-democracy movement in 1989. The party was apparently annoyed that motorcyclists played an active role in the demonstrations and police were ordered to confiscate riders' licences.</p>

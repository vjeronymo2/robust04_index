			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Letter: An Ecu by many another name Sir, In his Economics Notebook (August 10), Peter Norman perpetuates the non-issue of what the Ecu and its parts should be called. People concerning themselves with this matter should consider: (1) that French and German-speaking Swiss have completely different words for one-hundredth of a Franc; (2) that the French call Britain's currency la livre, without the average Brit even knowing, let alone caring; and (3) that when a sub-unit was introduced in the UK at the time of decimalisation, natural linguistic pressure for 'p' triumphed over the official preference for 'new pence'. The peoples - in the plural - of Europe should be allowed to call the Ecu, or any part of it, whatever they want, as in fact they will anyway.

Institutions of political  science and law should, under the unified leadership of party  committees and governments, fully display their functions and  create a stable and political environment for the province's  reform, opening up, and economic development.    After listening to the views of participants from Zhengzhou,  Luoyang, Xuchang, and Nanyang, Li Changchun said: Doing two  types of work simultaneously and laying equal stress on both are  an important component of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. All levels of party and  government leaders should properly understand the dialectical  relations between reform, opening up, economic development, and  social stability, and improve their understanding on the  importance of preserving social and political stability.    Li Changchun pointed out: Development is the central issue,  reform is the driving force, and stability is the foundation.  All levels of party committees and governments should pay full  attention to political science and law, increase the impetus of  maintaining social stability, and persist in doing two types of  work simultaneous and laying equal stress on both in the course  of deepening reform and stepping up development.    Li Changchun continued: All levels of party and government  leaders should conscientiously carry out the responsibility  system for comprehensive management of social order. [passage  omitted]    Departments of political science and law throughout the  province should strengthen their leadership functions, severely  crack down on all kinds of crimes, and examine and handle major  and important economic crimes. [passage omitted]    During the discussion, Comrade Ma Zhongchen pointed out: All  levels of party committees and governments should apply the  method of one divided into two in their work. Comrades on the  front of political science and law should fully understand the  difficulties arising from the deepening of reform, the  adjustment of interests, and the increase in the people's  contradictions. They should raise their awareness of social  problems that may possibly arise from the introduction of major  reform measures.    Ma Zhongchen stressed: Comprehensive management of social  order is a social systems engineering, which should proceed  under the unified leadership of all-level party committees and  governments.

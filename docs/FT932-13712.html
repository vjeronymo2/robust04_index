			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / People: Lars McBride to bank on paper Lars McBride, a City corporate financier who has had to watch the shrinking of at least two merchant banks' corporate finance businesses from inside, has decided to transfer his skills to industry. He is taking up the position of finance director at Portals, the papermaking and protection and control group. He succeeds John Lloyd, who becomes group managing director after the May agm. 'Like many others, I fancied the idea of helping a company grow from within rather than advising them from outside,' says 38-year-old McBride. 'This is a British manufacturing exporter that has done well during the recession.' Portals is the world's leading producer of banknote paper, and the second biggest manufacturer of tea-bag paper. McBride was until recently managing director of European mergers and acquisitions at Chase, but the American bank has scaled back its activities in that area. Before that he was at County NatWest - but had the misfortune to join three weeks before the 1987 stock market crash and two months before the onset of the Blue Arrow affair. He also had a spell at Lazards, and qualified as an accountant at Peat Marwick. As finance director, Lloyd had also been in charge of corporate development; he retains responsibility for this area but says that McBride's experience will mean that he too has 'a very significant input'.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Sweden in free market pledge SWEDEN'S government will not be deflected from its free market strategy by current economic difficulties, Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, said yesterday at the opening of parliament. Mr Bildt's centre-right coalition will press ahead with free market reforms in its next 12 months in power, Mr Bildt said. The prime minister's determination is in spite of the historic compromise he made with the Social Democratic opposition in negotiating two all-party crisis packages of spending cuts and tax increases. The government promised to eliminate the country's growing structural budget deficit as part of its measures to shore up the krona, stimulate competitiveness and calm the markets. Mr Bildt said legislation in the next parliamentary session would transform Sweden into a more entreprenurial, dynamic country. His pledges indicate the government wants to stick to its long-term strategy of preparing Sweden for European Community membership in 1995 and economic and monetary union. This autumn's measures include: A bill to enable the supply of venture capital particularly to new enterprises through a risk capital company. The deregulation of Swedish railways, the telecommunications system and the postal services by turning the public enterprises into limited companies. The government is to abolish the state monopoly on labour market institutions, allowing private employment agencies. It will turn the public training board into a limited company. 'New and tougher competition' laws are to introduced to increase competition in public procurement by local authorities. The prime minister also confirmed that there would be a moratorium on the sale of Sweden's state enterprises because of the 'current market situation'. However, he said preparations for privatisation would continue. He also announced a measure to underpin the country's banking system with state guarantees. Mr Bildt also unveiled sweeping changes in Sweden's social policy. A family doctor system would be introduced to operate initially alongside community health centres. The state pensionable retirement age is to be extended from 65 to 66 from January 1 1994. The government wants to introduce dental care charges from the same date. It is examining a system of mandatory health insurance to shift the cost of medical care from the state by the mid-1990s. Meanwhile, the Confederation of Swedish Industries reported this week it expects a decline of 1.8 per cent both this year and in 1993 in the country's gross national product and a rise in unemployment to 7 per cent from around 5 per cent now.</p>

			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Spending by British groups on takeovers in EC surges to Pounds 5bn BRITISH companies spent about Pounds 5bn acquiring continental European groups in a surge of overseas investment in the first 10 months of this year, according to government figures. The figures from the UK's Central Statistical Office show that British companies' spending on overseas acquisitions between January and October was two-thirds higher than in the same period in 1992. The statistics suggest that strengthening balance sheets, coupled with the gradual emergence of the UK economy from recession, have encouraged the rise in cross-border spending. Continuing recession in most European Community countries may also have helped UK companies acquire continental businesses on attractive terms. Hostile takeovers remain rare, however, and most EC deals continue to be struck on agreed terms. While the number of acquisitions completed by UK companies in the rest of the EC has fallen, the size of many individual deals has risen sharply. In some cases the figures have been distorted by large individual acquisitions - such as the Kingfisher takeover of Darty, the French electrical retailer, and the purchase by PowerGen and a US partner of an east German coal field. But UK companies have, nevertheless, added significantly to corporate assets in France, Germany, Spain and Italy. Last week, Siebe, the UK controls and engineering group, launched a Pounds 184m rights issue to acquire Eckardt, a German process automation and controls systems specialist. In recent months, UK companies such as Courtaulds, Rugby Group, Northern Foods, Midlands Electricity and Amstrad have all acquired businesses elsewhere in the EC. Some of the upsurge in spending has been offset by the disposal by companies of earlier acquisitions. UK disposals, within the EC so far this year were worth about Pounds 571.5m, about half the level of 1992. Interest in North American companies has also been reviving, despite the dollar's recent strength. The CSO calculates that UK companies so far this year have undertaken merger and acquisition deals in the US and Canada valued at more than Pounds 5bn, twice the level in the whole of 1992. Even so, the value of transatlantic deals is only about half the level in the mid-1980s. Separate CSO figures suggest the UK has itself continued to attract high volumes of inward investment. So far this year, other EC nations have invested Pounds 1.4bn into the UK, suggesting a final annual figure in line with 1992. The CSO puts the figure from around the world so far this year at more than Pounds 5bn, up by more than a quarter on 1992.</p>

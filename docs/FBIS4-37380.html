			<p>BFN     [Text] His Eminence Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Sham-al-Din,  chairman of the Higher Islamic Shiite Council, has stated that  the continued occupation of south Lebanon is like having the  capital itself occupied, in addition to the Presidential Palace,  the Prime Minister's Office, the Chamber of Deputies, and all  Christian patriarchial seats in the country.    His eminence remarked that he opposes the establishment of  an  Islamic republic in Lebanon because the country is comprised of  Muslims and Christians. He said an Islamic republic would not be  conducive to the security of either the Muslim or Christian  communities in Lebanon.</p>

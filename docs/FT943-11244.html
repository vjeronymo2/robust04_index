			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Far East office space shortage forces blue chips into backrooms: Victor Mallet, Tony Walker and Andrew Taylor find rents are outstripping those in the west An acute shortage of city office space in rapidly emerging Far Eastern economies has left international executives operating from converted rooms in Vietnamese hotels with less-than-exotic names, such as the Army Hotel or the Government Guest House. More fortunate, or wealthier, executives are working from converted offices in houses or crumbling villas, dating back to the French colonial era, after installing electricity generators in the backyard. Finding suitable premises to work and live is just as hard in China where large numbers of executives have been forced to work from hotel rooms and town houses. A study by international property consultants Richard Ellis showed that office rents in Beijing and Shanghai in China and Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, in Vietnam are now higher than in London, Paris, New York and Frankfurt. Only Tokyo and Hong Kong have higher rents. In Beijing and Shanghai, office rents have soared by 30 per cent in the past six months as a result of the accommodation shortage. Ellis, which itself is working from converted offices in the Beijing Toronto hotel in China's capital, says the pace of development in emerging economies has been too slow to satisfy the high growth in demand from international companies. Mr Toby Anstruther, Vietnam representative of property consultants Brooke Hillier Parker, says: 'You have Fortune 500 companies working out of chop houses. IBM is sharing an office with a local Vietnamese company in a house.' The best villas in Saigon, part of the Ho Chi Minh City, have been rented by the big Japanese trading companies, which began operating in Vietnam several years before the arrival of most of their western competitors. Developers are building furiously to catch up. In Ho Chi Minh City, one block constructed by a Taiwanese developer is already open, and two others are about to be completed by Hong Kong companies. A further two office buildings are under development in Hanoi by Singapore and Hong Kong groups. Rents are expected to range from about Dollars 40 (Pounds 25.80) per square metre per month to Dollars 55 for high-quality offices - almost two thirds more than equivalent rents in mid-town New York. Companies and individuals in Shanghai, China's main financial centre, are expected to pay a month's rent in advance just to appear on long waiting lists for offices and apartments, says Mr Terry Merrifield a senior executive of Seacliff which manages the Shanghai Centre, a large hotel and office complex in demand from international companies. When the centre opened in 1990, office rents were in the 'high Dollars 30s', about one-third the present rate. A dozen organisations are currently on the waiting list for offices with about 50 individuals waiting for apartments which cost Dollars 6,000 per month. Because of the housing shortage, some organisations were delaying sending the families of employees to Shanghai. Companies also had deferred moves to the city until the accommodation shortage eased, said Mr Merrifield . Offices were expected to remain in short supply until 1997, by when 'the pendulum should be swinging in the other direction'. The situation is only slightly easier in Beijing where there also are long waiting lists for prime office buildings, such as the China World tower attached to the China World hotel. Office space at China World costs about Dollars 85 per sq m. Reasonable accommodation, however, can be acquired for about Dollars 60 per sq m per month according to Mr Tom Whitten, representative in Beijing of the China-Britain Trade Group (CBTG) an organisation to promote Sino-British trade. He says companies seeking to establish a presence in China should: 'come early, put names on waiting and be prepared for a sizeable wait in a hotel.' Hotel accommodation costs about Dollars 100 a day in Beijing. CBTG as an interim measure offers a desk and a phone to members. There are other places in Beijing such as the Regus centre at the Kempinski hotel which provides short-term office space with secretarial services. Apartment rents in Beijing range between Dollars 5,000 and Dollars 10,000 but there have been large rent increases in the past year as demand has risen fuelled by China's economic boom. It is a familiar story in many rapidly growing Asian business centres. Cities in south-east Asia accounted for eight out of the 11 most expensive office locations according to the Richard Ellis study which compared accommodation costs in 45 business centres.</p>

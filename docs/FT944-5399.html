			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (11): Back smaller companies and be patient - Japanese markets Japan seemed the place to be for many investors early this year. After falls in other stock markets around the world this spring, Tokyo was the only place where optimism seemed justified. The market there was still at less than half its peak level. Deregulation and restructuring of the Japanese economy and industry seemed to promise new opportunities for growth, and economic recovery looked set to take off. For a while, it seemed that the stock market would follow suit - but its performance has been disappointing. While foreign fund managers poured money into the market in the first half of the year, Japanese individuals and institutions kept their hands in their pockets and their money on deposit. The main Nikkei index is no higher than it was for most of 1993, and in late November it slipped below 19,000 for the first time in nine months. The over-the-counter market (OTC) in smaller companies fell just as dramatically as the main index in 1990, only to rise again, then fall yet further by mid-1992. It has since bounced back a little, with the first signs of a recovery. Overall, the OTC market has outperformed the main Nikkei index substantially over the last five years. Some investors have taken advantage of this trend by putting their money into unit and investment trusts specialising in Japanese smaller companies. It is no surprise that three of the five top-performing Japanese unit trusts over a five-year period are specialists in smaller companies - two trusts managed by Schroders and one by Dunedin. Of course, outperformance by smaller companies tends to be cyclical. In the late 1980s, Tokyo was briefly the world's biggest stock market. It is now back in second place, behind New York, but still deserves a place in every serious investor's portfolio. The main choice for private investors is between general Japan funds (there is a broad choice of both unit and investment trusts) and those concentrating on smaller companies. Or, if you prefer to spread your bets a little, you could pick a fund that invests in the whole of the Far East including Japan. More obsure areas, such as warrants or corporate bonds, can be exciting, but are rarely accessible to individuals with modest amounts of money to invest. Buying individual Japanese stocks is not recommended for private individuals. The Japanese stock market often moves in a different direction from the rest of the world, so it can be seen as a useful way of lowering risk and diversifying your portfolio. However, currency fluctuations can complicate matters: the strong yen has worked in favour of British investors recently, but the situation could well be reversed in future. Although Tokyo has been a disappointment so far this year, many analysts say that the good times have only been postponed, not cancelled. The recovery has been a little slower than expected, but Tokyo may still be a good home for a little of your savings if you can afford to wait a few years for your rewards.</p>

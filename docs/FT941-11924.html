			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / NZ economy grows by 4.2% in year New Zealand's economy grew 4.2 per cent in the year to September 30, pointing to one of the strongest recoveries the country has seen for many years. The GDP figure is the highest recorded since March 1985, when rapid growth followed efforts by the National government to prime the economy in the hope of winning the 1984 election. The latest growth figure, far higher than economists predicted, cappeda week of exceptionally positive economic news which has helped fuel the share market to levels approaching those of 1987. Last Thursday, Statistics New Zealand reported a trade surplus of NZDollars 1.7bn (Pounds 646m) for the year to December 31, a NZDollars 536m improvement on the previous year. The latest retail figures, released last week, showed a sharp recovery in this long-depressed sector, with an annual rise of 6.6 per cent, on a nominal basis, for November. Retailers say the trend was equally strong in December, with stores extremely busy in Christmas sales. Statistics from manufacturers showed sales and other income rose 12 per cent in the year to December, with greatest growth recorded by metal industries, machinery, construction and primary foods. Inflation continues at alow level, and the Reserve Bank is closely monitoring currency movements because of fears that the New Zealand dollar might get too strong and imperil the 0-2 per cent inflation target. The central bank worries that the country might see negative inflation, ie, inflation running below its zero target. The positive news on the economy has led to substantial foreign investment in New Zealandand continued appreciation of the NZ dollar, especially against the US and mostEuropean currencies. The New Zealand unit climbed to a 28-month high yesterday, ending a busy session at USDollars 0.5714/21 after trading as high as USDollars 0.5718 from a USDollars 0.5672/79 start. However, a 3 cent fall in the value against the Australian dollar has been welcomed bymanufacturers, as most of New Zealand's manufactured goods are exported to Australia under the Closer Economic Relations pact. The trade weighted indexcontinues to hover around 57, the top of the Reserve Bank's 'comfort zone'. Observers believe the bank is unlikely to intervene soon, as the latest consumer price index showed a rise of 0.2 per cent in the December quarter, bringing annual inflation for the year to 1.4 per cent. The positive economic statistics are bolstering business activity. The Institute of Economic Research, in its latest quarterly survey, showed business optimism was the highest in the 26 years since the survey of 1,250 business leaders began. Businessmen were pleased with the steady drop in interest rates, now at their lowest since 1971 and forecast to fall further.</p>

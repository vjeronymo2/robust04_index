			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / The Loyalist Ceasefire: From jailbird to dove of peace Nothing perhaps better personifies the change in Northern Ireland as the choice of Augustus 'Gusty' Spence, as yesterday's spokesman for the loyalist paramilitaries. The man picked to announce to the world that the para-militaries had opted for a universal cessation of hostilities has not always been a man of peace. Twenty-eight years ago Mr Spence formed part of a Ulster Volunteer Force band that fired on four young Roman Catholics as they left a pub in West Belfast, near the loyalist Shankhill Road. One of the Catholics, 18-year-old Peter Ward, was killed. Three men, including Mr Spence, were subsequently arrested and imprisoned for the attack. Many Catholics believe that murder was directly responsible for the civil unrest and street disorder which developed later. Mr Spence - now elderly and suffering from poor health - claims to have undergone a Christian conversion while in prison, abandoning direct involvement in terrorist operations. He was released from prison in 1984 after serving 16 years of a life sentence. He has always admitted having once been a member of the UVF but denies that he murdered Mr Ward. He formed a youth training centre for the unemployed in the late 1980s. The centre closed last year after getting into financial difficulties. In a rare interview four years ago Mr Spence explained why some people in Belfast chose to live behind walls. He said: 'In a society of fear people stay with their own sort. We are living in a society which has never been normal.' In recent months he has kept in close touch with the internal debate of the loyalist paramilitaries. Yesterday he was chosen to usher in the prospect of at least more normal times.</p>

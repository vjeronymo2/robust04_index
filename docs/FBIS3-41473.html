She  described Demyanov's actions as ``illegal and destructive,''  referring to his giving Agriculture and Food Minister Yuriy  Karasik his personal consent to using the American chemical  ``Harness'' in the republican agriculture.    She said ``such a connivance allowed the American company  `Monsanto' to fetch in 2,000 tons of this chemical which is not  even registered in the U.S.A. and is banned for use in  Ukraine.'' She also said a criminal case was filed against  ``state officials of the Agriculture and Health Care  ministries'' on the fact of the acquisition of this chemical and  production of banned chemicals in Ukraine.    In an interview with Interfax-Ukraine, Kolinko said  ``Ukraine  has become a test site for foreign companies where they test  their chemicals, and moreover, directly on the fields.''    ``Monsanto'' representative in Kiev, Vladimir Kudryashov,  told Interfax-Ukraine that ``they did sell some quantity of  `Harness' to Ukrainian consumers.'' He said ``had the chemical  not been used last year, Ukraine would not have had such a rich  harvest of corn.'' At the same time, he added that the  company's office in Kiev will sell the chemical only after its  registration in the republic, supposedly this February or March.</p>

Referring to the current situation surrounding the "nuclear  issue", Ho Chong-man said the United States is entirely to blame  for the situation in which the agreed conclusions reached at the  DPRK-U.S. contact in New York on Februray 25 and the Feb. 15  agreement between the DPRK and the International Atomic Energy  Agency had been reversed, and for the situation of the Korean  peninsula which is rushing headlong to the brink of war.    He said that the "presidential statement" of the UN Security  Council was another international pressure upon the DPRK and  that such "threat" and "pressure" could never be a solution to  the problem.    "The `nuclear issue' must be solved fairly in keeping with  the special status of the DPRK in which it has temporarily  suspended the effectuation of its announced withdrawal from the  treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons," he said,  expressing the hope that the JSDP would play a positive role to  this end.</p>

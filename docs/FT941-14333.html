			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (21): The tables have now turned - Large companies have just ended another year of slack domestic demand. Consumer confidence was depressed by high real interest rates and fears of rising unemployment / Country Analyses - France Almost all the winners among the French contenders in last year's version of the FT500 were from manufacturing and most of the losers were from finance. This year, the tables have turned. France's financial groups, notably Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), Axa and Assurances Generales de France (AGF) in insurance, succeeded in improving their standing in the FT500 during 1993, having slipped down the index in the previous year. Several of the earlier manufacturing winners, such as L'Oreal in cosmetics and BSN in food, lost ground last year. The performance of the French corporate sector was scarcely scintillating in 1993. Elf Aquitaine, the oil group which is not only the biggest single company in France but the next candidate for sale in the Balladur government's privatisation drive, slipped from 16th to 17th place. Even successful stocks, such as the insurers, saw their shares rise not on a strong performance in 1993 but in anticipation of recovery in 1994 and 1995. The companies quoted on the CAC 40 Index have just ended their fourth successive year of earnings decline, as illustrated by the recent round of profits warnings and gloomy corporate statements that have emanated from the shareholders' meetings of the large French groups. Mr David Harrington, French market analyst at James Capel in Paris, estimates that the CAC 40 companies suffered a 25 per cent reduction in net earnings during 1993. The reasons for this pedestrian performance are all too obvious. The Balladur government has, like its socialist predecessor, persistently resisted the temptation to regenerate the economy by accelerating interest rate reduction in favour of pursuing its franc fort policy of protecting the French currency. As a result, the economy slipped into recession during the first quarter of 1993 and remained stubbornly sluggish for the rest of the year. France's large companies have just ended yet another year of slack domestic demand as consumer confidence was depressed by the impact of high real interest rates and fears of rising unemployment. Companies in the consumer products sector slipped down the FT500 partly because of concern about the strength of the domestic market. BSN, the food group, tumbled from 30 to 53 in a year in which the retail market became so competitive that it was forced to cut the prices of some products to maintain market share. Media groups also lost ground. Havas, which has extensive interests in advertising and publishing, fell from 128 to 153 on concern about the condition of the French advertising market and the impact of the recession on its travel business. Canal-Plus, the pay-TV group which was once a star of the stock market, was hit by fears about the impact of the Balladur government's forthcoming media reforms, culminating in its recent profits warning for 1994. It fell from 102 to 129. Other French companies were affected by concern about their international interests. Despite their domestic difficulties, the French continued to fare well on the foreign front until early 1993 when the impact of the franc's strength following the European currency crisis in autumn 1992 became a significant handicap to international competitiveness. The strong franc not only depressed the reported profits from foreign subsidiaries, but also made it more difficult for French businesses to compete in their export markets. A number of the most prominent losers among the manufacturers in last year's FT500 are companies that had, in the past, fared well on the export front. LVMH, the luxury goods group with interests across the drinks and fashion industries, has been badly affected by the problems of the global champagne market, the instability of the Japanese economy and the difficulties of Guinness, its UK associate. It fell from 31 to 51 in the FT500 during 1993 after reporting reduced interim profits and warning of a further fall in earnings for the full financial year. Peugeot-Citroen, the motor company, was dogged by concern about the fragilility of the European car market. It slipped from 84 to 100 during a grim year in which it plunged into the red during the interim period. Peugeot said that, without the negative swing in exchange rates, it would have stayed in the black in the first half. But its problems pale beside those of Euro Disney, the leisure group that dived down the FT500 from 184 to 307 as speculation mounted about the prospects for its emergency financial rescue plan. Euro Disney, which reported a net loss of FFr5.3bn for the year to September 30, looks like a microcosm of all the problems of the French corporate scene with the recession reducing the expenditure of its French customers and the strong franc making it more difficult to drum up business from other countries. Yet some French groups did succeed in shrugging off the gloom of 1993. Retailing was one of the year's stronger sectors despite the strains on consumer spending and the poor results of a number of big companies. Carrefour, the hypermarket chain, and Promodes, the mail order concern, both managed to move up the FT500. Similarly, the large insurers fared well in the face of lacklustre results. UAP edged up to 58 in anticipation of its forthcoming privatisation. Its shares were bolstered by a modest improvement in its 1993 results and the expectation of further progress next year. Axa and AGF also rose in the index - from 95 to 68 and from 110 to 80 respectively - on recovery hopes. Investors clearly consider the worst is over, not only for the large French insurers, but the rest of the corporate sector. The economy is still in a fragile state - and its prospects for recovery will be complicated by the condition of trading partners such as Germany - but analysts do expect to see some improvement this year. James Capel has pencilled in increases in CAC 40 net earnings of 28 per cent for 1994 and 29 per cent for 1995, thereby marking the end of four years of decline.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Leading french companies by market capitalisation  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 FT500    Company                         Dollars m     Rank   Sector  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1 Elf Aquitaine                     18743.8       17      212  2 Alcatel Alsthom                   18494.8       18      533  3 Total                             12037.0       35      212  4 Generale des Eaux                 11690.0       40      221  5 L'Oreal                           11558.0       42      432  6 LVMH                              10480.5       51      422  7 BSN Groupe                        10242.8       53      451  8 UAP                             9585.5       58      151  9 Suez (Compagnie Financiere de)     9099.4       62      112 10 Societe Generale                   8984.2       64      112 11 Axa                                8418.7       68      171 12 L'Air Liquide                      7865.3       72      621 13 Paribas                            7790.5       73      112 14 Carrefour                          7696.7       75      493 15 Rhone-Poulenc                      7279.7       79      622 16 AGF                                7189.2       80      151 17 Saint-Gobain                       7027.5       81      611 18 Peugeot                            5786.4      100      401 19 Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez           4634.5      126      221 20 Canal +                            4543.8      129      474 21 Lafarge Coppee                     4370.3      131      611 22 GAN                                4033.4      141      151 23 Elf Sanofi                         3808.8      152      433 24 Havas (Agence)                     3784.7      153      475 25 Michelin                           3444.1      162      574 26 Pernod Ricard                      3430.2      164      422 27 Schneider SA                       3417.3      166      171 28 Eridania Beghin-Say                3312.7      172      451 29 Thomson-CSF                        3211.6      176      551 30 Pechiney International             3045.6      187      672 31 Promodes                           2828.6      201      491 32 CarnaudMetalbox                    2802.3      205      671 33 Credit Local de France             2743.5      209      122 34 Cetelem                            2696.2      210      112 35 Accor                              2691.8      211      464 36 Credit Comm de France              2635.0      215      112 37 Institut Merieux                   2630.4      216      433 38 Navigation Mixte                   2621.7      218      171 39 Valeo                              2515.0      226      571 40 Roussel-Uclaf                      2397.4      234      622  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

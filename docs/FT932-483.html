			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Tokyo council elections help strengthen yen against dollar THE Tokyo stock market rose 1.2 per cent yesterday and the yen strengthened against the dollar, following Tokyo council elections at the weekend. In the polls the ruling Liberal Democratic party held its own in the face of predictions that it could lose power in a general election on July 18, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo. The dollar finished the day in Tokyo at Y106, down Y0.35, while the Nikkei average rose 227.19 points to close at 19,886.76, largely in response to the LDP's solid showing. The Japan New party, which was the main gainer in the Tokyo poll, announced it would be fielding up to 70 candidates in the general election. The party is aiming to hold the balance of power in a hung parliament. The LDP's weakness, in spite of its Tokyo showing, was underlined by the party's announcement that it would field 282 candidates, the smallest ever team in a lower house election. The list means it is almost certain that the party will not win the 275 seats it held before the lower house of the parliament was dissolved 10 days ago and 48 LDP lower house members defected to set up rival parties or to run as independents.</p>

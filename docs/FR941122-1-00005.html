			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Under current rules at 7 CFR 277.15 of Food Stamp Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, State agencies are required to submit a fraud  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control plan prior to receiving the enhanced funding. A plan is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not currently required under the regulations for standard fraud  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding. In Fiscal Year 1993, all State agencies submitted or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extended their current fraud control plans and all State agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received enhanced fraud funding. The Department is proposing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retain the requirement for a fraud control plan. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes a fraud control plan is an important management tool in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combatting fraud and an important component of the State agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plan of Operation. Further, because program benefits are fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funded by the Department, the Department has an interest in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seeing that State agencies develop and implement an effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fraud control plan. However, the Department is proposing to drop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the other specific requirements in &sect;277.15 (e.g., job title of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Investigator, separate claims units, etc.) that pertain solely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced funding for fraud control activity. Fraud control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity performed either by investigators or certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workers would be eligible for 50 percent funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is also proposing to change the timing of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submission of the fraud control plan. Under current rules the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fraud Plan is submitted annually to FNS as an attachment to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FNS&hyph;366B, Program Activity Statement, 45 days after the end of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State's <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  fiscal year. For most States which operate on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> July 1 to June 30 fiscal year, this created an August 15 deadline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the fraud control plan. The Department is proposing a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;272.2(e)(10) which would create a uniform due date of August  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15th for all State agencies, regardless of their  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year. The change will ensure that the fraud control plan is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted prior to the start of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  fiscal year to which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it applies, and it links submission of the fraud control plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the submission of the Budget Projection Statement which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also due August 15. The Department believes the planning and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> budgeting of program activity should be linked since significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in planned activity may also mean changes in Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding. The Department is proposing to make conforming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendments to &sect;272.2(a), (c)(3), and (e)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department further proposes to remove &sect;277.15 and incorporate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the retained provisions elsewhere in the regulations. As noted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, the Department intends to retain the fraud control plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in &sect;277.15(c) by incorporating these requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into the Plan of Operation requirements at 7 CFR 272.2(d). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department is also proposing to make conforming amendments to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;272.2(a)(2), (c)(3), and (d)(1), as appropriate, related to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due date of the plan and the relocation of the submission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure from (c)(3) to (e)(10). The Department is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to create new requirements for the fraud control plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but to extend the current requirements and change the due date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for this plan. The Department is proposing to reserve section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 277.15 for future use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the Department is proposing to move the fraud control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan submission requirement to &sect;272.2(d)(1)(xi), the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submission requirement in &sect;272.2(c)(3)(i) is being deleted. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deletion of paragraph (i) requires redesignating &sect;272.2(c)(3)(ii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as &sect;272.2(c)(3). Although the wording must be changed slightly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to accomodate the restructuring of the paragraph, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in the current &sect;272.2(c)(3)(ii) for submission of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain interagency agreements are unchanged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department also intends to incorporate the provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding the funding rate for investigations of retail or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wholesale food concerns currently found in &sect;277.15(f)(2), with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> slight modification for clarity, into a new paragraph (e) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;277.4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> ADP Development_Sections 277.18, 274.12  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

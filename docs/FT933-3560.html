			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Europe's flights of fantasy In the 18 months since signature, the Maastricht Treaty has had such a sand-bagging from events in the real world, that it is hard to see how it can be made to work without a far-reaching re-think. Unfortunately, no-one is offering that. The unresolved crisis in the exchange rate mechanism is, of course, the most immediate item on the European Community's emergency agenda, because it appears to threaten the objective of economic and monetary union, centre-piece of Maastricht. The crisis does not prove the arguments of those who say that the Emu objective is in any case ill-advised, unnecessary and unattainable. But it shows that the system was politically under-engineered, because the member states were unprepared to navigate through a heavy speculative upheaval. Chancellor Helmut Kohl seems unsure whether Maastricht's timetable should now be lengthened, or indeed shortened; but neither alternative is allowed for in the treaty. But the ERM crisis is a political, not a technical problem. Experts may disagree over how, or indeed whether, to revise the details of the EMU programme. But the basic problem is that there is no political consensus on the objective of monetary union. When Maastricht was negotiated, the UK wanted the right to opt out; after two currency crises, British ambivalence seems to have been replaced by hostility. It is difficult to believe in the possibility of a renegotiated Emu programme, without political agreement on the final objective. Political dissent over the objective of Emu is symptomatic of widespread ambivalence over the objectives of Maastricht. It showed up vividly in the Danish and French ratification debates, as well as in opinion polls in other countries, but nowhere as deeply or as intensely as in Britain. This ambivalence is starkest over Europe's foreign policy. One way or another, the member states will be compelled to resolve the EMU crisis, because non-solution will become intolerable: economic actors will not long accept instability and incompetence. But there can be no mechanical solution to the foreign policy quandary; every decision is a deliberate act of will, a reflection of fundamental political preferences. In Bosnia, France and Britain have worked closely together; but Maastricht maximises the procedural obstacles to multilateral co-operation, and in practice the policy of the Community towards ex-Yugoslavia has been catastrophic in its weakness and vacillation. In a sensible world, member states would now conduct a thorough review of the treaty, as drafted, to see if it can be made to work better. So far, there seems to be a serious mis-match between what Maastricht appears to promise, and what the member states are really committed to deliver. Is this mainly the result of British hostility to the whole enterprise? Or is it also the result of ambivalence in other member states? These questions need to be confronted. But it seems the member states find these questions too disagreeable and prefer flight into make-believe. In Lisbon, and again in Edinburgh, they agreed to early membership negotiations with the four applicants from Efta; in Copenhagen this June they brought forward prospects of membership for east European countries, and others. According to one interpretation* the Community is now committed to an enlargement to 20 or 30 members within the next decade or so. Now there may be a politico-moral case, for the Community eventually to take in liberated eastern Europe. But does it make practical sense, on the basis of a treaty of European union which is not workable as written, and which does not appear to reflect a genuine political bargain by the member states? It is hard to imagine a recipe for greater political lunacy. The Community cannot expand from 12 to 25 states without completely changing in character. There are four possibilities: accelerated federalism, with a vast increase in central powers; a multi-speed Europe, with overlapping membership circles; a comprehensive renegotiation of all existing Community policies; or the disintegration of all common policy-making powers. None of these options is discussed; instead, it is assumed that the Community will be the same but much bigger; which is nonsense. First, the Common Agricultural Policy could not be applied in eastern Europe, as it would mean a dizzying explosion both in the Community budget and in farm output. Second, GNP per head in eastern Europe is one-tenth of that in western Europe. A Community with such disparities must mean a Europe which was brutally laissez-faire or one which was both federal and heavily centralised. Existing Community policy should mean a vast expansion in the regional and other structural funds. But the conventional wisdom is that the Europe of nation states could not tolerate even a moderate amount of central budgeting and central authority. The conventional wisdom needs to find an answer to the fact that, even if the east grew by as much as 5 percentage points a year faster than the west, it would still take 48 years to catch up. There are no simple solutions to any of these problems. The only solutions we know will not work, are those which pretend that Maastricht is fine as it stands. If the Community expands to 25 states, it will need considerable political surgery, and perhaps a political civil war. But governments prefer fantasy. *Beyond Maastricht; Recasting the European Political and Economic System, by Peter Ludlow. Centre for European Policy Studies, 33 rue Ducale, Brussels.</p>

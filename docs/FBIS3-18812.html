			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Munich (DPA) -- After the setbacks suffered by the  Christian Social Union [CSU] in a number of local elections in  Bavaria, party leaders have been assessing the election results  of Sunday [6 March] with restraint. "This is neither a  landslide nor a political shift," CSU Chairman Theo Waigel said  on Monday before a meeting of his party's Executive Committee in  Munich. Minister President Edmund Stoiber spoke of a "pretty  middling result." Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen, on the other hand, claimed  that the CSU had suffered a serious defeat: "The voters have  given the CSU strong slaps in the face."    Waigel assessed the average turnout of 60 to 70 percent as  "good to very good." This shows that one cannot speak at all of  the citizens' abstinence at the polls if such efforts are made,  he said. The result of the mayoral elections in Bamberg was  considered to be the biggest surprise of the election, in which  about 400,000 of the approximately 8.6 million people eligible  to vote in the Free State were involved. In Bamberg there will  be a run-off ballot without Rudolf Grafberger, the current mayor  and CSU candidate.    The SPD mayors, on the other hand, held their positions in  the towns of Bayreuth, Hof/Saale, Rothenburg/Tauber, as well as  Aschaffenburg in Franken. In addition to Bamberg, a run-off  election for mayor is necessary in Eichstaett, Freising, and  Landsberg/Lech in Upper Bavaria, as well as in Lindau in Swabia.  The local council elections in the Lower Franken district of  Rhoen-Grabfeld as well as in the Upper Bavarian district of  Ebersberg were won by the CSU.    In Bamberg, the CSU had expected a better result, Waigel  said. The decision will now be made on 20 March between Herbert  Lauer of the Supraparty Association of Voters and Andreas Starke  of the SPD. Waigel called for support for Lauer as the CSU's  originally desired candidate at the run-off ballot. Stoiber  warned against seeing local elections as a barometer of the mood  for Landtag or Bundestag elections. The decisions are too much  related to specific individuals, and party affiliation plays  only a small role.    Verheugen spoke of a "political earthquake." For his party  the "brilliant results" achieved in the towns and communities,  which are worried about jobs, are a confirmation of its policy.  In the view of Bavaria's Greens' leader Gerald Haefner, the CSU  is clearly losing its grass roots. The election result of  Sunday is a "gratifying sign that the CSU's power is no longer  God-given." The good results achieved by his party in several  communities show that many people no longer see ecology and the  economy as contradictions, Haefner stated.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine has deactivated forty-six SS-24 missiles  (removed nuclear warheads from them), Deputy Premier Valeriy  Shmarov, who is responsible for the military-industrial complex,  told Interfax-Ukraine. According to him, in the future  ``Ukraine hopes to get Western aid for the process of  dismantling strategic nuclear missiles deployed on its soil.''    As Shmarov maintains, ``by signing the trilateral statement  concerning nuclear arms Ukraine undertook to dismantle missiles,  and it is fulfilling its pledge without any aid from other  countries.''    He spoke about this with members of the American delegation  visiting Ukraine now, the deputy premier said.    According to him, top priority will be given to removing  from  Ukraine nuclear warheads, whose safety guarantees will soon  expire.    There are 176 strategic nuclear missiles on Ukrainian soil.  Since the Russian, Ukrainian and American Presidents signed  their statement concerning Ukraine's nuclear disarmament forty  nuclear warheads have been removed from Ukraine in exchange for  Russian fuel to be used by Ukraine's nuclear-power plants.</p>

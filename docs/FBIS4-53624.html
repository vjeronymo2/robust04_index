			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First installment of four-part article by Shinobu Takeda of </F> NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN's Industrial News Department: "Centennial  Change in the Construction Industry"]    [Text] In response to the recent bribery scandals involving  the central and local political worlds, as well as every major  general contractor, it has been decided to introduce a general  competitive bidding system for public works to replace the  designated bidding system which had been in practice since the  Meiji era. "Dango" [bid-rigging], a practice of coordinating  the selection of contractors among construction companies, is  going to be abolished. The construction industry, which has  530,000 firms and approximately 6 million directly employed  workers in the country and shares more than 10 percent of  Japan's Gross National Product (GNP), is now entering an  unprecedented turning point in its history: a change in the  100th year.  <H5>  No Longer Involved in Coordinating Contract Winners </H5>   "While we have no intention of stealing a march on other  companies in the dango group, our main office directed us not to  take part in coordinating the winner of a contract." The  remarks of a person who is in charge of public works sales at  Shimizu Corporation this year threw general contractors, who had  been discussing the selection of a contractor for a dam  construction project in the Hokuriku district, into an uproar.  Three leading general contractors, Shimizu Corporation, Taisei  Corporation, and Kajima Corporation, have already said that they  will part with the bid-rigging system. Those companies retired  from the frontline as agents for bid-rigging in the central  construction industry, and the bid-rigging organization there  has dissolved. In spite of all these changes, other contractors  had assumed optimistically that the trend to eliminate  bid-rigging was yet to affect the local construction industries,  and that is why they are shocked.    A medium general contractor which has been selected to be  the  winner for the dam construction project from among the firms in  the dango group says, "We desperately tried to find out  Shimizu's bid price." If Shimizu's bid price, decided  independently by itself, is lower, the company selected in the  bid-rigging will not be able to win the contract. The major  premise of dango is that all the companies that are going to  place a bid participate in it. Besides, the level of bid price  can be very low if Shimizu, the top in the industry in terms of  sales, is going to place a bid by its own criteria.    This medium general contractor bid at the lowest possible  price according to its financial strength and managed to win the  contract. Shimizu's bid price was higher than previously  expected. Although the person in charge of the project at the  company complained, "We could have gained about 100 million yen  more in profit," this is the result of the price competition  between "bid-riggers" and "Shimizu."    In face of the Fair Trade Commission, the construction  industry has kept the practice of bid-rigging by going  underground deeply. A person (deceased) in charge of  bid-rigging at a major general contractor, who was once the  secretary of the central bid-rigging organization, left the job  of finding a place for the dango meetings to his son so as not  to leave any trace. The chairman of the bid-rigging group at  that time was Sukemasa Uera, former adviser of Tobishima  Corporation, and the adviser of the organization was a prominent  figure of a major trading company. Since a room at a hotel or a  Japanese restaurant is not safe enough, a condominium was  purchased under an individual's name, and remodeled so that a  meeting could be held. [The secretary] even sent cooks from his  home to prepare meals for the meeting in order to avoid the use  of delivery services.  <H5>  Other Companies Will Follow Sooner or Later </H5>   But all these efforts may end in vain. Shimizu is certain to  go its own way in bidding on other public works projects, too.  Some companies will follow Shimizu in the future. Bid-rigging,  which was famous for its firm unity, has now begun to rust, even  before the Fair Trade Commission begins to exercise its power.    When the chairman of the central bid rigging organization  changed from Uera to Kajima's Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama,  the construction industry voiced concern if he "is all right."  While bid-rigging had a function to control the selection of  contractors so that contracts will not be monopolized by the  major contractors, the people in the industry suspected that  "Kiyoyama will always choose Kajima to be the winner for a  contract." Leaving the discussion of whether bid-rigging is  socially fair or not, the mechanism of bid-rigging to assure  fairness within the industry was already collapsing during  Kiyoyama's era.    However, bid-rigging is not unique to the construction  industry. The same kind of system exists among architecture  companies. A major designing firm reveals that the "post office  is the point." In bid-rigging, the dango chairman selects a  company for a contract in a way that the awarding of contracts  does not concentrate on a single firm by referring to past  records. Nevertheless, there is even a better trump than the  past records. A company which finds an unpublished project  first has the priority in bid-rigging.    In order to prove the date of discovery, "a post office is  used." The location of the project is marked on a map, then the  map is put in an envelope and sealed. After that, one rushes to  a post office and simply has the envelope postmarked. At a  bid-rigging meeting, the envelope is opened to claim the  company's priority. The designing companies require much more  time to change their consciousness.    Favorable Argument Unjustifiable    The head of a construction company of a South Korean  financial cartel once said, "I envy Japan because bid-rigging is  possible there. Since there is a company to steal a march on  other companies, this practice is difficult in South Korea."  This executive is in favor of bid-rigging for the following  reason. While Western countries urge that "bid-rigging should be  eliminated," their social structure is well prepared. On the  other hand, in the developing Asian countries, the construction  industry, which is responsible for improving infrastructure,  will be impoverished by price competition and will not be able  to accomplish its tasks unless the selection of contractors for  public works projects is controlled by bid-rigging.    Argument for bid-rigging does not hold water in today's  Japan  which has developed economically. But, the thought that  "bid-rigging was necessary during the period when Japan was  developing" still lingers at the hearts of the executives of  Japan's construction industry. At a general meeting of the  construction industry held at the beginning of this year, an  owner-president of a semi-major general contractor blurted out,  "Still, bid-rigging is necessary or we are in trouble."  However, he retracted his words after he was severely scolded  by other participants who said, "what if the Fair Trade  Commission happens to learn your remarks?" The psychology of  people in the industry has not changed since the days Japan was  developing.</p>

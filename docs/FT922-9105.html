			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar stages good recovery THE DOLLAR strengthened against the D-Mark yesterday after better than forecast US employment figures indicated an upturn in the US economy in April, writes James Blitz. The market reacted optimistically to the non-farm payroll figures for April, which showed a rise in employment of 126,000. As a result the dollar ended up over a pfennig against the D-Mark, closing at DM1.6475 after a previous close of DM1.6360. However, analysts thought the jobs figures were not good enough to alter the market belief that the US recovery is still rather dormant. Fears that the US Federal Reserve might cut the Fed funds rate again are certain to resurface next week. 'We can't rule out a further reduction in interest rates, especially if next week's US retail sales figures come in on the weak side,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist of Yamaichi International in London. That indicator, which the markets will watch out for closely on Wednesday, showed only a 0.1 per cent monthly rise in March. Sterling was, once again, among the most actively traded currencies of the day, ending up half a pfennig against the D-Mark at DM2.9450. It is now fifth from bottom of the EMS grid, having overtaken the Italian, French and Danish currencies this week. There were no new factors boosting the British currency yesterday, beyond investor confidence in the one European country certain to have stable government for the next five years. According to Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation in London, the outlook for sterling remains strong, with every possibility that it could soon test DM2.97. 'Sterling has been one of the most volatile currencies this year,' he said, 'with plenty of potential for profit and loss there.' The D-Mark, by contrast, failed to gain from news that the damaging public sector strike in Germany had finally ended, and lost out to most currencies yesterday. The market seemed more concerned that the government had caved in to the trade unions' demands, raising fears of inflation. Like sterling, the French franc continued its week-long assault on the German currency, with the D-mark ending at around FFr3.3630, compared to a previous close of FFr3.3669. Yen trading was, once again, very subdued yesterday. But the currency gave up some of its recent gains after the Japanese Ministry of Finance said it had no plans for injecting a new fiscal stimulus. This has raised fears that the Japanese economy is being subjected to policy overkill, and the yen closed down against the dollar at Y133.35 compared to Y132.70.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / We all need to change: Next year's summit in Copenhagen should define social progress From the peo-ple who gave you Rio 92 (the 'Earth Summit'), stand by for Copenhagen 95: the Social Summit. You remember Rio, I expect. Behind all the razzmatazz there was a fairly simple north-south dialogue. The north was alarmed about the fate of the planet, and had noticed that some of the world's remaining stocks of non-renewable resources, such as rain forest, were concentrated in the south. The south noticed that, for once, it seemed to possess something of interest to the north, and sought to turn that to advantage. Southern leaders suggested, politely or otherwise according to temperament, that if the planet were to be saved its resources should also be more equitably shared. Some also pointed out that the north, by its sheer volume of consumption and production, was doing far more damage to the global environment than the south. It was a frustrating dialogue for both sides. Ecologists and development economists alike felt that the urgency of their concerns had not really been recognised. The sums of money pledged seemed pitifully small in relation to the ambitious targets set, and there was every sign that even those pledges would not be fulfilled. The leaders of northern democracies were not ready to ask their electorates to accept the radical change of life-style that Agenda 21, the action programme endorsed by the Rio summit, implied. Indeed, the powerful and comfortable elites of north and south alike were clearly not about to make such changes in their own life-style. Yet many believe that on balance the exercise was worthwhile. There is now a wider recognition in the north that the threat to the global environment cannot be dealt with unless the conditions of squalor and hopelessness in which more than a quarter of the globe's inhabitants live, without access to clean drinking water or sanitation, are also addressed. There is a corresponding awareness among southern elites that, whoever's fault it is, their peoples will be the first victims of continuing environmental degradation. Policy changes so far may be inadequate, but at least they are mostly in the right direction. So perhaps the 'world summit for social development', to be held next March, is the logical next step. This time it is the south which is bringing its agenda to a northern capital. Interestingly, the moving spirit behind the Copenhagen summit is the UN representative of a star pupil in the class of southern governments applying current northern economic orthodoxy: Ambassador Juan Somavia of Chile. Even the Chilean government, it seems, has decided that Chicago School economics are not enough. Chile has put itself at the head of a movement of southern states seeking to remind the north that the UN was never meant to be only a world police force. It also aimed, in the words of the preamble to its charter, 'to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom', and 'to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples'. A 'new world order' confined to issues of peacekeeping and peace enforcement would mean little to the billion-plus people who live in poverty, 'without jobs, without basic necessities, without hope'*. It would also be unsustainable in the long run, even if the world's leading military powers were willing to devote their forces to it, which they are not. A world where the top 20 per cent of the population receives 83 per cent of the income, while the bottom 20 gets only 1.5 per cent, and the gap appears to be still widening, is hardly likely to be a peaceful world. Yet no one imagines the social summit will be the occasion for a crude redistribution of global income. No doubt industrialised countries will yet once more pledge their best efforts to reach the target of spending 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product on development aid. But no one will believe them, at a time when even Sweden is slashing its aid budget; and few people any longer believe that if the target were reached it would make a great difference to so-called 'developing countries'. Some of these countries really are developing, which means they are generating resources and providing opportunities for investment. Many are not, including at the moment almost all African countries. The degree of success does not correlate with the amount of concessionary finance a country receives. If anything, it correlates inversely. So what will the summit discuss? All the nostra of the age, from debt relief to labour market flexibility. The latest draft of its declaration contains no less than 84 'commitments' in eight pages, with no hierarchy of priorities among them, and therefore zero credibility. What should it discuss? The issue which Rio opened up, but certainly did not resolve: what does 'social development' actually mean? It cannot be equated with economic progress, if that means helping the south to 'develop' in the way the north has developed. Apart from the fact that that would destroy many traditional cultures, reducing the richness and diversity of our species, it would clearly be ecologically unsustainable. This planet will not support 12bn or even 8bn people living the way we in the north do now. All of us are going to have to change our way of life, our aspirations and above all our appetites. *From the leaflet Why a Social Summit?, UN Department of Public Information</p>

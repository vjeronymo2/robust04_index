			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] On 26 January, the municipal government held a  meeting on urban collective economic work. The meeting  profoundly implemented the guidelines of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Second Plenary  Session of the Sixth Municipal Party Committee and arranged for  the urban collective economic work for this year in line with  the demands set by the municipal economic work conference.    Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, made  an important speech at the meeting. Vice Mayor Zhang Haosheng  made a work report.    Gao Dezhan pointed out in his speech: We should further  enhance our ideological understanding and strengthen the sense  of urgency and the sense of responsibility for accelerating the  development of the collective sector of the economy. Going all  out to develop an urban collective economy constitutes not only  an important move to accelerate China's economic development,  but also plays a positive role in promoting the development of  the socialist market economy. Since the third plenary session of  the 11th CPC Central Committee, particularly over the past  several years, Tianjin's collective economy has developed  greatly, and the economic strength of districts and  neighborhoods has been enhanced. Practice shows that urban  collective economy has already become an important component  part of Tianjin's national economy. It should be noted,  however, that the development of Tianjin's urban collective  economy is not good enough. We should keep sober-minded,  further enhance our sense of urgency and our sense of  responsibility, pioneer new ideological trains, and adopt  energetic measures and every possible means to create a new  situation in urban collective economy. We should fully  understand the importance of accelerating urban collective  economy under the new situation. First, urban collective  economy constitutes the major force of Tianjin's national  economy, plays an irreplaceable role in invigorating the economy  and accelerating the development, and has already become one of  the new important economic growth points of the municipality.  Second, accelerating the development of the urban collective  economy is conducive to improving the living standards of urban  residents. Third, accelerating the development of the urban  collective economy may greatly increase the financial revenues  of districts and neighborhoods.    Gao Dezhan said: This year is critical to accelerating the  reform, opening up, and modernization drive of the municipality.  As a new important growth point to accelerate the municipal  economic development, the urban collective economy must develop  rapidly. In the course of efficiently running state-owned  enterprises, we should allow the people to freely develop  township enterprises, foreign- invested enterprises of the three  types, urban collective economy, individual economy, and private  economy, and should allow the simultaneous development of these  enterprises and these sectors of the economy. In developing  urban collective economy, we must further emancipate our mind,  open up our train of thought, and go all out to accelerate the  pace of development. Those that have a good market and  efficiency may develop actively.    Gao Dezhan stressed: We must foster the idea of depending on  reform to accelerate development in order to expedite  development with reform. The general guiding ideology for the  reform of collective enterprises is to emancipate the mind in a  way more vigorous than that of state-owned enterprises and to  carry out reform in an even more flexible and energetic manner.  The reform programs of collective enterprises may include  diverse forms based on free choice in line with their respective  conditions, such as the shareholding cooperative system, the  system of being owned by the state but run by the people, the  system of being owned publicly but run privately, partnership  management, management on a leasing basis, and management on a  contract basis. Enterprises should adopt what most conforms to  the conditions of enterprises; what is most conducive to  liberating productive forces, to increasing the accumulation of  the state, to increasing the momentum for development of  enterprises, and to improving the living standards of workers  and staff. Enterprises should continue to increase the income  of workers and staff members on the premise of developing  production, improving management, and increasing economic  returns.    Gao Dezhan stressed in conclusion: We should actually  strengthen leadership over the work concerning urban collective  economy, list the work as an important item on the daily agenda,  and conscientiously study how to solve the problems in reform  and development. The government should actually transform  functions and further lift restrictions on collective  enterprises in an effort to administer enterprises as little as  possible and do as many tangible things as possible for  enterprises. All the districts, bureaus, and units that  undertake the function of managing the urban collective economy  should exert great efforts and adopt bold measures to accelerate  the development of the collective economy. The urban collective  economic office under the municipal government should strengthen  guidance, coordination, and service to the development of the  collective economy in order to create favorable conditions for  developing this economy. Tianjin has a great potential and  bright prospects in developing the urban collective economy.  Thus, Tianjin should make great efforts to overcome  difficulties with a view to developing the urban collective  economy in an even better and faster way and making new  contributions to invigorating the economy.    Vice Mayor Zhang Haosheng summarized, in his speech, the  municipality's urban collective economic work in 1993 and made  arrangements for this year's work. [passage omitted]</p>

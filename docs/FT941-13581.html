			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Observer: Front stalling What will the Maxwell pensioners think of the latest wheeze dreamed up by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm whose partners are administrators to Maxwell Communication Corporation? Plans are afoot to invite all the members of the Maxwell creditors' committee for a good night out to see  - Maxwell: the Musical Revue. Mark Homan, PW's head of insolvency, insists that were such an event to take place, it would be paid for from the firm's marketing budget, and not from the professional fees charged on the insolvency. Of course, though, given the total bill from accountants, lawyers and bankers is likely to run to more than Pounds 60m, they could probably buy the theatre.</p>

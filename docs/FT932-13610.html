			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Underlying improvement lifts Whirlpool to Dollars 58m WHIRLPOOL, the world's biggest maker of large home appliances, yesterday reported an underlying improvement in first-quarter profits, at Dollars 58m, up from Dollars 35m in the same period of 1992. However, two charges meant that the bottom-line figure for the Michigan-based group showed a Dollars 162m loss after tax in the most recent three months. One of these was a Dollars 180m item, related to accounting rule changes; the second was a Dollars 40m charge to adjust the value of certain accounts held by Whirlpool Financial Corporation. Whirlpool had warned the stock market of the Dollars 40m item. Whirlpool's first-quarter sales rose by 5 per cent to Dollars 1.81bn, and Mr David Whitwam, chairman, described operating performance as 'excellent'. The company said shipments in the North American market outpaced the industry average of about 3 per cent, and operating profits grew even more substantially. In Europe, shipments rose only slightly, but margins increased. In Latin America and Asia, there was a 'marked' advance in both shipments and revenues. The Brazilian affiliates also swung into profit, having suffered losses a year ago.</p>

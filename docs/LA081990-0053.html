			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY BEDEVILS TEACHING OF HISTORY IN BRITAIN  </P> <P> British students learn all about Florence Nightingale, the heroic nurse of the  Crimean battlefields, but what of Mary Seacole, a Jamaican nurse who served  with equal devotion in the same war?  </P> <P> Therein lies the heart of an intellectual wrangle over how history should be  taught in British schools.  </P> <P> One side says Britain's own history comes first. The other believes that, in  what has become an ethnically diverse country, one child's footnote is  another's historical landmark.  </P> <P> Most students know about Cecil Rhodes, the Victorian empire builder who dreamed  of a Cape-to-Cairo railroad. But how many have heard of King William Dappa  Pepple Bonny V of Nigeria, who was exiled with his wife Annie from their realm  and lived in London in the 19th Century?  </P> <P> British children learn about Anglo-Saxon settlers, but the contribution of  Jewish settlers in the Middle Ages is often overlooked.  </P> <P> Debate centers on a national "core" curriculum mandated by the Education Reform  Bill of 1988 in history as well as English, math and science-technology. The  reform limits local choices, but does not do away with them.  </P> <P> The curriculum recommended by a history study group "is the only one that has  generated the heat," Rozina Visram, a former teacher, said in an interview.  </P> <P> "Academics from high and mighty universities have thrown their hats into the  ring. No other document has been given such a long consultation."  </P> <P> Those who approach history as a force in molding national pride and identity  view the curriculum reform as a means of regaining the ground that has been  slipping away since the liberal 1960s.  </P> <P> They want a return to teaching Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's "great  landmarks of British history": the life of King Henry VIII, Nelson's victory at  Trafalgar, the Battle of Waterloo, the Battle of Britain.  </P> <P> Opponents contend that minority history must be included in a country whose  ethnic minorities now total 2.6 million people.  </P> <P> Children of the inner cities will not "switch on to an all-white male  experience," said Sylvia Collicott, a senior lecturer at the North London  Polytechnic.  </P> <P> "In the classroom, you can't tell kids what to do; they won't do that anymore.  They expect to be engaged. They won't sit there and take that."  </P> <P> Local schools have adapted to the cultural changes. In Bradford, where 53 of  the 231 schools have non-white majorities, students learn a little of  everything.  </P> <P> Tonnie Ecker's children attend Birkby School in Kirkliees, suburban Bradford,  where "just about every ethnic festival is celebrated."  </P> <P> "It's wonderful," she said. "They come back and tell you the stories about  various gods and all that. Sometimes their hands are covered for three days  with mehandi patterns," butterfly or flower designs painted in a reddish dye.  </P> <P> The reform does not prohibit local diversity and ethnic celebrations, but  critics say it makes so many detailed prescriptions of what should be in the  curriculum that it leaves no room for ethnic studies.  </P> <P> Robert Skidelsky, a historian at Warwick University, said history trains people  for citizenship, "and it touches many raw nerves."  </P> <P> So vehemently have academics disagreed that some fear the government will  abandon the history reforms..  </P> <P> Skidelsky got into the debate when his son took a test that instructed him to  "imagine that you are a Palestinian gunman attacking the Israeli Olympic team  in Munich."  </P> <P> The question was part of the empathy theory of teaching history, which asks  students to imagine themselves as players on the historical stage.  </P> <P> "There were too many theories floating around," Skidelsky said in an interview.  "Pupils were becoming guinea pigs."  </P> <P> Michael Barber, education policy director for the National Union of Teachers,  feels the curriculum is too detailed.  </P> <P> "What we need at the national level is an interstate highway map of the  country, as opposed to a map of all the local state roads and foot paths," said  Barber, a former high school history teacher.  </P> <P> For instance, the history working group says students aged 7 to 11 should study  invaders and settlers; the Romans, Anglo-Saxons and Vikings in Britain; life in  Tudor and Stuart times; Victorian Britain; ancient Egypt and Greece, and  exploration from 1450 to 1550.  </P> <P> Each topic is divided into four areas: political; economic,  technological-scientific; social-religious and cultural-aesthetic.  </P> <P> "There are hundreds and hundreds of detailed prescriptions," said Ted Wragg,  director of Exeter University's school of education.  </P> <P> He finds the proposals arbitrary. As an example, he said, students aged 14 to  16 studying modern American history would be required to learn about President  Franklin D. Roosevelt and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., but President John F.  Kennedy and the civil rights movement would be optional.  </P> <P> Detractors, including the teachers' union, say less than the recommended 50% of  class time should be devoted to British history.  </P> <P> Thatcher supports a heavy emphasis on British history and told the House of  Commons concentrating on the names of England's kings and queens, statesmen and  battles is "absolutely right."  </P> <P> Skidelsky feels the proposed curriculum benefits the majority: "Some areas have  got to adopt entirely unconventional methods, but most people in Britain are  part of the great middle class bulge and go to a very standard school."  </P> <P> Although the opposition Labor Party accused Thatcher of seeking to indoctrinate  children with her own view of history, Skidelsky doesn't believe politics is  involved.  </P> <P> "The government has felt a responsibility to increase its involvement because  of testing which shows British school children are behind those in other  countries," he said.  </P></p>

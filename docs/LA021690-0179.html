			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: TRUMP CARD: WILLING TO PAY FOR A QUICK END  </P> <P> Can it be that the Ivana and Donald Trump "Split by Media" is winding down? I  hope so. Newsday reported Thursday that Donald has now decided to give Ivana a  $100-million settlement, obviating the controversial pre-and-mid-marriage  agreement for $25 million and the Connecticut house.  </P> <P> I don't know if this decision just sprang from Donald's good heart, or because  Ivana's attorney, Michael Kennedy, now has the 400-man, Old Guard and  distinguished New York law firm of White &amp; Case assisting him.  </P> <P> But one wag, speaking of the Mike Kennedy-John Scanlon media blitz in Ivana's  favor, joked, "If these guys had been handling the Vietnam war, it would have  ended in three days!"  </P> <P> HERE'S WHAT I hear -- Donald is talking money now for a fast and quick end to  all of this and he is talking much more money than even the aforesaid $100  million. The sum is said to be "considerably larger."  </P> <P> Well, think about it before you faint. Trump's empire is said to be worth  nearly 2 billion bucks. And he can't have relished, the past few days, looking  like a piker trying to chisel the mother of his three children and his wife of  a dozen years down to a mere $25 million plus.  </P> <P> SINCE TRUMP is about to have the largest gambling casino in the world, already  owns the Palm Beach showplace Mar-a-Lago, and is building the biggest yacht,  etc., maybe Donald has decided he'd also like to have the ex-wife with the  biggest divorce settlement.  </P> <P> And when a man's own mother and his two wonderful sisters turn out to support  his estranged spouse (as Donald's family did on Wednesday), it might make a man  think twice.  </P> <P> One big influence could be the person Donald respects most in all the world.  His father, Fred Trump, is beside himself over this entire affair. Trump the  elder is devoted to Ivana and his three grandchildren. He supposedly has told  Donald: "If you don't stop what you are doing, it's going to give me a stroke!"  Fred Trump is a formidable figure, even to the son who has outstripped his  father's own empire-building.  </P> <P> ONE THING you should know is that the Trumps are still talking to one another.  Although Ivana was absolutely devastated Thursday by stories that had Donald  attending the Marble Collegiate Church with Marla Maples, reconciliation IS  possible. And it seems to be what Ivana really wants. If these two could come  back together and forgive the hurts and embark on a new course of fidelity to  one another, then this is what their friends (maybe even their enemies) wish  for them. Donald did dine several times this past week in the Trump Tower  apartment with his wife and three children.  </P> <P> And, hey, let's be careful out there, as they say on "Hill Street Blues." So  far neither Trump has filed ANY divorce papers. Why, Ivana and Donald are not  even "legally separated."  </P></p>

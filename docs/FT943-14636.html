			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Looking for common ground on EU farm policy - Deborah Hargreaves finds a wide divergence of opinion among growers in different member countries There is little common ground between a British farmer who wants to see an end to most agricultural subsidies and a French producer whose Pounds 34,000 profits last year were almost wholly derived from European Union coffers. The spread of opinion among EU farmers was highlighted at a recent open day organised by Ciba Agriculture, the agro-chemicals company, to discuss Common Agricultural Policy reforms. Last year, Ciba set up a group of producers from five different EU countries to meet annually for the next five years to discuss their different approaches to CAP reform. Already it is becoming clear that the farmers are altering the way they plan their businesses to fit in with the new regime and the coming General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal. Uppermost in their minds is the need to cut costs and diversify as well as manage their set-aside land. Mr Richard Beldam, the British member of the group, was the only farmer to come out wholeheartedly in favour of abandoning subsidies. But that could have been because he runs one of the most profitable and lowest cost farms. His net margin on 1,423 hectares in Gloucestershire this year is projected at Pounds 491 a hectare. This compares with Mr Jim McCarthy, a producer on 405 hectares in Ireland, where poor weather conditions and high costs are keeping his net margin at Pounds 150 a hectare this year. Mr McCarthy, from County Kildare, has been the most immediately affected by changes to the CAP. The owner of the farm he managed decided to retire from farming by taking up an offer from the Irish government of a pension for former producers and Mr McCarthy has now set himself up as a self-employed farmer leasing 200 hectares from his previous employer and 200 hectares from nine other landowners. By renting more land, he has expanded the size of his farm from 294 hectares; but he has had to increase his debts to do so. He is conscious of the need to continue subsidies, particularly for smaller producers. 'We've got a lot of small farmers,' he points out, 'and if you stopped subsidies there would be a lot of hurt and the countryside would be derelict'. The reduction in aid payments has led some of the farmers to set up ancillary businesses on their land as a way of increasing profits. Mr McCarthy is stepping up his sales of straw, which he has traditionally supplied to nearby racing stables - he is now delivering straw to local mushroom growers. Mr Beldam also plans to make more of his straw. He has joined a group of producers and Southern Electric, the local power utility, in a project to build a 20MW straw-burning power plant near his farm. He has also increased the capacity of his grain-driers so that he can dry crops under contract to other producers. He has contacted Cargill, the agri-business company, in the hope of growing oilseed rape on his land for the company's planned biodiesel production plant. Mr Francis Ringo with a 150-hectare farm 100km from Calais in northern France, already grows crops for biofuels on his entire portion of set-aside land. He plants rape for di-ester (a petrol additive) and wheat and sugar beet for ethanol. The market for biofuels has become well established in France on the back of government subsidies. Mr Ringo has tried this year to reduce his costs by reining in his use of agro-chemicals and fertilisers. This cutback has enabled him to trim his input costs from the equivalent of Pounds 319 a hectare last year to Pounds 187 this year. 'In the past, we were influenced by the drive for intensive cultivation, but we were using too many inputs - since we cut them our yields have not changed,' said Mr Ringo. Almost all of the farmers in the group were looking to cut down on their use of expensive chemicals and fertilisers. Mr Reinhard Funk, a producer on 120 hectares in Germany between Stuttgart and Lake Konstanz, can claim an additional DM200 (Pounds 83) a hectare payment from the Baden Wurttemburg state government if he does not spray his wheat with a regulator to restrict growth and stop it being knocked over by rain. Mr Funk is facing a dilemma common to many of Germany's producers as he believes his farm will not afford him a full-time living over the long term. He is planning to set himself up as an agricultural surveyor providing services for his neighbours as a way of supplementing his income. Almost half of Germany's 650,000 producers are now part-time farmers with average holdings of 20 hectares. But in the former East Germany, farms are huge and producers' views diverge widely from their western German counterparts. Mr Udo Bohme manages a 5,300-hectare holding near Leipzig. He has 150 workers on the farm and spends DM2m a year on machinery. As well as wheat, barley, rye and maize, Mr Bohme has 2,500 dairy cattle, and 5,000 pigs. Even with a holding of this size Mr Bohme has been cutting costs and increasing his farmed area. He has reduced the number of workers from 230 in 1992 and added another 400 hectares - leased from 400 separate landowners. Mr Ted Kallehave who farms near Copenhagen in Denmark, has added 300 hectares to his existing 500 hectares. He has also tried to grow as wide a spread of crops as possible so as to reduce the farm's dependence on any single crop. In addition, he has rented out some of his land for hunting and grows Christmas trees on 182 hectares. A common theme among the farmers was the need to diversify and get bigger. Mr Beldam who farms most of his land on a profit-sharing basis with landowners, hopes to expand his business to 3,000 hectares in the next two years and eventually would like to manage 10,000 hectares. Mr Beldam favours a rapid cut-off in agricultural aid combined with some social support to eliminate the worst problems. 'I think most of us would survive in Europe - the free market would tell us what to grow,' he said.</p>

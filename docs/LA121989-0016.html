			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAINTS KNOCK OFF EAGLES, 30-20;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: PHILADELPHIA FAILS IN QUEST TO WRAP UP NFC EAST TITLE BY LOSING  FOUR-HOUR GAME.  </P> <P> Bill Parcells, coach of the New York Giants, had his "Who Dat" face on Monday  night rooting for the New Orleans Saints.  </P> <P> Now that they've beaten the Philadelphia Eagles and put New York within a game  of the NFC East title, he might send a few "Who Dat" thank you cards to John  Fourcade, Eric Martin, Frank Warren and the rest of the Saints.  </P> <P> Despite being out of the playoffs for the first time in two years, the Saints  (8-7) beat Philadelphia, 30-20, keeping the Eagles from clinching a playoff  spot by knocking them a game behind the Giants.  </P> <P> Fourcade threw for three touchdown passes, two to Martin, and Warren had three  sacks, one of them on Randall Cunningham in the end zone for a safety. Fourcade  completed 18 of 35 passes for 236 yards and Martin had nine catches for 120  yards.  </P> <P> Philadelphia (10-5) can still clinch a wild-card spot by beating Phoenix at  home next weekend, but the Eagles will need help from the Raiders, who play the  Giants, to win the division title. If the Eagles and Giants finish with the  same record, the Eagles win the division by virtue of beating the Giants twice  this season.  </P> <P> There were several ironies in this Monday night game that lasted almost four  hours.  </P> <P> For one, the Saints beat the Eagles at their own game, forcing four turnovers  and converting three into touchdowns. Philadelphia entered the game leading the  NFL with a plus-24 turnover ratio, 13 better than any other team.  </P> <P> "We just kept the pressure on them," linebacker Vaughn Johnson said.  </P> <P> A blocked field goal with 3:02 to play iced it for New Orleans.  </P> <P> For another, the man who helped the Giants, Fourcade, was once cut by New York.  </P> <P> "I've had a headache for two hours," Fourcade said after a game in which he was  sacked five times by the Eagles.  </P> <P> Two fumbles by Philadelphia led to two early touchdown passes of 13 yards to  Eric Martin and 35 to Dalton Hilliard that gave the Saints an early 14-0 lead.  </P> <P> The Eagles scored 10 points in the third quarter to take a 20-16 lead, but  Fourcade hit Martin for a 20-yard TD early in the fourth quarter for a 23-20  advantage.  </P> <P> Then Dave Waymer intercepted Cunningham to start a 58-yard drive, capped by  Buford Jordan's one-yard run with 6:12 left that all but clinched it.  </P> <P> Philadelphia's turnovers started early.  </P> <P> The first came when Rickey Jackson stripped the ball from Cunningham and Robert  Massie recovered at the Philadelphia 35. Four plays later, Fourcade drilled the  ball over the middle to Martin, who made a leaping catch at the two and fell  over the goal line.  </P> <P> Three minutes later, Milton Mack stripped Keith Byars of the ball and Gene  Atkins recovered at the 38. This time it took only two plays as Fourcade rolled  right and found Hilliard, who caught the ball at the 15 and rambled in to make  it 14-0 just 10 seconds into the second period.  </P> <P> Philadelphia took just five plays to come back, the big one a 60-yard pass play  from Cunningham to Byars that carried to the New Orleans 13. On the next play,  Cunningham, who finished completed 19 of 34 passes for 306 yards and ran for 83  yards, hit Johnson in the right corner of the end zone to cut the deficit in  half just 2:46 into the second quarter.  </P> <P> The Eagles cut it to 14-10 on Roger Ruzek's 21-yard field goal with 8:20 left  in the half. Anthony Edwards made a fair catch of a punt on his own four with  33 seconds left in the half, and it cost Philadelphia when Warren burst threw  and dumped Cunningham in the end zone.  </P> <P> Edwards redeemed himself early in the third quarter, catching a 66-yard bomb  from Cunningham on a third-and-24 play that carried to the New Orleans one. Two  plays later, Cunningham hit David Little at the back of the end zone for a  touchdown that made it 17-16.  </P> <P> Ruzek's 19-yard field goal with 16 seconds left in the period made it 20-16.  </P></p>

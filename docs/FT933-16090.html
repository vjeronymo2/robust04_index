			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / BBC structure is endorsed by public A LARGE majority of respondents to the government debate on the future of the BBC want the corporation to continue broadcasting a wide range of programmes and to be funded by licence fee. The large measure of support for the survival of something similar to the existing BBC structure, with the same number of radio and television channels, came in replies to a government consultation exercise. An analysis of the 6,210 letters on the subject received from the public by independent consultants Research International Media and Advertising was published yesterday by Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary. The consultants say they do not believe the results are misleading because they conform to an established finding from other studies 'that the BBC is widely held to be a special case, it is not just another broadcaster.' Sixty one per cent wanted the BBC to continue broadcasting a wide range of programmes compared with only 9 per cent who did not. Sixty six per cent of the letters supported the licence fee compared with only 7 per cent opting for advertising. Nearly 30 per cent, however, said they wanted the BBC to become more efficient and manage its money better.</p>

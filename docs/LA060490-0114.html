			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE SYMPHONY CLOSES ITS SEASON  </P> <P> Maybe it was the heat. Perhaps it was the hall.  </P> <P> Whatever the cause, the Garden Grove Symphony spent the first half of its  season finale Saturday making music in a decidedly inconsistent manner. Guest  conductor Philippe Bender, director of the Orchestre Regional de  Cannes-Provence, did a great deal more than just beat time and oversee  orchestral traffic, yet memorable results of a positive nature were a long time  in coming.  </P> <P> Billed "A French Gala," the proceedings opened with Berlioz's Overture to  "Benvenuto Cellini." Bender mustered a mighty sound, impressive if one could  overlook its blaring and diffused quality. The quieter moments fared no better,  rife with ragged entrances and questionable intonation.  </P> <P> The normally suitable Don Wash Auditorium revealed its true place in the scheme  of things as a high-school facility first, symphony hall a distant second. More  than adequate on previous occasions, it proved barely able to support an  ensemble of Berliozian girth. In roaring fortissimos, several hardy string  players appeared ready to spill right over the edge of the stage.  </P> <P> Of course the piano didn't help the space problem, but they had to have it for  Ravel's Piano Concerto in G. Or did they? As matters turned out, this usually  scintillating masterpiece had (on the whole) all the musical personality of a  fallen souffle.  </P> <P> Pianist Deborah Kiszely displayed occasional glimpses of substantial talent,  particularly when unfettered by the orchestra in the extended solo opening the  second movement. But the first movement transpired in slow motion, the  rhapsodic central passages reduced to a virtual standstill. Even generous doses  of sass and insouciance, however, would not have obviated careless orchestral  transitions and phrasing.  </P> <P> So just when one began to dread sitting through a potentially deadly reading of  Franck's Symphony in D-minor, a minor miracle occurred. Bender showed that his  podium skills not only look right, but can produce music that sounds right. And  the Garden Grove Symphony reminded us that at its best it is far more than just  another little orchestra south of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The warhorse had sweep and power to be sure, but subtlety of dynamic shading  was in welcome abundance as well. Bender persuasively delineated both inner and  overall structures, culminating in climaxes of inevitability, rather than  predictability. The push-button standing ovation was a little slow in coming,  but the crowd eventually staggered to its collective feet.  </P> <P> Maybe it was the heat.  </P></p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Sexual harassment reported BRITISH women face sexual harassment in most workplaces and all sectors of employment, according to IRS, a independent employment research group. More than half the 132 employers in the survey published today in IRS Employment Trends journal said complaints of sexual harassment had been made at their workplaces, with 46 per cent saying cases had been reported during the past year. Almost nine out of 10 harassment complaints are upheld after internal investigations. Proven harassers can face dismissal, according to almost half of employers, while 57 per cent said they issued formal warnings or took disciplinary action. Only one employer said sexual harassment was not a disciplinary offence, although one in 10 said that the position was 'not clear'. Almost four employers in five said sexual harassment was a 'fairly important problem' compared with 15 per cent who said it was a 'major problem'. Three per cent said they did not see it as a problem. The survey shows that awareness of the issue is growing in the private sector, where one in five employers have policy statements. Half of public-sector employers said they had policy statements on sexual harassment. Sexual Harassment at the Workplace, by Janet Egan. IRS Employment Trends 513.

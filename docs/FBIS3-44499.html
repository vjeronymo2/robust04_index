Zhu Wanli, president of the People's Bank of China Guangdong  Branch said as the vanguard of the country's economic reform,  the province is eager to see more foreign banks set up branches  or offices next year.    He disclosed that Guangdong is planning to open 10 more  foreign bank branches this year, increasing the number in the  province to 49.    "Guangdong's booming economy preferential policies and its  proximity to Hong Kong and Macao are luring a great number of  foreign banks to test the business opportunities here," he said.    The province welcomes enquiries from all kinds of foreign  banks, he added.    "But we are pretty careful in selecting banks," he said.    So far, 77 foreign banks have set up branches or offices in  the province, 39 of which have business functions.    Shenzhen has 24 foreign bank branches,--the most in the  province--while Guangzhou has seven. The other two are in  Shantou and Zhuhai special economic zones.    Hong Kong East Asia Bank has reaped about HK$500,000  ($64,000) in profits after one year of operations in Guangzhou.    "Guangdong hopes the central government will allow other  cities to open foreign bank branches next year," Zhu said.    On financial market reform, Zhu said the province will  continue to develop fledgling markets, including those involving  securities, foreign exchange and futures.    The establishment of a gold market on a trial basis is in  the  making and we hope to open the market this year, he said.    Foreign insurance companies are being encouraged to set up  co- operative shareholding insurance companies, he said.    According to officials from the Guangzhou government, the  capital city will set up stock branches at the Shenzhen and  Shanghai securities exchanges this year.    Zhu said despite the central government's credit-tightening  policy introduced last June, Guangdong financial organizations  provided 6 billion yuan ($1 billion) more in loans in the  January- to November period last year compared with the same  period in 1992.    The amount of money put into circulation in 1993 almost  doubled over 1992.    "We cut loans on badly-performing enterprises, but for ones  that performed well, credit and loans kept coming, Zhu explained.    He attributed the growth in money circulation last year to  the improvement in the province's production output, which rose  20 percent over 1992.    As for banking reform, Zhu said his Guangdong branch will  help strengthen the role of the People's Bank of China as the  country's central bank.    Following the lead of the draft Banking Law, the province  will turn its four specialized banks into commercial banks.</p>

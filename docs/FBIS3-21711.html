			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Drug trafficking has several faces. One of them is  what has been occurring in Chapare: clashes between Rural Mobile  Patrol Unit agents and coca growers. Foreign Minister Antonio  Aranibar has pointed out that Law 1008 is being strictly  complied with, and that the clashes that have been taking place  in Chapare are essentially a result of the fact that new coca  plantations have been found.    [Begin Aranibar recording] This conflictive situation in the  Chapare region is a result of the national government's  decision, which has been channeled through the appropriate  Ministry of Government organizations and the National  Secretariat for Social Defense, to comply with Law 1008 with  regard to illegal coca growing in the Chapare region. Coca has  recently been planted in the region, and this violates Law 1008  and harms the international commitments made by Bolivia. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The Central Bank of Costa Rica has  issued a report saying that for the past three years Costa Rica  has been one the of the "Latin American countries with the  greatest increases in the price of its foreign debt on the  international market." In 1990, the face value of the country's  foreign debt was 30 percent; in 1993 it surpassed 82 percent.  Between 1991 and 1993 Costa Rica paid $1.525 billion in  principal and interest on its foreign debt, thereby lowering the  burden of its foreign debt. Central Bank President Jorge  Corrales believes this is the result of appropriate  macroeconomic policies. (San Jose LA NACION in Spanish 1 Feb 94  p 24A)</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Arts: Dizzy Gillespie - Obituary Flamboyant, often exotic in appearance, the curious up-bent horn propelled by extraordinary ballooning cheeks, Dizzy Gillespie, who died on Wednesday, has long been one of the most instantly recognisable figures in modern jazz. As the inventor of a whole new style of trumpet playing and, in partnership with alto saxophonist Charlie Parker, the creator of a new and difficult language in jazz, he is one of the music's most important and influential figures. Born John Birks Gillespie in Cheraw, South Carolina, on October 21 1917, he first picked up the trombone at age of 12 and moved to the trumpet a year later. His musician father had died when he was 10 and the young Gillespie followed precocious self-tuition with study at the Laurinburg Institute in North Carolina. A keen follower of big band trumpeter Roy Eldridge, he took his hero's place in Teddy Hill's band in 1937, visiting Europe and recording for the first time. In 1939 he joined the Cab Calloway Orchestra as a featured soloist and what started as a clash of personalities with the leader ended as a fight and the prankster Gillespie being sacked from the band. During his time as an arranger for the big bands of Woody Herman and Jimmy Dorsey that followed, Gillespie began to hang out in New York's 52nd Street clubs, and Minton's in particular. Here he met Charlie Parker, a more chaotic but equally incandescent talent, and the seeds for the vital new music were sown. Parker and Gillespie became friends and between them, leading sextets and quintets, they introduced the new, seething sound that was bebop to astonished audiences across the US. Where Parker was the unpredictable cauldron of ideas, rarely off the boil, Gillespie's perfect phrasing and clowning approach lent modern jazz accessibility and acceptability. Where Parker was the shooting star, burning bright in small groups and leaving imitators to hang on his tail, Gillespie sought to shed light on the possibilities in the new music for both peers and rivals. A match for Parker's boundless creativity and technical skill in improvisation, Gillespie's soloing was marked by flawless phrasing at impossibly high speed and register. He could hit the ear hard where it was least expected, and yet maintain an insidious swing. Gillespie's development as a musician was complete by the end of the Forties and compositions such as 'Night in Tunisia', 'Salt Peanuts' and 'Blue 'n' Boogie' established as swinging anthems of bebop. By the mid-Fifties, when Parker had all but burnt out, Gillespie had become a sort of cultural diplomat and even carried out world tours for the US State Department. Throughout the 1960s and '70s as the jazz (and bop) idiom underwent further change, Gillespie's international stature grew. The essence of his playing remained undiluted by his (pioneering) exploration of Latin rhythms and latterly of fusion, his comic approach sometimes drawing criticism, often attracting new interest in jazz music. A tireless tourist, Gillespie began to reach yet wider audiences in the 1980s as the international festival circuit grew: the virtuoso entertainer with a self-deprecating but impish persona had finally picked up where Louis Armstrong left off - as genial ambassador for an often unapproachable and factionalised branch of contemporary music.</p>

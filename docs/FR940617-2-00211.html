			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Do I mail my pre-application to EPA headquarters or an EPA regional office? Is there a difference between the type of project that is funded by EPA headquarters as opposed to EPA's regional offices? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pre-applications requesting between $25,001 and $250,000 in federal environmental education grant funds must be mailed to EPA headquarters in Washington, DC. Pre-applications requesting $25,000 or less in federal environmental education grant funds must be mailed to the EPA regional office where the project will take place (rather than to the regional office where the applicant is located, if these locations are different). A list of addresses is included at the end of this notice. The EPA headquarters and regional grants will be evaluated using the same criteria as defined in this solicitation. The only difference between grants that are awarded by EPA headquarters and by EPA's regional offices is the size of the grant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Where do I get the information and forms needed to prepare my pre-application? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA strongly encourages applicants to read the solicitation notice carefully. This notice contains all the information and forms necessary to prepare a pre-application. If your project is selected as a finalist after the evaluation process is concluded, EPA will provide you with additional forms that must be completed in order to process your pre-application further. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. How much money can I request and how does the dollar amount requested affect my chance of being funded? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants may request up to the statutory ceiling of $250,000 in environmental education grant funds for any one grant. However, pre-applications which request relatively small amounts of funding have a much better chance of being funded because EPA awards a much greater number of grants at lower funding levels. A significant number of small awards are made because EPA is required, under Section 6(i) of the Act, to award 25% of funds for grants of $5,000 or less. In addition, EPA has chosen to award very few of the largest grants (e.g., those over $100,000) so that we may support a greater number of efforts. Thus, your chance of being funded increases dramatically as the amount of money you request decreases as illustrated below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has awarded grants under the Environmental Education Grants Program in Fiscal Years 1992, 1993, and 1994. Individual awards have ranged from less than $5,000 up to $250,000. During this three year period, EPA has funded only about 10 proposals annually for projects requesting between $25,001 and $250,000; only 1 proposal each year has been funded at or near the $250,000 level. By contrast, EPA has funded about 30 proposals annually for projects requesting between $5,001 and $25,000. Furthermore, EPA has funded about 200 proposals annually for projects requesting $5,000 or less. EPA has received between 1,500 and 3,000 pre-applications each year. To increase your chance of obtaining funding in FY 1995, EPA strongly encourages applicants to request regional grants of $5,000 or less. If larger sums are needed, EPA strongly encourages applicants to request a headquarters grant closer to $25,000 rather than the maximum of $250,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section II. Laws and Regulations Governing Grants Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Under what authority has this grants program been established and what laws and regulations do I need to follow in applying for a grant? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 16, 1990, the President signed the National Environmental Education Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;619) into law. Section 6 of the Act requires that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administer an environmental education grants program to support projects that design, demonstrate, or disseminate practices, methods, or techniques related to environmental education. The Act also requires that EPA establish a program which includes a process for soliciting, selecting, supervising, evaluating results, and disseminating information on the effectiveness of projects funded under this program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA published the Environmental Education Grant Program Regulations in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on March 9, 1992 which provides additional information on how EPA is administering this program (57 FR 8390; Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 47 (40 CFR part 47). In addition to the requirements of the Act and part 47, recipients of section 6 grants must comply with EPA's general assistance regulations at 40 CFR part 31 for states, local governments, and Indian tribes and Part 30 for all others. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. How much money has Congress appropriated for this grants program? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act requires that 38% of the total funds Congress appropriates in a given fiscal year under the National Environmental Education Act be awarded as grants under the section 6 environmental education grants program. Based on this percentage, EPA has awarded approximately $8.1 million in grants under section 6 of the Act over the past three years (approximately $2.5 in Fiscal Year 1992, $2.7 in Fiscal Year 1993, and $2.9 in Fiscal Year 1994). EPA will award grants in Fiscal Year 1995 subject to the amount of funds appropriated by Congress. EPA may use up to 15% of these funds to support environmental education projects which meet the requirements under section 6, but are outside of the competitive process established under the solicitation notice. If funds are used in this manner, EPA will publish a separate solicitation notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to cover the award of these funds. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

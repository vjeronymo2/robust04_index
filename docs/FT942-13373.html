			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Whitehall waste over consultancy projects attacked: Report identifies just Pounds 10m savings from Pounds 500m outlay The government is spending more than Pounds 500m a year on outside consultants with little effort to track expenditure or assess value for money, according to an unpublished Whitehall report. The report, by the Cabinet Office efficiency unit, says departments and agencies can identify just Pounds 10m in savings a year by bringing in external consultants to improve civil service management. The saving is less than 2 per cent of current expenditure. The Pounds 78m spent on using civil servants to provide similar advice on efficiency, however, yielded identifiable savings of Pounds 18m, 23 per cent of the cost. There is little evidence of clear policies or strategies for the use of consultants, says the efficiency unit. Too often, they are involved in significant projects because it is felt some ministers will not be persuaded by advice from civil servants alone. 'There needs to be a report from consultants, preferably one of the large consultancy firms, to give proposals credibility,' the report says. The decision to commission consultants is sometimes taken at a junior level. Little attempt is made to find out whether other departments have done similar work that could be used instead. Contracts are often unnecessarily complex with adversarial contract terms and conditions that vary widely for no apparent reason. Project management is described as 'patchy'. Managers change frequently, leaving the consultant as 'the only person with any real continuity'. The report was drawn up by civil servants from five Whitehall departments, led by Mr Richard Harrison, an assistant secretary at the Employment Department. Their recommendations are being considered by Sir Peter Levene, the prime minister's adviser on efficiency. Among the proposals are more sharing of information on consultancy across Whitehall to avoid duplication. The report recommends that civil servants should adopt the best practice of the private sector, including working more closely with consultants to get the best from them. Managers should be expected to see projects through to completion to encourage accountability. It also calls for improved tracking of expenditure on consultancy and its benefits. Mr Keith Burgess, managing partner of Andersen Consulting and president of the Management Consultancies Association, welcomed the recommendations. 'Consultants have a body of knowledge and a pool of experience essential for improving clients' performance,' he said. 'The management drive to follow through on their advice is often missing in the public sector.' The report contains the first accurate estimate of the total bill for external consultancy in the civil service. For 1992-93, this was Pounds 565m, including Pounds 275m on consultancy to help implement programmes such as overseas development and defence. Information technology consultancy cost Pounds 160m, while most of the remaining Pounds 130m was spent on traditional management consultancy. The total covers more than 6,800 projects involving over 1,700 consultancies. About 18 per cent of the business went to large management consultancy firms such as Andersen, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and PA. Editorial Comment Page 21</p>

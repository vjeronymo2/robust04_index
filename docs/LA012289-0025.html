			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMING SOON : IN THE BEGINNING ;  </P> <P> ' ANOTHER THING I ENJOY ABOUT TV IS THE OPPORTUNITY IT AFFORDS ME TO TRAVEL AND  MEET THE PEOPLE. '  </P> <P> BY TICHI WILKERSON AND MARCIA BORIE  </P> <P> From "Hollywood Legends," by Tichi Wilkerson and Marcia Borie, recently  published by Tale Weaver Publishing. In November, 1955, Ronald Reagan -- then  host of "General Electric Theatre" -- wrote the following for the Hollywood  Reporter.  </P> <P> I HAVE FOR THE past months been combining television and motion picture chores.  This manifold job has taught me one thing for sure: Never again will I allow  myself to get into a position where I must make a choice between a seat in  Congress and a position in the arms of my leading lady.  </P> <P> The actor's first duty is to his profession. Hence, you can rest assured that I  will never again run for mayor or anything but head man in my own household.  You may remember a few seasons back when I was honorary mayor of Thousand Oaks  and also a candidate for mayor of Hollywood. It was then that someone  approached me with the suggestion that I run for Congress.  </P> <P> I realized then that I was becoming a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I selected the  Jekyll character -- an actor. This presented a chance to appear in RKO's  "Cattle Queen of Montana." All this plus my regular weekly stint on the  "General Electric Theatre." Now I am getting the biggest chance of my career.  My bosses have permitted me to produce "Seeds of Hate" for their series.  </P> <P> Another thing I enjoy about TV is the opportunity it affords me to get away  from Hollywood, travel around the country and meet the people. I now make  coast-to-coast (trips) for my sponsor. In this manner I can keep in constant  touch with the public and better understand their moods, their likes and  dislikes.  </P> <P>  Copyright 1988 by Tichi Wilkerson and Marcia Borie.  </P> <P> </P></p>

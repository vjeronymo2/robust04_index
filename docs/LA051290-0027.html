			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILLS COLLEGE STUDENTS PROTEST DECISION TO ADMIT MEN IN 1991  </P> <P> Although I am slightly Victorian in my dealings with women, I am certainly no  chauvinist. I see nothing wrong with opening a door, helping a lady on with her  coat, etc.  </P> <P> I do not disagree with the Equal Rights Amendment women have been pursuing for  the past however many years.  </P> <P> Are they entitled to a double standard? Is anyone? I think not -- and that is  why I was so appalled by Carol Tavris' position in "Boys Trample Girls' Turf"  (Commentary, May 7).  </P> <P> How dare she (and the protesting females at Mills College) take up arms against  admitting men to the school in an era when the world is moving inexorably  towards the equality women have sought and deserve.  </P> <P> I graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School in its last year of being an  all-male engineering facility and was most disappointed that after four  grueling years of studying college-level aeronautical engineering, that I had  just missed the opportunity to have interacted with female students in my  socially formative teen-age years.  </P> <P> In conclusion, it seems wholly appropriate that Ms. Tavris would base her  tenuous position on convoluted research that was conducted on and relates to  girls between the ages of 3 and 5 years -- not on mature, rational college-age  women whose voices are surely being drowned out by arrogant feminists who are  clearly embracing a double standard on this non-issue.  </P> <P> RAND RUBIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Ljubljana DELO in Slovene in its 2 April  edition on pages 1 and 2 carries a roundup report about the  results of an opinion poll about the impeachment of the former  Defense Minister Janez Jansa and the political events  surrounding this affair. The poll was carried out over  telephone by DELO's Stik research group on 31 March and 1 April.  As it is reported, out of 1,000 randomly chosen telephone  subscribers from all over Slovenia, 789 took part in the poll.  The report consists of 6 graphs and an accompanying explanatory  text.    The first graph shows replies to the question: "Which of the  present parliamentary parties would you vote for if the  elections were tomorrow?"    The party that won the most votes is the Liberal Democracy  of  Slovenia (LDS) with 19.3 percent, followed by the Social  Democratic Party of Slovenia (SDSS) with 10.3 percent, the  Slovene Peoples' Party (SLS) with 7.5 percent, the Slovene  Christian Democrats (SKD) with 7.2 percent, the United List of  Social Democrats (ZLSD) with 4.7 percent, the Democratic Party  with 1.5 percent, the Slovene National Party with 0.8 percent,  the Greens of Slovenia with 0.8 percent, and an independent  group of deputies of the Slovene National Party with 0.1 percent  of votes. Of the pollees, 29.3 percent replied with "I do not  know," 9.6 percent would vote for none of these parties, while  8.9 percent would not take part in the voting at all.    The second graph on page 1 shows the opinions as to whether  the State Chamber did the right thing in impeaching former  defense minister Janez Jansa. To this question 37.1 percent  replied affirmatively, 41.9 percent negatively, while 21 percent  did not know.    As DELO writes "despite considerable dissatisfaction with  the  parliamentary decision regarding Janez Jansa, the pollees mostly  (54 percent) expect that Jelko Kacin will be a good defense  minister." As it is written further "a good half of the pollees  is also of the opinion that the departure of Janez Jansa from  the post of the defense minister cannot influence adversely the  Slovene defense situation and its independence. A little over  30 percent fear that this could happen."    "However," paper continues, "a staggering 74.4 percent of  DELO's pollees believe that the demands of the demonstrators and  the State Chamber deputies that the President of the State Milan  Kucan accounts for some of his statements and also for his  possible involvement in the Smolnikar affair, are perfectly  legitimate." As a graph on the page 2 illustrates, 12.8 percent  disagreed, while 12.8. percent were undecided on this question.    "Regardless of this," DELO writes on, "more than a half  believe that after the Monday events the Smolnikar affair will  never be thoroughly investigated."    According to the paper, more than a half (56 percent) find  the demands for early elections "nonsensical" while 30 percent  approve.    Regarding the demand of some parties that the United List  leaves the coalition, 38.3 percent replied negatively, 24.1  percent positively, and 37.6 percent were undecided on the  matter.    "Because the three men -- Kucan, Drnovsek, and Jansa -- in a  way symbolize three rival or at least different political  orientations, DELO's pollees could also answer to the question  of which of the political orientations they supported the most,"  paper says. As an accompanying graph on page 2 shows, Jansa's  political orientation won the most votes -- 27.5. percent --  followed by that of Janez Drnovsek with 24.1 percent, and Milan  Kucan with 17.5 percent: 14.4 percent were undecided while 16.5  percent said that they do not support any of the above three.    A separate analysis on page 2 by Aleksander Bratina, which  examines correlation between the education of pollees and their  choices, shows that "in terms of sex, age, and place of  residence (we have classified the pollees according to whether  they live in a bigger town, smaller town, or a village, although  there is also a possibility of regional classification, which we  leave to the marketing experts) there are no significant  differences in support for the above three political  orientations." As Bratina writes, "there is an important  difference only in terms of education. Jansa is favored by  those with completed primary and secondary education and a  little less by those with higher education. The opposite is the  case with Janez Drnovsek, who is supported by the voters with  higher education. The support for Kucan is the same as the  support for Janez Jansa; however, the latter is currently  leading."</p>

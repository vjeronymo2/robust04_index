			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Amicable in European link with J Rothschild Scottish Amicable, one of the UK's largest mutual life offices, is to set up an international life company to provide financial services in Europe, in a deal which sees its relationship with J Rothschild Assurance becoming even closer. Scottish Amicable European will be based in Dublin, and will take on the existing 60 staff, premises and business assets of J Rothschild International Assurance. JRIA will in effect, start again, under Mr David Beynon, who will build up a new marketing team. Mr Beynon is a former colleague of Sir Mark Weinberg, now JRA chairman, at Allied Dunbar, who joined the J Rothschild Group late last year. The administration and some product development for JRIA will be carried out by Scottish Amicable European, in an arrangement that mirrors the relationship between Scottish Amicable and JRA in the UK. J Rothschild Assurance Holdings will have a 10 per cent stake in Scottish Amicable International Holdings, Scottish Amicable will have an 80 per cent stake, and the remaining 10 per cent will be owned by the management and salesforce. Mr Roy Nicolson, ScotAm managing director, said the new venture was intended to become operational in June. Of the total Pounds 28m initial cost ScotAm was investing Pounds 25m in development capital, of which some Pounds 1m-Pounds 2m is going towards start-up costs. In December, ScotAm raised a Pounds 100m 'war chest' for acquisitions and expansion via a bond issue. Sir Mark said the arrangement announced yesterday was 'an opportunity to create two life companies for the price of one'. The two companies would share a computer system but would be able to tailor products to their own markets. Although be in competition, each company will focus on its own area of expertise.</p>

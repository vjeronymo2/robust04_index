			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HERE'S HOW: SHOWER DOOR BETTER THAN A CURTAIN  </P> <P> There are lots of good reasons for replacing a shower curtain with a modern  shower door. A door does a much better job of keeping water inside the tub and  off the bathroom floor. It also does a better job of trapping heat, making for  a warmer, cozier shower.  </P> <P> A door has a neater, crisper look, and it's easier to keep clean and mildew  free. If you like, you can get a shower door with a mirrored panel, a nice  convenience if you like to shave in the shower. And shower doors usually have  long hand rails, just right for hanging your washrag.  </P> <P> Finally, if you're one of those people who can't help but think of Tony Perkins  and butcher knives every time you step into the shower, a sliding door can give  you a greater sense of security.  </P> <P> Shower doors come in two basic types. The kind for stall-type showers swings on  hinges, while doors for tubs usually slide on tracks. I've installed both types  without any problems whatsoever and in both cases, the whole job took about an  hour.  </P> <P> Whichever type you need, you can find it at plumbing supply shops, home centers  and building supply dealers. Before you go shopping, measure the width of the  area the door will fit. Height shouldn't be a factor.  </P> <P> Installing the door won't require much in the way of tools. If your tub or  shower area is tiled, you'll need a carbide-tipped bit to drill holes for the  screws that anchor the side rails in place. If you need to cut the aluminum top  and bottom track, you can use a hacksaw. I cut mine on the radial arm saw,  using a carbide-tipped crosscut blade mounted backward. This makes an  ear-splitting noise, but does a nice, smooth job in a matter of seconds.  </P> <P> Installation techniques vary from one brand to another, but all the instruction  sheets I have ever seen are very clear and complete. A typical sliding door for  a tub-type door will look like the one shown in the sketch. Typical  installation usually goes like this:  </P> <P> Start by cutting the bottom track to length if necessary. Test fit it on the  front edge of the tub, and mark where you want it to go with a crayon. Then lay  a couple beads of silicone bathroom caulk along the underside of the track and  press it into place. If you like, fasten it down with a few strips of heavy  tape to keep it from shifting while you carry on with the rest of the job.  </P> <P> The next step is to mount the side rails. Test fit each of these in place. Make  sure the bottom ends match up with the bottom track, and use a level to make  sure the rails are plumb. Then mark the position of all screw holes with a  pencil or crayon. Take the track down and drill your mounting holes.  </P> <P> If you are fastening to tile, use a carbide bit to drill holes for the plastic  anchors usually supplied with the door. Set the anchors, then place the side  rails and screw them in place. It's not a bad idea to caulk behind the rails.  If you are fastening to fiberglass, skip the anchors. Drill pilot holes for the  mounting screws, using a bit slightly smaller than the diameter of the screws.  Then screw the channels in place.  </P> <P> Now measure for the length of the top track, and saw it to length if necessary.  With most doors, the top track just slips over the side channels and gravity  holds it in place.  </P> <P> Now hang the doors. These may come with their wheels unmounted. If so, put the  wheels on, then install the doors. Some types hang from the top track, others  ride the bottom track.  </P> <P> Hinged doors are just as easy to install. Usually, you screw up side channels  on each side of the opening, then screw the door in place. The door will  probably have a continuous piano-style hinge, and an adjustment that lets you  slide the door left or right to get a good fit.  </P> <P> 1989, Los Angeles Times Syndicate  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NICARAGUA;  </P> <P> ORTEGA SEES A PLOT TO DISCREDIT ELECTION  </P> <P> Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega accused the opposition of plotting to create  a "situation like Panama" by withdrawing from the Feb. 25 national elections.  He said he told Elliot Richardson, a former U.S. attorney general who is  monitoring the campaign and election for the United Nations, that he fears such  a ploy would set the stage for the United States to declare the election  fraudulent and invade the country. Opposition spokesman Danilo Lacayo denied  that the National Opposition Union will withdraw and called Ortega's statement  just another maneuver.  </P></p>

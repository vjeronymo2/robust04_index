			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Russia faces budget hurdle Mr Andrei Vavilov, the Russian temporary acting finance minister, said yesterday that 'we have a lot of work to do with the state duma on the budget' - an admission of the difficulties the finance ministry foresees in getting agreement on a budget which will further squeeze the Russian economy in an effort to bring inflation down. However, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, press secretary to President Boris Yeltsin, said yesterday the failure of a motion of no confidence on Thursday in the lower house would 'ease political tension and avoid a government crisis.' Mr Kostikov said reforms would get tougher - 'it's clear the government won the battle for the budget and in a larger sense for reform'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin will  see doctors in Barcelona during his upcoming visit to Spain next  week, but it is not clear whether the president wants to undergo  a medical check-up or just thank the doctors who had cured him  after an air accident in 1990.    Presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kosikov told reporters on  Friday that Yeltsin will see the doctors who operated on his  back hurt when the plane made an emergency landing.    "I cannot say whether it will be a consultation or a gesture  of gratitude to them", Kostikov said. The doctors had examined  the Russian president in Moscow last September. Kostikov said  that in Barcelona Yeltsin also plans to visit Olympic sites.</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / International Company News: Kone sees improvement for rest of year KONE, the Finnish engineering group, expects profits to improve during the rest of 1992 following a sluggish start to the year, Reuter reports from Helsinki. On sales up from FM2.8bn to FM3.1bn, pre-tax profits for the first four months were little changed at FM78m (Dollars 18m), against FM72m. Operating profits were FM231m, against FM214m. 'The financial result for the remaining eight months of the year is expected to show an improvement over that for the first four months,' the company said. Even so the interim profits exceeded most analysts' expectations. Kone said its annual net sales were expected to grow only at the rate of inflation and remain below FM11bn, compared with FM10.04bn in 1991. Kone said all divisions had improved their results.</p>

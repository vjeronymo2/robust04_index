The constitutional revision starts with  the discussion of and voting on a political agenda which has  previously been negotiated with those political parties that  promoted the constitutional revision, and which includes a  novelty for Brazilian voters: the end of the compulsory vote as  of 1995. This means that in the 1996 municipal elections, each  citizen will decide whether or not to vote.    One of the 15 amendments included in a draft agenda that was  issued yesterday by Deputy Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party -- Rio Grande do Sul State]),  spokesman for the revisionist congress, grants President Itamar  Franco, current state governors, and mayors the chance to run  for other elective posts in the next elections without having to  resign to their current posts by April, as is established in the  law. This amendment will be enforced as of the date of its  publication. The constitutional revision should end by 15  March, a mere 17 days before the deadline to resign from the  posts.    With the new deadline state governors will be able to run  for  the presidency in the next elections, for example, without  having to leave their posts until Octover 1994. Executive  branch officials who hold elective posts will be allowed to seek  reelection for one single term, but this rule will be in force  as of 1 January 1995. Therefore, only those elected in 1996 will  benefit from this new regulation. Jobim also proposes  shortening the presidential term from five to four years.    He says: The idea is to grant more continuity to the  government. As things stand now, one governs for only two years.  During the first two years you learn to govern, while during  the last you campaign for the elections.    The draft agenda also includes issues that will shake up the  lives of legislators. This, according to Jobim, "only shows  that Congress is willing to end its ailments." A legislator  who leaves the party for which he was elected will lose his  mandate, and will not be eligible for election for another two  years. Another case of ineligibility includes dishonest  handling of public affairs and immoral conduct. This will  prevent a person like Paulo Cesar Farias, for example, from  being elected.    The constitutional revision will hit the executive branch  heavily, restricting the possibilities of its submitting  provisional measures. The president will be unable to issue  provisional measures on the budget or electoral rights, for  example.    The 16 Proposals    Vote: An end to compulsory voting as of 1 January 1995. The  spokesman argues that "the Brazilian peopole are mature enough  to be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not to vote."    Reelection: Executive branch officials who hold elective  posts are allowed to seek reelection for one single term, and to  do so while still in office. This amendment will be enforced as  of January 1995.    International rights: It regulates current international  regulations between Brazil and other countries.    Incompatibility: The president, state governors, and mayors  do not need to resign their respective posts to run for other  elective posts. Moreover, their relatives are also eligible to  run. This measure will be enforced as of the date it is  published.    Challenging mandates: There will be a 60 day deadline,  instead of the current 15 day deadline, for submitting a request  to challenge an election after the date it is held.    Ineligibility: Those charged with dishonest handling of  public affairs and immoral conduct are subject to ineligibility.    Termination of term: A legislator who leaves the party for  which he was elected loses his mandate, and is ineligible to run  for another two years.    Presidential term: It will be four instead of five years,  with the possibility of seeking one single reelection.    Congressional immunity: The Federal Supreme Court (STF) may  sue a legislator prior to congressional authorization. The case  will be closed only if there is an absolute congressional  majority vote in favor. Congressional immunity will encompass  the opinions, words, and voting of legislators, and is extended  to common crimes.    Provisional measures: The issuance of provisional measures  is prohibited, and Congress has a 60 day deadline to review it  instead of the 30 days it now has. It can only be used in  urgent cases. It cannot be used for issues pertaining to  complementary laws or for issues of the exclusive competence of  Congress or those regarding nationality, citizenship, political  or electoral rights, or the budget.    Military recruitment: It will continue to be compulsory. A  military man with over 10 years of service may run for an  elective post without having to join a political party. He only  needs to be nominated by the party.    Establishment of states: The discussion starts in the local  state legislative assembly, which immediately summons a  plebiscite. Only then does the national Congress manifest itself.    Establishment of municipalities: Will be established in  keeping with the population and minimum public income before the  holding of a plebiscite.    Religious worship: The current text is maintained.    Maternity leave: The text establishes that pregnant  legislators are entitled to maternity leave.    Nationality: It establishes that foreigners' offspring born  in Brazil are considered Brazilian citizens. It also  establishes that Brazilian citizens who work abroad and who are  forced to adopt the nationality of their host country continue  to be Brazilian citizens.</p>

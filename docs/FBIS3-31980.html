Petro  and his group not only could not get in but confirmed that the  foreigners completely control the area.    Only four of the group of 84 were allowed into the site and  observe everything related to the presence of U.S. troops  stationed at Malaga Bay. The group, People's Observers, headed  by Petro, rapidly walked around the area and confirmed that  Colombian authorities do not control the U.S. troops. The  Marines control everything.    [Begin Petro recording] The Colombian High Command does not  control the U.S. weapons, which are locked in an 80 cubic meter  green trailer. We also found that the Colombian military does  not control the information dispatched from the site, which  presently is being sent via microwave, but which later will be  dispatched through a satellite whose ground station is being  built. [end recording]    Petro said it is impossible for the People's Observers to  operate. Not only was he not permitted to film the  installations, but an accompanying photographer was ordered to  stay out of the area, although he held a card authorizing entry.</p>

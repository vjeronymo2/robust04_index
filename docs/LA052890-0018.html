			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> IT'S SECURITY  </P> <P> I had been renting a two-bedroom, subsidized apartment for $330 a month. The  house initially cost $49,000, but with the $10,000 subsidy, I got it for  $39,000 with a $5,000 downpayment I scraped together from my savings and from  loans from my family.  </P> <P> Everybody chipped in and helped.  </P> <P> I would never have been able to own a house at that time without the Nehemiah  grant. I am a single parent. I was making about $23,000 (annually) at the time.  I had looked into home ownership but there was no way with my salary and the  large down payments.  </P> <P> Having the house has meant security. It's affordable and it's a nice  surrounding. Where I lived before wasn't nice in terms of crime and dark  stairwells. It's made life much better when you are trying to raise sons in the  big city with drugs and crime and all those things. Life is much better. The  streets are nice. It's an area where people care about their houses and that  makes it a better environment.  </P></p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Cookery: Cheat's roast A BACHELOR friend told me recently that, when asked to dine in someone else's house, he always hoped to be served roast meat. The reason was that a roast is not something lone householders usually cook for themselves. Doing so smacks of extravagance and self-indulgence. There is also the matter of leftovers. Even half a leg of lamb or a small chicken can mean days of repetitive cold meat meals, or having to devise palatable ways to re-hash the remains. The recipe which follows is a compromise solution. It is not, strictly speaking, a roast: it is a grill. But it offers many of the appealing features of a roast without the disadvantages. It is quick to cook; easy to carve into thick, neat slices (no awkward bones to frighten those inexperienced with a carving knife); and just the right size to provide two meals for one person (or one meal if you invite a friend). The cut I have used is known variously as neck or neck fillet of lamb, which is the piece of meat that runs alongside the bones of the middle neck and scrag end. It is lean, juicy and flavoursome. I have teamed the lamb here with aubergine, a well-known partnership in Mediterranean cooking. To make full use of the heat of the grill - which is needed for cooking the lamb - the aubergine also is grilled (rather than fried, the more usual practice). Grilling means the aubergine absorbs relatively little fat. It also means less washing up - just one pan instead of two. The other short cut I suggest is omitting to salt the aubergine before cooking. Salting might be a tablet stone of culinary tradition  - something put down to the fact that aubergines contain bitter juices  - but, in this recipe at least, the results are every bit as good without salt. SIZZLED LAMB WITH AUBERGINE &amp; HERBS (serves 2) Ingredients:  3/4 lb neck fillet of lamb; 1 aubergine weighing about 9 oz; a few sprigs each of thyme (preferably lemon thyme) and oregano; a little lemon juice and a little extra virgin olive oil. Method: Marinate the lamb for several hours or overnight in a generous tablespoon of lemon juice mixed with a scant tablespoon of olive oil, a good grinding of black pepper, and an aromatic scattering of chopped fresh herbs. Turn the meat once or twice so the flavourings penetrate it evenly. When ready to cook, cut the aubergine into slices one-third to half an inch thick. Brush them lightly with olive oil and lay them on the grid of a grill pan round the lamb. Pour the marinade over the meat and cook under a thoroughly pre-heated grill for 6-7 minutes, depending on the thickness of the lamb. Turn the meat and vegetables and grill for a further 6 minutes until the aubergine is hot, tender and gilded, and the meat is well-crusted and brown without and juicily pink within. Let the lamb rest for 5 minutes before cutting it across into thick slices for serving. Spinach steamed until wilted goes well with this. So does basmati rice cooked in light stock with thyme and bay, and enriched with the meat juices.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Geevor to bid for shut British Coal pits after rights issue GEEVOR, Britain's oldest UK mining company, is being brought back from the brink of death by Mr Malcolm Edwards, former commercial director of British Coal, in a move which provides hope of re-employment for hundreds of miners made redundant in the government's pit closures programme. Mr Edwards plans to become chairman of Geevor following a financial restructuring. This will involve a rights issue, the acquisition of a Welsh pit formerly mined by British Coal and the conversion of Geevor's debt into equity. Geevor will acquire one of Mr Edward's private businesses, Coal Investments, which has made bids to take over five pits closed by British Coal - Betws in Wales, Trentham in Staffordshire, Markham Main and Rossington in Yorkshire and Coventry. Although there is no prospect of Geevor re-employing anything like the numbers made redundant at the mines last year and this, it may be able to provide work for several hundred. Mr Edwards said yesterday that if any of his bids for the bigger mines was successful, he would hope to produce around 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes a year from each, compared with potential capacity of more than 1m tonnes. Holders of Geevor's equity and debt have given broad support to the proposals, according to Mr Christopher Stainforth, an executive at merchant bank Guinness Mahon, which is advising Mr Edwards. Geevor shares have been suspended for 18 months but should resume trading in mid-October. Details of the deal are likely to be announced next week. Geevor has been struggling for survival since it withdrew from Cornish tin mining in 1990. Mr Edwards plans to drop the Geevor name and replace it with that of Coal Investments. The restructuring involves Geevor buying a small, privately mined pit in Cwmguili, Wales. There will also be a rights issue to raise Pounds 1.75m, to help develop both Cwmguili and any mines whose licence Geevor acquires. However, if it is successful with more than one British Coal bid, it is likely to return to the market for additional funds. Following the rights issue, Geevor will be capitalised at about Pounds 3.5m. Mr Edwards will own about 3 per cent. Background, Page 23</p>

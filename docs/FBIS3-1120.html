The constitution provides for a republic and  citizenship for "members of the volk" [people].    Non-citizens' rights would be afforded protection by the law  between nations (volkereg). There would be a bill of rights and  responsibilities for citizens and non-citizens.    The AVF said it would release next week the results of a  survey it had conducted among landowners on inclusion in the  volkstaat as well its claims on land it wanted included in its  republic.    The AVF said it would support any lawful claim on territory  and that it would respect the wishes of landowners who wanted  their land to be under "volkstaat" jurisdiction. It said it  would back its land claims with all means at its disposal.    The AVF said its republic would be Christian and would have  English and Afrikaans as official languages. It would be  governed by an assembly elected directly by constituencies at  five-year intervals. There would be a state president and an  executive council.    The assembly would ratify the constitution by a two-thirds  majority while a 51 per cent majority could force a referendum.    Representatives who acted contrary to their mandates could  be  disqualified. The "volkstaat" economy would be run on free  market principles.    More details of the constitution would be released soon, Dr  Hartzenberg said.</p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Observer: Unofficial line Michael Heseltine is not the first president of Britain's Board of Trade to find that the resources to hand will not stretch to sustain an insufficiently economic coal industry. His predecessor, the Earl of Dalhousie, was in a comparable pickle soon after leaving the presidency in 1847 to become governor general of India. Aiming to improve transportation there, he set about developing the East Indian Railway. But he was saddled by the London-based Indian Board of Control with a specification and budget to lay down 92 miles of double track, which would have been 30 miles too short to reach the Raneegunge coalfield. 'I regard the proposal as totally useless,' Dalhousie wrote. 'The government might as well construct a railway from the jail to the general hospital.' Whereupon he ignored the official policy, built a single-track line that served the coalfield, and both worked prosperously for a good while thereafter.</p>

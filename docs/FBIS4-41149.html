			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 22 TASS--Russia's minimum monthly wage  will rise to 20,500 roubles (about ten USD) from 14,620 roubles.  The corresponding law, taking to effect from July 1, was  adopted today by the State Duma (lower house) of the Russian  parliament.    The new minimum wage in the state-run sector will be  provided  by corresponding budget sources, whereas all other companies and  agencies should ensure it from their own sources, the law stated.    Labour Minister Gennadiy Melikyan, speaking before the Duma,  noted that only 3.5 per cent of Russians live off the minimum  wage. According to the minister, the survival minimum (what the  West calls poverty line--TASS) for Russia amounts now to 72  thousand roubles.    The new law is to be submitted for approval to the  Federation  Council (upper house) of the Russian parliament.</p>

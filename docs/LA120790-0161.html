Final  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> ANTI-AIDS DRUG TO BE TESTED  </P> <P> Scientists at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Connecticut, a major  drug firm, have developed an experimental drug that prevents the AIDS virus  from reproducing, it was disclosed today.  </P> <P> The firm plans to begin clinical trials on the product early next year. The  compound drug, known as BI-RG-587, has fewer side effects than AIDS drugs now  on the market, according to an article in Science magazine.  </P> <P> "It's a very specific drug which seems to be a positive. It doesn't have the  impact on other cells in the body. It doesn't deteriorate bone marrow or other  cells," Pat Morrow, a public relations official at Boehringer, told Reuters.  </P></p>

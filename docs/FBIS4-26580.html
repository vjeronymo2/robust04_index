			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 21 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- While  gradually removing price controls where appropriate over the  next few years, China will continue to exercise direct state  control over the prices of five types of commodities and  services.    The five types of commodities and services are:    Less competitive commodities that have a great bearing on  social stability and on the long-term development of the  national economy, such as crude oil, natural gas, and a few rare  metals;    Commodities whose prices are strictly controlled by the  government including some medicines and weapons;    Living quarters offered to civil servants and low-income  earners;    Utilities where competition is inappropriate, such as public  transport, urban water and gas supplies, electricity for general  and production purposes, rail passenger and freight transport,  the mail service, and telecommunications;    Major facilities and services such as various types of  social  public insurance, public education, and health care.</p>

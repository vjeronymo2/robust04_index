			<p>BFN     [Text] Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader and Home Affairs  Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi said his party is still committed  to international mediation regarding federalism and the Zulu  monarchy. He said this at a function organized by the Inkatha  Youth Brigade at Undini during the party's Natal victory  celebrations. The occasion was also used to honor his  leadership.    He commended President Nelson Mandela and Vice-President  F.W.  de Klerk for their views regarding the Zulu monarch,  particularly in the period before the election. Dr. Buthelezi  emotionally thanked Natal voters for their support. He praised  officials of the KwaZulu administration for their loyalty when  there was talk of overthrowing the government. He said the  struggle for freedom and federalism had just begun, and that the  IFP would take the lead in this struggle. Dr. Buthelezi asked  his supporters, for the sake of the region's future, to make  peace with their opponents. He said economic investments can  only be expected in provinces where there is peace and political  stability.</p>

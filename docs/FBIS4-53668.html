			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>   [Text] Washington, May 21 KYODO -- Japan and the United  States held a third day of trade talks Saturday [21 May] as  officials raced to find a mutually acceptable formula to  increase market penetration in Japan for several U.S.-interested  industry sectors.    "Both sides felt that it would be important to meet this  afternoon to further clarify and address the issues on the  table," said a spokeswoman for U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor.    At stake is the prospect of the so-called "framework" trade  talks, which ruptured in February and have since badly soured  bilateral trade relations.    Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. President Bill  Clinton have said they are eager to find a common "basis" for  resuming the framework talks when they meet at the Group of  Seven summit in Naples in early July.    But the prospects of an early agreement remained elusive  after three days of on-and-off negotiations.    When the officials emerged from another hourlong  face-to-face  encounter Saturday afternoon, they refused to say whether there  was progress in their latest round of talks.    "I can only say the talks are ongoing," said Japan's Deputy  Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi.    Japanese officials said the two sides will meet again  Monday.    Saturday's session was a surprise.    Both the Japanese embassy and Kantor's office told reporters  earlier Saturday that the two sides have called off the day's  session.    "The Americans later called us up and told us they need  certain clarifications," a Japanese official said later in  explaining why the two sides decided to hold a meeting Saturday.    While both Japanese and U.S. officials have declined to  comment on what transpired across the negotiating table, Kantor  underscored the importance Washington attaches to this week's  talks by personally participating in part of the negotiations  between sub- cabinet officials.    The trade talks, which are closely watched on financial  markets as a barometer in the state of relationship between the  world's two largest economies, broke down at the Feb. 11 meeting  in Washington between Clinton and then Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa.    One major sticking point in the framework talks -- and the  primary cause for the three-month deadlock in the negotiations  -- is the idea of setting "objective criteria" to measure  imports to Japan.    In what is known as a "results-oriented" approach, the U.S.  has insisted on using "numerical indicators" to ensure that a  trade agreement with Japan translates into increased foreign  sales in the Japanese market.    Tokyo has vehemently objected to the idea, saying it amounts  to government-managed trade.    Among the industry sectors covered under the framework  accord  concluded last July are Japanese Government procurement for  medical and telecommunications products, trade in autos and auto  parts, and Japanese insurance market.    The U.S. wants Japan to open its market wider in these  "priority" market areas and stimulate domestic demands in order  to reduce its vast and growing trade surplus.    The U.S.-Japan trade imbalance was underscored by fresh U.S.  Government data Thursday that showed the U.S. trade deficit with  Japan jumped 25 percent in March to 5.8 billion dollars.    The U.S. trade gap with Japan came to 15 billion dollars in  the first three months this year, well ahead of the comparable  period last year which stood at 13.3 billion dollars.</p>

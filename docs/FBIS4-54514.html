			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Nada Al Issa from Zagreb] </F>   [Excerpts] The founding assembly of the Croatian  Independent Democrats [HND] was held in Zagreb today. The party  was founded by Stjepan Mesic and Josip Manolic. [passage omitted]    Before the founding assembly, Mesic and Manolic sent an open  letter to Croatian President Franjo Tudjman which was,  surprisingly, published in Croatian newspapers. In the letter,  Mesic and Manolic present their opinion about President Tudjman  and his policy, and that opinion is the worst possible. Mesic  and Manolic write: Mr. President, you rule as a dictator,  leading the country to a catastrophe. After our warnings you  call us putschists.    Let me remind you that the Hungarian Democratic Community  [HDZ] accused Mesic and Manolic of preparing a coup while  President Tudjman was in Washington. In their letter, Mesic and  Manolic respond: We do not want to bring down the state but, Mr.  President, we are against your disastrous policy both in Bosnia  and in Croatia. According to Mesic and Manolic, all decisions in  Croatia are made by one man and consequently the state president  has to answer the following questions: Who is responsible for  the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly the war with the  Muslims? Who sent the Croatian army to Bosnia only to deny its  presence there? Its involvement in Bosnia has been confirmed by  numerous coffins returning to Croatia, Mesic and Manolic say.

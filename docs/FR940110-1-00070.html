			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.13 of the proposed rule provides that at the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of initial disbursement of a subsidized advance or a direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidy by a Bank for an approved AHP application, the Bank shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verify in writing that the project complies with all applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements contained in proposed &sect;960.9 and all obligations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed to in the approved AHP application. The Bank shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verify the amount of subsidy being provided in connection with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application and being charged against the AHP fund. The Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall include in its AHP implementation plan its verification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for such purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Monitoring Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.14 of the proposed rule sets forth the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for monitoring AHP-assisted housing projects. Section 960.14 is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to implement the statutory requirement of section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10(j)(9)(C) of the Act, which provides that the Board's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations shall ensure that advances made under the AHP be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only to assist projects for which adequate long-term monitoring is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(C).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board's existing AHP regulation provides that each Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must monitor housing projects funded through its AHP. See 12 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 960.7(b). Section 960.14(a) of the proposed rule carries forward  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this requirement, and &sect;960.14(e) through (h) of the proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sets forth the specific monitoring requirements for the Banks,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are discussed further below. Section 960.14(b) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule provides that each Bank shall include in its AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation plan an explanation of how it intends to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring requirements of &sect;960.14 of the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under &sect;960.14(c) of the proposed rule, a Bank may contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with an applicant, a state housing finance agency, or another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entity to perform the tasks required to carry out the Bank's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring responsibilities; however, the Bank remains ultimately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for meeting the monitoring requirements set forth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.14 (e) through (h) of the proposed rule. Thus, a Bank may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decide in its monitoring plan that applicants will have no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-term monitoring responsibilities. Alternatively, the Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may decide to require applicants to perform long-term monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a condition of approval of an AHP award, or the Bank may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine what entity has the responsibility for monitoring on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project-by-project basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicant Monitoring of Construction or Rehabilitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.14(d) of the proposed rule adds a new requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that if a subsidized advance or direct subsidy is used to finance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction or rehabilitation of a project, the Bank shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require the applicant to monitor the construction or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitation until completion, and to make progress reports to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Bank. Where an applicant finances construction or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitation, the applicant usually monitors the progress of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project in connection with approving disbursements of funds to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower. Therefore, the Board believes that where an applicant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uses a subsidized advance or direct subsidy to make loans for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction or rehabilitation of an AHP-assisted project, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant is in the best position to monitor the progress of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction or rehabilitation and to make progress reports to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Bank Monitoring Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.14 (e) through (h) of the proposed rule sets forth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the specific aspects of an AHP project that a Bank is required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitor. Section 960.14(e) of the proposed rule sets for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring responsibilities that are long-term in nature, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by section 10(j)(9)(C) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1430(j)(9)(C). Section 960.14(f) and (h) of the proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sets forth the short-term monitoring responsibilities for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the special needs and economic mobility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priorities. Section 960.14(g) sets forth the monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities for the District Bank priority or priorities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which may or may not be long-term, depending on the nature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priority selected by the Bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Monitoring of long-term requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.14(e) of the proposed rule sets forth the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for monitoring the long-term requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner-occupied and rental housing projects assisted under the AHP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Owner-occupied housing units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.14(e)(1)(i) of the proposed rule provides that at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time a household enters into a purchase contract for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP-assisted housing unit or by the closing on the financing for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such unit, or at the time a household that already owns the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing unit receives a commitment of a loan or a grant pursuant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the AHP, the Bank or its designee shall obtain a certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the sponsor that the household has an income at or below the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level committed to in the AHP application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

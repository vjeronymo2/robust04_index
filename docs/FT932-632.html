			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / How a simple ruse cost the public purse Pounds 92m: The biggest fraud case to be prosecuted by the tax authorities THE corporation tax fraud carried out by Nissan UK, the highly successful car importer set up by Mr Octav Botnar, was by far the largest ever prosecuted by the Inland Revenue. It lasted some nine years until June 1991, when the Revenue acted on a tip-off and raided the company's Worthing headquarters in West Sussex. By then it had cost the public purse some Pounds 92m in lost corporation tax and interest. Its scale puts it among the largest frauds to take place in the UK. That the fraud lasted so long is explained by its relative simplicity - and its cross-border nature which enabled the scheme to be concealed from tax authorities in Britain and elsewhere. The tax evasion began in 1982 when Nissan UK had transformed the position in the UK car market of the imported Japanese car from standing joke to leading player. Mr Botnar ran his company in notoriously autocratic style, establishing a reputation for the ruthless hiring and firing of executives. Renowned for his aggressive manner, he maintained a low public profile, only displaying his considerable wealth through large charitable donations. Mr Hunt, who had known Mr Botnar since the mid 1960s, served as his loyal number two throughout. An inconspicuous character, Mr Hunt's invested his considerable income from Nissan UK in a widespread portfolio of UK and foreign investments. His only apparent ostentation was a cinema Wurlitzer organ installed in his West Sussex home which, at the press of a button, would rise through the living room floor. Mr Frank Shannon, the finance director who also served on the board of Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club, was number three on the team until he resigned in 1986. The Revenue claimed this trio, who ran the company and owned its entire share capital, were all involved in the fraud with Mr Botnar apparently its prime mover. It was not the first time the revenue had investigated Nissan UK. The company's unusual arrangements for shipping cars from Japan had first provoked the curiousity of tax inspectors in 1984. Explanations given then did not leave them completely convinced, but were enough to prevent further investigations. Second time around, the Revenue was more suspicious that a big fraud had taken place. Further digging led to the decision to mount the largest-ever raid on a company's offices. In a dawn swoop on June 26 1991, 135 revenue investigators and police officers raided 13 locations. They included the offices of some of Nissan UK's financial and legal advisers and the homes of Mr Botnar, Mr Hunt and Mr Shannon. Mr Botnar himself was caught in his dressing gown when a dozen Revenue officers arrived at his house at 7am. He was furious. Having recently lost the franchise with Nissan, he was on the brink of concluding a similar importing deal with another leading motor manufacturer. This never happened. Although it was clear from the outset that the fraud centred on inflated freight charges and was very large, the real scale of it did not become apparent until after the Japanese end had been investigated in November 1991. Only then did it become clear how great was the difference between the charges actually paid by the Japanese and those claimed by Nissan UK. The fraud uncovered by the Revenue was essentially very simple. Nissan Japan's transport division, Nissan Motor Car Carrier (NMCC), had originally provided all aspects of the service to ship the cars to the UK. Nissan UK renegotiated this arrangement, employing intermediary shipping agents. Scansiris, the Norwegian agents run by Mr Tore Thorsen, another alleged conspirator, were used after 1982 to submit sham invoices for services which had, in reality, continued to be provided by NMCC. In this way Nissan UK could artificially boost its freight charges declared to the Revenue by some 40 per cent, thus avoiding substantial sums in corporation tax. Scansiris would invoice Nissan UK for the inflated freight charges, aided by Mr Frederick Pannosch, an Austrian rail consultant, who, in a bogus arrangement with the Norwegian company, claimed to have carried out services performed in reality by NMCC. Nissan UK would pay Scansiris the inflated rates. The Norwegian company then paid NMCC the genuine rates and the surplus was routed into Mr Pannosch's account at BFG bank in Basle. However, Mr Pannosch had no control over this account. Exactly what happened to the money after it was deposited in the account remains unknown. The banking arrangements at BFG were carried out by a Mr Kurt Vogelsang who is also named on the indictment as a co-conspirator - a charge he dismisses as 'ridiculous'. Mr Pannosch proved a valuable source of information, handing over records which contained considerable detail of the correspondence between himself and Mr Thorsen. His co-operation with the Revenue ensured that, although named as a par-ticipant in the fraud, he was not prosecuted and appeared instead as a central witness for the prosecution. The Revenue's version of the fraud was challenged in court by Mr Hunt's lawyers who, while openly admitting that a fraud had taken place, tried to shift responsibility for it away from Worthing to the Japanese at Nissan's Tokyo headquarters. However, there was no direct evidence to support these claims, the trial judge said. Whatever the success of the investigation, the prosecution suffered a series of setbacks over gaps in extradition arrangements for alleged tax offences. These remain so great that it is virtually impossible to extradite anyone accused of tax offences from even the friendliest of European countries. This has benefited both Mr Botnar and Mr Thorsen. Mr Botnar was in Switzerland at the time of the arrests of Mr Hunt and Mr Shannon. Although a warrant has been issued for his arrest, he has remained out of reach of the British authorities. Mr Thorsen was arrested and was due to stand trial but later simply flew home to Norway. In a letter to the trial judge, headed 'Operation Viking', he announced he was 'tired' of the Revenue's prosecution. 'I have decided not to partake in this case any more,' he said. The trial which ended on Saturday in effect marks the end of the criminal actions over the fraud. However, a series of lengthy civil actions is now set to follow as the Revenue attempts to recover as much of the missing Pounds 92m as possible.</p>

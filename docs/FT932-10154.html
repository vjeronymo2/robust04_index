			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / IG Metall vote on wider strikes IG METALL, Germany's giant engineering union, yesterday started balloting 75,000 metal and electrical employees from Berlin-Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia on whether they want to join 37,000 metal and steel workers who have been on strike for just over a week. The results are expected tomorrow. It will also ask its members in western Germany to demonstrate tomorrow in support of higher wages for their eastern counterparts. The demonstrations, intended to convey a token sense of national solidarity, will take place at lunchtime, not during work hours. Union officials said they would continue the strategy of targeting more enterprises each day as a means of keeping up the pressure on the employers to reinstate a contract signed with the union in March 1991. The contract aimed at equalising west and east German wages by next year, which would have meant a 26 per cent pay increase this year for the metal and electrical sector, and 21 per cent for the ailing eastern German steel industry. The employers cancelled the contract because of the economic deterioration in the two parts of Germany. However, Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical employers' association, was optimistic yesterday that the strike would end 'by the end of this week'. It indicated that both sides were using talks which resume tomorrow in the Saxon capital of Dresden as a negotiating framework through which the strike could end without either side losing too much face. As it stands, IG Metall is prepared to put back the timetable towards income parity, but wants to retain the principle of the original contract, particularly this year's pay rises. IG Metall might also be prepared to forgo special Christmas bonuses and extra pay linked to productivity, in return for a guaranteed increase in the basic wage. That would mean about 18 per cent for the metal and electrical industry in the east.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, May 12 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Foreign Minister  Ali Alatas said Thursday an incident experienced by 41  indonesians on a pilgrimage to a Catholic shrine in Portugal  recently was "a matter of great regret."    "I am just surprised why the local security authorities had  not foreseen the possibility and taken steps to prevent such an  incident," the minister said after arrival at Sukarno-Hatta  airport from a tour of Eastern Europe, Geneva, and South Africa.    "If this is the way Portugal welcomes Indonesians visiting  Portugal under the mutually agreed `confidence-building  measures' (CBM), we would not have so readily agreed to taking  them (the CBM)," he said .    Indonesia and Portugal agreed in New York three years ago  that they would work towards a comprehensive settlement of their  dispute over East Timor by first engaging in so-called  "confidence-building measures" which included promotion of  informal community-to-community contacts between East Timorese  in East Timor and those living in Portugal.    Indonesian ambassador for special tasks Lopez Da Cruz who  led  41 Indonesian pilgrims from East Timor upon arriving at Lisbon  Airport on Tuesday (9/6), had been "attacked" by some  irresponsible Portuguese.    The delegation is in Portugal to make a religious visit to  the holy shrine of Fatimah.    Alatas said that Indonesia had always been supporting  conducive dialogs that would lead to the settlement of the East  Timor issue, among others, by implementing the CBM through  "people-to-people contacts".    He said the Indonesian people and government had warmly  welcomed the visit of 25 East Timorese living in Portugal.    On the result of the tripartite meeting among Indonesia,  Portugal and United Nations [UN] on the East Timor issue held in  Geneva on May 6, Alatas said that the meeting had agreed on  taking "progressive steps".    "We mentioned some programs that we have implemented in line  with the CBM," he said adding that Indonesia also agreed to  additional CBM.    Alatas said that the U.N secretary general welcomed the  London meeting that involved East Timorese figures living abroad  with their counterparts living in Indonesia.    The UN secretary general would like to see Indonesia and  Portugal expand their dialogs by involving more groups that had  so far not yet joined the reconciliation dialogs.    Both foreign ministers agreed to "take note" of the UN  secretary general's wish which means that they "neither support  nor reject the proposal", Alatas said.    He said that Indonesia, in principle, does not reject a  meeting that will involve groups of East Timorese, as long as  the meeting is based on the spirit of reconciliation,  non-political in nature, and formally dialogic between two  communities that have been separated for a much prolonged time.    Alatas said that Indonesia would only use the tripartite  meeting to achieve a political settlement of the East Timor  issue.    A settlement process mediated by the U.N would be the only  formal dialog, he said, adding that the crux of a solution to  the East Timor issue remained to be "in the UN's pocket".    "The U.N still terms East Timor as a non-self governing  territory and Portugal is termed as the administering power, and  therefore we are still being the accused," he added.    People-to-people contact may still continue as the channel,  he said, while rejecting the idea to make it as the first  channel for the two countries to settle the issue.    He said that it was not necessary for both foreign ministers  as well as the secretary general to take part in such a second  channel, adding that any involvement of the three camps will  make the channel become formal.    "Let the process go on naturally, the three camps should  refrain from taking part in it," he added.    He said that the recent tripartite meeting also resulted in  the Portugal foreign minister's readiness to hold talks with  East Timorese that support the integration.    On the other hand, Alatas will also be ready to hold talks  with groups of people that are against the integration.    "Ways and forms of dialogs will be up to both of the foreign  ministers," he said.    Alatas said that he is ready to talk with anti-integration  groups provided that they do not represent any organization or  institution.    The next tripartite meeting will be held sometime in January  next year.    Alatas said that the next tripartite meeting will discuss  the  core of the issue and step up to the exchange of views on the  settlement of the issue.</p>

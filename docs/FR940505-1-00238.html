Nonroad Engine Rebuild Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As with onhighway engines, nonroad engines are used for periods of time greatly exceeding the proposed useful life for nonroad engines (10 years, or 8000 hours, whichever comes first). For this reason, EPA proposes to apply the full rebuild program described for onhighway heavy-duty vehicles (section B.(4) of this appendix) to enhanced nonroad engines. As with onhighway engines, nonroad engines will not be subject to an I/M program and EPA is concerned about the possible adverse effect of engine rebuilding on the emissions from engines certified to the enhanced nonroad engine standards. If these engines are rebuilt improperly, they may have very high emissions which could outweigh many of the emissions benefits of the FIP programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comments on all aspects of this proposal, especially on any aspects of the onhighway heavy-duty engine rebuild program which are inappropriate for nonroad engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Recall Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA proposes to conduct all aspects of the enhanced nonroad engine recall program in the same manner as the enhanced onhighway recall program, as highlighted below. Interested readers should review the light-duty vehicle recall provisions (section A.(5) of this appendix) and the heavy-duty vehicle recall provisions (section B.(6) of this appendix) for additional details regarding this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nonroad engines will be recall tested using certification test procedures and fuels discussed above in section C.(3)(c). As for the other enhanced vehicle programs, EPA proposes to test nonroad engines unless they have been subject to obvious abuse or tampering. If there are particular usage characteristics that could contribute to in-use emissions failures, manufacturers must consider them in the design of their products. For example, nonroad engines are likely to be used in environmental conditions that may include rough terrain, high levels of dust, and exposure to water. EPA would not consider exposure to such conditions grounds for excluding engines from the recall test sample. The Agency believes that addressing these challenges is appropriate and necessary to provide assurance that applicable emissions standards continue to be met in actual use throughout the life of the engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In connection with the engine rebuilding requirements described above, EPA also proposes to conduct recall testing throughout the operating life of engines. EPA believes that this is the most appropriate way to ensure that engines are meeting the enhanced nonroad engine standards in use. For recall testing after the end of the original useful life, EPA will group engines by the certified configuration. Any subsequent recall orders will hold the certifier of that engine configuration responsible for failure to comply with applicable emissions standards. Remedial actions would be solely the responsibility of the certifier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comments on all aspects of the enhanced in-use compliance recall program for nonroad engines, including the recall provisions that have been proposed for onhighway heavy- duty vehicles and light-duty vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Fleet Averaging Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Like the heavy-duty onhighway program, the enhanced in-use compliance program for nonroad equipment will reduce emissions as projected only if new equipment is purchased and old equipment is retired at historical rates. Additionally, the use requirements which apply in the FIP areas must be obeyed to be effective. If old equipment is kept longer than in the past, the emissions reductions could be substantially less. These reductions are critical for achieving attainment; therefore, EPA is proposing fleet average and sticker programs to ensure traditional turnover rates and usage patterns continue. Due to the inherent complexities of such a program, among other things, EPA is also considering and requesting comment on a statewide nonroad program with sales requirements. Details of this alternative program are provided at the end of this fleet averaging section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Just as with heavy-duty onhighway engines, EPA is proposing to ensure that turnover is maintained by implementing a declining fleet average NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions program. Under the proposed fleet average program, if a fleet's turnover rate falls behind the historic average turnover rate for nonroad equipment, then an emissions surcharge will be assessed on the additional NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions caused by the higher emitting engines. The fleet average NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions level allowed is reduced each calendar year to reflect the appropriate turnover rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

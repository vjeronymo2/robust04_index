			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Mowlem The market has been conspicuously unforgiving this year towards UK companies offering bad tidings on the dividend front. It was thus consistent in pushing John Mowlem shares 10 per cent higher yesterday on the grounds that its final payout has been cut less than feared. In the present post-election mood, investors may be more susceptible to the idea of a robust recovery finally arriving. But even on the most optimistic profit forecasts a maintained dividend will not be covered this year. There can be no guarantee for 1993 either. The trouble with Mowlem is that there have been too many disappointments in the past to leave room for confidence that the group has it right this time. The balance sheet may look relatively solid and the provisions reassuringly conservative. But aside from its small operations in housebuilding and equipment hire, it is a late-cycle stock which will be fully exposed to the sharp downturn in contracting turnover and profits this year. Mowlem's quality in this area cannot be faulted, but it will not be alone among its peers in suffering from a drop in cash balances. At least the group's proposed exit from commercial property development, which should be achievable given that the related write-downs imply yields of 12-14 per cent, means there will not be a black hole for remaining spare cash this time.</p>

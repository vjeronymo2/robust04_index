Volkotrub, I.M. Yegorov, Cancer Research </F> Institute at the Tomsk Scientific Center of Russia's Academy of  Medical Sciences and Institute of Computer-Aided Control and  Radio Engineering Systems, Tomsk; UDC 614.71/.73-07]    [Abstract] The shortcomings of the existing environmental  pollution monitoring systems and the inadequacy of the data  interpolation procedures whereby the contamination levels are  assessed objectively only at the sampling spots prompted the  development of new methodological approaches to identifying  territories with different man-caused atmospheric air pollution  levels on the basis of terrestrial monitoring and remote sensing  data obtained from space using such revealing traits as dust and  aerosol fraction discharges which accompany air pollution. The  aerospace information is received from a regional center in the  form of photographs taken simultaneously within three spectral  bands (0.8-0.9, 0.6-0.7, and 0.5-0.6 m) by a Kosmos  satellite  with a medium resolution multispectral scanner. The pictures are  digitized at 256 brightness level and subsequently processed as  numerical matrices. The conclusion is drawn that the optical  contrast level of aerial and space video images of the territory  correlates with the atmospheric contamination index (IZA) thus  reflecting the man-caused air pollution and making it possible  to use it as the atmospheric purity criterion. The principal  advantages of the method are the reliability, data  representation form, and the possibility of identifying the  pollution source within the abnormal optical contrast zone as  well as the convenience of assessing the pollution dynamics by  comparing the pictures taken within a certain period, thus  obviating systematic ground-level monitoring in order to  determine the toxic substance concentration and analyze the  near-surface concentration fields.

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Metal union threatens strike IG Metall, Germany's engineering trade union, yesterday said it would use the strike weapon 'as the last resort' if employers refuse a wage increase of over 10 per cent this year for its members in east Germany. The warning follows the start of arbitration talks in Saxony last week. Further talks take place in the other east German states over the next few weeks. Previous talks broke down after the employers' union said it would not accept rapid pay increases which would bring east German wages up to 82 per cent of west German levels from the 70 per cent level at present. Yesterday, Mr Klaus Zwickel, vice chairman of IG Metall, said the employers' union was 'reneging' on its commitment to income parity between west and east German states by 1994. 'The employers are provoking us. We signed a contract in 1991. And we will stick to it. It is only fair, particularly since east German workers have to pay west German prices, and have seen housing and other subsidies sharply reduced.' Mr Zwickel rejected criticism that his union was pricing east German workers out of the market - despite the fact that unit labour costs are about 150 per cent higher and productivity is lower than 70 per cent of west German levels. But IG Metall union officials conceded that it might not have full backing for any strike call because rising unemployment is eroding the union's active membership. Most engineering workers, some 750,000 in the east German states, are members of IG Metall. But since unification the number east German engineering workers who have actually got a job has shrunk to 300,000. Also, 50 per cent of these are under the supervision of the Treuhand, the east German privatisation agency. Further privatisations could reduce the clout of I G Metall. 'We do not want to be pushed into a strike,' said Mr Zwickel. 'But we will not let our employees be pushed around.' However, several factory managers in west Germany yesterday believed that the employers' union would find a way out of the contract by invoking 'revision clauses'. This means that employers can argue that if the developments in the new east German states deviated from their original plans, the parties have the right to reconsider the clauses of the original contract.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lilya Kuznetsova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 30 TASS -- A general demographic scheme  for Russia's territories, determining the main tendencies for  the development of the country's urban and rural communities and  separate regions, stipulating versions for accommodating  refugees, displaced persons, families of servicemen, migrants  from the north, and outlining ways to officially regulate those  processes in conditions of a market economy, was discussed and  approved today by an expert council under the Russian president.    As noted by Aleksandr Krivov, vice-chairman of the Russian  State Building Committee, the key task, indicated in the  document, is to draw up a concept and a long-term policy for  settling people on Russia's vast territories and to elaborate  concrete proposals for this purpose.    The pivotal idea of the general scheme is to elaborate a  basic settlement pattern and to site and form urban  conglomerations, constituting the key form of contemporary and  future distribution of the Russian population. They are to be  provided with a powerful infrastructure, ensuring modern  transport and communication services, information facilities,  and the ecological safety of a given district.    The mid-Russian, south Siberia and Pacific regions are  indicated as the priority settlement areas. Leningrad, Pskov,  Novgorod, Tver, Yaroslavl, Kostroma and Vologda regions, as well  as the middle belt of Russia and the Urals, Siberia, and the Far  East are earmarked for the settlement of refugees from the  republics of the former Soviet Union, for the families of  servicemen and resettlers from the north, the number of which is  expected to reach 5.5-8 million people by the year 2000.    A package of federal programmes is to be drawn up on the  basis of this document, envisaging the development of small and  medium-size towns, revival of the Russian countryside, revival  and development of the mid-Russian region, and the accommodation  of migrants. The expert council moved to "determine the status  of the general scheme as a regularly amended prognosis-type  document", to approve the draft's concept, to set up an  inter-departmental commission for shape Russia's town-building  policy and to draw up a draft resolution of the Russian  Government "On the main directions of the state town-building  and settlement policy in the Russian Federation".</p>

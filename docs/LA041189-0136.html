			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PBS URGED TO ADDRESS DIRE STATE OF EDUCATION  </P> <P> Despite its proud history of educational programming, ranging from "Sesame  Street" for preschoolers to college-credit telecourses for adults, the Public  Broadcasting Service was admonished at its annual convention to take an even  more prominent academic role by championing educational reform.  </P> <P> Beyond the obvious societal reasons for doing so, former Proctor &amp; Gamble  chairman Owen B. Butler suggested in his keynote address, public television has  a personal stake in helping to improve the nation's schools.  </P> <P> The same people who are dropping out of high school -- he put the rate at 4,000  a day nationwide -- are also "dropping out of your potential audience," said  Butler, who now is chairman of the Committee for Economic Development, a  private group of business executives and educators.  </P> <P> "I don't think that any of those kids have the kind of intellect that makes  them interested in public-television programming," Butler said.  </P> <P> His speech Sunday at the Sheraton Harbor Island East Hotel here kicked off a  four-day joint conference of PBS and the National Assn. of Public Television  Stations.  </P> <P> Butler underscored the need for educational reform by citing statistics that he  said came from a Chicago Sun Times study last year: "Over 50% of the  first-grade students in Chicago could not recite their last name, could not  tell red from blue, or circle from square. Their vocabulary is not that well  developed. But I'll bet you anything most of them could have told you the  difference between crack and weed."  </P> <P> Ironically, immediately following Butler's speech, William McCarter, president  and general manager of WTTW-TV, the major public television station in Chicago,  did a little show-and-tell on two of the station's local programs involving  education: the Illinois Young Performers' Competition, now in its fifth year,  in which the station and Illinois Bell annually award $20,000 in scholarships  in six performing-arts categories; and the Golden Apple Awards, now in its  fourth year, which are presented each year to 10 outstanding Chicago-area  teachers.  </P> <P> The public television executives got down to business of a more routine nature  Monday, debating various options for restructuring the way national programs  are funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The corporation, which  distributes federal funds to noncommercial radio and television stations, is  under a mandate from Congress to consider revising its funding procedures.  About $40 million from CPB currently helps support such PBS series as  "Frontline" and "American Playhouse."  </P></p>

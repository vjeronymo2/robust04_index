			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Buying out of the company  -In a Nutshell Corporate divestments provided the source for an increased number of management buy-outs in Europe last year, according to the 1992 edition of Europe Buy-out Review.* Last year, 62 per cent of buy-outs were the result of corporate restructuring compared with 53 per cent in 1990. The number of buy-outs of private or family-owned businesses fell to 33 from 36 per cent of the total while 'other' sources accounted for 5 per cent (11 per cent). Only in France and Italy did private or family companies account for more than half the buy-outs. The number of continental European buy-outs fell from 411 in 1990 to 318 last year but there was a much smaller fall in the value of completed deals: from Pounds 4bn to Pounds 3.9bn. This compared with a UK market in 1991 of 564 deals with a total value of Pounds 2.8bn. *Initiative Europe, 69-71 Bondway, London SW8 1SQ. Tel 071 735 9838. 180 pages. Pounds 255.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: ABSA offer for Bankorp cut to R1.2bn ABSA, South Africa's largest banking group, has lowered its offer for Bankorp by R100m (Dollars 34.9m) to R1.2bn following a due-diligence investigation on the latter, writes Philip Gawith. Last month, ABSA announced it was to take over Bankorp, the fifth largest bank, in a deal which would make the enlarged ABSA easily the country's largest, with assets of over R80bn. Under the revised offer, ABSA will pay 288.5 cents for each Bankorp share, compared with the original offer of 312.5 cents. The first offer was made conditional on the outcome of a due-diligence probe. The R1.2bn purchase will be funded through the issue of 107.55m new shares in ABSA at R11.25 each, compared with the original offer of 116.5m shares. Bankorp shareholders will receive 100 ABSA shares for every 390 Bankorp shares, compared with 360 previously. In a related transaction, Sankorp announced - also following a due-diligence investigation - that it would pay 340 cents per Momentum Life share, instead of the 359 cents originally announced. This deal was precipitated by ABSA's takeover of Bankorp.</p>

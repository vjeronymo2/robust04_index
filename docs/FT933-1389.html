			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / MTV set for three extra channels MTV EUROPE, the London-based pop music satellite television channel, is planning a move to digital technology by the beginning of next year. This means that MTV, which already reaches more than 55m homes and as many as 120m viewers, will be able to broadcast four channels in place of the present one. Mr Bill Roedy, chief executive of MTV Europe, has not yet decided how the extra capacity will be used. The main possibilities include an additional MTV channel tailored to the European market or a music channel aimed at an older audience than that of MTV. MTV is already on four satellites across Europe. The digital service is initially expected to be aimed at European cable television networks via the Eutelsat satellite. Digital technology converts the television signal to digital form and compresses it by storing the constant factors of a picture frame, only transmitting elements that change from one frame to the next. As many as 10 channels can be squeezed in the space of one. MTV is also planning to join the British Sky Broadcasting subscription package of channels next year. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake in BSkyB.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 7 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam,  upon returning from his seven-day trip to Russia and Uzbekistan  Tuesday evening, said the visit has "opened a new historical  horizon of South Korean-Russian cooperation."    Reading an arrival statement in a welcoming ceremony at  Seoul  airport, Kim stressed that "the Russian commitments to suspend  arms sales to North Korea and make virtual amendments to the  North Korea-Russia mutual assistance pact would help us build a  new security footing."    The Russian and Uzbek Governments promised to protect ethnic  Koreans in their countries so that they, as a minority people,  do not suffer any racial discrimination, he said.    "With the visit to Russia in the wake of the visits to the  United States, Japan and China, I have completed the framework  of quadrangle diplomacy," he said. "To prepare ourselves for  the ever-intensifying international and inter-regional  competition, we must push ahead with our reform programs in a  more vigorous manner."</p>

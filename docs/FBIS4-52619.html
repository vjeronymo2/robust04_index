			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Japanese Trade Minister  Eijiro Hata on Thursday [13 May] pledged that Tokyo would make  efforts to deepen its ties with China. Japan should do its  utmost to make its ties with China "fruitful" while reflecting  on the recent controversial remark by a Japanese cabinet  minister, International Trade and Industry Minister Hata told a  Chinese economic delegation.    Hata received a courtesy call at his office from Ye Qing,  vice minister of the Chinese State Planning Commission.    Qing heads an eight-member team currently visiting Japan to  hold subcabinet-level consultations Thursday and Friday with a  Japanese delegation led by Hideaki Kumano, vice international  trade and industry minister.    Hata was referring to last week's remark by the justice  minister denying that the 1937 Nanjing massacre by Japanese  troops ever took place.</p>

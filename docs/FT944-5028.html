			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Change to league tables planned: Shephard says added value in school statistics must be intelligible to parents Government league tables of school performance should be changed to take account of pupils' achievements when they started at the school, government curriculum advisers said yesterday. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, accepted their report but said any measures must be 'straightforward to calculate and intelligible to parents'. The School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, chaired by Sir Ron Dearing, proposed three separate measures to show how much children improve while they are at schools in England and Wales. The first is a model which would plot a school's academic 'output' (as measured by its GCSE results), against its 'inputs' (pupils' performance in tests taken at the age of 11). A second more complicated option would estimate the proportion of pupils in a school achieving results better than expected. Their performance would be computed from the average GCSE results eventually achieved by children of different levels of ability at 11. A third possibility would be to divide schools into three groups - those with performance in line with expectations, those performing better and those performing worse. The authority has recommended against using measures which take social and economic factors into account, in spite of repeated survey evidence that schools with the weakest GCSE results serve socially deprived catchment areas. Dr Nicholas Tate, the authority's chief executive, said social factors would have affected the 'baseline' achievements of children when they started at a school, so the models proposed would all take social problems into account. He added that there was 'a balance to be struck between accuracy and manageability'. All the proposals would require much extra information to be published about schools, including the number of pupils who changed schools between the beginning and the end of the age range, and the estimated error in the school's predicted performance. The group also wants to investigate publishing three-year rolling averages of schools' performance, and an 'improvement index' which would show a school's improvement over previous years in percentage terms. The authority says that 'raw' data, which does not take into account pupils' abilities, should still be published. Teachers' unions remained hostile. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: 'If the proposal is simply a way of trying to give respectability to discredited league tables then it is a waste of time. For the study to have any value it must be de-coupled from the government's obsession with league tables.' Value-Added Performance Indicators for Schools.

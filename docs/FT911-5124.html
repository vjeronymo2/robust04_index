			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Profits tumble by 22% at Israel's third largest bank IDB BANKHOLDING, Israel's third largest financial group whose ownership structure is currently the subject of controversial negotiations with the government, yesterday reported a steep profits slide. For 1990, net profits fell 22 per cent to Shk66m (Dollars 32.5m at end-1990 exchange rates) from Shk85m in 1989. The reversal was largely due to a downturn in performance in its core banking business, Israel Discount Bank. Tight margins, the failure of Shekel devaluation against the dollar to match domestic inflation, an increased tax charge and a fall in contributions from subsidiaries were blamed for a 21 per cent tumble in IDB net profits, from Shk75.3m to Shk59.2m. Performance at the group's investment arm, IDB Development - one of the richest private investment portfolios in Israel - also slipped, with net profits down to Shk60m from Shk64m, although this was put down mainly to a windfall cancellation of a tax provision which inflated profits in 1989. For the group as a whole, total assets were down slightly to Shk35.8bn from Shk37.2bn, shareholders equity was up at Shk1.79bn from Shk1.76bn and return on equity was 3.8 per cent, compared with 4.9 per cent in 1989. The main issue facing IDB is settling its ownership. Mr Raphael Recanati, IDB chairman, yesterday called on the government to resolve the issue quickly. As with Israel's three other main banks, the government bought a majority shareholding in 1983 to rescue it from a share price collapse, but control was left in the hands of the Recanati family. A government effort to sell a controlling stake through a competitive tender, following an agreement with the Recanatis to abandon the preferential voting structure, collapsed when the only bidder other than the family dropped out. The Bank of Israel then said it objected to reselling the group to the Recanatis, who face criminal charges from a share manipulation scandal that prompted the 1983 collapse. At present the government appears ready to proceed with the sale despite the central bank's intervention.</p>

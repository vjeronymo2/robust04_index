			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Aircraft industry sees soft landing in China - Manufacturers scramble for market share in civil aviation's only area of growth CHINA is fast emerging as the latest battle ground for world commercial aircraft as manufacturers scramble to win new business in the current civil aviation industry slump. 'This is the only market right now where you can sell aircraft,' says Mr Werner Hupe, the general manager of Ameco, a joint venture based in Beijing between Air China and Lufthansa and the biggest aircraft maintenance and engineering workshop in China. Other aerospace executives based in China say demand for new aircraft is growing rapidly with air traffic expanding by 28-30 per cent this year and expected to continue growing for the rest of the decade. As part of the modernisation of its economy, which is set to show annual growth of more than 10 per cent in the next three years, China is seeking to increase and upgrade its airports, improve passenger and freight handling facilities and air traffic navigational systems. China has also announced plans to allow foreign investment in state-owned carriers and airports, starting with the country's six largest regional airlines. One example is the Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines, which recently announced a Dollars 555m order for five Airbus A340 wide body airliners. The airline, which has also ordered Airbus A300 and Fokker 100 jets, said it expected to be free from government control by the end of this year. Mr Wang Lian, the airline's president, said that the carrier might recruitforeign expertise into its new, autonomous management and was also considering an eventual flotation on China's stock market. The big three western manufacturers - Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the US and the European Airbus consortium - are jostling for position in what is becoming aviation's boom market. But Russian aircraft manufacturers, which have traditionally supplied China with commercial aircraft, are also seeking markets for new Russian aircraft equipped with western engines and avionics. China's requirements span the entire range of commercial aircraft from large wide body airliners to medium-sized jets and regional aircraft. At the top end of the market, the orders battle centres on China Southern Airlines, the Cantonese-based carrier, which is seeking to acquire at least six large wide body twin-engine airliners. The airline is looking at both the new Boeing 777 wide body and the newly-launched Airbus A330. 'The significance of the China Southern order is that this competition will be repeated many times in other Chinese regional carriers seeking wide body aircraft,' an aero-engine official said. McDonnell Douglas, which has devoted probably more effort that any other western airframe manufacturer in building up a relationship with China through an aircraft assembly joint venture in Shanghai, is also attempting to place additional MD11 three engine wide body airliner with Chinese carriers. The US manufacturer reached an agreement this summer to co-produce with China 40 MD-80 and MD-90 twin engine medium sized airliners. Boeing is now challenging its US rival in the so-called Chinese 'trunkliner' market with a proposal to co-produce its 200 seater 757 twin engine airliner in China. However, the Russian Aviastar aerospace manufacturer is also expected to bid for Chinese business with its new Tupolev TU-204 airliner powered by Rolls-Royce engines. The TU-204 is the Russian rival of the Boeing 757 and made its official debut at the Farnborough air show last month. Both Aviastar and Rolls-Royce consider the TU-204 has good sales prospects. China traditionally relied on Russian aircraft until the 1960s when it ordered six Viscounts. It subsequently acquired Tridents from the UK before reverting back to Russian-built aircraft, sold by the former Soviet Union for Chinese commodities. One of the big problems for the Chinese airlines has been the unreliability of Russian engines and the rudimentary design of Russian airframes and cabins. But Aviastar, which appointed UK management consultants Price Waterhouse to help it develop a strategy to expand in the world market, and Rolls-Royce believe the TU-204 can challenge western built airliners in terms of technology, design and cost. Aviastar says the TU-204 is about 20-25 per cent cheaper than equivalent western jets. There would also be the possibility for China to acquire TU-204 on a part barter basis paying for the Russian airframe in commodities and cash for the Rolls-Royce engines. The big three western manufacturers are also competing for a slice of the Chinese regional aircraft market. Demand is increasing for smaller aircraft to provide inter-city feeder services. But the main battle in this market segment is between Fokker, the Dutch manufacturer, and British Aerospace which is hoping its proposed joint regional jet venture with Taiwan will eventually help open up new opportunities in mainland China. There are also risks in this strategy. China continues to view with considerable suspicion the manoeuvres of western aircraft manufacturers in Taiwan. Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus managing director, recently claimed that a French proposal to sell Mirage combat aircraft to Taiwan appeared to be the main reason why China was delaying the purchase of 12 Airbus wide body airliners, including A300s and A330s, worth a total of Dollars 1.5bn.</p>

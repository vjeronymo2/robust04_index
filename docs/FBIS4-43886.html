			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD/RHR: "Claes: Paris Wants To Create a </F> `Safe Area' in Rwanda or Zaire"]    [Text] Brussels, 21 Jun (BELGA) -- Foreign Minister Willy  Claes reaffirmed Tuesday [21 June] that Belgium would not  provide troops for the two-month humanitarian operation Paris  would like to launch in Rwanda with the help of African  countries in order to protect the people from massacres while  awaiting reinforcements from the blue helmets.    The Belgian foreign minister also let it be understood that  the aim of French intervention was to create a "safe area" in  western Rwanda (which is still controlled by the Rwandan  Government Army) or in Zaire to protect the people. Claes told  the press, however, that this operation could lead to a "massive  evacuation" of Tutsis to neighboring countries, most likely  Zaire, to shelter them temporarily from the massacres, with the  hope of subsequently returning them to Rwanda.    "We will not provide troops, but we are prepared to provide  logistical support," Mr. Claes said, referring to food aid and  telecommunications support.    According to the minister, sending Belgian troops, or even  civilians, within the framework of the International Committee  of the Red Cross (ICRC), to Rwanda has been ruled out as long as  the anti-Belgian campaign continues in Rwanda. This campaign  has been fed by Hutu extremist radio stations which accuse  Belgium of being responsible for the death of President Juvenal  Habyarimana last 6 April in a mysterious plane accident.    Mr. Claes stated, however, that "Belgium was expecting Paris  to give it a list of what it wants. The United States is also  prepared to provide logistical support," he noted.    The minister also called on France not to underestimate the  "military risks" of a direct confrontation with the Rwandan  Patriotic Front (RPF) during the operation for which it is  currently trying to get the go-ahead from the UN Security  Council, despite the opposition of certain French politicians,  the OAU, and the RPF.    According to Claes, it is to avoid such confrontation that  the French Government has chosen to operate out of Goma, a  Zairian town located on the Rwandan border and alongside lake  Kivu.    Claes added that ``Paris has initiated informal contacts  with  the RPF in several countries to try and convince the rebel  movement that its initiative was genuinely humanitarian and was  aimed at saving Tutsis who are still in the area controlled by  the Rwandan Government Army.    ``I do not think that the French, who in my opinion, are  acting under pressure from French public opinion, have an  interest in consolidating the positions of the government  Army,'' Mr. Claes added.    Claes went on to explain that the maximum duration of two  months for intervention was set by France to await the  implementation of UNAMIR-II [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] by  the United Nations. UNAMIR-II should primarily be composed of  African blue helmets.</p>

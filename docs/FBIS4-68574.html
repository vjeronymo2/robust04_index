			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by APF Information Center: "`Islam And Human </F> Freedom'"]    [Text] On 28 February religious functionaries, scholars and  party representatives held a meeting on "Islam and Human  Freedom" at the Central Apparatus. Hajy Faiz, prorector of the  Higher Spiritual Medrese under the Spiritual Administration of  Transcaucasian Muslims, Meshedi Behruz, a teacher at the  medrese, Hajy Jebrail, chairman of the Farmers' Union, and his  deputy Hajy Nazim, Hajy Osman Efendiyev, chairman of the  National Enlightenment Party and docent Philosophy Department at  the Economics Institute, Tariyel Hesenov, a colleague in the  humanitarian policy department of the Office of the President  and Professor of Theology at Baku State University, Etibar  Talybly, chairman of the university rayon department of the APF  [Azerbaijan People's Front], Arif Aliyev, deputy chairman of the  APF, Meshedi Arif, member of the Presidium of the APF, and  others took part in the meeting.    The orientalist and translator of the Koran into Azeri,  Neriman Gasymzade, chaired the meeting.    During the discussion the return to the Koran, Islam and  tradition, remnants of idolatry in Islam, religious education  and problems of religion and policy were discussed.    It was noted that the concept of "there is no God but God"  is  the major source of human freedom. In the Islamic concept,  freedom has three supports: glasnost, equality and solidarity.  Religious functionaries explained their positions by saying  "essentially, there is freedom in Islam, but scholars must  absolutely reveal it."    The scholars discussed the damage done to society by  religious illiteracy, what the fragmentation of Islam means to  fragmentation of the nation, and the traces of idolatry in  Islam, and noted that one could consider the effort to iconize  certain political leaders even today as a manifestation of this  idolatry in modern times.    The party representatives gave more stress to the subject of  religion and politics. It was noted that the politicization of  Islam primarily damaged the religion itself. Religious believers  can implement their needs and demands through politicians  without interfering in politics themselves. Politicians must  create conditions for propagandizing religion on a healthy basis  and guarantee the inviolability of freedom of conscience. But  the establishment of religious parties as an effort to put  religion in a political framework is acceptable to no one.    At the end of the meeting it was decided to hold such talks  more often and to hold conferences on specific religious themes.  Agreement was also reached on organizing a special meeting of  the leaders of all confessions in Azerbaijan, scholars and  politicians.</p>

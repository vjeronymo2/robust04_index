			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Francisco Alves Filho: "The Rambos of Andarai"] </F>   [Text] Rio police have cut out the middlemen. They  themselves are handing out rifles and drugs to the criminal  elements who have set up shop in the Rio shantytowns. These  figures are the target of an extensive investigation by the  Federal Police (PF) that has already produced a dossier with  about 50 names. Checking into the circumstances that led to the  arrest of Detective Luiz Eduardo Sato and police informant Luiz  Alexandre Ferreira, who were picked up on 4 February when they  were carrying 22 kg of cocaine paste and ammunition for heavy  weapons to the Andarai hillside, could help dismantle the  connection between criminals dressed up as police and a branch  of the international drug traffic.    This hope was expressed by Lieutenant Governor and Secretary  of the Civil Police Nilo Batista himself, speaking on the same  day when the two were arrested. "If Detective Sato cooperates,  the scheme used by traffickers from other countries to work in  Brazil might be unveiled," Batista suggested. The problem is  that, as one might expect, neither of the two prisoners seems  willing to cooperate with the investigations. Sato, who has  already been called to answer two administrative inquiries and  has been separated from police work for two years now, said in  his deposition at the Drug Enforcement Division (DRE) of the  Civil Police that he had been told that traffickers from Andarai  had received a shipment of drugs and so had decided to go up to  the hill with the informant and seize the material. That was  what he did. Using a car from the 37th Police Precinct on  Governor's Island, he cleared the barricades set up by the  bandits, went up the hill without being bothered, picked up the  cocaine and the ammunition, and came back down. Not even Rambo  could have done as well.    The detective's explanation, however, is demolished when one  remembers that policemen who have been separated from the  service cannot carry out any kind of official operation.  Furthermore, no one believes that a police car would find it so  easy to reach the headquarters of the traffickers unless it had  the consent of the hoodlums. "If two men acting alone can  accomplish that kind of feat, I should start thinking about  firing the troops from the Drug Enforcement Division, which has  never done anything of the sort," commented Chief Walter  Oliveira, who is in charge of the DRE. It was the ease with  which Sato and Ferreira's car drove around the Andarai hillside  that attracted the attention of the military police, who ended  up arresting the two.    The episode of the arrest, by the way, shows that there are  many other interests behind Sato and Ferreira. The military  police who stopped the two met with resistance from agents on  duty at the 20th Police Precinct in Grajau, who refused to  record the event on the police blotter. This was not done until  after newspaper and magazine reporters arrived, having been  mobilized by the MP's themselves. Furthermore, the detective and  informant gave no convincing explanations as to why they were  driving a police car without being authorized to do official  work, and there are suspicions that agents from the Governor's  Island precinct had cooperated with Sato. The head of the 37th  precinct, Chief Jorge Barros, who could not explain this either,  was relieved of his duties.    Even if they do not provide any good leads for the Civil  Police investigation, Sato and Ferreira are important pieces of  the puzzle that the Federal Police are putting together. They  are thought to be part of a gang that, according to police, is  headed by Otto Gomes de Miranda, a black-market dealer in  dollars who distributes cocaine, weapons, and ammunition on the  hills of Rio de Janeiro. Miranda was arrested in Miami in April  1991 because he had been caught trying to return to Brazil with  13 AR-15 rifles and 55 machine guns and pistols. This  dollar-trader and trafficker is at liberty in Rio since the  police have not gathered enough evidence to arrest him.    Although the investigations are only halfway completed, the  arrest of Detective Sato and informant Ferreira has already had  the effect of transforming an uncomfortable suspicion into a  dramatic certainty: some Rio police are now sharing with the  criminals the dirty work of the drug traffic. So, a reversal of  roles that has been in the works for a long time has become a  reality. It contributes to a situation where, with every passing  day, the people of Rio de Janeiro become more afraid -- of both  the bandits and those who are supposed to be enforcing the laws.</p>

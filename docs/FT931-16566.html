			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / BR privatisation may start with seven franchises BETWEEN FIVE and seven franchises to operate British Rail passenger services will be transferred to the private sector in the first year of the privatisation of Britain's railways, the government indicated yesterday. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, told BBC Radio that the government would 'build up' from that level - 30 or 40 franchises might eventually be made available. As the row over the proposed privatisation rumbled on, senior Tories joined Labour in criticising the government's plans as dated or potentially unworkable. Lord Ridley, a former Conservative transport secretary, underlined his reservations, predicting that few would be prepared to 'embark on franchising' because 'they do not know what benefits they will get from running the trains'. Emphasising the link between railway infrastructure and the rolling stock that uses it, Lord Ridley said separating the two was 'a very difficult thing to do'. In such circumstances, he said, pricing would require very difficult calculations, 'particularly if one is publicly owned and the other privately owned'. Mr George Walden, Tory MP for Buckingham, said that while the government's plans might work for certain lines, if others continued to be subsidised, 'one asks oneself what is the point of the exercise'. He added: 'I profoundly hope the point of the exercise is not just to go ahead willy-nilly with some kind of dated political commitment.' For Labour, Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, called on Mr MacGregor to resign. 'Franchising has already taken place and failed - we already know the experiment does not work,' he said. Meanwhile, the all-party Commons transport committee yesterday released a timetable of meetings scheduled for later this month in connection with its scrutiny of the government's privatisation plans. Witnesses will include Sir Bob Reid, British Rail chairman, Sir Peter Parker, one of his predecessors, and Lord Prior, the former Tory cabinet minister. Officials said the committee hoped to arrange a meeting with Mr MacGregor during its inquiries. It hopes to produce a report in February or March.</p>

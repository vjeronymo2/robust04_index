Today, the experience of China's  success in converting its defense industry to civilian use is  drawing worldwide attention.    According to the latest statistics by authoritative persons,  in 1993 the output of goods for civilian use produced by China's  defense industry increased by more than 30 percent over the  previous year, or higher than the growth rate of China's  industrial output, and the proportion of civilian goods in the  total output value of the defense industry sharply rose from 8.1  percent 15 years earlier to 77.4 percent.    Defense industry technology has passed out of its former  mysterious colors and is benefiting tens of millions of ordinary  people. People are enjoying more and more the fruits of the  peaceful use of defense technology. Today, more than 50 percent  of China's cameras are produced by defense industry enterprises,  and 65 percent of bicycles are produced by defense industry  factories. The "minibuses and cabs" on the streets of Beijing  already have a bigger transportation capability than the subway,  and three quarters of these yellow minibuses and cabs were  produced by munitions factories. By employing nuclear radiation  technology, China has cultivated 325 new farming species, adding  an output of 4 billion kg of grain and an output of 200 million  kg of cotton each year. The shipbuilding industry, which could  only produce warships and gunboats in the past, can now  manufacture technologically advanced roll-on, roll-off  freighters, shuttle tankers, and scientific research ships. The  annual tonnage of ships manufactured by China already ranks  fifth in the world. Its aircraft industry not only can produce  batches of the "Yun-7" and "Yun-11" civilian planes, but is  successfully cooperating with large multinational corporations  like Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The launching of the  Australian satellites, in which the Chinese take pride,  Beijing's electronic collider, and the Yangpu Bridge are all  good examples of "converting defense industry into civilian  use." The new Qinshan Nuclear Power Station produced 1.4  billion kilowatts in 1993, and the Daya Bay Nuclear Power  Station was already put into trial use.    In the early 1980's, with foresight toward the changes in  the  world situation, China made a historical step in the conversion  of the defense industry into civilian use. From 1986 onward,  the conversion of the defense industry into civilian use was  officially incorporated into the state plan. In the Seventh  Five-Year Plan and the Eighth Five-Year Plan, the state invested  over 10 billion yuan in loans and prepared over 700 projects for  civilian use, with the result that over 70 percent of defense  industry enterprises now possess their own civilian products.  At the same time, over 2,000 military technologies had their  secrecies cracked, some of which have been developed for the  production of civilian products.    Since the beginning of the 1990's, China's peaceful use of  defense industry technology has already become a world trend.  In converting defense industry technology into civilian use  under a market economy, China has new challenges from the  structure, capital, and the market.    China's defense industry enterprises have come out of the  closed door and are striving for survival and returns. Some  defense industry enterprises, which "kept foreigners at a  distance" in the past, have now set up joint ventures with  foreign enterprises. In Sichuan's Chongqing, Henan's Luoyang,  and Guangdong's Shenzhen, a number of Sino-foreign-funded  automobile, motorcycle, and electronic enterprises have imported  foreign capital and management systems. The joint-stock system  is beginning to be tried in the defense industry. Following the  change of the Huanghe Television Factory, the Feiyada Watch  Factory, and the Guangzhou Shipbuilding Factory to the joint  stock system on their original foundations, the Hainan Peace  Industries Limited, a large joint-stock group formed by the  aeronautic, shipbuilding, aerospace, and nuclear industries and  banking institutions, has been set up. This type of capital-  concentrated economic entity, which has been separated from many  parent enterprises, does not have an administrative supervisor  and is powerful as a fist, winning huge room and opportunities  for the development of conversion of the defense industry into  civilian use.    Experts of the state's decisionmaking authorities are  exploring how to change the passive maintenance of the defense  industry to its active "downsizing." Leaders of the State  Council have also proposed considering the idea of concentrating  the production of military products so that their production is  to the full capacity, promoting technological progress and the  improvement of returns, while, on the other hand, doing their  best to orient the production of civilian goods to the market so  as to change the current situation in which investment in the  conversion of the defense industry into civilian use is  scattered, too wide a scope is embraced, and returns are  unsatisfactory. In this way, defense industry enterprises can  maintain their productive vitality and shirk the passivity of a  heavy burden. At present, people with insight in the  economically developed areas of the eastern coastal areas have  already seen the catalyzing role of this idea in economic  development. They also find the advantages of manpower,  technology, and equipment in defense industry enterprises. A  number of cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangdong, and  Hainan have set up technological and industrial areas for the  conversion of the defense industry into civilian use. They use  land, capital, and policies to attract defense industry  enterprises to go there for the purpose of converting the  defense industry into civilian use. By utilizing defense  technology in a peaceful way, China's economy can ultimately  develop steadily and in a sustained way in the world's economic  setup.</p>

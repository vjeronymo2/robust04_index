			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Fisons plans cuts as profit tumbles: Drugs side to shed 1,000 jobs - 30% of scientific instruments division to be sold Fisons, the UK pharmaceuticals group which dismissed its chief executive in December, yesterday said it had identified further scope for cost cutting as it unveiled a slump in trading profit from Pounds 117m to Pounds 37.4m. Mr Patrick Egan, chairman, said its cost reduction programme would cut overheads by an annualised Pounds 38m over two years, compared with the previous forecast of Pounds 35m. The programme, which will involve the loss of 1,000 jobs in the pharmaceuticals division, follows a review by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand which cost Pounds 4m. Mr Egan also revealed the group planned to sell about 30 per cent of its scientific instruments division, which incurred losses of Pounds 39.6m, including a restructuring charge of Pounds 20.7m. In December, Fisons sacked its chief executive, Mr Cedric Scroggs, who had been directly responsible for the scientific instruments division, and warned the group would only break even for 1993. The company hopes to announce a replacement for Mr Scroggs in the next few months. 'We are absolutely determined to get it right and I am not going to be rushed,' said Mr Egan. The figures were also hit by the decision to end the practice of boosting pharmaceutical sales just before the year-end by offering discounts. This reduced profits in 1993 by Pounds 32m though Mr Mike Redmond, pharmaceuticals managing director, stressed: 'We will be selling in January and February what we would have sold in December.' After Pounds 40m of exceptional items, trading profit from pharmaceuticals fell Pounds 29.2m to Pounds 42.2m, with sales from continuing businesses up 7 per cent to Pounds 446m, while profits from laboratory supplies rose from Pounds 25.9m to Pounds 27.6m. At the pre-tax line, profits fell from Pounds 124m to just Pounds 1m after losses on business to be discontinued of Pounds 32.9m. There was a loss per share of 3.3p, compared with earnings of 13.9p. Spending on research and development rose from Pounds 64.5m to Pounds 72.5m. Thanks to disposals, an operating cash outflow of Pounds 69m after tax and dividends became a cash inflow of Pounds 152m and gearing fell from 67 per cent to 40 per cent. In line with December's announcement, the final dividend is cut from 5.4p to 1.0p. Lex, Page 20</p>

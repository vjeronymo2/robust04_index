			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN EXPLANATION OF THE DOLBY SYSTEM  </P> <P> What it does, we have done for years in our own  </P> <P> ears and heads, encoding and decoding,  </P> <P> undoing performances, restoring them to their notes  </P> <P> from which we perform, on which we work our own  </P> <P> will, attending as we please, or ignoring  </P> <P> whatever we will, whatever is displeasing,  </P> <P> surface noises, for instance, the hiss we'd hiss  </P> <P> if we supposed these mere machines could hear  </P> <P> or react to our reactions. They boost here  </P> <P> and then diminish there, to return to a state  </P> <P> better than real, if not truer than true.  </P> <P> What possibilities are there for engineers  </P> <P> to tantalize us with, what high-tech tricks?  </P> <P> Dolby meals? Dolby sex? What Dolby  </P> <P> days and nights can we spend, lolling on some  </P> <P> Dolby beach? Thus, must the dead dream  </P> <P> their lives' perfections, parodies, and yearn,  </P> <P> in a heaven where the slag-heaps are pure gold,  </P> <P> for incidental grit, for imperfections.  </P> <P> </P> <P> From "Equinox and Other Poems" (Louisiana State University Press: $13.95,  cloth; $6.95, paper; 50 pp.). Slavitt, a resident of Philadelphia, is the  author of nearly three dozen books, including "The Walls of Thebes," poems, and  "The Hussar," a novel, both published by LSU Press. 1988 David R.

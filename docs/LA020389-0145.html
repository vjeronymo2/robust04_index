			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SLIPPAGE FEARED IN DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> OFFICIAL SAYS FUNDING FOR ADVANCED RESEARCH IS 'FIRST TO GO' WHEN PENTAGON  BUDGETS ARE CUT  </P> <P> America is in danger of losing its technological supremacy on the battlefield  because of inadequate funding for Pentagon research programs, a senior Defense  Department official said Thursday.  </P> <P> "When (Pentagon) budgets are cut, the first thing to go is advanced technology  research," said Raymond S. Colladay, director of the Defense Advanced Research  Projects Agency. "It ought to be the other way around. The situation is getting  worse."  </P> <P> Colladay made his remarks Thursday at the Winter Convention on Aerospace and  Electronics Systems. It was the final day of the 3-day annual defense industry  conference in Costa Mesa, attended by about 300 top defense industry officials  getting a glimpse of the Pentagon's plans for tomorrow's weapons systems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Big-Ticket Systems Favored  </P> <P> With the exception of Thursday's session, Wincon meetings were classified and  closed to the public.  </P> <P> Colladay, former director of NASA's aeronautics and space research and  technology programs, has headed DARPA for the past year. As the Pentagon's main  research arm, DARPA's main task is maintaining U.S. technological superiority  over the Soviet Union and other potential adversaries.  </P> <P> Colladay's view that the U.S. military may be losing its technological edge was  shared by another speaker, Anthony R. Battista, who retired as a staff member  of the House Armed Services Committee last year and now works as a defense  consultant.  </P> <P> Battista said the armed services have traditionally favored big-ticket weapons  systems while pushing research into new technologies "down the priority list."  As a result, the massive military buildup undertaken by former President Reagan  did little to enhance the nation's defense technology.  </P> <P> When Reagan came into office the defense industry was "euphoric," Battista  said. "Everyone thought they were going to get everything back that President  Carter had cut. . . . They were not selective; they were greedy.  </P> <P> "We were throwing money down the rat hole in a duplication of programs" among  the military services, Battista said. "Technology was de-emphasized. The money  all went into platforms and large weapons systems."  </P> <P> Under the Pentagon's proposal, the DARPA budget would swell to $1.2 billion in  fiscal 1990, from $785 million this year. But Colladay said that is still not  enough money to keep the nation on the cutting edge of technology. He  emphasized that Pentagon research programs do not serve solely military  purposes, but sometimes have commercial uses as well.  </P> <P> </P> <P> High-Resolution TV  </P> <P> An example would be DARPA's recent decision to finance the development of an  advanced high-resolution video display, a move also aimed at reviving the  American television manufacturing industry. The project is designed to develop  high-resolution display screens for use on combat aircraft, battle simulators  and other military uses.  </P> <P> The program will enlist the help of American electronics and semiconductor  manufacturers to develop the next generation of television equipment, known as  high-definition television, or HDTV, which is supposed to bring movielike  clarity to home TV sets. The Japanese now dominate TV manufacturing and are  known to be far ahead of competitors in development of HDTV.  </P> <P> Other DARPA research projects include lightweight satellites,  super-maneuverable aircraft, superconductors, high-speed computing and  sophisticated sensors that would automatically recognize targets. The agency is  also funding research on "neural networks" -- artificial intelligence computers  that recognize and compare patterns and then solve problems in ways similar to  that of the human brain.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOUGLAS GAINS TITLE, BUT TYSON GETS A REMATCH;  </P> <P> BOXING: HOLYFIELD'S MANAGER SAYS HIS FIGHTER WILL PROBABLY STEP ASIDE FOR THREE  MONTHS BUT WANTS FIRST SHOT AT THE WINNER OF DOUGLAS-TYSON II.  </P> <P> Now, the boxing world agrees: Buster Douglas is heavyweight champion. And it  almost agrees: His first challenger will be Mike Tyson.  </P> <P> The final barrier to Douglas-Tyson II was breached Tuesday when Evander  Holyfield's manager, Ken Sanders, said in Atlanta that his boxer probably would  step aside to allow the rematch.  </P> <P> Billionaire developer Donald Trump says Douglas-Tyson II will be June 18 in  Atlantic City, although neither Douglas nor Tyson have signed contracts.  </P> <P> In fact, Douglas only learned hours earlier that he was undisputed champion  when the World Boxing Assn. became the last of the sport's three major  governing bodies to recognize his 10th-round knockout of Tyson on Sunday in  Tokyo.  </P> <P> "We don't have a rematch now," Don King, Tyson's promoter and adviser, said  Tuesday at a news conference. "We're trying to get one. The first thing we have  to do is get a rematch. As you know, the catching comes before the hanging."  </P> <P> King said he was negotiating with representatives of Douglas and Holyfield to  work out an agreement.  </P> <P> Tyson, who appeared with King at the news conference, said his loss was "a  temporary, minor setback. I don't take it to heart. I'll be the champion again.  I'm still one of the best fighters in the world and when the rematch comes I'll  prove it."  </P> <P> Holyfield, as the No. 1-ranked contender, is the WBC's and WBA's mandatory  challenger, but it looks as if he'll wait for Tyson-Douglas II, then fight the  winner.  </P> <P> "We've been approached to make a deal, by Don King, to step aside and make way  for the rematch," Sanders said. "We're waiting for the contract from him. If  it's what they said it would be, we probably would do it."  </P> <P> Sanders said Holyfield would fight a tuneup on the undercard, then fight the  Tyson-Douglas winner in September or October. For his part in the rematch,  Holyfield reportedly will get $3 million.  </P> <P> "They're just asking us to move it three or four months," Sanders said. "It's a  very good deal for us. We know we're going to fight for the championship."  </P> <P> King started the controversy over Douglas' knockout by protesting that referee  Octavio Meyran counted too long over Douglas when he was knocked down in the  eighth round. After the fight, Meyran said he had mistakenly taken up the  timekeeper's count a few seconds too late.  </P> <P> In his hometown of Columbus, Ohio, Douglas said the main thing for him "is that  I am now looked upon as the heavyweight champion of the world. It was a  lifelong dream come true, and I thank God for that."  </P> <P> The IBF recognized Douglas as champion immediately, and the WBC extended  recognition Monday night after King, who promotes Tyson, dropped a protest of  the result.  </P> <P> "I never asked anybody to change the decision," King said. "We just want a  first shot at a rematch."  </P> <P> In a telephone interview from Los Angeles, WBC president Jose Sulaiman  apologized for initially withholding the title from Douglas, saying he was  embarrassed by his actions.  </P> <P> "I felt embarrassed to Buster Douglas," he said. "I felt it was not fair to the  kid that I had withheld my opinion about the result of the fight."  </P> <P> At the same time, he said King had put no pressure on the WBC to give the title  back to Tyson.  </P> <P> "The WBC is not controlled by Don King or anybody," Sulaiman said. "I laugh at  those rumors started by people who cannot accept us."  </P></p>

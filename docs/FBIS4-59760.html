			<p>BFN     [Text] Council of Ministers Chairman Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas met Mr. Pelletreau, the Assistant State Secretary for  Near East Affairs at the U.S. State Department yesterday. They  discussed the grave developments in our country and the  continued barbaric attacks led by the military leadership in  control in Sanaa against the people of the southern and eastern  provinces.    Prime Minister al-'Attas reviewed the peace initiative  proposed by the Yemeni Socialist Party and the principles for  national salvation accord proposed by the nationalist forces  which were both rejected along with other political initiatives  by the leadership in Sanaa.    The U.S. official expressed the U.S. Administration's  satisfaction with and welcome of this initiative stressing his  country's keen interest in stopping the war. He pointed out  that whatever the result of the war is, it cannot be a solution  to the current political problems. It will rather lead to more  ruin, destruction, and victims and will create hatred and  bitterness and expose the union to danger.</p>

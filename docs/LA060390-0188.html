			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYBE MOVIE STARS ARE JUST TOO GORGEOUS FOR OUR OWN GOOD  </P> <P> Within a span of several days, I saw the 1955 movie "Marty" on a PBS broadcast  and "Pretty Women" in a theater.  </P> <P> I left "Pretty Woman" with mixed emotions. I watched this stunning woman fall  in love with a rich, gorgeous hunk. Even though she was a prostitute with no  manners, class or education, she "cleaned up real good" and managed to capture  millionaire Richard Gere by way of her long legs and practiced love-making.  </P> <P> The more I thought about this movie, the more uncomfortable I became. It did  have a romantic ending: He rode the limousine back to the slums to rescue her  from her sleazy life of sin. But how did this movie relate to me?  </P> <P> I don't know anyone as gorgeous as Roberts -- luscious lips, thick mane of  hair, full bust line. And Gere? He's no slouch either -- firm body, wonderful  tan and just a hint of gray hair. (Where did he get that tan if he was so busy  raiding corporations?)  </P> <P> But are these people real? I thought movies today were supposed to be more  realistic.  </P> <P> And then I watched "Marty." Ernest Borgnine is not Gere and Betsy Blair is not  Roberts.  </P> <P> How can two "dogs" find love and happiness when they are so ugly and their  lives are so boring?  </P> <P> He was a butcher. When did you last meet a single woman who wanted to date a  butcher? And she was a science teacher. Do you know how intimidated most men  are by female science teachers? (I know, because I'm a female science teacher.)  </P> <P> The men I meet today are looking for Julia Roberts. These same men complain the  women they meet are seeking a multimillionaire who looks like Gere.  </P> <P> There's a clue here, folks. We've been seeing the wrong movie. Next week, see  "Marty."  </P> <P> CLAIRE SCHNEIDER  </P> <P> Ramona  </P></p>

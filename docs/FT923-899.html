			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Harland Simon brings in Astra's former chief executive MR TONY McCann, one of the company doctors brought in to run Astra Holdings, the munitions and fireworks maker before it went into receivership earlier this year, has been appointed chief executive of Harland Simon, the control systems company which had its shares suspended earlier this month pending clarification of its financial position. Mr McCann was also named as deputy chairman of Harland's executive committee, which will be chaired by Sir Ian Morrow, the industrialist and accountant whose industrial experience includes the successful restructuring of Rolls-Royce. Mr David Mahoney retains his post as chairman. The new appointments were announced along with the resignation of Mr John Redshaw, managing director, from the board of the troubled group. A company statement added that Mr Redshaw had 'waived all claims' against it. Harland requested the suspension of trading in its shares at 20p earlier this month after Barclays, the group's main commercial banker, indicated that its banking facilities were being cut by up to one third. Yesterday the company emphasised that it continues to receive the support of its principal bankers. The appointment of Sir Ian and Mr McCann completes a management reorganisation which began in February when Mr Roy Ashman, former chairman and the driving force behind the company, was replaced by Mr Mahony, a former chairman and an industrial adviser to Hambro's, the company's financial adviser. The immediate priority of the new management team will be to complete a review of the financial condition and prospects of the group, which has already begun an asset sale. Harland's problems began in February after the once high-flying company issued an unexpected profits warning and released details of exposure to companies controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. In the wake of the warning the group's share price collapsed and it subsequently reported a Pounds 6.3m pre-tax loss for the year to March 31. Mr McCann also has extensive industrial experience with Black &amp; Decker, Allegheny International and Littlewoods. Most recently, institutional investors in Astra asked him to take over as chief executive to resolve its financial difficulties. Although he, with Mr Roy Barber as chairman, managed a significant improvement in Astra's performance, from losses of Pounds 65m to near break-even, the burden of debt prevented a capital reconstruction and the company eventually went into receivership.</p>

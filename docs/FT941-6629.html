			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Arts: Tactile works in wax and clay - William Packer on a surprising and ambiguous retrospective of the work of Medardo Rosso, a contemporary of Rodin Medardo Rosso was born in Turin in 1858. A spell of soldiering took him through his early 20s and it was not until he was 24 that he turned seriously to art, entering the Brera Academy in Milan in the summer of 1882. That too did not last long. Barely a year later he had been expelled for insubordination and taken himself off to show at that year's International Exhibition of Fine Art in Rome. From that moment he was clearly an actor on the international stage, showing his work in major exhibitions at every opportunity - now at the Salon des Independants in Paris, now in Venice, now in London, at the Albert Hall. He was already travelling widely, and in 1889 he moved to Paris where he was to keep a studio almost until the end of his life. For the next 30 years he was acknowledged with Rodin as the principal sculptor of impressionism, his work shown throughout Europe. In 1898, when Rodin's Balzac was first shown, Rosso was cited as putative influence - their friendship ended soon after. Boccioni and Marinetti saw him as the revolutionary forerunner of Futurism. Upon Rodin's death in 1917, Apollinaire declared him the greatest sculptor alive. Six years on and the furniture in the Paris studio had been taken by the bailiffs against unpaid rent. He continued to show, mainly in Italy where he was still held in high regard, but the sense now is of a career and reputation in decline. He died in hospital in Milan in 1928, a little short of his 70th birthday, after having had a leg amputated following an accident to his foot. And now? Rosso's sculpture, these many years past, has been honoured more in the form than the true observance, the work seldom seen and only in the isolated and occasional example. This full - though still quite small - and proper retrospective study is, therefore, of real art-historical moment, a true event. Whether it gives us the Rosso we might have expected, Rosso the proto-Futurist, the suggestive, symbolic impressionist, is another matter. What we do get is someone altogether more ambiguous and surprising, at once more thoroughly old-fashioned and more profoundly radical and prescient than we supposed. He was never a carver: his materials were those of the modeller, clay and wax, by which the image may be realised directly and quickly, and either left as it is or cast into plaster or bronze. And as a modeller, the young Rosso works soundly enough within the genre conventions of the mid-19th century, looking to the domesticity of Dalou, to the symbolism of Rodin, and perhaps back a little to the satirical figurines of Daumier. But he brings to such work his own peculiar attack, a rapid and tactile expressiveness in the actual working of the clay, which soon enough becomes an end in itself. It is in this development that his revolutionary quality lies, and which today makes his work so relevant to current practice and preoccupation. What intrigued his contemporaries was the way in which increasingly he came to establish the most fleeting suggestion of head or face, a cast of countenance caught in the wing, with but most minimal apparent intervention on his part. There was the impression, to be viewed perhaps from one side of what was manifestly still a lump of stuff. Yet the quality of that image, so beautiful, so delicate and haunting, as though seen through a veil, was what caught the fin-de-siecle symbolist imagination. Rosso's habit was to make several versions of an image in parallel though not necessarily from the same original, now wax, now bronze, now plaster, each as close as possible but still different in its finish. Any original clay model would inevitably be destroyed in any case, in the making of the plaster mould for subsequent casts. Similarly, by the lost-wax process, the wax would be, well, lost. But each material, plaster, bronze or wax, has its particular qualities, and here repeatedly we consider the variations, side by side - the matt, light-absorbent surface of the plaster, the heavy, patinated bronze, the translucent wax. Imagery apart, what we are left with are these differences, and physical and material differences at that. In noting them, we respond to them for being what they are in material terms of stuff and substance. Here is a chunk of plaster or a wilfully rough concavity of bronze, with a most delicate and sophisticated image on it right enough, but also an inside and an outside, a back and front. There it is, not so much for what it might be as for what it is. Take it or leave it. Such is Rosso's modernism as it speaks to us today. Medardo Rosso: Whitechapel Art Gallery, Whitechapel High Street E1, until April 24, then on to Edinburgh and Leeds - a national touring exhibition from the South Bank Centre, sponsored by British Telecom.</p>

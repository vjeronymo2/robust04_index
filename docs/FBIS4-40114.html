			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Plyushch, former speaker of the </F> Ukrainian Supreme Soviet and current presidential candidate;  place and date not given -- from the "Current Interview" feature]    [Text] [VYBIR] What powers must the Ukrainian president  possess to efficiently run the country?    [Plyushch] If I become the president, I am not going to  request any powers in addition to those specified by the  Constitution.    [VYBIR] What about the proposals of left-wing factions in  the  parliament to provide the president only with representative  functions?    [Plyushch] They propose this since our president was not  able  to efficiently use the powers delegated to him. Therefore,  left- wingers want the parliament to possess such functions.  However, to do this the Constitution should be amended which  requires at least 300 votes. The left factions do not have such  number of backers. They would have never gotten even 170 votes  to elect the Speaker if they had not been supported by the  president.    [VYBIR] Whom would you appoint to the key posts in the  government?    [Plyushch] Too early to speak about that. Too early. The  other day, I was going to go to Donetsk and came to the airport  20 minutes before the flight but they did not permit me to enter  the plane. They said I was 10 minutes late. Too early to speak  about the government now.    [VYBIR] What is your attitude to the new speaker?    [Plyushch] He is an experienced politician. Mr. Moroz is  supposed to do what he says. The speaker should have no party  affiliation. Still, sometimes I do not understand Mr. Moroz.  Look, he says that political council of the Socialist Party  suspended his membership in the party, then he says that it was  his party that nominated him as a presidential nominee, that  communists supported him...    [VYBIR] What do you think of the president's proposals  concerning the ruling posts in government?    [Plyushch] I haven't seen the list but I believe that a new  premier will again become a scapegoat.    [VYBIR] What is your attitude to the memorandum, signed by  communist parties of ex-Soviet republics, including Ukraine,  concerning restoration of the USSR?    [Plyushch] My attitude is absolutely negative. Such activity  of the communist party is illegal.    [VYBIR] Which international blocs are the most attractive  for  Ukraine. Where are Ukraine's interests -- in the West or East?    [Plyushch] We should enter the blocs which admit us. East or  West does not matter much. We have state-of-the-art  technologies but no investments to introduce them. We should  try to reestablish the common market of ex-Soviet republics.  Ukraine lost its market, sold it for nothing, for bribes. We  gave it to false friends trying to get rich using our  difficulties.    [VYBIR] Who is your chief rival in presidential marathon?    [Plyushch] The one who is governed by common sense.    [VYBIR] If you become the president, will you keep trying to  create the Baltic-Black Sea zone? What is your attitude to the  so- called Visegrad triangle?    [Plyushch] I will insist on the worldwide summit to solve  the  global problem facing all countries today. "Cold war" is over.  Bipolar world exists no more. Each country has a great  responsibility to the world community. Such summit must be  similar to that held after WWII. Ukraine should initiate this  process. The world community, not some countries, must be  peace-maker today. Look, now Russia wants to be the peace-maker  in the "near abroad" and the United Nations to play this role  elsewhere. I am against any division of the spheres of  influence. There are some questions as well -- today the Warsaw  Pact does not exist, but what about NATO?    [VYBIR] Thank you.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: Celsius buys information technology business Celsius, the Swedish defence group privatised last year, said yesterday it was buying the information technology concern, Dialog, for up to SKr480m (Dollars 60.8m). The purchase will broaden the group's range of consulting and technical services and enable it to offer software development and computer operations expertise to military and civilian customers. Dialog has 2,000 employees and an annual turnover of SKr1.8bn. This will lift Celsius's information technology sales to SKr6bn, and bring total group sales up to SKr15bn. Mr Ake Plyhm, Celsius president, said Dialog's customer profile, based around municipal authorities and large companies, fitted well with Celsius's other IT operations. Two previous acquisitions, Telub and CelsiusTech, have given the group a strong position in the military information technology sector. However, it has also expanded into the civilian sector with Telub's purchase of the Swedish telecom company, Dotcom, and Celsius's acquisition of the voting majority in Enator, a firm of IT consultants. Celsius will initially pay SKr385m for Dialog, and up to SKr95m more under an earnings-related formula. It is buying the company from the Swedish Association of Local Authorities.</p>

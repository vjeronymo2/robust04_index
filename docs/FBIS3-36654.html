			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Commander of the anti-Dudayev armed formations  General Ibragim Suleymenov stated that reconciliation with the  Chechen regime was only possible on the following terms:  immediate and unconditional resignation of Dzhokhar Dudayev,  the return of the capital from foreign banks (about $1 Bn) and  proportional distribution of this capital among the population,  and putting Dudayev on Shariat and secular trial.    On Monday, Suleymenov made a corresponding statement which  was circulated in Moscow on Monday by the armed opposition's  spokesman Zanbek Aliyev. He said that the Suleymenov-controlled  units had started military maneuvers in Chechnya last Friday to  improve interaction between units and rehearse bomb attacks on  land targets.    Suleymenov was a deputy in the Chechen parliament disbanded  by Dudayev in June 1993.</p>

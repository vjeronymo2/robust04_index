			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The April 10 Notice contained guidance to assist potential claimants wishing to file refund applications for crude oil monies under the Subpart V regulations. Generally, all claimants would be required to (1) document their purchase volumes of petroleum products during the August 19, 1973, through January 27, 1981, crude oil price control period, and (2) show that they were injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges. We also specified that end-users of petroleum products whose businesses were unrelated to the petroleum industry will be presumed to have been injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges. End-users, therefore, need only submit documentation of their purchase volumes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See City of Columbus, Georgia,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 16 DOE &para; 85,550 (1987). Additionally, we stated that we would calculate crude oil refunds on a per gallon (or volumetric) basis. We obtained this figure by dividing the crude oil refund pool by the total consumption of petroleum products in the United States during the crude oil price control period. The OHA has adopted the refund procedures outlined in the April 10 Notice in numerous cases.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., Shell Oil Co.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 17 DOE &para; 85,204 (1988) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Shell <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> );  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Mountain Fuel Supply Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , 14 DOE &para; 85,475 (1986) (Mountain Fuel).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> B. Refund Claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> We adopt the PDO's proposed determination to use the DOE's standard crude oil refund procedures to distribute the monies in the Cone Consent Order fund. We have chosen to reserve 20% of the fund, $122,000, plus accrued interest, for direct refunds to claimants in order to ensure that sufficient funds will be available for injured parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OHA will evaluate crude oil refund claims filed in this proceeding in a manner consistent with our previous crude oil refund proceedings under Subpart V.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See Mountain Fuel,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 14 DOE at 88,869. Claimants in this proceeding will be required to document their purchase volumes of petroleum products and prove that they were injured as a result of the alleged overcharges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We adopt a presumption that the crude oil overcharges were absorbed, rather than passed on, by applicants which were (1) end-users of petroleum products, (2) unrelated to the petroleum industry, and (3) not subject to the regulations promulgated under the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 (EPAA), 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;751&hyph;760h (1988). Under this presumption, end-user claimants need not submit documentation to show injury, and may become eligible for a refund by simply documenting their purchase volumes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See Shell,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 17 DOE at 88,406.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petroleum retailer, refiner, and reseller applicants must submit detailed documentation of injury. They may not rely upon the injury presumptions utilized in some refined products refund cases.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> These applicants may, however, use econometric evidence of the type found in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> OHA Report on Stripper Well Overcharges,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para; 90,507 (1985).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See also  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act &sect;3003(b)(2), 15 U.S.C. &sect;4502(b)(2) (1988). If a claimant has executed and submitted a valid waiver pursuant to one of the escrows established by the Stripper Well Agreement, it has waived its rights to file an application for Subpart V crude oil refund monies.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See Mid-America Dairymen  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Herrington,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 878 F.2d 1448 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App.), 3 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para; 26,617 (1989);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> In re: Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 707 F. Supp. 1267 (D. Kan.), 3 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para; 26,613 (1987).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As we have stated in prior Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant need only submit one application for its share of all available crude oil overcharge funds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., A. Tarricone, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 15 DOE &para; 85,495 (1987). A party that has already submitted a claim in any other crude oil refund need not file another claim. The prior application will be deemed to be filed in all crude oil refund proceedings finalized to date. The DOE has established June 30, 1994, as the final deadline for filing an Application for Refund from the crude oil funds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 58 Fed. Reg. 26,318 (May 3, 1993). It is the policy of the DOE to pay all crude oil refund claims at the rate of $.0008 per gallon. While we anticipate that the applicants that filed their claims before June 30, 1988, will receive a supplemental refund payment, we will decide in the future whether claimants that filed later applications should receive additional refunds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., Seneca Oil Co.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 21 DOE &para; 85,327 (1991). Notice of any additional amounts available in the future will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To apply for a crude oil refund, a claimant should submit an Application for Refund containing all of the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Identifying information including the claimant's name, current business address, business address during the refund period, taxpayer identification number or social security number, a statement indicating whether the claimant is a corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, or other business entity, the name, title, and telephone number of a person to contact for any additional information, and the name and address of the person who should receive the refund check. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  If the Applicant operated under more than one name or under a different name during the price control period, the Applicant should specify these names;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Privacy Act of 1974, the submission of a social security number by an individual applicant is voluntary. An applicant that does not wish to submit a social security number must submit an employer identification number if one exists. This information will be used in processing refund applications, and is requested pursuant to our authority under the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C. &sect;4502(b)(1) (1988), and the regulations codified at 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V. The information may be shared with other Federal agencies for statistical, auditing or archiving purposes, and with law enforcement agencies when they are investigating a potential violation of civil or criminal law. Unless an Applicant claims confidentiality, this information will be available to the public in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

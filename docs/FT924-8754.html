			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Croats cut Serb supply link CROAT forces yesterday cut off the vital supply route linking Serb-held territories in Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia with Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital. Belgrade Radio said the Croats had severed the land corridor running across northern Bosnia from Belgrade to Banja Luka, military headquarters of Bosnia's Serbs. The radio also said Moslem fighters had cut off a main road running south to Pale, the Serb stronghold just east of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. Despite earlier ceasefire agreements between Serb and Croat forces, which control some 25 per cent of Bosnia-Hercegovina, fighting yesterday intensified around Croat-held Mostar and Serb-controlled Nevesinje in southern Bosnia. Croatian Radio claimed Croat and Moslem forces had moved the front line deep into Serb-held territory. In Belgrade, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday announced a plan to end the war in Bosnia by freezing current front lines. While the Geneva Conference on Yugoslavia has rejected the partition of Bosnia along ethnic lines, Mr Karadzic said the former Yugoslav republic had ceased to exist. 'This war is no longer being waged for the division of Bosnia-Hercegovina, because it has already been divided between the Serbs and Croats,' he said. The leader of the self-proclaimed Serb Republic, which covers some 70 per cent of Bosnia, appeared confident Serb forces could preserve their territorial gains even in peace.</p>

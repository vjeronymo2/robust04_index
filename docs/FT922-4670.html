			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Buenos Aires peaks after avalanche of new money - The return of flight capital has led to a snowball effect in Argentine equities May was a month of records for the Buenos Aires stock exchange and June will probably be equally memorable. Trading volume broke records on three successive days last month, hitting a peak of Dollars 131m on May 21. The exchange's Merval index, which tracks 16 blue chip stocks, rose 6.2 per cent in dollar terms in May to reach a record high of 882, more than four times its level 12 months earlier. The market has consolidated since then, but it still managed to chalk up a new record turnover figure of Dollars 147m on Tuesday when the Merval closed at 870. Buenos Aires became one of the world's best-performing markets after it was hit last year by an avalanche of money, which has kept pushing up prices ever since. For a market with only 170 stocks and daily turnover of just Dollars 3m only 18 months ago, the change has been impressive. The bull phase has turned into a snowball effect: the influx of money pushes up the index, attracting more money, forcing the index inexorably upwards. Last month, over Dollars 855m entered Argentina, nearly all of it flight capital returning to the country, fleeing low international interest rates. Argentina's markets blasted off in August, when it became clear that restructuring of the Dollars 32bn foreign commercial bank debt under the auspices of the Brady plan would be successful. A convertible currency pegged to the US dollar, unwavering government commitment to economic reform and low inflation further strengthened confidence. Most listed companies moved strongly into profit after a severe recession ended in mid-1991. At first, investors bought tried and trusted blue chips to win exposure to Argentina. When blue chips became fully priced, they branched into second-tier stocks, which have also reached saturation point. The markets really came into their own with the sale in December and March of the government's 30 per cent stakes in two privatised telephone companies for over Dollars 2bn, with the new equity feeding investors' appetites. Now, after aggressive government promotion of equity markets, new companies are applying for listings. This is important for two reasons. First, without more supply, there is every chance that the equity snowball will go into metamorphosis and turn into a giant bubble. El Economista, a financial weekly, calculates that the market's 12 largest companies already have a historical price/earnings ratio of 43, although their aggregate profits were very low in 1991. Second, incursions into the equity market demonstrate an important shift in Argentina's stuffy corporate culture. Nearly all companies are family-owned, and their proprietors fear that selling shares to outsiders would become a thin edge of a wedge that would eventually force them to relinquish control. But the lure of dirt cheap equity capital is overcoming these fears. Guillermo Decker, a construction goods company, was the first to hit the market in May with a Dollars 14m offer representing 22 per cent of its equity. Companies in the pipeline include Sevel, Argentina's biggest car assembler, which builds Fiat and Peugeot cars under licence, and two affiliates of the Bunge y Born group. Yet more privatisation stocks are due this year. Equities will remain buoyant for as long as the virtuous circle of capital inflows and new share issues keeps going. And if corporate profits continue growing, today's apparently absurd share prices will be justified. Furthermore, private pension funds are to make their first appearance next year and should channel a good part of their Dollars 6-7bn annual cash flow into equities. But the market is vulnerable to an unpredictable shift in investor sentiment, say cautionary voices. This could suddenly turn the virtuous circle vicious, sending prices crashing and flight capital winging its way back to Miami bank accounts as quickly as it left.</p>

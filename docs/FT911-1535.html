			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Commodities (Week in the markets): Base metals retreat as stocks rise WAREHOUSE STOCKS in all the base metals traded on the London Metal Exchange rose yesterday. Zinc stocks stand at a record high, while aluminium, lead and copper stocks are at or near the highest levels for many years. Mr Robin Bhar, of Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, the London brokers, said: 'Demand is weak, so people deliver surplus metal to the LME - it's as simple as that.' The weight of stocks is reflected in the prices, which are down across the board this week - except for cash copper, which has been held up by a technical squeeze. The squeeze on copper can be seen in the widening premium for cash metal over three month metal this week. On Thursday the premium closed at Pounds 81.50 a tonne, but narrowed yesterday to Pounds 73 as cash metal retreated to close at Pounds 1,467.50 a tonne, a fall of Pounds 14.50 on the day but up Pounds 3 on the week. Mr Nick Moore, metals analyst with Ord Minnett, believes the copper price is a 'myth defying reality. At some stage people have got to realise the emperor has no clothes.' Copper stocks yesterday rose by 5,800 tonnes to 237,875 tonnes, the highest level since May 1984, as the high prices attracted metal into LME warehouses. This is almost a third more than the amount of stocks at the beginning of the year, and yet the price is more or less unchanged since then, Mr Moore points out. The cash price has been held up by position covering by producers and some investment funds that have sold short of copper. Additional support was given on Thursday by a declaration of force majeure from Gecamines, the Zairean state-owned copper producer, on 45 per cent of its commitments this year. Zinc stocks reached a record 115,275 tonnes, sparking commission house selling and depressing prices yesterday. Overnight news of a tentative agreement that might end the long-running dispute at Brunswick Mining's Bathurst lead and zinc mines also weighed on the market. Cash zinc closed at Dollars 1,134 a tonne, a fall of Dollars 14.50 on the week. Mr Bhar points out that zinc production is strongly up this year; there have been no strikes in Peru and little industrial unrest elsewhere in the world. At the same time demand is weak. Aluminium stocks - at 363,725 tonnes - are close to eight-year highs, also at a time of high production figures, says Mr Bhar. The rise in tin stocks, following a steady pattern of small declines, put further pressure on the market yesterday. Prices fell every day this week, leaving cash tin at Dollars 5,632.50 a tonne, a fall of Dollars 192.50 on the week. The sugar market, which fell steeply to the lowest levels for more than three years at the beginning of the week, was making a gradual recovery until it was confronted yesterday with a sharply higher estimate of the world surplus for this year. ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house, estimates that production for 1990-91 will exceed demand by 4.6m tonnes, the biggest surplus since 1982-83. 'It's a huge surplus and I can't see any hope for the market with that sort of situation,' one despondent dealer said yesterday. Man's latest figure compares with its previous estimate, made in January, of a 1.9m tonne surplus. In February FO Licht, the German statistician, put the surplus at 3.33m tonnes. Czarnikow, another large trade house, is expected to rise its estimate upwards from 1.2m tonnes later this month. On Tuesday the London Daily Price for raw sugar was Dollars 194 a tonne, the lowest level since November 1987. Yesterday it was Dollars 195.50 a tonne, a fall of Dollars 13.50 on the week. Man now puts this season's production at 113.8m tonnes, compared with its previous estimate of 110.4m tonnes. It points out that this is the largest rise in output since 1981-82. 'Although sporadic short term rallies cannot be discounted  ...the weight of the existing as well as the impending supply surpluses should depress values, forcing prices to drift lower,' Man says. Coffee prices have been flat, with the market keeping one ear cocked for any news from the International Coffee Organisation's executive board meeting. However the meeting, which ended yesterday, threw no new light on the stance of Brazil, the world's biggest producer, towards a revival of the export quota system.  ---------------------------------------      LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS     (As at Thursday's close)  --------------------------------------- tonnes Aluminium    +3,075  to  363,725 Copper       +5,800  to  237,875 Lead           +125  to   72,875 Nickel       +1,896  to    5,466 Zinc         +2,750  to  115,275 Tin            +285  to   16,645  ---------------------------------------</p>

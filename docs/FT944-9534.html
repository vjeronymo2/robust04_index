			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Molson to dispose of retail interests Canada's Molson Companies plans to narrow its focus to brewing and specialised chemicals, and to dispose of its retail hardware business. However, the company also warned yesterday that the present strike by North American ice-hockey players and a disappointing performance by Diversey, its international cleaning-services subsidiary, would push earnings for the fiscal year to March 1995 below last year's CDollars 125.7m (USDollars 92.5m). Molson owns the Montreal Canadiens, last year's champion hockey team, as well as the arena where it plays. A dispute over players' salaries has led to an indefinite postponment of the start of this year's season. Mr Mickey Cohen, chief executive, said yesterday Molson would leave the retail sector 'in an orderly fashion' over the next year or two. The retail interests, which include three chains of do-it-yourself hardware stores in Canada, generated 22 per cent of Molson's revenues of CDollars 2.97bn last year.</p>

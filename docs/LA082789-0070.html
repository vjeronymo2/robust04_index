			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A former Oakland School District payroll clerk is accused of using her Bible  study group in a scheme to embezzle more than $24,000 from the district, police  reported. Marie Louise Bell, 48, was arrested at her Richmond home on a warrant  charging her with grand theft. Police said Bell masterminded a kickback scheme  in which overtime and payroll records of some custodians were allegedly  falsified. Officers said Bell apparently selected the custodians at random and  on their paychecks would occasionally pay each of them a minimum of "several  hundred dollars for unworked overtime." After the custodians received their  first overtime payment, officer said Bell then contacted them and essentially  said, "If you like what we're doing we can keep it up, but I get some."  </P></p>

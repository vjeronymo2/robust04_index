			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOVAK ON AMERICANS MOVING UP  </P> <P> Perhaps Novak is right. It may be time for a flat tax for everybody.  </P> <P> Individuals, companies and corporation, with no tax exemptions or tax credits  for anyone. I can hear the screaming already.  </P> <P> No more abusing business-related expenses, because there will be no more  business-related exemptions. I am sure it will be easier for the IRS auditors.  No need for tax experts, lawyers, etc.  </P> <P> ROBERT C. NELSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

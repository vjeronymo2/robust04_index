			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Maytag and Bosch form business alliance MAYTAG, one of the five large US home appliance manufacturers and owner of the Hoover brand in Europe, said yesterday that it was forming a 'business alliance' with Germany's Bosch-Siemens Hausgerate, Europe's second-largest household appliance group after the Swedish Electrolux group. The two companies said the aim was to explore possibilities for marketing each other's products. They would also examine opportunities for combining customer service activities; for sourcing of components and materials; and research and development work. However, although a 'joint senior executive committee' will draw up agreements, no ownership tie - via the purchase of shares - is expected. The move is the latest in a series of alliances and acquisitions struck between US and European domestic appliance manufacturers, as the industry consolidates. Whirlpool, the biggest manufacturer of home appliances in the US, recently took over Philips's domestic appliance business, based in Holland; General Electric of the US linked in a joint venture with its UK namesake; Maytag itself acquired the Hoover business four years ago. Since 1988, however, Maytag has encountered problems in Europe, incurring a Dollars 22.9m operating loss there in 1990, and a reduced Dollars 865,000 deficit last year on sales of about Dollars 500m. Last month, the US manufacturer - which ranks fourth in its home market after Whirlpool, General Electric and Electrolux - announced it was taking a Dollars 95m charge against profits, mainly to cover a 'downsizing' of its European operations. Maytag's turnover worldwide in 1991 was Dollars 2.97bn, and net profits, Dollars 79m. Its shares closed in New York yesterday up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 14 3/4.</p>

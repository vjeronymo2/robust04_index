			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> BLACKHAWKS ROUT OILERS, 5-1, TO TAKE LEAD IN SERIES  </P> <P> Steve Larmer had the goals, but gave the credit to Denis Savard.  </P> <P> Larmer scored the tying and go-ahead goals, and Savard had three assists Sunday  night as the Chicago Blackhawks took a 2-1 lead in their NHL semifinal playoff  series with a 5-1 rout of the Edmonton Oilers.  </P> <P> "A lot of the credit has to go to Denny," Larmer said. "He was hurt late in the  season and had his troubles early in the playoffs. But tonight he was on top of  his game. The pass he made on the goal that made it 3-1 was a typical Savard  play. He took it away from the Oilers and set me up perfectly."  </P> <P> Game 4 will be played at Chicago Tuesday night, with Game 5 Thursday night at  Edmonton.  </P> <P> Dirk Graham clinched the victory with his specialty, a short-handed goal at  7:27 of the final period. It was the first playoff goal for Graham, who led the  Blackhawks with three shorthanded goals during the regular season.  </P> <P> Edmonton Coach John Muckler lamented some missed chances.  </P> <P> "We had our opportunities and never scored," Muckler said. "They had theirs and  scored.  </P> <P> "If we can come back to tie the series and go home tied, we'll be in good  shape. We're getting chances but we're not putting it away.'  </P> <P> Chicago's Greg Millen stopped 31 shots for his second consecutive victory over  the Oilers.  </P> <P> The Oilers took the early lead at 6:01 of the first period on a power-play goal  by Craig Simpson, his ninth of the playoffs.  </P> <P> Edmonton's Esa Tikkanen went off for interference at 6:35 and five seconds  after the penalty expired, Bob Murray's goal tied the game.  </P> <P> Larmer's goal at 12:32 of the first period gave Chicago a 2-1 lead.  </P> <P> Larmer scored on a pass from Savard at 3:05 of the second period to make it  3-1.  </P></p>

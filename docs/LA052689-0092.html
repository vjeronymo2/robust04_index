			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRIMINAL LINKS TO IOWA A POSSIBILITY, NAVY SAYS;  </P> <P> SERVICE CONTENDS SAILORS' RUPTURED FRIENDSHIP MAY HAVE LED TO THOUGHTS OF  MURDER OR SUICIDE  </P> <P> The investigation into the April 19 explosion that killed 47 sailors on the  battleship Iowa has "a criminal aspect to it," the Pentagon disclosed Thursday  in confirming reports that a ruptured friendship between two members of the gun  turret crew may have led one or both of them to ponder murder or suicide.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Navy announced that the surviving member of the friendship,  Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall L. Truitt, 21, has been transferred off the  Iowa before it was to depart on a six-month deployment June 6. Citing the  "extensive publicity surrounding the Iowa explosion," the service reassigned  Truitt "in the best interests of Petty Officer Truitt, the Iowa and the Navy,"  a Navy spokesman said.  </P> <P> Truitt was one of only 11 men in the ill-fated second gun turret to survive the  blast. The other subject of the current investigation -- 24-year-old Gunner's  Mate 2nd Class Clayton Michael Hartwig -- died in the explosion, leaving Truitt  as the beneficiary of a $100,000 life insurance policy, Navy officials said.  </P> <P> Hartwig, as a gun captain in Turret 2, would have been one of the last men to  handle the 550-pound bag of explosive powder that ignited to trigger the blast.  </P> <P> Kathleen Kubicina, Hartwig's sister, told The Times from her home in Cleveland  that federal and Navy investigators had questioned her and her family at length  about Hartwig's relationship with Truitt. Kubicina, who is contesting Truitt's  claim to the insurance money, was among the first to alert naval investigators  to the insurance policy, Navy officials said.  </P> <P> Asked whether she believes that either Hartwig or Truitt had engineered the  fatal blast, Kubicina said: "I absolutely do not believe that."  </P> <P> In the wake of widespread reports that investigators found explosive devices  among the possessions of Truitt and Hartwig, officials said that the inquiry  has proved inconclusive so far.  </P> <P> "We have no evidence to prove homicide or suicide here," said Deborah Johnson,  an agent with the Naval Investigative Service in Norfolk, Va., where the Iowa  is based. She described theories of homicide or suicide as "possibilities among  many possibilities."  </P> <P> But investigators so far have failed to find any evidence to suggest that the  crew of Turret 2 accidentally misloaded the gun or mishandled the explosive  powder that powers projectiles to distances of 23 miles. In the absence of  other strong clues to the cause of the explosion, the inquiry increasingly has  focused on the Hartwig-Truitt connection.  </P> <P> "There's nothing else," said a knowledgeable Navy source. "There's a lot of  confusion" among investigators, the source added.  </P> <P> Knowledgeable sources said that Navy criminal investigators on the West Coast  were questioning Truitt's friends about his relationship with Hartwig,  including the possibility that one or both men were homosexual. The  investigators also sought information from Truitt's former crew mates now based  in San Diego about the insurance policy that Hartwig purchased and what Truitt  knew about it.  </P> <P> Gay rights groups protested the Navy's focus on the relationship between  Hartwig and Truitt.  </P> <P> "It's not surprising that the Navy would blame the Iowa disaster on personal  emotions rather than on military negligence, particularly when they could also  then claim support for their ridiculous argument that gays are unfit for  military service," said Craig Davidson, executive director of the New  York-based Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.  </P> <P> Staff writer Carla Lazzareschi contributed to this story from Los Angeles.  </P></p>

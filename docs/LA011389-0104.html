			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Bhopal District Judge M. W. Deo who was hearing the case for compensation to  victims of the 1984 gas leak in Bhopal, India, has been taken off the case,  officials said. The state High Court ruled in November that Deo was prejudiced  after Union Carbide Corp. complained that he ordered it to pay interim relief  of $290 million to victims before fixing liability for the leak. Deo was  transferred to a trial court at Mandleshwar in Madhya Pradesh state. Nirmal K.  Jain, another district judge, has been appointed to hear the case in Bhopal.  </P></p>

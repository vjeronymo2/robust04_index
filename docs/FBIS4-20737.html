			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article signed N.O.: "The FNS-2626 (National Solidarity </F> Fund) Program for 1994; 151,000 Recipients, 142 Towns, and 302  Projects"--first paragraph is LA PRESSE DE TUNISIE introduction]    [Text] "The sustained rate at which the first 1993  installment was completed provided a good argument in favor of  an ambitious 1994 program," according to Mr. Abdelkrim Azaiez,  FNS [National Solidarity Fund] president.    Thanks to the climate of confidence established in the  country since the change, and thanks to the sunshine measures  adopted with respect to the handling of collected funds, the  programs launched by the FNS (2626) in 1993 were very  successful. This success marks the emergence of an unprecedented  spirit of solidarity in Tunisia which, with this unique  experiment, has found the most efficient way to enable mutual  aid and solidarity to take root among citizens, and to fight  poverty wherever it may be.    Already, the results achieved are more than satisfactory  since 27 million dinars[D] were spent in 108 different towns on  behalf of 141,600 destitute individuals and to start 272  projects.    The projects, launched in the country's disadvantaged,  remote, and isolated regions aim to improve the living  conditions of citizens, in particular the underprivileged, to  promote their integration in their respective environment, and  to create conditions enabling them to settle down. This is why  priority is given to infrastructure projects in these still  underdeveloped regions, to provide them with electricity,  drinking water, paved and unpaved roads, schools and medical  clinics, and eventually to create stable jobs, especially in  farming.    In this respect, Mr. Abdelkrim Azaiez, chairman of the FNS  standing commission indicated yesterday, at a press conference,  that "the sustained rate at which the first 1993 installment was  completed provided a good argument in favor of an ambitious 1994  program." Besides, the restricted ministers council of 17  February took note with pleasure of the satisfactory completion  of the FNS 1993 programs and of the new projects adopted for  1994, to which D35 million were allocated.  <H5>  All Regions Affected </H5>   To assess the impact of the projects started in 1993, Mr.  Abdelkrim Azaiez enumerated the construction of 2,830 housing  units, 18 primary schools, 29 clinics, and 257 km of roads of  which 120 km were paved.    All of the country's remote, isolated, and poor regions were  affected by these programs. And the people in these regions,  which could not be provided with water or electricity under  ordinary government programs, can now measure the results of  this beautiful instance of national solidarity initiated by  President Ben Ali.    To ensure that these people remain on location, special  programs designed to improve their living conditions were  already launched, and financing of up to D1.6 million was  provided by the Rural Development Program.    The 1994 program promises to be ambitious since it will  affect 151,000 individuals and 142 towns, and will involve the  completion of 302 projects.    This program was prepared on the basis of objective criteria  adopted after consultations with regional authorities and visits  on location by members of the FNS standing commission.  <H5>  The Northwest and West Central Regions </H5>   Mr. Abdelkrim Azaiez announced that the second installment  of  the programs launched in November 1993 will be completed by next  May. He added that cost control was an essential consideration  in completing these projects. There is no secret in that,  considering that contractors who take on FNS-financed projects  cut their profit margins to a minimum, that technical studies  are performed in the regions for free, and that FNS management  is so flexible that construction companies are reimbursed for  their expenses without delay.    As far as the regional distribution of projects and credits  is concerned, we can say that the northwest and west central  regions were those that benefitted most from FNS projects.  <H5>  Assessment by Academics </H5>   To fight poverty and the lack of infrastructures, the  northwest region was granted a budget of D6.7 million in 1993;  this amount was increased to D9.4 million in 1994. The west  central region (Kasserine, Kairouan, and Sidi Bouzid) will be  allocated about D6.2 million in 1994.    Mr. Abdelkrim Azaiez indicated that, following the  completion  of the first 1993 program instalment, the standing commission  invited academics and researchers from the Tunis University  Center for Economic and Social Studies and Research to give  their opinion on the methods used to establish priorities and  select towns and projects, and to evaluate the impact of these  projects on the beneficiaries. On the whole, the evaluation of  these experts was satisfactory.    Mr. Abdelkrim Azaiez concluded by estimating that, in spite  of the considerable effort made, there is still a long way to  go, which means that the national solidarity effort must be  consolidated in order to fight poverty efficiently.    Besides, at the restricted ministers council of 17 February,  the chief of state recommended to develop a plan so that the FNS  could operate in all the dark areas within the next seven years.    Actually, 1,780 dark areas have been identified to date,  with  a total population of 1 million; these zones include 18,258  slums and 79,730 poor families.    A 1992 evaluation of the credits required to reach all these  areas shows that at least D714 million must be found.    Today, we have somehow completed the first few steps, which  are also the most difficult. But now that confidence and  sunshine methods characterize the allocation of these credits in  the new Tunisia, the spirit of solidarity will be expected to  express itself more strongly. Its scope and significance are of  crucial importance and, with the confidence that now prevails in  the country, it should find more than one way to thrive.

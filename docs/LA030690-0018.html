			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $3-MILLION OUTRAGE -- AND COUNTING  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors takes a back seat to no one when it  comes to keeping a lean, mean budget. Need more county mental-health services?  Tough. There was a $3- million budget shortfall. Sorry, the majority of the  board told mental-health-care advocates pleading for mercy, we just can't  squeeze another nickel out of the budget.  </P> <P> But wait! The magicians on the board now seem to have found $3 million. For the  mentally ill? Forget it. To shelter homeless people on cold winter nights? In  your dreams. The board has found 3 million taxpayer dollars -- and counting --  for something truly dear to their hearts: their own political hides.  </P> <P> The dollar total mounts as the county continues its legal battle to fight the  righteous, and the inevitable: a redistricting lawsuit aimed at providing fair  political representation for the county's 3 million Latinos. The county is  fighting not only the American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican American  Legal Defense and Educational Fund but the U.S. Justice Department as well.  </P> <P> According to the county, the lawsuit is not about fair representation for  Latinos but about preserving local control and home rule. Apparently, the  county does not want the federal government to impose its oddball notions of  representative government on the all-white board -- a description that still  holds for most, Supervisor Pete Schabarum's recently trumpeted Latino heritage  notwithstanding.  </P> <P> The board majority's priorities are sadly evident; its rationale for paying a  private law firm $245 an hour completely transparent. What the county is paying  lawyers for one hour to defend the indefensible could feed, clothe, counsel and  give health care to 10 homeless children every day. That fact is nothing short  of shameful.  </P> <P> The federal trial is expected to be over in a few weeks. The county has already  declared that if it loses, it will appeal, which is a signal that it apparently  is ready to spend an endless amount of taxpayer money to maintain the  supervisors' political fiefdoms. Whatever the legal outcome, the board  majority's decision to fight a costly political battle -- while poor-mouthing  the homeless and the mentally ill -- is a memory that should be carried to the  polls in future elections by every voter of conscience.  </P></p>

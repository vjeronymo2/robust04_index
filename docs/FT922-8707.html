			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Coats calls halt to Lantor talks Coats Viyella, the UK's largest textile company, has called a halt to talks concerning its proposed sale of Lantor, the nonwoven materials business, to the privately owned Freudenberg Group of Germany.  Coats said that Lantor, acquired as part of Tootal last year was not now for sale. Mr Sam Dow, Coats company secretary, said that the sale had been cancelled to 'settle the minds of shareholders', adding that agreement on price had not been reached.  In March, it was thought Lantor might fetch less than Pounds 25m: when Tootal bought the 49.9 per cent it did not already own in 1988, the valuation of the whole company was nearer Pounds 40m. Mr Dow also said the interest of the German Cartel Office could have added about four months to the disposal discussions.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (18): How to give advisers the litmus test - Questions you should ask FINANCIAL ADVISERS come in many different guises. They can be an alternative name for insurance company or unit trust salesmen; employees of banks or building societies; or pukka financial consultants. So the first question when dealing with financial advisers should be aimed at checking that they are authorised to give investment advice, and on what subjects. That sorts out the wheat from the chaff. If you receive an honest answer, you should at least know whether you are talking to an independent financial adviser, company representative or a 'tied' agent. The company representatives and tied agent should explain that they are only able to offer the range of products sold by one particular company. But salesmen are salesmen. Therefore you might need to ask a few supplementary questions to get a really clear picture. Ask to see a letterhead and/or business card. Asking for the name of the adviser's boss or contact at the company gives you someone to complain to if something goes wrong, and a possible checkpoint if you feel you are being misled. Once you have established what type of adviser you are dealing with, the next stage is to assess their status and competence. With company representatives and tied agents, this is mainly a check on the company they are representing. Has it got a good name and a reputation to protect, or have you never heard of it? It is a bit more difficult with independent advisers. You can ask how long they have been in business, how many people are employed, and what qualifications or experience the adviser has. Also, what they are authorised to advise upon; and whether they are specialists in any particular areas. In both cases you can then check with the central register of all the authorised firms of investment advisers, maintained by the Securities and Investments Board (SIB). The register lists their names, addresses and a description of the sort of business they are allowed to undertake. It also states whether or not the firm is permitted to handle clients' money  -another important question. If their names are not on the central register, prepare to move away smartly with your hand on your wallet. Competence and honesty, are more difficult to assess. However, you might prepare a few trick questions where you know the answers, and see whether the adviser looks blank, bluffs or gives correct replies. The simplest questions are often the most revealing. For example, two questions that might reveal whether the adviser is only interested in commission-earning products are: What's the difference between an investment trust and a unit trust? What are the current rates being paid on National Savings products? Another safeguard is to ask advisers to put their recommendations down in writing, so that you can judge them in the cold light of day. Possibly the most crucial question is how the adviser is remunerated - salary, bonuses, commission or fees. Unfortunately, with company representatives you are unlikely to get a straight answer. They are not obliged to tell you how and what they are paid. Tied agents are also not bound to reveal their commission and charging arrangements. Independent financial advisers, however, must give you details of how much they will earn from providing you with a particular product, provided you ask specifically. Most independent advisers still rely on commission for the bulk of their earnings, and this can obviously influence their judgment. However, equally relevant is how the individual consultant is remunerated. Some independent advisers pay their consultants salaries only to prevent their being swayed by the need to earn commission. Others pay a mixture of salary and commission to their consultants or themselves. Alternatively, there are a growing number of fee-based advisers who charge 'up front' for their services, although most of them do not rely exclusively on fees. The few simple questions listed with this article should at least prevent your being led up the garden path. Whether the advice proves to be any good is another matter. Key questions to ask a financial adviser: Are you authorised to give investment advice, and if so by whom? Are you fully independent, or are you employed or tied to a particular company and only able to recommend its products? Are you authorised to handle clients' money? What types of business are you authorised to give advice on, and are you permitted to operate discretionary accounts? Are you prepared to put your advice in writing? How are you remunerated? Salary only; salary plus bonuses and/or commission; commission only; fees only, or a mixture of fees and commission. John Edwards is a consultant with Berry Birch &amp; Noble</p>

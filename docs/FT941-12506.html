			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: US economy Financial markets had been primed for high US growth in the fourth quarter. The surprise was the weak inflation that accompanied yesterday's data with an implicit price deflator of only 1.3 per cent. That seems to give markets the perfect combination of high growth with low inflation. It can only help equities if there is an even longer interval for corporate earnings to grow before the Federal Reserve decides to tighten. The bond market, too, is clearly happy to be reprieved. There seems little likelihood of such high growth continuing. The Clinton administration was quick to point to reasons why the fourth quarter was an aberration; crop losses after last summer's floods were smaller in the fourth quarter than in the third and car production was abnormally high. It will take some time for present trends to become clear, though. Blizzards on the east coast and an earthquake on the west are bound to distort January's data. Higher investment spending on plant might prompt a downward revision to next month's capacity utilisation figures. That would sit badly with any monetary tightening. Yet the unusual sight of a US administration trying to talk down the growth rate is an indication of worry about how markets would react to any rise in short-term rates. While that concern may now go underground for a while, it is unlikely to disappear altogether and could resurface at any sign, rogue or otherwise, of economic strength. For bonds, this may yet be one of those occasions where it is better to arrive than to travel fearfully.</p>

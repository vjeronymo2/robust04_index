			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Numerous commenters recommended that a SPRE be required to give an institution a minimum number of days to respond to the findings and required actions contained in the SPRE's report to the institution. The commenters recommended that the minimum number be set at 30, 40, 45, 60, or 90 days, or be set by the Secretary in regulations. Most of the commenters argued that the setting of a minimum number of days was needed because the regulations did not provide for an appeal by an institution of the SPRE's findings to the Secretary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary understands the commenters' concerns that a SPRE could take a precipitous action against an institution by not allowing the institution sufficient time to respond to its report. As stated previously, however, the Secretary believes strongly that a SPRE is in the best position to determine the actions it should take in carrying out its review responsibilities, and, in view of the change made to &sect;667.23(d), the Secretary has no reason to believe that a SPRE would not afford an institution a reasonable time to respond to its report. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters were concerned that a SPRE might punish an institution by initiating a proceeding to effect the termination of the institution's participation in a title IV, HEA program if the institution did not respond ``quickly enough'' to the SPRE's request for information, access to the institution, or access to personnel at the institution. The commenters agreed, in principle, that an institution should not be able to thwart the efforts of a SPRE to obtain necessary information by refusing to provide to the SPRE information or access to the institution, but believed that the NPRM provided the SPRE too much authority. The commenters recommended removing two parts of the provision and modifying the third part so that a SPRE would take an action if ``*&blank;*&blank;* the institution exhibits a documented pattern of failure to allow SPRE personnel at the institution or repeated failure to provide SPRE officials with access to documents or records.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters believed that, although the proposed provisions were appropriate, some changes should be made. A few commenters argued that a SPRE should view all violations of the State's standards as serious violations and recommended that the term ``serious'' be removed from the phrase ``*&blank;*&blank;* the SPRE's findings show serious violations of the State's standards.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary does not agree that a SPRE must request repeatedly, and be denied repeatedly, information or access by an institution before taking an action. The Secretary agrees to remove the term ``serious,'' but in doing so does not intend that a SPRE take an action under these provisions for because of a technical violation by an institution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;667.23(g) is revised to remove the word ``serious.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters responded to the request in the NPRM regarding specific areas where SPRE performance standards should be established and how that performance should be evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters suggested that the Secretary should consider a SPRE's performance to be seriously deficient if the SPRE exhibits a pattern of (1) allowing reviewed institutions an excessive time to correct violations, or (2) not initiating termination proceedings against institutions for serious violations of the State's standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters suggested that the Secretary evaluate a SPRE's performance based on the SPRE's success in completing its objectives under the plan the SPRE submits annually to the Secretary, and on other areas related to the SPRE compliance with statutory requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary appreciates the commenters suggestions. Based on these suggestions, and upon further review, the Secretary has decided not to promulgate specific SPRE performance criteria because the Secretary already has, or will have, access to all of the information or records pertaining to the suggested criteria. In addition, the Secretary intends that on occasion Department of Education officials and representatives will accompany SPRE personnel in conducting reviews of referred institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 667.24&blank;Peer Review of Institutions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter, writing on behalf of an accrediting commission, objected strongly to the regulations and views expressed in the NPRM. The commenter argued that if States wish to use peer review systems other than recognized accrediting agencies, those peer review systems should be subject to an approval process established and administered by the Secretary along the lines of the proposal noted in the NPRM preamble. The commenter submitted that ceding the choice of peer review systems to the States would be an abdication of the Secretary's responsibilities and an invitation to abuse. According to the commenter, the goals of Congress for ensuring integrity in the title IV, HEA programs will not be met if, in the future, instances come to light where the quality reviews performed by ``peer review systems'' on behalf of SPREs have been found to be inadequate, politicized, or abused. In addition, the commenter believed that it could not be assumed that every SPRE would appropriately choose or create peer review systems that will be competent to assess institutions and programs. For these reasons, the commenter urged the Secretary to define in final regulations a ``peer review system'' and the process by which such systems are to have shown ``demonstrated competence in assessing programs.'' Many commenters echoed this commenter's views. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters suggested that the Secretary permit a SPRE the use of a ``peer review system'' only in cases where there is substantial reason to doubt the reliability of the accrediting agency's evaluation of an institution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters agreed that a SPRE should determine the competence of a peer review system and agreed that the criteria listed in the NPRM preamble are appropriate for making that determination. Some of these commenters suggested the following additional criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

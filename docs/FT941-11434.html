			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Auditors propose change in liability A working group of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has drafted proposals calling for the government to reform the law on the liability of auditors. Members of the group are calling for the removal of a legal provision which prohibits auditors from limiting the amount for which they can be sued. They are also recommending changes to the principle of joint and several liability, which allows any successful plaintiff to pursue any one of several defendants found to have acted wrongfully for the entire amount of a judgment. This can often mean accountants rather than directors or others being named in a writ, since they are perceived to have the deepest pockets. The proposals have to be ratified by the next institute council meeting in March. The arguments, which will be presented to the Department of Trade and Industry, echo calls for reform made in lobbying efforts by the largest eight accountancy firms. The institute goes further than the firms, which decided not to call for reform of joint and several liability, believing that a change was unlikely to find favour with the public. The group, chaired by Mr Graham Ward, a partner with Price Waterhouse, may yet run into difficulties with smaller accountancy firms and accountants in business, who believe the case for reform serves the interests of the largest firms.</p>

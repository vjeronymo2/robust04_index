			<p>Language: <F P=105> Somali </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Ali Mahdi Mohamed, the  president of the Republic of Somalia, called on the Somali  people, to choose between two options: Either that the peace  agreement signed in Nairobi should become a reality, or that  peace should be finally realized at home, in Somalia [as heard]  because this nation has gone through four years of civil war and  destruction, and should not undergo more fighting and suffering.  It is true that the Somali National Alliance should think about  ways to bring about peace in the country.    The president said that he believes that 100 percent of the  Somali people believe that peace should prevail, and hence he  hopes that the politicians will respect the wishes of the  people, since politicians are the servants of the people.

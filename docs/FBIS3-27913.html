The Ministry  is studying ways to eliminate the posts of 17 senior officials,  according to the official.    A senior official at the Ministry said, "there has been  criticism that the Ministry has too many special grade one  officials and too few working-level officials.    "A recent meeting of the Ministry's senior officials almost  agreed to the reduction of the organization's staff. If things  go well, we plan to receive approval from the minister and  revise the executive ordinance of the Public Servants' Law  covering foreign affairs. We want to begin the reduction within  the first half of this year."    Other ministries do not have the positions of special grade  one or two level officials, which are unique to the Foreign  Ministry.    Under the plan, the number of special grade one level  officials will decrease from 47 to 30 over five years, while  that of special grade two level officials at the assistant  minister level will be maintained at the current 35.    In contrast, the number of grade one level officials will  rise from the current 53 to 70.</p>

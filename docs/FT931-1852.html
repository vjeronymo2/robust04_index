			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Private cash urged for council homes PRIVATE-SECTOR capital could be used to modernise local-authority housing stock if councils transferred ownership of their estates to arms-length housing companies, says a report published yesterday by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation. The report says that transferring council estates to local housing companies would allow funds to be raised on the capital markets without increasing the public sector borrowing requirement. The move could produce savings in public expenditure of Pounds 16bn for the Treasury, releasing funds for building affordable rented accommodation. Sir George Young, the housing minister, welcomed the report and promised the environment department would examine it 'with great care'. He warned, however, that any new approach would have to be attractive to tenants and investors, as well as local authorities and the government. The Rowntree report investigates ways in which local authorities could borrow against the security of their housing stock to modernise and repair council homes. At present such borrowing counts towards the public sector borrowing requirement and is therefore controlled by the Treasury. Nineteen councils have arranged to transfer their estates to housing associations which can borrow outside the PSBR. Many, however - especially in inner cities - cannot do this because the current value of their housing stock is less than the debt outstanding on it. Councils would retain a non-controlling interest, with tenants' representatives on the boards. Local Housing Companies. Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 40 Water End, York YO3 6LP. Pounds 7.50.</p>

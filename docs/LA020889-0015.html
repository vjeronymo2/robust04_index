			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DIXON AND LINCOLN SLOW OLP'S RUN TOWARD TITLE  </P> <P> Our Lady of Peace, leading by eight with 3 minutes left in the third quarter,  looked as if it would defeat Lincoln for the second time and all but wrap up  the City Central League girls' basketball championship.  </P> <P> But Lincoln's 6-foot-2 sophomore center, Sheila Dixon, had different ideas.  </P> <P> During the final 11 minutes, Dixon scored 13 of her game-high 29 points to lead  Lincoln past OLP, 57-51, Tuesday at St. Augustine's gym and keep the Hornets'  title hopes alive.  </P> <P> OLP (16-5, 6-1) is striving for its first league title after beginning  basketball just three years ago. The Pilots still lead Lincoln (14-5, 5-2) and  San Diego (9-10, 5-2) by a game with three left for each team.  </P> <P> With league games remaining against San Diego, Hoover (1-12, 0-7) and Crawford  (6-14, 2-5), OLP would have been in excellent position for the championship had  it beaten Lincoln.  </P> <P> "A win would have really iced the cake," said Carol Burnett, OLP's coach.  </P> <P> The Hornets, who lost to OLP earlier (57-56), this time used their overwhelming  height advantage to dominate the boards, especially on the offensive end.  Dixon, with 16 rebounds (eight offensive) was the leader.  </P> <P> "I was more aggressive, and I got more rebounds today," said Dixon, who stands  six inches higher than OLP's tallest starter.  </P> <P> "(Height) is our biggest problem," Burnett said, "We don't have any. We have to  be smart, and we have to be fast. Today, we weren't. And that's why we lost."  </P> <P> Trailing, 29-27, at the half, OLP went on a 14-4 run led by Tammy Tavares (18  points, seven steals, six assists). Lincoln then went on a 14-3 run to retake  the lead, 47-44.  </P> <P> It was 52-49, Lincoln, with 2:08 remaining, when Dixon got an offensive  rebound, scored and was fouled. She made the free throw, then another quick  basket after an OLP turnover, and Lincoln led, 57-49. Tavares' 15-footer with  26 seconds left ended the scoring.  </P> <P> Keisha Mobley scored 12 points and had eight rebounds for Lincoln. Kathy Bashi  scored 12 points, Deanna Beauparlante 11 and April Velk 10 for OLP. JIM  LINDGREN  </P></p>

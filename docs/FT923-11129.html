			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Letter: Borrowing requirement and money supply Sir, John Plender's excellent article ('Uncertainty in a stable world', July 22) regarding strains in the housing market referred to Greenwell Montagu's strong view that the government's 'full funding' rule, whereby the PSBR is fully offset by net sales of gilts outside the banking and building society sectors, should be amended in the current economic climate. It seems to us odd, to say the least, that under this rule the effect of the PSBR on the money supply is more or less exactly neutralised whether the economy is in boom or slump. Surely it would be better to overfund in economic boom times and underfund at times of recession like now. Underfunding would have several beneficial effects. Broad money supply growth would be pushed up by approximately the amount of underfunding. Yields on long-dated gilt stocks would fall as the supply of new stock became smaller. The investing institutions would have more money to invest in other assets such as equities and property, giving a much needed boost to the price levels of those markets. Mr Plender is not correct, however, in concluding that underfunding would lead to higher short-term interest rates. He presumably comes to this conclusion by arguing that, if the government sells fewer gilts and more Treasury bills, this would push Treasury bill rates higher. In practice, the government decides the overall level of money interest rates and the effect of small or large bill issues is almost negligible. This is probably most easily explained by considering the effect on the banking system of, say, Pounds 10bn underfunding. This would increase bank deposits (ie, money supply) by Pounds 10bn and would be available to buy Pounds 10bn of Treasury bills or short-dated gilts. There is thus no significant imbalance to put pressure on interest rates one way or the other. It is difficult to see why the government has not already embraced the idea of underfunding when virtually all other options of stimulating the economy are closed by ERM constraints. It is possible to argue about the extent of the beneficial effects set out above, but I have heard no one argue that the effect would not be in the right directon.

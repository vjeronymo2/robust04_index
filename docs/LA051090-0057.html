			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> LOCKING UP 'SEXUAL PREDATORS';  </P> <P> A PUBLIC OUTCRY IN WASHINGTON STATE TARGETED REPEAT VIOLENT SEX CRIMINALS. A  NEW PREVENTIVE LAW WOULD KEEP THEM IN JAIL INDEFINITELY.  </P> <P> Ida Ballasiotes' first thought, upon hearing the criminal history of the man  who'd raped and killed her daughter, came in the form of a question.  </P> <P> What was this guy doing out of jail? she wondered.  </P> <P> After all, the authorities had known Gene Raymond Kane was dangerous. He'd  attacked two other women 13 years before, and he'd been sitting in prison ever  since. He'd received no treatment during that time, mainly because a mental  hospital considered him too dangerous to handle. In 1985, a prison psychologist  thought Kane's chance for successful adjustment to society "quite poor." Still,  officials in mid-1988 had decided to "transition" Kane back into the community  through a downtown Seattle work-release center. He'd been there just two months  when he killed Diane Ballasiotes on Sept. 26, 1988.  </P> <P> Dwelling on these facts, Ida Ballasiotes found her puzzlement swelling into a  rage. Diane's death was not like an earthquake, she told herself. It wasn't an  act of God. They had this man's record staring at him. They knew.  </P> <P> "No one can bring our daughter back," she wrote Washington's governor, Booth  Gardner, a week after Diane's murder. "The light has gone from our hearts. But,  be assured, we will work and mobilize forces to get change and reform . . . ."  </P> <P> The initial response from state authorities was uncomplicated and distinctly  colored by their sense for the fundamentals of the law. Gene Kane was out of  jail, they explained, because he'd finished serving his full sentence. The  state could not confine him any longer. The state could hold a person only for  what he'd done, not for what he might do.  </P> <P> "What were the alternatives?" wrote Chase Riveland, secretary of the state  department of corrections. "The suspect could not have been retained  indefinitely in maximum security. Law and court decisions demanded his release  imminently."  </P> <P> "Sadly, we know statistically that there will be inmates who will re-offend,  yet no foolproof system has been developed to accurately predict on an  individual basis who those people will be . . . ." added Gov. Gardner.  </P> <P> Ida Ballasiotes' fury only deepened as she studied these replies. They lose  sight of what the hell happened here, she thought. Let's strip it away to what  happened. Someone is responsible.  </P> <P> Ballasiotes sat down at her typewriter. She was not quite finished with her  letter writing.  </P> <P> So began a grass-roots citizens campaign in Washington that has forced  authorities into treacherous territory. How to preserve the letter and spirit  of the Constitution while still keeping dangerous people such as Gene Kane off  the streets? It is an abiding dilemma within the judicial system, exacerbated  everywhere by the growing public alarm over drugs and crime. A decision to  detain someone in order to prevent a future crime may be prudent, may be rooted  in realistic assessment, but it's not consistent with the law's most basic  tenets.  </P> <P> The state of Washington, however, has decided to try some tinkering.  </P> <P> On Feb. 28, Gov. Gardner signed into law an omnibus package aimed at violent  sex offenders. Among the new statute's several provisions is a civil commitment  procedure that will allow authorities to confine in locked treatment centers,  until they are cured, a group of people defined as "sexual predators." A sexual  predator, as spelled out in the law, is one who has previously committed a  violent sex crime and now is found by a judge and jury to suffer a "mental  abnormality" or "personality disorder" which makes him "likely to engage in  predatory acts of sexual violence."  </P> <P> In other words, the law will allow the state, acting on predictions of future  dangerousness, to confine indefinitely people who are not mentally ill, as  defined by medical specialists, and who do not have a criminal charge pending  against them.  </P> <P> Questions have been raised by those who believe the law will prove neither  effective nor legal, but their numbers are few, and their voices muted. Many  more people have fought to make the new law even tougher. Not the least  intriguing element of Washington's current situation is the manner in which the  authors of the sex offender law have emerged as a moderating influence.  </P> <P> "The alternative was to lock up hundreds or thousands of people for life," said  King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng, who headed the task force that drafted the  new law. "Our way was much more selective."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Familiar Ring  </P> <P> It was the particulars that made Diane Ballasiotes' death especially  disturbing. She'd left her job at a downtown Seattle advertising agency one  evening at 5:30 and just disappeared. The missing-person posters her friends  nailed everywhere described her as 5 feet-5 inches, 110 pounds, 29 years old,  with curly shoulder-length auburn hair. Last seen, the poster said, leaving the  1st and Yesler area of Pioneer Square, heading toward the 3rd and Yesler U-Park  garage, dressed in a navy skirt and tennis sweater. A Park Department employee  had found the body a week later, while looking for garbage being dumped in  another part of town, along Cheasty Boulevard South.  </P> <P> Diane Ballasiotes' murder alone would not, however, have brought the present  upheaval. Even when a group called Friends of Diane began staging rallies and  circulating petitions, the state government's response was muted. Then came two  more violent sexual assaults, involving circumstances with a familiar ring.  </P> <P> First, in December of 1988, a man broke into the apartment of a 23-year-old  Pierce County woman, removed a light bulb and lay in wait in her darkened  bedroom. When she returned, he tied her to the bed, raped her and slashed her  with a knife. The assailant was Gary Minnix, who'd been charged with four  vicious knife-related rapes in 1986 and linked by Seattle police to 22 other  such cases. He'd never been convicted though -- he'd been found incompetent to  stand trial because he was mentally retarded, with an IQ possibly as low as 48.  He'd eventually ended up at Western State Hospital, but authorities there had  no legal basis to keep him under tight security. He was a "gravely disabled"  person, after all, not a convicted criminal. He was on his sixth weekend  furlough when he assaulted the Pierce County woman.  </P> <P> Then, five months later, in May of 1989, a 7-year-old boy riding his bike near  his Tacoma home was dragged into the nearby woods, raped, choked nearly to  death and sexually mutilated. Before leaving him semi-conscious in the dirt,  Earl K. Shriner cut off the boy's penis. Shriner's history, and his heinous  crime, proved the most disturbing of all to people in Washington.  </P> <P> Shriner had a 24-year record of assaults on young people, dating back to an  involvement in the killing of a 15-year-old schoolmate when he was 16.  Diagnosed at the age of 3 as being mentally retarded, he'd spent his youth in  juvenile centers, schools for the disabled and -- when he became too violent --  a mental institution.  </P> <P> Upon his release in his mid-20s, he'd kidnapped and assaulted two teen-age  girls and subsequently had been sentenced to prison for 10 years. Aware of his  history, authorities never considered him for parole -- he served his full  sentence. Faced finally with the prospect of releasing Shriner in May of 1987,  corrections officials still balked -- they tried to get him committed  involuntarily to Western State Hospital. But doctors ruled he didn't meet the  legal criteria, because he wasn't mentally ill or, just then, acting in a  violently dangerous manner.  </P> <P> That didn't mean he wasn't a likely danger in the future. A psychiatric  evaluation at that time said Shriner "has unusual sexually sadistic fantasies  and plans to carry them out." This was an accurate enough appraisal, since  Shriner had once told a cellmate he wanted a van with cages so he could pick up  children and imprison, sexually abuse and kill them. By law, though, Shriner  couldn't be confined for an ominous statement or a sinister psychological  profile.  </P> <P> At the time, the state could only commit people if they suffered from a  distinct, recognized mental disorder making them immediately and substantially  dangerous to themselves or others. The state couldn't commit a dangerous person  who wasn't mentally ill. The state also couldn't commit a dangerous person if  his mental illness wasn't the cause of his dangerousness.  </P> <P> "He had served every day of his sentence," a corrections official explained  later. "He served all the time he was supposed to serve."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Public Outrage  </P> <P> There are those who now ask bitterly why it took a boy's rape and mutilation  before a male-dominated system responded. "It's because the Legislature is male  and could relate to it," concluded Helen Harlow, mother of the mutilated Tacoma  boy. But it might also have had something to do with the particularly ferocious  public outrage aroused by Shriner's assault.  </P> <P> Last July, Friends of Diane and a new group called the Tennis Shoe Brigade  marched on the state capitol in Olympia, where they dumped thousands of tennis  shoes -- a symbol of children's vulnerability, they explained -- in Gov.  Gardner's outer office. "These are the shoes of a beautiful 18-year-old girl  who was murdered last summer," read the unsigned note attached to a pair of  white exercise shoes. Holding aloft her son's red high-top sneakers, Helen  Harlow said: "He could be anybody's child. He could be anybody's grandchild."  </P> <P> Across the state, disparate voices joined the protest. People who'd never  before written public officials now lifted pens. Employees in restaurants  organized fund drives for the maimed Tacoma boy. Thousands called elected  officials to demand change. Plans were formed to convert the site of Shriner's  attack into a park named after his victim (who was undergoing apparently  successful reconstructive surgery). "The degree of outrage and mobilization . .  . is unprecedented in recent history," prosecutor Maleng observed of this  uprising.  </P> <P> The citizen's demands were uncomplicated: Don't let these kind of assaults  happen. Figure out a way to keep people of this sort confined. Don't let them  out. Give them life sentences, or put them away somewhere forever. And don't  drag your heels doing this.  </P> <P> Over and over, the Tennis Shoe Brigade and Friends of Diane demanded that  Gardner convene a special session of the Legislature to pass emergency  legislation. The governor, a moderate Democrat, did not want to do it. "There's  a lot of passion out there," his spokesman, Dick Milne, observed at one point,  "but it would be wrong to react at a gut level to this. We can't overnight  start devising laws that are going to stand up in court."  </P> <P> Instead, Gardner last summer appointed a "task force on community protection,"  hoping it would channel the citizen's outrage into a more measured, reasoned  process.  </P> <P> Some still were dubious. "I didn't even want the task force convened," said one  of its members, state legislator Marlin Appelwick, chairman of the House  Judiciary Committee. "The public mood, in Pierce County particularly, was near  vigilantism. I feared we'd be forced to do very radical extreme things."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Political Stroke  </P> <P> It is now generally acknowledged that picking King County prosecutor Norm  Maleng to head the task force represented a masterful political stroke by  Gardner, one that eased concerns such as Appelwick's and neutralized possible  critics on both sides. Maleng had been Gardner's Republican opponent in the  last gubernatorial race.  </P> <P> "Maleng is very widely respected, a brilliant pick," said Bob Boruchowitz,  director of the Seattle-King County Public Defenders Assn. "You know it's not  going to be a whitewash when you pick your opponent, and with Maleng you also  know it's not going to be a screaming crazy guy. He is reasonable."  </P> <P> After a series of emotionally moving public hearings, where 151 victims rose to  tell their often harrowing stories -- the picnic table gang rape of a  3-year-old girl by her father and his friends being one that stuck in some  minds -- the job of drafting much of the sex predator bill fell to task force  member David Boerner, a University of Puget Sound law professor. Boerner, too,  was considered a reasonable man even by opponents. He was a liberal-minded  former prosecutor who, seeing there were going to be changes, told colleagues  he thought it best to get involved in the process in order to limit its effect.  </P> <P> One by one, elements of the bill fell into place, fashioned by a group that  included Ida Ballasiotes, Helen Harlow and two other representatives from  victims' families among the customary professors, prosecutors, doctors and  social workers.  </P> <P> The bill greatly increased prison sentences for sex crimes. The bill allowed  police to warn the public when sexual offenders were being released from  confinement. The bill created a central registry of released offenders,  including photographs and fingerprints. The bill provided expanded services and  treatment both for victims and youthful offenders.  </P> <P> Task force members were particularly proud of this last provision and the  considerable state funding it mandated. To have an impact, they explained after  their months of research, you must get to sexually active juveniles as early as  possible.  </P> <P> None of these provisions, however, addressed the central question the task  force had been formed to answer: What to do about the Earl Shriners and Gary  Minnixes and Gene Kanes, once they are adults? Yes, some are retarded, and yes,  most as children suffered horrible beatings and sexual abuse by alcoholic  parents -- but now what?  </P> <P> It was, Maleng, Boerner and their colleagues knew, not at all a simple  question.  </P> <P> "Incarceration of people not mentally ill because of what they might do is  'preventive' penal detention which is an unconstitutional infringement of the  right to due process and equal protection," the task force itself pointed out  in an early briefing paper. "The state must prove that a person has committed  crimes before depriving the person of their liberty."  </P> <P> The procedures for involuntary commitment were restrictive for good reason, the  task force added: "Our current state law was developed during a reform period  when arbitrary and indefinite commitments of individuals were a major concern.  The law was designed to limit the considerable discretion the medical  professional had over continued commitment of patients, as well as limiting the  power of family members in committing individuals."  </P> <P> Of course, there were plenty of people, some on the task force, who didn't much  care about the commitment laws anyway. They felt the response to sexual  predators should be kept within the criminal justice system. Washington and  most states, after all, for decades had tried treating sex offenders in  hospitals under various sex psychopathy laws, only to back away from that  approach in recent years, mainly because it hadn't worked. Those sent to  hospitals proved just as likely to commit additional crimes as those sent to  prison.  </P> <P> So forget treatment, argued many in Washington, including the state attorney  general. Instead, greatly increase sentences. And give life sentences for  second offenses -- 104 months instead of 52 months doesn't make a person safer  when he gets out.  </P> <P> This prison-over-treatment attitude, as it happens, reflects the current trend  in most states. Even Illinois and Massachusetts, the two states with  civil-commitment laws somewhat similar to Washington's new statute, are  considering their repeal.  </P> <P> Maleng and his colleagues, however, decided to buck this return to a reliance  on the criminal system. Required, but not overly eager, to act, they wanted a  narrower and less bluntly edged alternative.  </P> <P> The task force members knew the state was free to define broadly what  constituted "mental illness" and "treatment." So why not, they reasoned, create  a new diagnostic category, making eligible for commitment those "likely to  engage in predatory acts of sexual violence."  </P> <P> In the end, the task force chose to define "acts of sexual violence" broadly:  They included the major sex offenses -- rape, indecent liberties, child  molestation -- and also lesser offenses such as second-degree assault and  residential burglary, provided that those crimes were "determined to have been  sexually motivated."  </P> <P> Those deemed likely to commit such crimes could be confined in a treatment  center -- within a prison grounds -- if they were nearing the end of a criminal  sentence or juvenile detention, if they'd been found not guilty of a sex  offense by reason of insanity or if they'd been determined incompetent to stand  trial on a sex offense charge.  </P> <P> Confinement could be ordered only by a judge at the request of a county  prosecutor. There would be a jury trial, where the defendant could have a  lawyer and expert witnesses, and the state would have to prove its case beyond  a reasonable doubt. If committed, the "predator" would be provided treatment  and an annual review by state authorities, who could release him if they deemed  him cured. And he could petition for release on his own, and get it, if he  proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he was cured.  </P> <P> It cannot be said that Maleng, Boerner and others on the task force were  unaware of the objections this plan would arouse. After all, they themselves  had spelled out some of them in their earlier briefing papers. Two particular  problems suggested themselves immediately. The proposed bill called upon  medical personnel to treat people whom history and the doctors themselves  generally say are untreatable. And it asked psychiatrists to predict future  dangerousness, even though research overwhelmingly showed that these experts  were wrong in at least two out of three cases.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Preventive Detention  </P> <P> Some doctors and lawyers soon enough raised just these points, and others. Talk  as much as you will about treatment and commitment, they argued, what this  comes down to is preventive detention. The people you've targeted are not  mentally ill, and can't be treated. They're criminals, pure and simple. Some  are developmentally disabled. You've carved out of thin air a false medical  diagnosis, as an excuse to hold people indefinitely. It sounds a lot like the  old, discredited sex psychopathy laws. And how would the detention ever end?  </P> <P> "How many psychiatrists do you know who will go to court and say this guy is  OK?" asked Dr. James Reardon, a psychiatrist representing the Washington State  Psychiatric Assn. who works with prisoners and the involuntarily committed.  "Can you imagine the liability? You are trying to make medical people into  agents of social control, into policemen . . . . We urge you to accept the  limitations of science and medical practice. Lock up the rapists, murderers and  the armed robbers for a long time if you will. But do not commit them for  treatment."  </P> <P> "There is a duality here," added John LaFond, Boerner's colleague at the  University of Puget Sound law school and a specialist in mental health law.  "First the system treats certain offenders as criminal wrongdoers, in control  of their actions. Then when their sentence is up, it says he's in need of  treatment, is not responsible for his actions. I call this 'labeling of  convenience.' "  </P> <P> If there was substance to the various objections, however, there was also a  certain tentativeness. In the end, only a handful of those opposed to the sex  predator bill spoke publicly, and most kept their voices unusually low.  </P> <P> The state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, in fact, chose not to  testify at all during the legislative hearings, concluding it would be  counterproductive, with emotions running so high. The lone civil liberties  advocate on the task force, Robert Stalker from Evergreen Legal Services, also  remained quiet. "My political assessment was there was no point in opposing  this," he explained later.  </P> <P> One state psychologist, an expert in the sex offender field, said she kept her  doubts private because her boss supported the proposed bill. A lawyer, asking  anonymity, said that he'd hesitated even to talk with a reporter, since the  last time he'd spoken out, he'd received a letter threatening to burn down his  home.  </P> <P> "It's a very difficult position we're in now," the public defender,  Boruchowitz, said. "I mean, no one can be against protecting the community, or  be for sex predators. Moderate people have been caught up in this mood. I  hesitate to speak out."  </P> <P> Maleng, Boerner and their colleagues, at any rate, by now had carefully refined  answers for those who did object.  </P> <P> There's a distinction between the obligation to treat and the likelihood of a  cure, they pointed out. Besides, even if we can't treat now, shouldn't we keep  trying? We do that all the time with AIDS and cancer. And we're not asking the  doctors to predict borderline cases, we're asking them to tell us who are the  most dangerous of the dangerous. Yes, it's going to be difficult for these  people to get out, we can't deny that. Some will be in for a long time --  perhaps 30 years. Either a person changes or we find a cure. Maybe a treatment  will be developed much later. What else is a rational society to do -- let them  go or lock them in prison forever?  </P> <P> "I feel very sensitive to civil liberties," Maleng said. "That's why we put in  a full due process procedure. Of the alternatives, life sentences for thousands  is worse, and letting them go, not possible. I am not concerned that there will  be abuse -- this system makes it hard on all actors."  </P> <P> Whatever the merits of these various opinions, the truth is, they did not  account for much of the public debate over the proposed legislation. The bill's  authors just never were particularly occupied with objections from  psychiatrists and civil libertarians. They had a much more formidable lobby  bearing down on them.  </P> <P> "The fires we were trying to put out have been more from people who wanted even  stronger measures," said Paula Jallison, Maleng's administrative assistant.  "Lots of people were trying to make it tougher. Politicians were jumping on it.  It was political suicide not to support this."  </P> <P> In many quarters, preventive detention simply was not an offensive notion.  </P> <P> "What's wrong with a holding pen?" asked Ida Ballasiotes. "They're not going to  be mistreated. It's not a dungeon. They get food. The point is to keep them  away from society. For how long? Maybe forever . . . . Society likes these  nice, tidy definitions -- mentally ill, criminal, sane. Well, some of these  people don't fit these categories. They just attack, repeatedly, over and  over."  </P> <P> Life sentences without the possibility of parole for a second offense was, in  the end, among the milder proposals. A bill providing greatly reduced prison  sentences to sex offenders who agreed to castration was approved by the state  Senate in mid-February, winning support from a surprising number of mainstream  political leaders. Legislators said they voted for the measure as a response to  constituents' demands.  </P> <P> "It's time we address the public's concern for safety and not concern for  criminal rights," said state Sen. Bob McCaslin (R-Olympia). "This bill would be  something positive . . . ."  </P> <P> "Voluntary mutilation is too good for sex offenders," said state Sen. Brad Owen  (D-Olympia). "It should be mandatory for these creeps. The Constitution was  never meant to coddle these people, but that's what we use it for."  </P> <P> So at the start of February, when the sex-offender legislation won unanimous  approval in both houses of the state Legislature, Maleng and Boerner were  thankful -- not because their bill hadn't been diluted, but because it hadn't  been toughened.  </P> <P> The morning that representatives in the House were voting, Ida Ballasiotes sat  in the upper gallery, eyeing the tally board.  </P> <P> "We were watching to see if anyone opposed the bill," she explained later. "We  were prepared to publicize names of those who voted against it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Glad It's Over  </P> <P> Looking back several weeks later, state representative Marlin Appelwick,  expressing a not uncommon sentiment, said: "I'm damn glad it's over. I can't  take many like this." Adoption of the sex-offender legislation, however, has  proven not so much the end of the story but the beginning. The question most  frequently asked now: Will the law, aimed at the Earl Shriners of the world,  cast a far wider net than intended?  </P> <P> Maleng calls the law a "rifle shot" and estimates that perhaps 30 or 40 people  might be targeted a year, out of the 750 sex offenders that Washington releases  annually. Others, though, point out that 39 different autonomous county  prosecutors will decide whom to go after, and will have a tough time choosing,  since no less than 60% of those 750 released sex offenders can be expected to  reoffend.  </P> <P> "Political pressures will force a wide net," predicts LaFond. "You are  criticized, not for sending a nondangerous person to treatment centers; you are  criticized for releasing someone who is dangerous. Prosecutors tell me they'll  have to file. If they have that power and don't file, there will be hell to  pay."  </P> <P> Recent events in Washington, as it happens, have done little to allay LaFond's  fears. The bill doesn't go into effect until July 1, but public officials  already are displaying an unmistakable enthusiasm for its spirit.  </P> <P> Last July, Police Chief John Turner in suburban Mountlake Terrace called a  press conference to warn citizens that a dangerous 18-year-old man, recently  released from juvenile custody and not suitable for involuntary commitment, was  now living in their community. Here was a considerably more marginal figure  than Earl Shriner.  </P> <P> The 18-year-old's record included two convictions on indecent liberties charges  almost five years before, when he was 14. But he also was the author of a  detailed written plan to abduct and molest children, discovered by staffers at  his juvenile detention center.  </P> <P> "I thought: 'Am I going to be the chief of a community that gets information  like this and doesn't do anything with it?' " Chief Turner later told  reporters. "How big of a billboard did I need? What am I to do? Am I to take  that information and file it away?"  </P> <P> Turner's public announcement triggered an avalanche of phone calls to the  police station -- for two hours, the calls came every 15 to 20 seconds. City  residents began keeping their children indoors. The school district bought new  fencing. Within three weeks, county mental health officials had ordered the  18-year-old to Western State Hospital, deciding he was indeed fit for  involuntary commitment.  </P> <P> Since then, confidentiality laws make it hard to trace what has happened to  him, but a prosecutor familiar with the case indicated that he eventually was  diagnosed a pedophile, which enabled authorities to commit him, involuntarily  and indefinitely, even though the new law hadn't gone into effect.  </P> <P> Then, early last February, Tacoma Police Chief Ray Fjetland and Pierce County  prosecutor John Ladenburg at a press conference not only announced the release  of a "predatory" man who'd just completed serving his maximum sentence, but  also provided his name and whereabouts. He was, they said, an "extremely  dangerous, extremely violent" convicted child molester.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, they were describing the wrong man. The person being released,  they soon had to acknowledge, was not the 53-year-old man they'd identified,  but his 21-year-old developmentally disabled son, who had juvenile convictions  for arson, indecent liberties and malicious mischief. The police chief and  prosecutor stood by their initial warning, though. State officials, they  explained, had serious concerns about the younger man because of "other  behavior" that was not described in court files and could not be released  because of the juvenile confidentiality laws.  </P> <P> Other miscues followed. One day, Tacoma police informed the Oakland Park area  that a 22-year-old child rapist had been released from prison and was going to  live in the neighborhood with his father, but the next day the father said he  had no notion of his son's whereabouts.  </P> <P> That same week, a Pierce County sheriff, apparently acting on his own, posted  flyers all over the Eatonville area that listed not only the name of a  newly-released sexual offender, but also the name, address and phone number of  the elderly woman who was once his foster mother. For days, the 72-year-old  woman's phone rang constantly, the calls full of threats and questions. The  woman didn't know how to respond, since she hadn't seen the man for seven years  and had no idea where he was.  </P> <P> By early May, state officials had tentatively targeted six particular sex  offenders, five of them already released, for possible civil commitment when  the sex predator bill takes effect in July. The screening for candidates had  been going on since January, explained corrections official Don Moore, although  state officials were still struggling to fashion an objective, standardized  procedure to assess risk. "We need something better than a crude eyeballing of  an individual," Moore said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Different Reactions  </P> <P> Watching all this, people understandably had differing reactions.  </P> <P> The psychiatrist James Reardon wished citizens would focus their outraged  concern on what he felt were far bigger threats to society than sexual  predators, such as drugs and alcohol abuse and guns. Physical and sexual abuse  were far more likely to come from family members than from strange predators,  after all. "Nine people were shot to death on Seattle streets last week while  this law was being debated, but no one talks of gun control," he said. "Sex  predators have become the focus, the bogyman."  </P> <P> The civil liberties lawyers, sounding shaken and isolated, thought the recent  events proved that striking down protections for the Earl Shriners also lost  them for other people. "People forget what this country was founded on,"  Boruchowitz said. "It was for the protection of minorities, the accused, the  powerless. It was to protect against government abuse. We have died for  protections people are willing to give up."  </P> <P> Others suggested that the new law simply won't work. "The public was sold a  bill of goods," said LaFond. "I predict mistaken confinement of innocent people  and extensive victimization still will continue within the community. So we  will have the worst of both worlds. The fact is, there are limits to how much  we can protect and make the world safe, even if politicians can't say that.  This situation starts you thinking why systems have limits -- there usually are  reasons. I suspect they'll just commit a few at the start, then there will be  more Shriners. So they will commit larger numbers. There still will be  Shriners. Then what?"  </P> <P> Even some connected to the task force felt, if not uncertain, at least  cautious. "There's no question this can be abused," said Dave Boerner. "We  simply will have to see. But I have faith in juries." Paul Trause, deputy  secretary of the state Department of Social and Health Services, who served as  the task force's chief of staff, said: "We are at the edge. We recognize that.  There were trade-offs."  </P> <P> On the other hand, Ida Ballasiotes, surveying all that has unfolded, could not  help but feel a sense of accomplishment.  </P> <P> Her daughter's murderer, Gene Kane, has been put behind bars for good,  sentenced to life without possibility of parole. Just hours before the  Legislature passed the sex offender act, Earl Shriner had been convicted of  first-degree rape, assault and attempted murder. On that same day, in another  courtroom, Gary Minnix had been sentenced to 50 years in prison for his rape of  the Pierce County woman -- a new judge had decided the retarded Minnix was  competent to stand trial after all. And Friends of Diane and the Tennis Shoe  Brigade now were carefully monitoring a variety of other courtrooms, carrying  with them lists of sexual offenders due to be released soon from prison.  </P> <P> At her Mercer Island home one early February morning, Ida Ballasiotes reflected  on these matters. Then she produced two letters -- one written by Gov. Gardner  soon after her daughter's death, the other written by Diane on Mothers Day in  1988, four months before she was murdered. Ballasiotes held the two sheets  before her, in separate hands, reading first from one, then the other. "The  board was required to return Mr. Kane to society" . . . "I love you, and I am  one lucky gal." Dropping the letters on her kitchen table, she shook her head  with disdain.  </P> <P> "We have focused attention," Ballasiotes said. "We'll never get a perfect  system, there still will be Shriners and Kanes, but we're saying, at least do a  better job than you have been doing. We're saying, use your head, be  accountable."  </P> <P> No, she replied to a question, they were not yet fully satisfied. They were not  finished.  </P> <P> "This is just a good first step," Ballasiotes said. "This was a compromise.  There's a lot to do yet."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE PREDATORS LAW  </P> <P> Under a Washington state law that goes into effect July 1, people could be  confined indefinitely, even past their statutory prison terms, if they are  found to be "sexual predators."  </P> <P> The law defines a predator as "any person who has been convicted of, or charged  with a crime of sexual violence and who suffers from a mental abnormality or  personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in predatory acts  of sexual violence."  </P> <P> Under the law, acts of sexual violence include first- and second-degree rape,  indecent liberties and child molestation. Lesser offenses such as second-degree  assault and even residential burglary could also be considered to meet the  definition if they are "determined to have been sexually motivated."  </P> <P> A county prosecutor could seek to confine a person under the law who:  </P> <P> Has been convicted of a sexually violent crime and is nearing the end of a  criminal sentence.  </P> <P> Has committed a sexually violent offense as a juvenile and is about to be  released.  </P> <P> Has been charged with a violent sex offense but has been determined to be  incompetent to stand trial.  </P> <P> Has been found not guilty of a sex offense by reason of insanity.  </P> <P> A judge would order a 45-day confinement upon receiving the prosecutor's  request. A trial would be held to determine whether the person is at risk to  commit a sexual crime and should be confined. Confinement would end only upon  proof that the "predator" was cured.  </P></p>

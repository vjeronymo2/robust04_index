			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Appointments: Pearson takes over at IMS Richard Pearson, who has been associate and then deputy director of the Institute of Manpower Studies for the past eight years, will succeed John Elliott as director in March. The IMS, which advises companies, government departments and trade unions on employment and labour market issues, has a staff of 50. According to Sir John Cassels, president of the IMS council, Pearson 'knows exactly what makes the Institute tick'. His colleagues obviously know what makes him tick; 12 years ago they parodied his punctilious style in a staff Christmas pantomime. He was characterised as someone who insisted on punctuality, people speaking in turn and sticking to the point. Now he says: 'Luckily I laughed. I have learnt that life is messier than I thought; I was a bit naive then.' Last year, when he was 42, Pearson started learning to play tennis. But his performance in meetings is not replicated on the court; he is said to have little style but makes up for this with stamina and determination to hit every ball. ***** Is John Hardman, former chief executive and chairman of Asda, in need of the personal services of the executive search company of which he has just been appointed a non-executive director? Pushed from his position at the troubled store group by angry institutional shareholders last June, Hardman has just picked up his third non-executive directorship, this time at Adderley-Featherstone, a brand new Leeds-centred headhunting outfit. Peter Adderley, previously group managing director of Hoggett Bowers, says Hardman has been a friend of his partner John Featherstone for years. The former Asda boss, a Lancastrian who has made his home in Yorkshire, is also a director of the Yorkshire Electricity Board and deputy chairman of the Leeds Development Corporation. But that is unlikely to be keeping him fully occupied.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Observer: Crying wolf The idea that Martin Sorrell is about to sell off or float 'up to' 50 per cent of the market research entities of his mammoth WPP advertising group needs closer examination. Not to see if it's sensible; with debts of Pounds 361m it clearly is. But Sorrell has talked about doing it for the past two years - since March 1992 - and little enough has happened so far. Having worked so hard to build up WPP, Sorrell is not keen to see it fall apart. He hates the thought of selling anything.</p>

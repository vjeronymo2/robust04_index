			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / SNP sidesteps campaign on VAT THE SCOTTISH National party yesterday backed away from launching a campaign of non-payment of value added tax on household fuel bills, James Buxton writes. It followed a heated debate at its annual conference in Dunoon in which several speakers argued that a campaign would be ineffective. Mr Peter Macleod proposed a campaign based on the slogan 'pay the bill, not the tax'. Scots would be urged to delete the VAT from their fuel bills when the tax comes into force next year.</p>

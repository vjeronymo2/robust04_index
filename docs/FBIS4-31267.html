			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Geneva, June 7 (TANJUG) -- Special U.N. envoy for  former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi on Tuesday evening started a  new round of bilateral talks with Bosnia's warring parties after  which he would decide whether or not to continue the Geneva  conference on the cessation of hostilities in that war-torn  former Yugoslav republic.    Visibly exhausted by futile attempts over the past five days  to establish communication between the belligerents and create  conditions for talks, Akashi said on Tuesday afternoon the  conference might be continued in Sarajevo and in Pale.    The international mediator is currently meeting for the  third  time in a single day with vice-president of the Moslem-Croat  Federation Ejup Gapic to persuade him to accept a platform on a  four-month general ceasefire proposed by the contact group on  Bosnia.    The Bosnian Serb delegation has indicated it may accept the  platform, and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has stated  that an agreement to that effect may be reached by the evening.    The start of the talks was delayed for four days because the  Moslems claimed all armed Serbs had not left the three-kilometre  exclusion zone around Gorazde in eastern Bosnia as set out in  U.N. Security Council Resolution 913.    The Moslems on Monday attempted to seize the territory  around  Gorazde from which the Serbs had withdrawn, a U.N. spokesman in  Sarajevo said on Tuesday.    The plenary session of the Bosnia peace talks has had to be  postponed for three times because the Moslem-Croat delegation  remains firm in its position that a ceasefire can be signed for  a maximum of four to six weeks.</p>

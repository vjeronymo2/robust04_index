Against the backdrop of the split between Berlusconi, the  media mogul who led his three-month old Forza Italia to victory  in the just-concluded general election, and Northern League  leader Umberto Bossi, Ciampi said, "The government hopes to be  able, as soon as possible, to hand matters on to the new  government which will be named by the president of the republic  on the basis of the electoral results."    The premier who took over in April last year, as the first  non-politician and non-member of Parliament to hold this office,  also spoke of hopes for "a climate of stability and correct  civil co-existence, necessary conditions for facing the complex  problems before the nation." He went on to voice "the  satisfaction of the government with the orderly conduct of the  campaign and voting operations which brought in the Parliament  of the twelfth legislature.    ``The government,'' he added, ``is beginning to conclude its  duties of management and as institutional guarantor in a  sensitive phase of transition with results which testify to the  country's basic steadiness and capacity for renewal in the  political, economic and social fields and in democratic  security.''    In the wings, Berlusconi said all the alignments in his  Forza  Italia-led Freedom Front should be involved in the formation of  a government, "just as indicated by the voters," and that the  new executive should be "political" rather than a cabinet of  "technocrats."

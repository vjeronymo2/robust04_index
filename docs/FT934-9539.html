			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / A common theme for twin dips in markets Global investment strategists are on red alert. Two of the world's biggest securities markets, in US Treasury bonds and Japanese equities, have hit trouble. The 30-year Treasury long bond yield flipped up from 5.78 per cent on October 15 to 6.21 per cent last Friday, a correction proportionately almost as severe as the 9 per cent tumble in the Nikkei Dow over the past three weeks. The Tokyo stock market generally shows scant correlation with markets elsewhere, so we can probably put the timing of these twin dips down to coincidence. There is a common underlying theme, though, in that both markets have been sustained by low short-term interest rates that may have encouraged investors to lose sight of the underlying realities. My own view is that the longer-term outlook for US Treasuries is still fair, although there may be a turbulent period in the immediate future. Yesterday dollar bonds were rallying. Japanese equities, I guess more pessimistically, are embarking on the fourth substantial downwards leg of Tokyo's extended bear market. From almost 7.5 per cent in January, the Treasury long bond yield has been declining all year - until mid-October. The bull market in bonds has been sustained by two main factors, the profitable yield curve play for the banks, funding themselves off a 3 per cent money market rate, and the search for yield by investors. As far as the latter are concerned, it seems that the fall in returns below 6 per cent began to cut off the demand: net sales of mutual funds investing in bonds fell from Dollars 15.4bn to Dollars 11.8bn between July and September. As for the banks, the question has always been how abruptly the freakishly steep yield curve up to five years will be flattened by a rise in short-term rates: US Treasury bond investors can pick up 150 basis points of yield at 3 years, UK gilt-edged buyers almost nothing. Forecasts of the date of the first tightening by the Federal Reserve have recently varied between the end of next year and the end of next week. The latest evidence of a strengthening of the US economic recovery has encouraged a rush for the exit. If up to Dollars 300bn of Treasuries must find new buyers the yield adjustment could be quite sharp. Certainly, the first quarter-point rise in US short rates will be regarded as just the first step of many. Over in Tokyo we have the mirror image of this problem, the appearance of further evidence that the economic problems of Japan are dire. Much of the huge expansion of industrial capacity in the 1980s at a more or less zero cost of capital has turned out to represent massive waste. The underlying, but largely hidden, bankruptcy of much of the property and construction sector - and by extension, much of the financial system - is gradually emerging into daylight. Myths of the skilful official manipulation of the Tokyo stock market have been devalued by the disruptive announcement of a new Nikkei 300 index and the bungling of the JR East privatisation. The bulls had been relying on potential support from very low bond yields, based upon the ratio between JGB yields and company earnings yields on the convenient assumption that profits will soon start to 'normalise'. But we are now in the 1990s, and I believe that to draw conclusions from the historical levels of various yield ratios during the 'bubble' period of the 1980s is a worthless exercise. An unfortunately-timed example was the advice from Warburg Securities three weeks ago that the moment had come to move back into Japan. This was based inter alia upon a bond yield-related measure described as the 'cross-holdings adjusted earnings yield gap', and on hints of 'official' support below 20,000 on the Nikkei. The common theme in Japan and the US has been the low level of short-term interest rates. But the difference has been in the economic circumstances. So the JGB market has brushed aside the problems of equities in Tokyo, and Wall Street equities have only suffered minor damage from the correction in Treasury bonds. Forget the historical ratios, look at the prospective fundamentals.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLEWATCH  </P> <P> Oprah's Honesty: "Truth has been the foundation of my adult life," declared  Oprah Winfrey, confirming a recent report that she had a child out of wedlock  at age 14.  </P> <P> "It is true that when I was 14 years old, I became pregnant," Winfrey said in a  statement issued to Parade columnist Walter Scott to be published this Sunday  in the magazine. "The baby was born prematurely and died shortly after birth,"  she added. Winfrey said she had hoped the matter could stay private until she  was ready to talk about it. Winfrey issued the statement now because her  half-sister Patricia Lloyd told of the birth in a recently published interview.  BETH KLEID  </P></p>

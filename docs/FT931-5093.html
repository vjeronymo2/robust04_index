			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Letter: BR's pension obligation Sir, I concur with your view ('Pensions at Risk', March 3) that dilution of benefits will do nothing to enhance confidence in a pensions system which has suffered gravely from the activities of the late Robert Maxwell. Reviewing the government's proposals for railway pensions after privatisation, I came across the following paragraph: 'The government will need to be satisfied that the method of allocation of surplus assets strikes a fair balance between all interested parties, including contributing members, pensioners, deferred pensioners, current and prospective employers, and the taxpayer who is contributing through the government support contributions.' A statement like this from any other sponsoring employer of an occupational pension fund would raise eyebrows even of those taking the broadest view of conflicts of interest. It seems to me that the government is in a position comparable to that of an employer in such a scheme. Perhaps the most appropriate way to determine the distribution of surplus assets within the BR's pension fund is by the appointment of a truly independent trustee body.

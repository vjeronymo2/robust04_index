			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CREATIONISM AND EVOLUTION  </P> <P> Shaver claims that many evolutionary biologists now are having second thoughts  about evolution. The standards of accuracy in her column are not high. For  example, she claims that British paleontologist Colin Patterson publicly  recanted his believe in evolution in a talk at the American Museum of Natural  History in 1981, and now admits that evolution is unsupported by the fossil  record. This "Patterson fable" was first published in June, 1982, in "Impact,"  a four-page insert in the monthly newsletter of the Institute for Creation  Research of San Diego, and has been copied ad nauseam by creationist writers  ever since. In a letter written in June, 1982, Dr. Patterson explains what  happened:  </P> <P> "The story behind the 'Impact' article is that last November I gave a talk to  the systematics discussion group in the AMNH. I was asked to talk on 'evolution  and creationism,' and knowing the meetings of the group as informal sessions  where ideas could be kicked around among specialists, I put a case for the  difficulties and problems with evolution, specifically in the field of  systematics. I was too naive and foolish to guess what might happen: The talk  was taped by a creationist who passed the tape to Luther Sunderland . . . I was  putting a case for discussion, as I thought off the record, and was speaking  only about systematics, a specialized field. I do not support the creationist  movement in any way, and in particular, I am opposed to their efforts to modify  school curricula. In short the article does not fairly represent my views."  </P> <P> So the Patterson fable has no foundation.  </P> <P> So much for the veracity of Shaver's article. Evolution is far from dead; it  remains the central working principle of modern biology. Biology without  evolution would only be natural history, and we haven't taught natural history  for 100 years. The heated arguments among biologists today and how evolution  occurs are signs of the life and vigor of the field. It would be a loss to good  teaching if the eccentric fringe of science and their tape recorders would  discourage teachers from speaking provocatively for fear that their words later  would be twisted and tortured out of context, as Shaver has done with Colin  Patterson.  </P> <P> RICHARD E.

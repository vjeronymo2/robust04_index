			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Kashmir elections postponed The Indian government yesterday said it would extend federal rule in the troubled province of Kashmir for another six months, shelving plans to hold elections for the state assembly, Reuter reports from New Delhi. Mr Shankarrao Chavan, the home minister, said in parliament that the situation in the region, where Moslem militants are fighting for independence from India, was not conducive to the holding of elections. At least 7,500 people have been killed in Kashmir since the insurgency flared more than two years ago.</p>

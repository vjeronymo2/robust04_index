"First, we would like to know what Russia's position is at  the next meeting," he said while adding that, hopefully, Russia  would comply to its responsibility to withdraw forces from  Estonia by August 31 deadline without pegging it to other  problems yet to be solved.    During the last round of negotiations on March 1-2, Russia  withdrew its earlier commitment to pull out its forces by August  31 and neglected to offer another date for negotiations.    Following support to Estonia by the Western countries,  Russia  proposed another date which Estonia accepted.    On answering the question on possible concessions, Reinart  said the basis for negotiations were Estonia's laws. The  position of retired Russian military has been an issue of debate  between the two countries. The question has been dealt with in  Estonia's Law on Aliens, Reinart said.    Under the Law on Aliens, the retired military have no right  to apply for residence in Estonia, but a following governmental  decree allows granting them residence permits on individual  basis.    On commenting agreements initialled between Latvia and  Russia, Reinart said that Latvia was in a more difficult  position as they lacked respective legislation. Russia, of  course, hopes that Estonia would amend some of its laws, Reinart  added.</p>

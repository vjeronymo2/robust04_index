			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The insured person has not had contact of any kind with any relatives, dependents, employers, or friends for at least 7 years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A diligent search was conducted with the air of the appropriate authorities reasonably soon after the insured person's disappearance, but the search failed to locate or explain the absence of the insured person. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Circumstances surrounding the insured person's disappearance allow no reasonable explanation of that person's absence other than death. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After much deliberation, we have decided that we will not adopt the rule published in the NPRM. This NPRM withdraws the NPRM published at 49 FR 7405&hyph;7406 on February 29, 1984. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of the Social Security Acquiescence Rulings, we are now administering two different standards with respect to presumption of death for entitlement purposes. One standard is based on our historical interpretation of the regulation; the other on the Social Security Acquiescence Rulings issued for the seven different circuits as the result of appellate court decisions. We have reevaluated our policies and are proposing to revise the existing regulation and establish a national policy based on the interpretation set forth by the courts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, we propose to revise the regulations to include a new section which will contain information on evidence which will rebut a presumption of death. Current regulations do not provide guidance on what constitutes evidence to rebut a presumption of death. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations will provide that the presumption of death arises when the claimant establishes an individual has been absent from his or her residence and not heard from for 7 years. Once the presumption is made, the burden then shifts to us to rebut the presumption either by presenting evidence that the missing individual is still alive or by providing an explanation to account for the individual's absence in a manner consistent with continued life rather than death. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We will remove reference to establishing no apparent reason for the absence from &sect;404.721(b). We will provide rules concerning the rebuttal of a presumption of death in proposed &sect;404.722, a new section to the regulations. This section will provide that a presumption of death made based on &sect;404.721(b) will be rebutted if there is evidence available that the person is still alive or the absence can be explained in a manner consistent with continued life rather than death. We will also make a conforming change to &sect;404.988 (conditions for reopening) to reflect the proposed change in &sect;404.721(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We will rescind the following Social Security Acquiescence Rulings by publishing a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  when we publish these rules as final in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  AR 86&hyph;6(3); AR 86&hyph;7(5); AR 86&hyph;8(6); AR 86&hyph;9(9); AR 86&hyph;10(10); AR 86&hyph;11(11); and AR 93&hyph;6(8). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order No. 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have consulted with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and determined that these proposed rules do not meet the criteria for a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866. Thus, they were not subject to OMB review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We certify that these regulations will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because these rules will only affect individuals.

L. 96&hyph;354, the regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These proposed regulations impose no new reporting or recordkeeping requirements requiring Office of Management and Budget clearance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Nos. 93.802, Social Security-Disability Insurance; 93.803, Social Security-Retirement Insurance; and 93.805, Social Security-Survivors Insurance.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 20 CFR 404 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure; Aged, Blind, Death benefits; Old-age, Survivors, and Disability insurance; Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Social Security. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 17, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Shirley Chater, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Commissioner of Social Security. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Approved: July 7, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donna E.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Jun 2, BNS -- The Latvijas Gaze (Latvian Gas)  enterprise is expected to cover its 23-million-U.S.-dollar debt  to the Russian Gazprom gas consortium Thursday, Latvijas Gaze  President Girts Stalbovics told reporters.    The money comes from the Japanese Import and Export Bank  credit, which is guaranteed by the Latvian Government.    Latvijas Gaze owed Gazprom 29.2 million dollars on May 27  for  supplied gas. Latvijas Gze must also pay Russia 2.5 million  dollars in fines for delayed payment.    Russia has pumped 32 million cubic meters of gas into the  Incukalns container by May 27, Stalbovics noted.</p>

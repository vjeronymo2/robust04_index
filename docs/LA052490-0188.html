			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS, CYPRESS;  </P> <P> LOS ALAMITOS SUES CYPRESS OVER PROJECT  </P> <P> Los Alamitos sued the city of Cypress on Wednesday over a report that concluded  that a proposed business park on the border of the two cities would have little  impact on Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> The developer of the 75-acre business park project, Cypress Development  Partnership, was named as a co-defendant in the lawsuit filed in Orange County  Superior Court.  </P> <P> No hearing date has been set.  </P> <P> The development -- dubbed the Cypress Business and Professional Center and next  to the Los Alamitos Race Track -- in part abuts Katella Avenue, a major  thoroughfare through Los Alamitos that would be the development's most direct  link to a nearby freeway.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos wants Cypress and the project developer to pay for street  maintenance and improvements along Katella Avenue because of the development's  impact, Allen said.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos City Atty. Thomas W. Allen said an environmental impact report  prepared for the city of Cypress did not adequately address the impact the  development would have on his city.  </P> <P> "The majority of the traffic that goes to the race track now passes through Los  Alamitos," he said. "And it is probable that the majority of the traffic going  to the business park would also pass along Katella to I-605 (San Gabriel River  Freeway)."  </P> <P> The lawsuit does not specify how much money Los Alamitos wants. However,  Cypress Mayor Cecilia L. Age said Los Alamitos asked for $2.8 million from  Cypress.KATHIE BOZANICH and LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

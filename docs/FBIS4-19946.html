			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on remarks by Defense Minister Fabio </F> Fabbri during visits to the Northeastern Military Command in  Padua and the Fifth Allied Tactical Air Force Headquarters in  Vicenza on 20 April: "Fabbri: `We Are Defended by an Effective  Shield'"]    [Text] Padua -- "I see no danger of attacks in Italy; there  are no Serbian missiles that could hit our country. And an  attack from the sky or the sea is inconceivable; we have a very  effective protective shield." Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri  played matters down: At the northeastern military command at  Padua he thanked the soldiers who have defended our country over  the past very difficult year. "Our country is NATO's aircraft  carrier in Europe; the war in the former Yugoslavia has granted  us a strategic role, and our international esteem has increased  considerably," he said. The minister then went on to Vicenza,  to the headquarters of the Fifth Allied Tactical Air Force  (ATAF). It is from this observation post that commands for  military actions are issued. "NATO has shouldered all its  responsibilities, but I think that it should have intervened  even before the Gorazde massacre. I consider it very important  and positive that Russia has issued an indication of its  amenability by condemning the Serbs. However, I believe that  the NATO forces cannot avoid, in the future too, taking all the  measures necessary to end the massacre."</p>

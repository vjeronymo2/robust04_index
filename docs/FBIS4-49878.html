			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- Peter Sutherland,  director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT), said here today that he confides in the prospect of  early completion of the negotiations on the terms and conditions  for China's rejoining GATT.    "China's ambitious program of trade and economic reforms has  contributed greatly to bringing China more closely into line  with the world trading system," he told the 1994 China summit  meeting which opened here today.    In his speech entitled "Global Multilateral Trading System:  The Role of the People's Republic of China," he said that  observing the Chinese economy in the process of reform, one  could see that China is essentially doing "autonomously" what  the world trade organization would in any case oblige it to do.    "China is to be congratulated on its most recently announced  program of liberalization and reform," he said, since "China's  economic reforms have given a far greater role to market forces  and have led to a rapid liberalization of its foreign trade  regime.    "I am sure that producers, traders and consumers the world  over, including those in China, are keen to see full  implementation of these and other announced reforms."    He said that given the magnitude of China's economy and the  likelihood that China would assume a leading role in shaping the  global economic environment of the next century, it was of  critical importance that close attention be paid to the manner  in which China proceeds with its full integration into the world  trade organization.</p>

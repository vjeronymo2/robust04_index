			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Abolition of two more county authorities urged: Warwickshire and Wiltshire residents to be consulted - Unitary local authority urged for Swindon Swindon will be given a self-governing unitary authority under plans announced yesterday by the Local Government Commission for England, but the two-tier status quo of counties and districts remains on the table for both Warwickshire and Wiltshire. The commission yesterday suggested that both counties should be split into unitary authorities - bringing the number of county councils recommended for abolition since the beginning of June to 12. But in both cases it said it would consult local people. The recommendations are: Warwickshire: The commission cautiously proposed the abolition of Warwickshire County Council and the county's five district councils, and their replacement by two unitary authorities. The commission said: 'There are strong arguments both for retaining the present two-tier structure and for moving to a unitary system. At this stage, the conclusion is that on balance the county would benefit from a change to unitary local government.' But Mr Brian Hill, in charge of the review of the county, said: 'There doesn't appear to be any tremendous groundswell for change.' In the next 11 weeks the commission will gauge views in Warwickshire on splitting it into north and south unitary authorities, or leaving local government as it is. North Warwickshire - which includes Nuneaton and Bedworth, and Rugby districts - would be a string of small industrial centres wrapped around the eastern side of the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation. South Warwickshire  -Stratford-upon-Avon and Warwick - would be more rural. The cost of setting up the two authorities is estimated at up to Pounds 20m, with annual savings of up to Pounds 7m a year. Wiltshire: The commission is proposing two alternatives, both of which involve giving unitary status to Thamesdown borough, centred on Swindon. This has been supported by both the borough council and the county council, and is unlikely to provoke opposition. The commission's first preference for the rest of Wiltshire is to split it into two unitaries - Mid-Wiltshire, consisting of the present North Wiltshire district plus most of Kennet and West Wiltshire districts, and South Wiltshire, which would merge Salisbury with the Warminster and Tidworth areas of Kennet and West Wiltshire. This structure would 'recognise the natural divide of Salisbury Plain', the commission said, at a start-up cost of Pounds 12m to Pounds 14m. Alternatively, the two-tier structure of counties and districts would remain intact outside Swindon. Delays caused by legal action mean that the county of Cleveland will not be split into four unitary authorities until April 1996, Mr David Curry, the local government minister, said yesterday. The government had planned to implement the change in April next year, with elections for the new authorities the following month. Delays caused by the county's appeal for judicial review of the decision, which the High Court rejected last week, made this timetable harder to implement. Labour had also objected to the plan to create new authorities before the areas had held democratic elections.</p>

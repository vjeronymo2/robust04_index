			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STYLE: ANTIQUE SCAVENGER'S NEWFANGLED 'EARLOOMS' HAVE A BEADY PAST  </P> <P> Leslie Allen recycles old jewelry the way some people collect aluminum cans and  newspapers, turning trash into treasure. She'll pull apart unwanted necklaces,  brooches, bracelets, handbags, buckles and buttons and rearrange the pieces  into glitzy, rhinestone-studded earrings that she calls "Earlooms."  </P> <P> "I can take two of anything and turn them into a pair of earrings," she says.  </P> <P> Because she uses antique findings, her earrings are a curious combination of  old-fashioned trinkets set in contemporary, geometric designs.  </P> <P> "They're like heirlooms. Each pair has a history. These came off of a 1920s  movie costume," says Allen, pointing to a pair of triangle-shaped earrings with  a row of red rice-shaped beads.  </P> <P> To adorn her earrings, she has retrieved black beads from a necklace worn by  her grandmother in the 1800s, cut beaded applique flowers from a 19th-Century  wedding gown and dismantled a set of her late husband's cuff links.  </P> <P> "I don't throw anything out," she says.  </P> <P> A resident of Los Alamitos, the 60-year-old Allen commutes three times a week  to the Rag Street Consignment Apparel shop in Laguna Beach, where she has set  up a small workstation loaded with plastic trays of beads, pearls, sequins and  findings.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I can do 20 pairs at a time," she says.  </P> <P> Her tools are simple: cement glue and a gall-bladder remover. The latter, which  looks like a pair of oversize tweezers, came from a friend who underwent a  gall-bladder operation. Allen will recycle anything.  </P> <P> She makes most of her earrings by gluing her treasures on black triangles or  geometric-shaped mirrors that reflect the sparkling gems. For instance, she  will take the flowers from a pair of 1940s clip-ons, glue them on small round  mirrors and add clusters of crystals and seed pearls.  </P> <P> "These earrings will be much bigger when I'm finished."  </P> <P> She calls her larger, more lavish earrings "entrance makers."  </P> <P> "When you walk in a room with those on, people notice."  </P> <P> Most of her gem-encrusted earrings cascade two or three inches from the  earlobe. Some pairs have a single tassel that sweeps the shoulder.  </P> <P> "I like glitz," she says.  </P> <P> A scavenger, Allen combs the bead shops of Laguna Beach, antique stores and  costume shops for anything that sparkles. She's made earrings from a pair of  old buttons painted with roses, dangles pulled off of chain belts worn by  flappers in the '20s, brown-bead appliques from a '30s evening dress and the  embroidered trim from a blouse collar. She pulls out a pair of triangle-shaped  mirrors adorned with blue glass balls.  </P> <P> "They're from my marble period," she says laughing.  </P> <P> She'll also make earrings out of earrings, creating what she calls a "redo" by  pulling the pieces apart and adding more sparkles.  </P> <P> "If I only have one of something, I make it into a pin. I've done watches and  belts, but earrings are my first love."  </P> <P> She refuses to part with her favorite earrings, including those made from  rhinestone buttons taken from a dress she wore to a high-school dance in the  '40s. "That's like selling my children," she protests.  </P> <P> A belt she made from watches once worn by her family will never make it to  market. "This was my dad's," she says, pointing to a watch with a square yellow  face. "And this is one I won in a beauty contest long ago."  </P> <P> Many of her mementos come from costumes she wore while working as an actress.  Allen has played assorted roles on television shows and soap operas, including  "Another World," "As the World Turns," "Streets of San Francisco," "Days of Our  Lives" and "Divorce Court." She's also acted in theater and films, including  the role of Mabel in "The Candidate" starring Robert Redford.  </P> <P> Until she started making Earlooms, she had no experience in design. "I never  worked with my hands," she says.  </P> <P> She made her first pair of earrings out of a tiny cameo that belonged to her  mother, two pearls she found pearl-diving on her honeymoon and five stick pins  that belonged to her grandfather.  </P> <P> "I didn't know what to do with the stick pins. Who wears stick pins in this day  and age? So I decided to make them into earrings."  </P> <P> She showed the earrings to Jeannie Quaintance, a friend and owner of Rag  Street, and Quaintance suggested she make more. Allen then raided a pair of  two-foot-high cones that had been trimmed 40 years ago with old jewelry to look  like Christmas trees. Friends brought her unwanted baubles from their jewelry  boxes.  </P> <P> She also began picking off the sparkles from her old costumes and others she  bought at the Screen Actors Guild Cinema Glamour Shop in Los Angeles. She made  10 pairs of earrings from a beaded dress worn by Elizabeth Taylor.  </P> <P> "I've now made about a thousand pairs, and no two are alike."  </P> <P> Allen sells Earlooms in six boutiques in Orange County and Los Angeles,  including Rag Street, Santa Fe by the Sea in Seal Beach and Notorious on  Melrose Avenue. Earlooms cost $30 to $85.  </P> <P> "It's turned into a semi-paying proposition," she says.  </P> <P> Allen custom designs earrings to match her customers' wardrobes and tastes. She  recently made personalized earrings for members of a widows' support group.  </P> <P> "One lady liked cats, so I went to a miniatures shop and found tiny bags of cat  food and bowls. Another liked sweets, so I found some miniature candy," she  says. "The group leader later told me, 'You should have seen all the joy it  brought to those ladies.' "  </P> <P> For her, the real reward comes in giving old, beautiful things a new life.  </P> <P> "A woman brought a bunch of her old broken jewelry for me to make into earrings  so she could leave them for her daughter," she says. Now her Earlooms have  become family heirlooms.  </P></p>

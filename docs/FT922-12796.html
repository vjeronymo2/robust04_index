			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Court advocacy changes endorsed THE END of the Bar's 200-year monopoly on advocacy in the higher courts in England and Wales came a step closer yesterday as the committee set up to advise the Lord Chancellor endorsed wider advocacy rights for solicitors. Solicitors in private practice, qualified for three years, who can show experience of advocacy in the lower courts and who are prepared to attend a training course and pass tests on evidence and procedure, will be allowed to present cases in the higher courts. But the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Committee, established under the 1990 Courts and Legal Services Act, rejected applications for wider advocacy rights for employed solicitors and barristers in the Crown Prosecution Service, the Government Legal Service, local authorities and in commerce, finance and industry. Lord Griffiths, the law lord who chairs the committee, said advocates in the higher courts had to be able to show detachment and impartiality and to appear often enough in such courts to maintain their competence. The committee felt employed lawyers were unlikely to meet either criterion and said there was also no demand for lawyers in commerce and industry to have wider advocacy rights. It had also concluded that giving the CPS wider rights of audience would build up a 'monolithic prosecution service' leading to polarisation of attitudes between prosecution and defence as in the US. Lord Griffiths said there was some attraction in a mixed system with independent advocates prosecuting most crown court cases with the option for the CPS to prosecute a limited number of less serious cases. But the CPS had not overcome its problems of underfunding and a lack of skilled personnel. The Law Society welcomed the extension of rights for the practising profession, but was dismayed by the proposal to discriminate against employed solicitors. The CPS and the Government Legal Service, in a joint statement, also expressed concern that the committee had differentiated between certain groups of equally qualified lawyers. The Bar, which has been fighting a rearguard action to keep its monopoly, yesterday criticised the committee for 'two profound failures'. Mr Gareth Williams QC, Bar chairman, said the committee had failed to understand the public importance of the Bar's 'cab-rank' rule - which prevents barristers from refusing to act for clients - and had not imposed any obligation on solicitors to do legal aid work. He also criticised the minimal extra training solicitors would have to undergo to get wider advocacy rights.</p>

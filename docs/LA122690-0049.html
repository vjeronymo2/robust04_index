			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE: AROUND THE NFL;  </P> <P> TOLLIVER'S BENCHING IS CALLED A LESSON  </P> <P> Dan Henning, coach of the San Diego Chargers, says the benching of Billy Joe  Tolliver for the season finale against the Raiders at the Coliseum should be  taken as a message by the entire team.  </P> <P> "Position by position, we're looking for the right guys," Henning said. "Some  of those that are (on the team) now may not be the right guys."  </P> <P> Henning said that rookie John Friesz will start Sunday.  </P> <P> Tolliver threw crucial interceptions late in the fourth quarter of consecutive  losses to the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs.  </P> <P> "I think Tolliver has a future as a quarterback in this league and can win,"  Henning said. "He has gotten to the point where he does many things far and  above from what you'd expect a second-year quarterback to be able to do in his  development. But he still has a track record in the last part of the game in a  number of situations of not making the play that has to be made."  </P> <P> To Pittsburgh Steeler quarterback Bubby Brister, there is nothing like a dome.  </P> <P> Two years ago, Brister played one of the best games in his career, passing a  5-11 Steelers' team to a 37-34 upset in Houston that helped knock the Oilers  out of the playoffs.  </P> <P> Last year, after Houston beat Pittsburgh twice in the regular season, Brister  directed the Steelers to a 26-23 overtime upset in Houston in the AFC wild card  game.  </P> <P> On Sunday night, the Steelers (9-6) and Oilers (8-7) meet in the Astrodome to  decide the AFC Central championship.  </P> <P> "I like it in domes," Brister said. "The ball travels true and you don't have  to worry about bad weather."  </P> <P> After struggling with his weight for years, the Chicago Bears' William Perry  seems to have it under control.  </P> <P> His improved play is one of the reasons the Bears are 11-4. The slim-downed  Perry, officially listed at 325 pounds, is moving more quickly -- and is sixth  on the team in solo tackles with 37.  </P></p>

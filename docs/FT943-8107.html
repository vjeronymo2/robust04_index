			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / World Trade News: ABB wins contract for Java A consortium led by Asea Brown Boveri, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, has won a Dollars 733m order to build a 1,090MW power sta-tion at Muara Tawar, in West Java. The order was placed by Perusahaan Unum Listrik Negara (PLN), the Indonesian state electricity authority. It will be shared by ABB and its consortium partner, Marubeni of Japan. ABB's part is valued at about Dollars 400m. The deal will be supported by a financing package based on the participation of several export credit agencies, as well as a significant countertrade contract arranged by ABB Project &amp; Trade Finance. Marubeni is subcontracting the civil works to UK-owned Balfour Beatty Sakti Indonesia, part of BICC Group, and Japanese-owned PP Taisei Construction Indonesia. They have received a letter of intent for the Dollars 158m contract, which will be shared equally. The new combined-cycle power station will be gas and oil-fired. It is due for completion at the beginning of 1997. ABB said its very short project completion times had helped it win the order, with the first of six turbo-sets expected to be running within 17 months.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Clinton budget plan faces tough passage THE US Congress returns to Washington next week for a month of hard negotiation over the fate of President Bill Clinton's budget package. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, said in Tokyo yesterday that the final version of the budget legislation could be ready for Mr Clinton to sign by the first week of August, although some congressional staff see that as optimistic. The August recess will provide a deadline that is expected to force a compromise. The administration will essentially be left on the sidelines as negotiators from the House of Representatives and Senate seek to reconcile their all but irreconcilable versions of the omnibus budget bill. Mr Clinton made concessions on almost every aspect of his budget plan in order to win narrow victories in both chambers - by 219 votes to 213 in the House, and through the intervention of Vice-President Al Gore to break a 49-49 tie in the Senate - but the concessions he made were different in each chamber. Democratic leaders in both chambers now say that they cannot move far from their version of the budget without jeopardising the slender majorities they so painstakingly crafted. The key difference between the House and Senate bills is the energy tax. The House preserved the outlines of the broad energy tax originally proposed by Mr Clinton, though it exempted a number of specific sectors and increased the basic rate proposed to 26.8 cents per million British thermal units. Opposition from oil state senators, on the other hand, forced the Senate to back off from the Btu-based tax and instead opt for a transportation tax of 4.3 cents per gallon. While the House may be willing to accept some changes in the energy tax it passed, this wholesale revision seems likely to displease both environmentalists, who were already angry that a string of exemptions had gutted the tax of much of its energy-conservation effects, and westerners, who dislike petrol taxes because of the long dis-tances they have to drive. Mr Bentsen said only that he expected an energy tax to be included in the final bill. Other differences involve House efforts to provide money for programmes for the poor and for disadvantaged inner cities. The Senate reduced by more than a third the House's plan to expand the earned income tax credit for low-income wage earners, and eliminated altogether a plan to create 'empowerment zones' offering investment incentives to businesses. Besides these differences of substance, the House-Senate conference promises a political and procedural tussle. Republican senators have already warned that they will invoke a Senate rule barring 'extraneous' measures from budget legislation, threatening a number of measures in the House bill. This has prompted an angry response from Mr John Dingell, the powerful and irascible chairman of the House energy and commerce committee, denouncing the Senate for causing gridlock through this 'arcane technicality' of a rule.</p>

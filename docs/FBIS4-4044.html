			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Angel Lau and Michael Smith] </F>   [Text] China is secretly maneuvring to polish its human  rights image after the authorities suddenly postponed the trials  of 14 dissidents held on counter-revolution charges for nearly  two years. The decision was made in the runup to June when the  United States decides if the most-favoured-nation (MFN) trade  status will be granted.    Family sources said yesterday that Chinese authorities had  suddenly postponed, to an unspecified date, the trials of at  least 14 dissidents originally scheduled for this week,  following the weekend release of imprisoned dissident Wang  Juntao.    The brother of one defendant said: "The trial for the entire  group has been postponed indefinitely -- lawyers for each of the  defendants informed us by phone on Saturday."    The wife of another family member said: "I have no idea why  they have decided to postpone it. There is a good chance it has  something to do with MFN status."    A Beijing Intermediate Court spokesman said the case of the  14, the largest batch of political dissidents to be tried in  China since prosecutions following the 1989 Tiananmen Square  protests, was still in the pre-trial stage. She said by phone  it was difficult to say when the formal court session would be  held.    Meanwhile, the Chinese trade minister said in Hong Kong she  was confident of China getting the renewal after her lobbying  mission to the U.S. last week.    Wu Yi, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation,  said U.S. entrepreneurs and congressmen favoured an  unconditional U.S. renewal of MFN to China. "I have met a large  bunch of big entrepreneurs this time and all of them unanimously  think that MFN should be granted to China unconditionally," she  said, adding that the same attitude prevailed among some 30  senators she visited during her stay.    The dissidents were charged for alleged involvement in  underground pro-democracy and labour groups, among them the Free  Labour Union of China and the Liberal Democratic Party of China.  Two, Gao Yuxiang and Li Quanli, have been excused from  prosecution, at least temporarily, because of illness, the  relatives said. In Washington, the visiting Chief Secretary  Anson Chan continued to lobby key congressmen for unconditional  renewal of MFN.    A leading proponent of linking MFN and human rights  congressman Nancy Pelosi brought forward a meeting with Mrs.  Chan.    The two met last night (HK time) following an interview with  Mrs. Chan on the national CNN television network.    Mrs. Chan also kept a number of appointments with key MFN  players including House speaker Tom Foley, Democratic leader in  the Senate George Mitchell, and Assistant Secretary of State for  East Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord.    Also in Washington, a White House press secretary said the  release of Mr. Wang was "a positive step" toward meeting U.S.  conditions for renewed MFN to China.</p>

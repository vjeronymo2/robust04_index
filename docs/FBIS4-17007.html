			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian President Yeltsin has sent greetings to the  congress of the Association of Russian Banks, which opened in  Moscow today. The greetings say: Russia's economy needs an  effective payments system, more active involvement of commercial  banks in investment projects, expansion of the banking services  sector, and an improvement in quality. We believe that these  issues will be a topic for professional debate at your congress.  The president wished the congress productive work.</p>

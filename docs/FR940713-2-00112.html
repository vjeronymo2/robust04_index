			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, in the March 1, 1994, notice and in a subsequent notice appearing May 16, 1994, 59 FR 25506, the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office established the initial procedural dates that would apply to the 1992 and 1993 DART proceedings, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 10, 1994_comments from claimants due on whether controversies exist in the distribution of 1992 and 1993 DART funds, and whether the 1992 and 1993 DART distribution proceedings should be consolidated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 15, 1994_precontroversy motions, and/or objections to any listed arbitrators due from claimants who will be participating in the 1992 and/or 1993 DART distribution proceedings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 30, 1994_declaration by the Librarian of Congress to be made as to whether any controversies exist in the distribution of 1992 and 1993 DART royalties, and, if they do, a declaring of the initiation of CARP proceedings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> August 1, 1994_authorization by the Copyright Office of the distribution of any royalties found not to be in controversy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. The Commentators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We received comments from the following claimants:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> The Alliance of Artists and Recording Companies (AARC)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ymistye L.

(BMI); Copyright Management, Inc. (CMI), Gospel Music Coalition (GOSPEL); The Harry Fox Agency, Inc. (HFA); SESAC, Inc. (SESAC), and the Songwriters Guild of America (SGA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jointly, ASCAP, BMI, CMI, GOSPEL, HFA, SESAC, and the SGA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Motion to Consolidate and Stay Procedural Dates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The comments indicated that, while many settlements were reached, there still existed some unresolved controversies in each of the subfunds. Rather than requesting the immediate initiation of a CARP proceeding to resolve these controversies, a joint motion was filed by AARC, ASCAP, BMI, CMI, GOSPEL, HFA, SESAC, and SGA requesting that the Librarian of Congress and the Copyright Office consolidate the 1992 and the 1993 DART distribution proceedings with the 1994 DART distribution proceedings that will start next year, and defer all consideration of DART distributions until 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a consequence of their motion to consolidate, the joint commentators also requested that the initial DART procedural dates of June 15 (precontroversy motions and objections), June 30 (initiation of proceedings), and August 1 (authorization of distributions) be stayed until after the 1994 claims are filed in 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Justification of Motion to Consolidate and Stay of Procedural Dates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In support of their motion to consolidate, the joint commentators noted that the 1992 and the 1993 DART funds, which are the first funds to be collected under the Audio Home Recording Act that took effect on October 28, 1992, are quite small: a little over $100,000 for 1992, and less than $500,000 for 1993. They anticipate that, because the DART fund is new, many issues of first impression will have to be resolved, but that the costs of such action will be such as to consume most, if not all, of the fund. The joint commentators observed that the costs borne by the copyright owners in a DART proceeding are not only their own costs, but the costs of the Library of Congress, the Copyright Office, and the arbitrators. In the interest of economy, therefore, the joint commentators requested that the 1992 and 1993 distribution proceedings be consolidated with the 1994 proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the joint commentators noted that the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office have endeavored to adopt regulations to govern the new CARP proceedings, but that the current regulations are interim rules. Comments on the interim rules were due June 15, 1994, and reply comments are due July 15, 1994. The joint commentators would prefer that a DART proceeding operate under the final rules that result from these latest rounds of comments, rather than proceed under the interim rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Last, the joint commentators stated that they will endeavor to use the time between now and 1995 to gather the best information and data relevant to a DART distribution proceeding, and to continue to work for more settlements in each of the subfunds. To the extent that more settlements are reached, fewer controversies will need to be brought before the arbitrators, and fewer royalties will have to be spent on the expense of a CARP proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  B. Grant of Motion to Stay Procedural Dates and Establishment of Comment Period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On June 21, 1994, the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office issued an Order finding good cause to grant the motion to stay the procedural dates of June 15, June 30, and August 1, established in this proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concerning the motion to consolidate the 1992, 1993, and 1994 distribution proceedings, the Order gave those persons who did not join in the joint motion until June 24, 1994, to respond to it, as provided by &sect;251.45 of the Copyright Office rules. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 251.45 provides that the comment period for precontroversy motions is two weeks from the filing of the motion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

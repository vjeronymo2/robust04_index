			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Arts: New WNO 'Lucia' - Opera Fresh from its success at the Edinburgh Festival, Welsh National Opera is keen not to let the impetus flag. As the season gets underway at the New Theatre in Cardiff, the company has announced the commission of a new opera from Peter Maxwell Davies called The Doctors of Myddfai - a mythical Welsh tale about a mystery illness and unearthly medical secrets, to be seen in 1996. For the time being more mundane matters are at hand. It is not long since WNO last put on Lucia di Lammermoor, although a Donizetti evening in which the most notable protagonist is the conductor can hardly be regarded an unqualified success. Thinking back to the company's days in the front line of modernist production styles, one might have assumed that a second try in so short a period was to invite a controversial producer to deliver the full-frontal assault missed last time. Not so: lovers of bel canto can come out of their bunkers. This new production is virtually non-existent; the singing is left centre-stage. Following on a line of lyric sopranos that has included Caballe and Ricciarelli, Janice Watson turns the role of Lucia into a vehicle for luminous, long-breathed, lyrical singing. Nothing that she has done before has suggested the ease with which she negotiates the high-lying passages in the mad scene, sung with the poise of an expert tightrope-walker. A period of study for the role in Italy has clearly paid off, though not yet enough to make the coloratura sparkle or the Italian words bite (the narrative aria 'Regnava nel silenzio' sounded nice but did not tell a story). Her Lucia is a sweetly vulnerable creature, who skips around the stage, running her hands innocently through her long blond air. According to a note in the programme her clandestine romance with Martin Thompson's visibly neurotic Edgardo makes her grow into a 'quiet revolutionary', though Rennie Wright's production fails to make clear on stage what that might mean. Thompson is an American tenor with easy top notes, an Anglo-Saxon sounding voice and good vocal manners, who is evidently much in demand. Tenors who can diminuendo on a top C are never two-a-penny. Nobody else succeeds in lighting up the miserable gloom of this staging, which works against David Barrell's Enrico and Michael Druiett's voluminously loud Raimondo. It is ironic that WNO's Music Director, Carlo Rizzi, should be opening the season at Covent Garden with Puccini and Rossini revivals, leaving Italian opera duties in Cardiff to Julian Smith. Looking at the stage, one could hardly blame him. When a ram gets its throat cut for a toast in blood at the wedding, it suggests a thirst for novelty which is nowhere else evident. We know we are in Scotland because the men of the chorus are wearing kilts, but the rest of the production consists of two grey walls and half-a-dozen tables, which clansmen shift around periodically for visual splendour and dramatic thrill. Clearly the money ran out at the drawing-board stage. Then again, was there a drawing-board stage? Sponsored by the Peter Moores Foundation</p>

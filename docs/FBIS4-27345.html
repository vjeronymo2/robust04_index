			<p>CSO     [Text] Oil prospecting and development projects off  Vietnam, which started along with expectations for discovering  new oil fields, are entering the second stage without seeing any  big results. On 19 April, a U.S.-Japan cartel which Mobil of the  United States formed with Japanese firms such as Japan Petroleum  Exploration formally signed a contract acquiring rights to the  Blue Dragon (05-1b mining area) off the south. Moreover, the  Arabian Oil and Teikoku Oil group, which has drilled two test  wells so far and failed with both, has obtained a "firm-in" from  Mobil of the United States and BP of Great Britain, and has  started study on a third test well. Mitsubishi Oil also has  begun drilling a test well for the first time. Moreover,  Idemitsu Kosan is making test wells off the north. However, the  situation is that if "results" do not appear with these test  projects, it is predicted that the Vietnam "oil development  boom" will cool rapidly. The project which is being conducted  centering on Arabian Oil and Teikoku Oil symbolizes the oil  development work off of Vietnam. They have dug two test wells so  far, but both entered a high-pressure gas layer before reaching  the target depth, they stopped the operation and abandoned both.  Idemitsu Kosan also is conducting test drilling in a mining area  off the north, but the first was "empty," they now are drilling  the second, and are at the stage of watching for "results" that  will appear in May. Mitsubishi Oil also began drilling their  first test well in April, and the results will appear in early  summer. Except for Blue Dragon by the Mobil-Japan Petroleum  Exploration-Indonesian Oil-Nissho Iwai group, all physical  prospecting has ended and they have begun drilling test wells,  but the expected "results" have not appeared so far. Since oil  development off of Vietnam had appeared to be one of the few  promising areas remaining in Southeast Asia, the international  trade war has "become overheated" and the so-called sign bonus  rate which is paid to Vietnam at the time of the contract is  said to have become very highly "irregular" for these kind of  business talks. The final conclusion as to whether or not they  have made an expensive purchase will come soon.</p>

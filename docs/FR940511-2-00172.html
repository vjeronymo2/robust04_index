			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such warrants shall be direct obligations of their issuer subject to cash settlement in U.S. dollars, and exercisable throughout their life ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> American style) or exercisable only at expiration ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> European style). Upon exercise, or at the warrant expiration date (if not exercisable prior to such date), the holder of a warrant will be entitled to a cash settlement value computed in accordance with a formula specified in the issuer's prospectus. If ``out of the money'' at the time of expiration, the warrants will expire worthless.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Warrants may be structured either to increase or decrease in value based on the increase or decrease in the price or yield of the government bond or bonds. Because all payments will be required to be in U.S. dollars, there would be no currency risk except to the extent that fluctuations in the value of the relevant currency affect the price or yield of the government bond(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amex will require that member firms only sell such warrants to investors whose accounts have been approved for options trading pursuant to Amex Rule 921. The Exchange also will distribute a circular to its membership prior to the commencement of trading calling attention to the risks associated with the purchase and trading of such warrants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At this time, the Exchange anticipates the listing of a warrant issue based on the prices of between three and five foreign government issues. Holders of such warrants would be entitled to receive from the issuer in U.S. dollars a cash settlement value, if any, based on changes in the arithmetic average yield to maturity of the bonds as calculated by the designated Calculation Agent based on prices obtained from three dealers in the bonds. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange represents that it will consult with Commission staff prior to listing warrant issues tied to government bond(s) with respect to (1) the specific calculation methodology to be used by individual warrant issuers, and (2) the adequacy of available bond pricing information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to promote just and equitable principals of trade, and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers and dealers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amex believes that the proposed rule change will not impose an inappropriate burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants, or Others  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.

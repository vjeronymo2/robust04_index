			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / The Markets: Impact of an invisible trend - Global Investor Some worldwide economic trends are easy for investors to come to terms with. Manufacturing is heading east? Buy Hong Kong. Interest rates are falling? Buy banks and property. Inflation's on the wane? Look for companies with long-term pricing flexibility. And so on. Other trends are much harder to translate into investment decisions. We know the score, but can't quite see how to play it. That's certainly the case with one of the profound trends reshaping manufacturing industry: the death of vertical integration. Not only is it difficult to disentangle the winners and losers; it is also hard to decide if this is an idea that has come and gone or if its full impact has yet to be felt. After all, the sort of complete vertical integration once practised at Ford's Rouge plant - iron ore in one end, cars out the other - has been out of fashion for at least 30 years. It's been clear for nearly two decades that the US car companies' heavy reliance on in-house components put them at a significant competitive disadvantage to their Japanese rivals. And in the 1980s, industries as disparate as oil and computers started to look again at how vertically integrated they should be. The trend though is still making itself felt. Last week ICL, the UK-based arm of Japan's Fujitsu, turned its factory into an electronics contract manufacturer, as part of its decentralisation plan. And Coopers and Lybrand's automobile experts announced that, though the car-makers have already moved away from vertical integration, you ain't seen nothing yet. The successful car companies of the future will be assemblers, not manufacturers, says the Coopers study. Fewer than 10 of the present 25 main engine manufacturers will survive. With a complete new car costing nearly Dollars 1.5bn to develop, the study says, collaboration and further outsourcing is inevitable. New union agreements in Germany, for example, will allow Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen to do much more outsourcing, following a path already trodden by the US (and bringing Europe more into line with the pattern always operated in Japan). 'Only final assembly will remain a core manufacturer skill for product variety and quality reasons.' What's the investment implication? Well, the study concludes that the most profitable firms in the industry in the year 2000 will be second-tier component suppliers, design houses and de-integrated car manufacturers. First-tier suppliers and integrated car manufacturers will underperform. Perhaps. But the example of the high-quality bicycle industry, which has never been vertically integrated, offers an alternative vision of the future. Its key players are not the assemblers, or the second-tier suppliers, but the big manufacturers of components, whose brand image and global reach outstrips the assemblers. Analogously, the personal computer business is becoming one in which two first-tier suppliers, Intel and Microsoft, have the global status and the profits, leaving the assemblers and the second-tier suppliers slim pickings. Perhaps the first component manufacturer to follow Intel's lead by advertising 'GKN inside' or 'Nippondenso under the bonnet' will be the car industry play of the 21st century. World's best Whatever the future may hold, 1993 was certainly kind to the car companies, in stock market terms at least. As the chart shows, car stocks were one of the top four best-performing global sectors in the FT-Actuaries World Index last year, and they have now regained all the ground lost to the recession. The chart shows last year's top four sectors in a longer-term perspective. (The sparkling performance of the Diversified Consumer Goods and Services sector probably owes as much to the presence of two of Hong Kong's biggest companies, Jardine Matheson and Hutchison Whampoa, as to any more humdrum cyclical factors.) Only three FT-AWI sectors lost value last year: beverage and tobacco manufacturers fell 3.8 per cent, under the influence of the Great Brands Panic. Health and personal care dropped 2.1 per cent as the US, Germany and  -last week - Italy put the squeeze on drugs prices. Textiles and clothing also fell, by 0.9 per cent. In global terms, the long-debated switch out of defensive stocks into cyclicals has already begun. Ruritania When the European Monetary Institute holds its first meeting on Tuesday, it will be easy to make Ruritanian jokes about an institution that has no offices and no obvious role. Easy, but wrong. The EMI illustrates the trend towards putting monetary policy in the hands of technocrats, even if as an institution it has little direct influence. In the long run, the deflationary bias inherent in such an approach will provoke political tensions, perhaps fatal ones. Until then however, the trend will place powerful downward pressure on prices. If 19th century Russia's governing principle was autocracy tempered by assassination, the political economy of late 20th century western Europe will be deflation tempered by popular revolt. The trick will be to estimate where, and how forcefully, the people's voice will make itself heard. Debt not equity The craze for emerging markets is usually described in terms of portfolio investment in equities, as in the left-hand chart. But this is a small proportion of the huge flow of funds to the rapidly growing economies of south-east Asia. The World Bank estimates that Dollars 60bn (Pounds 40bn) flowed into the region's developing countries last year, of which only Dollars 4bn was portfolio equity investments. The great bulk was made up of Dollars 27bn of long-term debt and Dollars 25bn of foreign direct investments. These figures were exactly double the level of 1990. Option to default Old-school investors will be dismayed by one aspect of the rapid proliferation of option theory at US business schools. The traditional bond versus equity debate - from the point of view of the issuer - has been transformed by the notion that a company issuing long-term debt is, in effect, acquiring an option as to whether to repay the principal, since bankruptcy is always available as an alternative. If the purchasers of the debt implicitly under-price this option, issuing bonds is inherently more attractive than issuing equity, a perception that might explain the steady drift upwards in the indebtedness of US corporations in the 1980s. In the 1990s, issuers started to price the 'option' more realistically, and gearing fell. Now, balance sheets have been restored by the equity issues of recent years; and the implicit option price has been falling for many borrowers as spreads for junk bonds have narrowed. The balance of advantage may be shifting back. A contribution to this debate comes in a recent paper from Moody's, the rating agency, assessing how US credit quality has changed over the past 70 years. It can be summed up in one word: worse. In the most difficult year of the 1960s, for example, Moody's had to downgrade only 2.9 per cent of issues. In the 1970s, a much more disturbed decade, the worst year saw 5.1 per cent downgraded, but many years saw 2 per cent or less. In every year since 1982, however, downgradings have run at more than 5 1/2 per cent of issues outstanding, and in some years the figure has been much higher. In 1986, for example, nearly one in 10 issues was downgraded; and though the figure has fallen since 1990, it was still 5.7 per cent in 1993, otherwise a great year for corporate America. Will the reversion to 1960s levels of interest rates also see a return to that decade's relative rating stability? Or has there been a permanent shift in issuers' attitude towards their debt obligations, as the option theory implies? It's hard to tell. One aspect of the Moody's study is entirely unambiguous, however. An upward revision of a rating is equally likely to be followed by a downgrade or a further upgrade - there is no 'upward momentum.' But, alas, 'downward momentum' does exist. Once an issue has been downgraded, it is statistically more likely to go further down than up. In credit quality as in life: once things start to go wrong they usually get worse.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 25/11/93  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    -------------- % change over period ---------------                    US    Japan    Germany    France     Italy       UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash   Week           0.06     0.05       0.12      0.13      0.16     0.09   Month          0.29     0.19       0.53      0.57      0.73     0.46   Year           3.88     3.47       7.44      9.56     12.88     6.69  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year   Week           0.08    -0.04       0.09     -0.04      0.08    -0.31   Month          0.14     0.44       0.94      1.39      2.69     0.36   Year           8.60    11.33      12.63     17.57     27.99    13.03  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year   Week          -0.12     0.15      -0.16     -0.39     -0.18    -0.84   Month         -0.34     0.96       1.45      2.19      4.10     1.49   Year          12.09    15.30      16.29     23.08     40.09    20.46  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities   Week          -0.2      1.4       -1.0      -0.6      -2.7     -1.1   Month          0.4      3.2        4.8       4.7       4.6      5.1   Year          10.1     14.7       44.9      31.2      41.9     25.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BEST PERFORMING STOCKS FROM FT-A WORLD INDICES IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 25/11/93  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                            -------- % change --------                                 Close      Week      Month       Year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- United Plantations      11.5 MDollars      64.3      152.2      199.5 Shangri-La Hotel         7.2 SDollars      33.3       46.3       51.9 Tudor (Spain)         1195.0 P             27.4       48.6      160.3 Amdahl (USA)            7.00 UDollars      27.3       27.3       -1.8 Edaran Otomobile        19.9 MDollars      25.2       22.8      128.7 Adia (Br)              237.0 SF            24.7       61.6       55.9 Radiotechnique         439.0 FF            24.7       26.7       98.6 Faber                   4.38 MDollars      24.4       41.3      373.5 Tasek Cement            7.80 MDollars      21.9       31.1       77.3 Highveld Steel          20.0 R             21.2       45.5      142.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

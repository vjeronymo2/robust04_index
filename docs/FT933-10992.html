			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Generators firm A preliminary inquiry into electricity industry pricing was greeted calmly by market watchers who thought that Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, had left open sufficient options for the generators to respond positively. The relaxed tone in the market enabled National Power to climb 6 to 367p with PowerGen putting on 7 to 394p. Several regional electricity companies moved ahead on the wave that has carried them for several days - their high yields. East Midlands went up 8 to 496p; Northern added 7 to 549p and Seeboard improved 6 to 555p. There was more positive comment on the possible sale of Augustus Barnett, owned by Bass, to Allied Lyons' Victoria Wines. Analysts said the final outcome was likely to involve Bass's being able to continue to supply its products through the enlarged chain. A price tag of around Pounds 45m has been put on the proposed deal by analysts. Bass put on 5 to 487p, Allied 4 to 574p. In telecoms, Investors again shunned BT ordinary shares, which ended the day a penny down at 414 1/2 p. Profit-taking left Cable and Wireless (C&amp;W) 3 1/2 off at 811p. The stock had surged on Thursday on the back of a positive message to analysts from Hong Kong Telecom, in which C&amp;W has a majority stake. After a dramatic week in the pharmaceutical sector, which saw global tie-ups in the OTC markets, a Dollars 6bn takeover in the US and the first results from Zeneca, most stocks stopped to pause for breath. Glaxo weakened as the market fretted over an important court case due to start soon. The shares lost 8 1/2 to 547 1/2 p. SmithKline Beecham declined 16 to 445p, Wellcome 8 to 687p and Zeneca 11 1/2 to 634 1/2 p. Food retail stocks continued their recent rally, with Argyll Group leading the way. The shares closed 10 ahead at 319p. Elsewhere, Iceland gained 7 to 216p, Morrison 5 to 142p and J Sainsbury 9 to 475p. However, sector specialists cautioned that the rally was likely to be shortlived as the problems behind the recent raft of downgrades - such as overcapacity and low inflation - remained. Hotel group Forte again hung back in a mostly dull leisure sector as talk of another large seller was heard. Earlier this week, one institution disposed of nearly 14m shares giving the stock's highest ever daily turnover of 29m. Yesterday saw a more moderate 1.4m shares change hands as the stock slipped a penny to 216p. Reports of weak European trading at Rank Xerox were said to have impacted on Rank Organisation, off 8 at 728p. Stanley Leisure responded to some determined buying by Schroders, the shares finishing 9 up at 243p. Nerves ahead of NatWest's interims - due next Tuesday - cut the share price by 6 to 495p. Barclays slipped back 5 to 482p in a sector generally thought to have hit the top of its range. Building stocks with exposure to Germany continued to benefit from the turmoil in the ERM and hopes of lower interest rates. Redland added 11 to 515p and RMC moved up 8 to 805p. Wolseley put on 8 to 623p in the wake of NatWest Securities highlighting the stock as a long-term quality investment. Doubts over relaxation of television takeover regulations took their toll on television stocks. The market moved on comments by the heritage secretary and LWT (Hdgs) pfd fell back 8 to 475p; Anglia eased 4 to 334p and Carlton Communications lost 12 to 1973p. Stocks with exposure to the French market made gains on hopes of an interest rate cut. Among these, Arjo Wiggins climbed 9 to 205p, CarnardMetalbox 50 to 2500p and Kingfisher 17 to 634p.</p>

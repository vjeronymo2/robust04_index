			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: We'll be worse off with the Budget - Well, that's what one accountant thinks. Others differ WITH THE first of two Budgets this year just over two weeks away, some of the large accountancy firms are predicting measures which the chancellor of the exchequer, Norman Lamont, might announce on March 16. In most cases, there will be few precautionary measures individuals can take even if the forecasts turn out to be right. If value-added tax were to be introduced on books and children's clothes, for instance, stocking up on these in advance has its limits. Other measures may have more practical consequences. One prediction is that tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) may be abolished - an incentive, if ever there was one, to get every member of the family to open one, even with only a small deposit. 'Most of us will be worse off than before,' says Peter Wyman, tax partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'The question is, by how much and in which areas.' But since Lamont has a difficult task to bolster confidence and stimulate the economy while funding a deficit, there are many who expect the first Budget to be cautious and the second to contain more radical measures. So, what may we expect? Personal taxes. Both Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Young believe Lamont will extend the 20 per cent income tax band, which he introduced in the last Budget, on the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. E&amp;Y suggests it could replace the 25 per cent basic-rate tax band through its extension to the first Pounds 10,000 of taxable income. To maintain tax revenue, E&amp;Y thinks Lamont could convert the remainder of the 25 per cent band to 30 per cent and alter the 40 per cent threshold. For Coopers &amp; Lybrand and KPMG Peat Marwick, however, the most likely outcome is that, like last year, the thresholds will not be increased in line with inflation. By making no change, the Treasury would get an extra Pounds 1bn in revenue. Other personal taxes. Coopers believes that inheritance tax and capital gains tax will both be increased with inflation and that there is a chance the threshold on IHT could be raised to as much as Pounds 175,000. KPMG says there are rumours that CGT might be rebased to 1992 which would, in some cases, have the effect of delaying accrued losses. Personal allowances. Coopers thinks that Lamont is likely to allow personal allowances to rise with inflation, but E&amp;Y predicts no indexation for allowances. Price Waterhouse thinks the married couples' allowance will be left unchanged at Pounds 1,720. Value-added tax. Since every percentage point increase in the standard rate of VAT means the Treasury would raise Pounds 2bn, it is an obvious target for the chancellor. Although an increase in the standard rate from 17.5 to 18.5 - or even 20 - per cent is possible, E&amp;Y thinks that such an increase is more likely to come in the second Budget. Price Waterhouse, Touche Ross and Coopers think that a new, reduced rate of possibly 5 per cent could be introduced on items hitherto exempt - such as books, newspapers and children's clothes. National Insurance contributions. Price Waterhouse says: 'The yield from this hidden tax, which is charged on both employers and employees, is so high that the government can be expected to continue its policy of quietly increasing the amount it raises while deflecting public attention onto income tax reduction.' PW and E&amp;Y believe the chancellor could decide further moves to integrate NIC with income tax, while E&amp;Y thinks employers' NIC could be extended to taxable benefits. Touche Ross wonders if Lamont will be tempted to remove the earnings cap for the self-employed, who enjoy more generous treatment than others for NIC purposes. Savings and personal investment. Touche Ross does not expect major changes to personal equity plans and Tessas but E&amp;Y thinks the latter could be axed. PW thinks Lamont could allow the inclusion of gilts in Peps to encourage people to buy more of them. While there is no CGT on gilts, they are liable to income tax - but anything in a Pep is exempt from either taxes. The business expansion scheme will be extinguished at the end of December, but Touche Ross and E&amp;Y think the chancellor could announce an end to 'loan back' schemes - which allow an exit from the scheme after six months - for the rest of the year. Cars. When Lamont abolished car tax last year, he warned that he would take other measures to recoup the loss. A steep increase in petrol duty is, therefore, expected by all. KPMG and Touche Ross think new scale rates for company cars may also be introduced, following the proposal last July by the Inland Revenue for basing taxation of company car benefits on the cost of the vehicle rather than engine size. Other possible areas for action include reforming the taxation of trusts and introducing an earnings cap for retirement annuity premiums, to bring them into line with personal pension plans. There is a possibility that the lump sum payable on maturity could be taxed on new plans. Lamont could also announce the gradual phasing-out of mortgage interest tax relief, although the delicate state of the housing market might inhibit him from doing so in the first Budget. Finally, the Revenue's new tax return form, which will be sent out in April, is expected to herald the beginning of 'self-assessment' where individuals will estimate their own liability - although the Revenue will be able to challenge the result.</p>

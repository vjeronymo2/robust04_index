			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 Beta Test and HELP Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Both the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and the HELP programs are currently planning to expand the geographic coverage and scope of their initial activities. The ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 beta test is expected to involve up to 5000 CMVs in the I&hyph;75 and Canadian Highway 401 corridor. The purpose of the beta test is to evaluate the actual operation of the transponders and to assess their potential to be used as a part of everyday motor carrier operations on a nationwide basis. HELP will deploy an ITS information network for CMVs in the original HELP/CRESCENT States, as well as in several additional ones. HELP is planning to equip at least 25,000 CMVs in its fee-for-service system by the end of 1995, and at least twice that many a year later.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Motor carriers participating in the programs have to meet stringent prequalification criteria set by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP. For ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75, these criteria include: (1) A Satisfactory safety rating from the FHWA Office of Motor Carriers; (2) an acceptable record in all States and/or Canadian Provinces in which the carrier intends to operate (including registration and taxes, safety performance, and other compliance items consistent with existing statutes); (3) agreement to abide by the FMCSRs or the Canadian equivalent; (4) agreement to participate in the project evaluation process; and (5) the carriers' self-certification that their enrolled trucks will meet an inspection protocol, at least quarterly, equivalent to the requirements of a Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance Level 1 inspection. The beta test is scheduled to commence in March 1995 and to continue for two years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Criteria for participation in the HELP program differ slightly. However, all States will require motor carriers to have a Satisfactory safety rating from the FHWA Office of Motor Carriers and be in compliance with administrative requirements (such as fuel tax and registration). Inspectors in the HELP States can require that as many as 5 percent of all electronically cleared CMVs enter inspection stations to verify their safety and administrative status. The officer at the inspection station can also override any bypass on a vehicle-by-vehicle basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA received formal requests for a waiver of the requirements of &sect;393.60(c) from the Commonwealth of Kentucky on September 19, 1994, and from HELP on August 31, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA believes that both motor carriers and the travelling public may derive substantial operational and safety benefits from the use of ITS/CVO technologies. The Congress has made the ITS program the centerpiece of a concerted effort to apply advanced technology to America's highway transportation system. The ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP programs are the first in a series of field trials of AVI devices for commercial motor vehicles. In the relatively short term, this technology could improve the productivity of both the trucking industry and State enforcement personnel by reducing the need for repeated vehicle inspections. It would also reduce fuel consumption and air pollution, and may improve highway safety by reducing congestion, particularly around inspection stations. It would also enable POE officials to target their resources to deal with vehicles more likely to be operating in noncompliance with safety and administrative regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While members of the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 Policy Committee have informally expressed interest in petitioning the FHWA to change the requirements of &sect;393.60(c), it is the agency's belief that this section should be subject to a more detailed review than is possible in the short time remaining before the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 beta test and the HELP program commence. The FHWA is therefore proposing to provide a waiver from the requirements of &sect;393.60(c) to the vehicles participating in the beta phase of the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 project. Because the HELP program proposes to use the same transponders as ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75, the FHWA also proposes to provide a waiver to those participating vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA notes that no safety concerns or complaints have been reported by alpha test participants, nor by any other parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petition for a waiver is being considered under section 206(f) of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 (49 U.S.C. 31136(e), formerly 49 U.S.C. app. 2505(f)) which authorizes waivers of any regulation issued under the authority of that Act upon a determination that the waiver is consistent with the public interest and the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conditions of the Waiver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Location of the Transponder  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a condition of the waiver, the FHWA proposes that the transponder be mounted at or near the top center of the windshield, outside the area swept by the CMV's windshield wipers, or, at a minimum, outside the driver's sight lines to the road and highway signs or signals. The FHWA believes that this location would have no discernable effect on a driver's ability to operate the vehicle safely. The AVI device would be placed in a position that would be within the portion of the windshield covered by a sunvisor. It is also in approximately the same relative position in the windshield of a CMV as that of a rear-view mirror in a passenger car. There is no evidence that sunvisors or rear-view mirrors pose a threat to safety by obstructing a driver's vision, and thus, we have no reason to believe that a transponder of the type and dimensions to be used in the test would have a negative effect on safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II. Compliance With Wiring Requirements of the FMCSRs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The installation of the transponder would be required to comply with &sect;393.27, Wiring specifications, and &sect;393.33, Wiring [and] installation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Paisley's party and Sinn Fein make gains in Ulster poll EXPECTATIONS OF an early resumption of the round-table talks on Northern Ireland appeared to fade last night as the final results for the province's local elections showed that Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party, which is led by the Rev Ian Paisley, had reversed their electoral decline. In Belfast Sinn Fein emerged with 23.2 per cent, the biggest share of the vote for any party, outpolling even the Ulster Unionist party. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said the result 'has dramatically renovated Sinn Fein's mandate'. Across the province the Sinn Fein vote increased by 1.5 percentage points to 12.5 per cent, winning it 51 council seats out of the 582 total. The Ulster Unionist party, the largest party in Northern Ireland, saw its support slip by 5 points to 29 per cent, although it increased the number of seats it holds from 193 to 197. Mr Herbert Ditty, the hard-line unionist Lord Mayor of Belfast, lost his seat to Mr Chris McGimpsey, an independent unionist, but control of the council remains in Unionist hands by a slim majority. Mr Ken Maginnis, deputy leader of the UUP, lost his seat in Dungannon, while the nationalist SDLP consolidated its hold on Derry council, winning an absolute majority of 17 seats. The turnout across the province was 55 per cent. The overall nationalist vote apparently rose as Unionist participation fell. The main loser has been the Conservative party, which saw most of the gains it made in the 1989 local elections wiped out. The Conservatives won only six seats, against more than 10 last time, with support apparently drifting back to the centrist Alliance party. The Alliance vote increased by 1 point to 7.7 per cent, but its support appears increasingly concentrated in the middle-class areas of the east and south-east of the province. Mr Brian Feeney, a spokesman for the SDLP, said the vote for the political extremes had hardened in those areas which had suffered the most political violence over the past year, while the vote for the more moderate SDLP, UUP and Alliance parties had held up or improved where there was greater stability. He said the Belfast result 'will have knocked a lot of people back on their heels'. Mr Addie Morrow, until recently the chairman of the Alliance party, said: 'I believe the result is very bad for the future of Northern Ireland. The electorate has given no encouragement for the parties to get together and negotiate.' Mr Richard McCaulay, the spokesman for Sinn Fein, whose party has been excluded from talks because of its support for the IRA, said future political talks 'are almost certain to fail unless a process is developed which excludes no-one'. The DUP described its result as 'a left hook' to efforts by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, to get talks going again. Mr Peter Robinson, the DUP deputy leader, said: 'If Sir Patrick Mayhew cannot read the message of this election then he needs glasses.' The DUP 'is not interested in the talks on the basis of the blueprint that (Sir Patrick) has offered'. Results: UUP 197 seats; DUP 103; SDLP 127; Sinn Fein 51; Alliance 44; Conservatives 6; Independents 51.</p>

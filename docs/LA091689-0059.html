			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> SALVADOR REBEL PEACE PLAN CRAFTED TO WIN U.S. FAVOR  </P> <P> Although El Salvador's leftist guerrillas sat down to talk peace with the  right-wing government of President Alfredo Cristiani this week, their words  really were aimed at their other long-time adversary -- Washington.  </P> <P> The rebel peace proposal, which calls for sweeping political reforms in  exchange for laying down their arms, was crafted for consumption by the Bush  Administration: It was short on rhetoric and emphasized issues that already are  a part of U.S. policy, such as judicial reform.  </P> <P> Dressed like senators and appealing directly to the U.S. Congress, the  Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front commanders were the picture of  conciliation.  </P> <P> "(We) aspire to a Christmas and New Year with peace in our country," commander  Schafik Jorge Handal said Thursday. "We hope that 1990 is the year the war  definitively ends and that our country enters a new, qualitatively better era  of its history."  </P> <P> For nearly a year, the rebels have been pursuing a two-track policy of stepping  up military attacks to prove their strength at home while pushing  internationally for a negotiated settlement in the 9 1/2-year war.  </P> <P> After President Bush's election last November, guerrilla commander Joaquin  Villalobos emerged from six years in the mountains of El Salvador to say that  he believed the new Administration would be "more pragmatic" than the  eight-year Reagan Administration and more willing to negotiate.  </P> <P> In the following months, the rebels increased economic sabotage and attacks on  military installations and began a campaign of assassinations in San Salvador.  At the same time, they offered to stop the war and participate in presidential  elections if the March 19 vote were postponed.  </P> <P> The guerrillas dropped their demands for power-sharing and integration of the  rebel and government armies -- both points the U.S. government had opposed. But  the Bush Administration was new and slow to respond, and then-President Jose  Napoleon Duarte rejected the offer. Cristiani went on to win by a landslide and  took office June 1, promising to seek a solution to the war.  </P> <P> While the American-educated Cristiani is well-received in Washington, the  rebels believe that his Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena party, is  problematic for the U.S. government.  </P> <P> In the past, U.S. officials have accused Arena's most powerful leader, retired  Maj. Roberto D'Aubuisson, of masterminding "death squad" killings and plotting  to assassinate a U.S. ambassador. Duarte, Washington's old ally, repeatedly  accused D'Aubuisson of having ordered the 1980 assassination of the archbishop  of San Salvador, Msgr. Oscar A. Romero.  </P> <P> Many of the hard-line Arena members, meanwhile, view U.S. involvement as a  thorn in their side. They believe the U.S. strategy of low-intensity conflict  has failed and that by attaching human rights to economic aid, the U.S. has in  fact hampered their war.  </P> <P> The guerrillas apparently see the unhappy alliance between Arena and the United  States as providing them with a chance to pursue negotiations with a U.S.  blessing.  </P> <P> "It's not that we think there is a crisis in Washington," said rebel spokesman  Salvador Samayoa. "It's that we think our proposal offers Washington a low-cost  solution."  </P> <P> On a global scale, the rebels are looking at the resolution of conflicts in  Nicaragua, Angola and Afghanistan and believe the trend could also lead to a  reduction of U.S. involvement in El Salvador.  </P> <P> "Internationally, there is less space for war not only for us but for the  government, too," rebel commander Handal said. "You can see this in editorials  in U.S. newspapers that ask how long the (U.S. government) is going to finance  this war."  </P> <P> The rebels have often expressed their belief that without American  interference, they would have won the war a long time ago, either militarily or  politically. The rebels' peace proposals apparently are based in their  conviction that if allowed to participate in fair and honest elections, they  would win.  </P> <P> There is no empirical evidence that they are right. Rather, there is evidence  to the contrary: The rebels' civilian allies who returned from exile to run in  the March presidential election won a scant 4% of the vote.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Exhausted From War  </P> <P> The rebels acknowledge that the country is exhausted from a war that has taken  tens of thousands of lives. And while they clearly have not abandoned their  vision of a socialist-style revolutionary state, their proposals indicate they  believe the battles for that goal are increasingly political.  </P> <P> "In the past, the (rebels) have made proposals that were obviously meant to be  rejected and they were," said Sigfrido Munes Cruz, El Salvador's ambassador to  Mexico. "This one is different. There is a new, more realistic attitude."  </P> <P> The rebel proposal calls for negotiating a cease-fire by Nov. 15 and a  permanent demobilization of the rebel army by next February. In exchange, they  are demanding a new attorney general, Supreme Court and National Assembly.  </P> <P> The plan would leave the Cristiani government intact, but it calls for reforms  to the constitution and electoral laws and for advancing the 1991 municipal and  legislative elections.  </P> <P> The key to the disarmament is the demand for a restructuring of the armed  forces, including a dramatic reduction in the size of the 56,000-member  military. They want the security forces consolidated into one police force  under civilian control and security guarantees for the return of rebel  combatants to civilian life.  </P> <P> At the three-day meeting, the government agreed to set up a permanent, monthly  dialogue with the guerrillas to begin Oct. 15 in San Jose, Costa Rica.  </P> <P> The government team, led by Justice Minister Oscar Santamaria, refused to  comment on the rebel proposal, saying officials want to evaluate it thoroughly  first. Cristiani also has yet to respond.  </P> <P> But perhaps the most important pronouncement will come from Washington, which  has spent more than $3 billion over the last decade to prevent a guerrilla  victory.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has not officially responded to the proposal, although  the initial reaction has been as negative as that of the Salvadoran military.  "It strikes me as not very impressive," said a senior State Department  official. "They're supposed to be negotiating without preconditions, but when  you boil it down, they want the entire government and constitution to be  scrapped."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Responding to UN Secretary General Dr.  Butrus-Ghali's announcement of his readiness to mediate in the  Mustafa al-Dirani issue, a responsible Hizballah source  emphasized that Butrus-Ghali's move is aimed at imparting  legitimacy to the terrorist Zionist action. The source said the  move also proves that the United Nations is no longer an  authority fit to make decisions on various issues and conflicts  and that it has turned into a podium for the U.S. political  stand.</p>

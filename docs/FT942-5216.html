			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Arts: Danger of linking life and art - Jackie Wullschlager argues against one move for political correctness 'Nous Accusons]' began the letter sent to critics covering the recent Dublin Pinter Festival. The Daughters of Eve, a feminist group which gives its address as the University of Southern California, announced the forthcoming trial of three writers: Harold Pinter, John Osborne and Ted Hughes. Their crimes? 'Fatal damage' to three women - Vivien Merchant, Jill Bennett and Sylvia Plath, all of whom died, two by suicide and one of alcoholism, after broken marriages with the writers. 'Age has withered their talent,' says the letter of Pinter, Osborne and Hughes, 'but the continuity of their spite, damage, self-seeking is so far unbroken.' Although a feminist trial of Harold Pinter is as offensive to most people as the Islamic fatwa against Salman Rushdie, the Daughters of Eve - who see art as an extension of personality - reflect a wider shift towards the politicisation of an artist's life. 'Perfection of the life, or of the work?' Yeats once asked. When he wrote, few readers cared about the facts of the writer's existence. In the past 15 years, however, there has been a surge of literary biographies and an explosion of interest, which is changing the fundamental way we think about the relation between life and art. 'Biography is listening to backstairs comment and reading people's mail,' says Janet Malcolm, whose controversial book The Silent Woman, about the battle between Hughes and the 'cultist' biographers who see Sylvia Plath as a feminist martyr, has just been published in the US. Last year, after Andrew Motion's biography of Philip Larkin, and the publication of Larkin's own letters, revealed racist attitudes - 'too many fucking niggers around' - and sexist tastes - a penchant for schoolgirl bondage - there were calls for his poems to be banned. To trace this movement is to see a cloud of censorship emerging from our most liberal and individualistic traditions. In an individualistic society, it is natural that the writer becomes the celebrity, almost a consumer icon, as well as in some sense our representative - an Everyman whose life tells us about our own. Hence the bestselling status of recent biographies such as Richard Ellmann's Oscar Wilde or Victoria Glendinning's Trollope. And in a culture which flatters itself on its lack of repression it is also inevitable that we assume the writer's private life, like his work, is our public property. In so far as this effects our aesthetic responses, it is usually to enrich them - most literature is grounded in personal experience, and is a better read when we know what that experience was. But recently other cultural trends have come into play - political correctness, the tendency to conformism, to simplify and to be over-literal. Together, these encourage a conflation of an artist's life and work, and the passing of an inappropriate moral judgment on both. There are the modern giants whose books we are constantly trying to explain, but who are above moral criticism, such as Joyce. His books are driven by personal experience. When he wanted to write about infidelity, he covertly urged his wife Nora towards an affair, but she saw through him. 'Jim wants me to go with other men so that he can write about it,' she explained baldly to the suitor he found for her, 'but I want only him.' Brenda Maddox's Nora is a model of a biography which illuminates Joyce's work through a fascinating account of two lives. But at the other end of the spectrum are the more recent authors whose lives happen to embody current political myths. The hijacking of Sylvia Plath, who gassed herself in 1963 leaving bread and milk by her sleeping children, as an early feminist icon, has prevented serious evaluation of her work beyond those terms. Thus Ronald Hayman's 1991 study reads like a detective story ('had there been a suicide note? What had it said? . . . was it true that a doll had been found . . . with pins stuck into it?') in which Plath's poems are used to solve questions about her life. Where Plath is the good girl, Larkin is the bad guy in the new Life stakes. But both are badly served because appreciation of their work risks being subsumed into tokenism. So when Larkin began to be seen - retrospectively - as politically incorrect, a flurry of critics who had previously been respectful suddenly called him a minor poet and there was a new hint of dismissal from the literary establishment. This trend is not limited to the literary world. Something similar happened, to the popular reputation of Woody Allen; many fans vowed never to see another movie after revelations that Allen had betrayed Mia Farrow for her adopted daughter. Here is ideological revisionism in strong new form. It is a fearful and irrational interpretation of the link between life and art. It masks an intolerance of those we don't agree with, the suspicion of what is not the moral fashion of the day. Enjoyment of Larkin's poetry or Allen's films does not depend on the moral purity of their creators. 'Women who assist in realising the fantasies of Pinter/Osborne/Hughes in any medium are in complicity with them and their crime,' say the Daughters of Eve. But fantasies are not separatist sub-committees, and you can't legislate over artistic inspiration, which is an haphazard, sub-conscious amoral affair. Andrew Motion defends Larkin by saying that 'art exists at a crucial distance from its creator'. Art is timeless and universal, and means different things to different people in different ages, whereas an artist's life is conditioned by his time, and by the morality of the moment when we interpret it. It may be true that Osborne has exploited his public image as the angry young man of his plays and that this has made his later writing immature, self-indulgent, vacuous: a casualty of his and our cult of the artist. But William Burroughs is an equally powerful case: a writer whose morality few, in any age, would share. He really did kill his wife - he shot her dead at a party - yet the tragedy then inspired one of his best works, the magical lyrics for the rock musical The Black Rider, about a marksman who shoots his lover. The piece opened in 1990, and, as the most innovative of recent musicals, has been a popular hit across Europe, while some of the poetry - 'I'll shoot the moon out of the sky for you' - seems likely to last beyond its commercial success. Artists rarely lead lives which we would call normal; how ironic, in our tolerant, post-Freudian society, to criticise their work because they fail an emotional health test. Artists have always stood on the edge of society: loners like Larkin or radicals like Pinter or angst-ridden neurotics like Allen. The paradox is that, from this position as outsiders they distil, in art, experiences which we can all share - they touch the loner, the radical, the neurotic in all of us. If we allow the straightjacket of conformity or political correctness to tighten, we risk losing the richness of such vision. It is an absurd and horrific form of censorship.</p>

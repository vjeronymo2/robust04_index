			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Dan-Air hopes name-dropping will reap hard cash: Virgin's possible relationship with ailing airline Marketing is a key word in the talks between Mr Richard Branson, owner of Virgin Atlantic Airways, and Mr David James, company doctor at Davies &amp; Newman Holdings which owns the struggling UK airline, Dan-Air. Just as the Virgin name is being held out as a way of enhancing Dan-Air's customer appeal, Mr Branson's is being used to help promote another refinancing of Davies &amp; Newman. The bottom line is that only a year after Davies &amp; Newman was recapitalised with a Pounds 49.3m share issue, it needs to line up another injection of cash. A press release from the company last weekend made clear that fund raising was necessary to secure the future of Dan-Air. Davies &amp; Newman says co-ordination of marketing and operational activities between Virgin and Dan-Air are an integral part of the fund-raising. But Mr James will have to answer a question about how much cash Mr Branson is prepared to put in. One fund manager said yesterday: 'We want to see hard cash on the table to warrant us going back to beleaguered funds saying we know this is risky but it is still a reasonable bet because x, y or z partner is sitting alongside Dan-Air.' The partner's contribution could come through an equity injection and the taking on of some of Davies &amp; Newman's debts. Virgin has so far said it is mainly interested in supplying its brand name and marketing expertise to match the cash input from institutional investors. In other words, it would pay mostly in kind, rather than cash, for a 51 per cent stake in a new company called Virgin European Airways. For instance, it would supply the Virgin name for no royalty payment. Investors would stump up hard cash for Davies &amp; Newman's 49 per cent. Virgin European Airways would be based on Dan-Air's network of scheduled routes. It would be repackaged to attract more business-class passengers. 'Two extra business-class passengers on each of Dan-Air's flights would add Pounds 20m a year to turnover,' says Mr Branson. Such a boost is sorely needed because projections made by Davies &amp; Newman at the time of the last refinancing have proved too optimistic. The 1992 pre-tax profit projection was for Pounds 20m; a recent broker's forecast was for a Pounds 7m loss. Although the group says its overdraft is less than Pounds 3m, this is the peak post-summer season for cash; funds drain out through the winter. One fund manager said: 'If you are not in a strong cash position at this time of year, the position will be awful in six months' time.' Davies &amp; Newman's bank facility is Pounds 35m, but the company's declared need to refinance suggests this will not be sufficient to see it through the winter. It also has a bank covenant linked to the level of profitability in 1992. Although the facility runs until the end of 1993, a possible breach of this covenant means that the banking agreement needs to be renegotiated. To solve the long-term financing need, some investors had hoped that Davies &amp; Newman would either be bought by another airline - British Airways looked recently but walked away - or find a partner prepared to put in a large amount of money, which does not seem to be what Mr Branson is offering. Some shareholders believe the group's strong position at Gatwick and its handful of Heathrow slots might be attractive to a US or Asian airline seeking access to Europe, to feed passengers into its long-haul flights. Yesterday, investors said they were disappointed at the lack of overseas interest so far, and complained that Davies &amp; Newman had not taken prompter action to raise cash by other means. One suggested that the group could have sold aircraft, renegotiated leases or sold its 50 per cent stake in one of Gatwick's two baggage handlers. The institutions do not like the idea of coughing up further cash so soon after last October's rescue, especially as the share price has fallen well below the 50p rights issue price. In August the price fell to 11p. Yesterday's suspension price was 23p, at which the group's market value is Pounds 26m. Whatever the financial element of Mr Branson's offer, Mr James can argue that the two airlines fit well together: Virgin specialises in long-haul routes and Dan-Air operates in Europe. Some of Dan-Air's problems stem from the fact that it has no in-house tour operator to soak up its charter aircraft capacity. Virgin has its Virgin Holidays tour operator subsidiary. Both have bases at London's Gatwick airport so costs could be cut in reservations, administration, engineering and baggage handling. But the reason that the two companies have little overlap is because Mr Branson's philosophy of how to run a profitable airline has so far avoided short-haul routes. Virgin once flew from London to Dublin and to a then-obscure town in the south of the Netherlands called Maastricht. It stopped those services in 1988 to concentrate on long-haul. The costs of flying short-haul are high: landing fees must be paid more often for each kilometre flown and the extra fuel used in more frequent take-offs and landings adds to overheads. Some of the world's most successful airlines concentrate on long-haul. Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines are among the world's most profitable carriers while the elaborately constructed 'hub and spoke' networks in the US domestic market have not prevented airlines there suffering badly from over-capacity in the recession. If the Virgin deal falls through, there is still hope that another airline would be interested in the feeder opportunities offered by Dan-Air's Gatwick-continental network. Slots at Heathrow are always highly sought after - BA would be particularly concerned to see these six slots go to its rival Virgin. It would strengthen Mr James's bargaining power with Mr Branson if BA renewed its interest. Anything that could help him squeeze more money out of a potential partner would also strengthen his chances of persuading institutional investors to back a new plan - or the rescue of the rescue, as one put it.

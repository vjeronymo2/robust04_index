			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Italy (7): Slide in lira will lead to casualties - Finance for industry WHEN Mr Guiliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, intervened in October to chivvy banks for not cutting their interest rates fast enough after the previous month's currency turmoil, which had seen rates hit near-record levels, it was clear that finance for industry had become a key issue. Since then, a chorus of bankers and businessmen have given their views on whether the financial system is responsive enough to the needs of industry, while the state-dominated banking system has toed the line and eased down borrowing levels. The debate on corporate lending is by no means over, however. In late October, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the governor of the Bank of Italy, took what many economists saw as the significant step of directly requesting the country's banks to limit their future lira lending to domestic customers. Under the Bank of Italy's demand for monthly details of new lending growth, banks were requested to keep credits to within precisely observed percentage limits of base levels set from the January-March period this year. Loans could go up by 3 per cent in November, 8 per cent in December and by either 7 per cent or 8 per cent monthly until March, when presumably the central bank will reassess the situation. The Bank of Italy's decision, which for some economists is an unwelcome echo of the regimented 1970s and 1980s when lending was strictly controlled, was purely a matter of 'moral suasion'. The central bank gave no hint of penalties for banks which exceeded its suggested limits. But in Italy's docile banking market, it is unlikely that bankers will fail to toe the line. As matters stand, corporate borrowers in Italy are faced with an astonishing array of choice when it comes to picking a possible lender. One reason for the multiplicity of sources are the laws introduced after the 1930s depression which divide corporate lending into two main categories. Under the regulations, now fraying at the edges, commercial banks are limited to what the Bank of Italy calls 'short-term' lending - meaning up to 18 months. The banks can also make a limited number of loans for longer periods of up to five years. The precise amount depends on their total shareholders' funds, but the lion's share of corporate credits is of the 'short term' variety. By contrast, medium to long-term lending - defined as being for periods up to 20 years - is the domain of a special group of 11 regional medium- term credit institutions. Such institutions specialise in structural loans for industry to finance major investments such as new plants, as well as mortgages on commercial property. The medium-term banks are owned by commercial banks in the region, along with municipal and regional authorities. The 11 are supplemented by two special institutions, Mediobanca and Istituto Mobiliare Italiano (IMI), which combine medium to long-term loans, usually reserved for Italy's blue-chip customers, with a variety of other financial services including investment banking and corporate finance. But there is less to the division of responsibilities than meets the eye. With agreed overdraft facilities forming the most popular instrument for industrial finance, companies commonly use rolled-over overdrafts, theoretically limited to 12 months, as a much longer-term form of credit. 'It is a distortion of the system, but short-term lending tends to be used even for companies' medium and long-term financing needs,' says one banker. 'With a plethora of banking relation- ships, companies have tended to turn lots of separate overdrafts into one effective long-term loan.' The head of marketing at a leading Italian bank explains: 'We examine a company's overdraft facility once a year. But rolling it over is usually just a formality provided the company's books are healthy.' Such short-term facilities comprise around a third of the loan finance used by Italian companies, according to figures from the Bank of Italy. The remainder is divided almost equally between supplier credits and long-term bank finance. For many Italian companies, the prime source of finance is retained profits rather than loans. Even in recession, the tradition of ploughing back earnings into the business is firmly established. According to figures from the central bank, around 45 per cent of company financing comes from internal sources. The figure testifies to the structure of Italian industry, with its plethora of small and medium- sized family-owned companies, which still take pride in bankrolling their growth through retained profits. By contrast, the limited role of the stock market emerges from the fact that little over 200 companies are quoted. Last year, companies raised around L11,000bn on the bourse - around a fifth of the L50,000bn to L60,000bn provided in new money by the banking system. Although the stock market is of little relevance in financing the corporate sector, shares comprise a surprisingly high proportion of private savings. That reflects the fact that, although few companies are quoted, many are privately owned. Thus shares comprise around 17 per cent of private savings in Italy - but only quarter of that total is composed of the equity of quoted concerns. Even finance from specialist institutions such as merchant banks has been on the wane as a result of the lacklustre performance of the bourse - exacerbated by this year's fall in share prices. Many of the new Italian merchant banks which sprang up in the early 1980s turned to investing in unquoted companies as an exciting new business. They believed that while such companies could have immense product and market know-how, they were often relatively unsophisticated when it came to finance. With the expected rise in cross-border takeovers from the liberalised European market of the 1990s, many bankers believed such companies might require their expertise in more specialised services such as corporate finance and mergers and acquisition. Eventually, the target was to float the companies - generating big profits for bankers and private family shareholders alike. That thinking reached a peak in the boom days of the bourse in 1986, when Italian finance appeared to be undergoing a sea change with traditional lending making way for risk capital and eventual flotation. But after the downturn on the stock market and the onset of tougher trading conditions for many smaller companies, many merchant bankers have found themselves lumbered with minority stakes which they cannot now sell. 'They've ended up having to marry their clients for ever,' says one economist. Foreign currency loans, which currently account for around 1 per cent of Italian companies' overall financing, has also turned out to be a mixed blessing after the lira's recent slide. The attractions of borrowing in low interest rate currencies such as the D-Mark or dollar - the two most common - were obvious at a time of a firm lira based on the Bank of Italy's policy of maintaining a strong currency through high interest rates. Against the D-Mark in particular, the risk of adverse exchange rate movements seemed virtually excluded thanks to the lira's presence in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, through which relatively high Italian interest rates sucked in large amounts of foreign capital. The devaluation of the lira has harshly spotlighted the fallacy of that reasoning. Though relatively few Italian companies have borrowed abroad  - and many have hedged their exposures - the slide in the lira will inevitably cause some casualties in the sector when companies find their interest payments have become astronomically higher in lira terms than before.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Farida Gaynullina, chairman of the Tatar </F> Republic Trade Union Council, by M. Ibragimov; place and date  not given: "Who Needs Trade Unions? The Opinion of Chairman of  the Tatar Republic Trade Union Council Farida Gaynullina"]    [Text] [Ibragimov] The fourth agreement between the Trade  Union Council of the republic, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the  Association of State Enterprises of the republic was signed  recently. Is the current agreement fundamentally different from  previous ones?    [Gaynullina] The range of coverage of problems reflected in  agreements keeps growing and getting more specific year by year.  For example, this year the consumer budget became 1,200 rubles  [R] weightier: We succeeded in incorporating the services of  baths and laundry facilities in it. A notion such as the price  of unskilled labor appeared in the law on the minimum wage; this  makes it possible to set the rate of Category I above the  minimum wage. It is envisioned to ensure social protection for  young people, women, and working people in certain sectors (the  agro-industrial complex, the military-industrial complex, the  sphere financed from the budget), and to reinforce and develop a  system for amelioration of the law which would bring together  various regulatory provisions touching on the rights of the  people.    The second reason is found in the area of politics: There  have been attempts to belittle our role in society. The  situation is exacerbated by the fact that in the process of  privatization, some employers try to reduce our rights in the  collectives to zero. All this prompts us to look for a legal  avenue of protection.    [Ibragimov] Perhaps the law did not have only supporters?    [Gaynullina] No intense opponents came along. However, we  had  to fight for certain articles. For example, one article was not  received well; there was a lack of understanding on the part of  some deputies, associated with registration. Various norms are  codified with regard to public organizations. According to some  proposals, registration is not envisioned, whereas according to  others it is mandatory. Registration of trade unions is  forbidden according to international norms and legislation in  effect.    There are various versions. We propose to submit copies of  the charter documentation as a notice.    [Ibragimov] Does the new draft law include the right to form  independent trade unions?    [Gaynullina] I think this is behind us. To be sure, there is  the Yedineniye in Chelny which has about 1,500 members in its  ranks. However, such a right is included; various principles of  trade union formation are envisioned.    [Ibragimov] As you see it, what are the drawbacks of the new  law?    [Gaynullina] I do not at all think that the law is perfect.  At present, it is being revised by a Supreme Soviet commission  for acceptance in the second reading. This will be the law of  the transition period, and it reflects today's realities.    [Ibragimov] Despite all the difficulties, the number of  nonstate enterprises is increasing. It is common knowledge that  they do not have trade unions.    [Gaynullina] Moreover, giving up trade union membership is,  unfortunately, one of the conditions for hiring at some  commercial enterprises. People are deprived of the right to  protect their interests before the employer. We have already  encountered such complaints in conjunction with illegal  dismissals. We had to interfere for purely humane  considerations. Women end up being deprived of their rights more  often. There have been cases of work-related accidents, even  fatalities. A certain amount of arbitrariness is felt. This  issue was considered specifically at a recent plenum of the  republic council devoted to occupational safety.    Taking advantage of this occasion, I call on the employees  of  commercial enterprises to unite--it is easier to protect your  rights in this way.    [Ibragimov] Many people are criticizing the policy of  privatization pursued in the city and the republic. Thus,  recently the sociopolitical movement "Economic  Breakthrough--Third Force" (for now, the only one to do so)  expressed its opposition to the privatization program by way of  putting leaflets on the stairways of houses. What is the  position of trade unions on this issue? As I see it, this is  something that merits consideration.    [Gaynullina] Unfortunately it is impossible to think up an  ideal version. Procedures for the privatization of housing  contain elements of social injustice. Some have managed to  obtain free housing while others have not. At present, the  social norm comes to 16.2 square meters of housing per capita.  It would be fairer if an additional fee to benefit those who do  not have housing were collected when floor space above the  established norm is privatized.    Procedures for the privatization of enterprises on the first  model also cause some concern; to my mind, they encroach upon  the economic interests of labor collectives. However, we should  also be mindful of employees in the sector financed from the  budget.    [Ibragimov] There has been talk in the corridors of power  about providing compensation payments for employees of  enterprises who are forced to work short work days or weeks.    [Gaynullina] The draft decree is ready. We have familiarized  ourselves with it and made our proposals. A source of funding  has also been found: For the most part, compensation to those  putting in short work weeks will be paid out of the employment  fund, and partially from the republic budget.    We think that the decree will be signed shortly.</p>

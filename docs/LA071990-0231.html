			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 6.4% EARNINGS DROP IN SECOND QUARTER REPORTED BY AT&amp;T  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. today reported its second-quarter  earnings fell 6.4% due to lower equipment sales and unexpectedly high start-up  costs for the company's new credit card.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T said it earned $657 million, or 60 cents a share, in the quarter ended  June 30, down from $699 million, or 65 cents a share, in the same quarter of  1989.  </P> <P> Revenue also fell, to $9.03 billion from $9.26 billion in the same quarter of  last year.  </P> <P> The company said the disappointing results were due mostly to slower sales of  corporate telephone systems, data communications gear and equipment sold to the  federal government, as well as unexpectedly high costs for processing  applications for its Universal card, which combines a MasterCard or Visa with  telephone charging privileges.  </P></p>

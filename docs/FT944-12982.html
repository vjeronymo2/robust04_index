			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Deutsche bank It has taken Deutsche Bank five years to decide to integrate its investment banking activities with those of its Morgan Grenfell subsidiary. Even so, yesterday's belated decision to do so gives Germany's largest bank a sporting chance of joining the investment banking big league with the likes of Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch. Its decision to locate the headquarters of the operation in London also strengthens the City's position as Europe's pre-eminent financial centre. Other Continental banks, seeking to develop their corporate finance and international equity businesses, may feel under pressure to follow suit. The decision is undoubtedly a blow to Frankfurt. Efforts to bolster Finanzplatz Deutschland - Germany as a financial centre - have not succeeded. Germany may be Europe's leading industrial power, but its financial system remains relatively underdeveloped while its equity markets are over-regulated and illiquid. Deutsche Bank will not find it easy to achieve its ambitions. While Morgan Grenfell still has a strong presence in corporate finance, neither it nor its parent is known for equity research and trading. There is also a big question over whether Deutsche can successfully merge its solid but slightly stodgy culture with Morgan's more entrepreneurial spirit. One reading of the decision to locate the investment banking headquarters in London is that Morgan's culture will come up on top. But, given that Deutsche has yet to agree a name for the business, it would be a mistake to bet on it.</p>

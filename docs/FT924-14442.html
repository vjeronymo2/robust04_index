			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Wellworth sale could bring Isosceles Pounds 100m Isosceles, the heavily-indebted owner of the Gateway food retail business, expects to complete the sale of its Wellworth subsidiary in Northern Ireland shortly. The group will be able to keep Pounds 30m of the proceeds of the sale to help fund capital expenditure. Gateway's capital expenditure budget is limited to Pounds 100m a year by Isosceles' financial position. The rest of the cash raised by selling Wellworth, which could be close to Pounds 100m, will go to reducing the group's debt. At the end of its last financial year debt stood at Pounds 1.26bn. Yesterday, Isosceles' shareholders formally approved a refinancing which involved interest deferral and new facilities. Isosceles also announced that it had agreed to sell 12 shops to Iceland Frozen Foods for Pounds 2.7m. Iceland said it would re-open the shops under its name in the first quarter of 1993.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Auctions of gilts to take place every month - Government Funding This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. AUCTIONS OF gilts will take place roughly once a month, instead of once every two months, the Bank of England said yesterday. In a statement, the Bank set out the framework within which it intends to conduct sales of gilt-edged stock in the year ahead, 'in accordance with the chancellor's announced intention to continue to pursue the full fund policy but to allow sales of debt to banks and building societies to count as funding in the same way as sales of debt to other sectors.' Purchases of gilts by banks and building societies in 1992-93 - estimated at more than Pounds 5bn to the end of February - will be taken into account in implementing funding policy over the next two to three years, the Bank said. 'In 1993-94 National Savings' instruments are once again expected to make an important contribution to funding. This contribution will result in an equivalent reduction in the gilt funding requirement. 'In its operations in the gilt-edged market, the Bank will continue to use the diverse range of selling techniques and funding instruments which have been deployed successfully in the current financial year.' Thus the Bank will continue the mixed approach to gilt-edged funding combining a programme of auctions with official sales of stock 'on tap' in the secondary market. The Bank intends that gilt-edged auctions should continue to provide the backbone of funding. For the last two financial years, auctions have been held at roughly bi-monthly intervals. In 1993-94, it is proposed to increase their frequency and to pursue a pattern of auctions at broadly monthly intervals, though as hitherto flexibility will be retained to vary the timing of auctions where appropriate in the light of events. 'The size of individual auctions is likely to be in the range of Pounds 2bn-Pounds 4bn. The programme of auctions overall is expected to account for a higher proportion of the total gilt funding requirement than in the present year. 'The auctions will be conducted on the same basis as those for the last two years: the stock will be auctioned on a bid-price basis, open to all comers without commission, with provision for non-competitive bids of up to Pounds 500,000. The stocks offered, which will extend over the full maturity range, may be new stocks or additional tranches of existing stocks and may be in either fully or partly-paid form. 'However, the Bank proposes to make two minor changes to the timetable for auctions. First, market participants have suggested that the announcement timetable for auctions can be shortened. Accordingly the Bank proposes that the notice period for the date of each auction should be reduced to not less than 10days (from the present fourteen days), with full details continuing to be given not less than seven days ahead of the auction. 'Second, market participants have questioned the need for a 'fallow period' after an auction as long as 28 days, during which the Bank at present undertakes not to sell in its 'tap' operations stock of a similar maturity or type to that offered at the auction. Accordingly, the Bank proposes to cease to specify a precise length of 'fallow period', but will nevertheless continue to refrain from issuing stock of a similar type or maturity to the auction stock for a reasonable period after the auction, and will only do so if there is evident market demand for further such stock. The Bank intends to discuss both these changes shortly with the gilt-edged market makers. The programme of auctions will continue to be supplemented by sales of stock by the Bank 'on tap' on the secondary market through its day-to-day operations with the gilt-edged market makers. Tap sales may take the form of sales of existing stock from official holdings or of packages of tranchettes (or a single, larger tranche) of newly-created stock. 'The Bank also has available the option of offering stock by minimum price tender, underwritten by the authorities at a minimum tender price, though use of this technique is likely to be infrequent given the continuing programme of auctions.' Among measures to boost the National Savings contribution are reintroduction of the First Option Bond and higher holding limits for most of the other National Savings products, the Department of National Savings said. Applications for purchase of First Option Bonds will be accepted from Monday 22 March. Prospectuses and application forms will be available at post offices from 29 March. The guaranteed rate for the first 12 months the bonds are held will be 6.34% gross, equivalent to 4.75% net. A bond to the value of Pounds 20,000 or more will earn a guaranteed bonus of 0.4% gross (0.3% net) over the first 12 months. The holding limit remains unchanged at Pounds 250,000. Holding limits are to increase - for savings certificates: 40th Issue - from Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 10,000; 6th index-linked issue - from Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 10,000. Reinvestment Certificates of each Issue - from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 20,000; Income Bonds: from Pounds 50,000 (Pounds 100,000 for joint holdings) to Pounds 250,000 (sole or joint holdings). Capital bonds: from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 250,000 aggregate for all series after series A All with effect from March 18. For premium bonds, the rise is from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 20,000. with effect from 13 April, and for the Investment Account from Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 100,000 from 10 May.</p>

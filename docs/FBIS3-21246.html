			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant occupies a site in the  world's most fertile fishing grounds, namely, Miyagi  Prefecture's Onagawa-machi and Ojika-machi located in the  eastern central part of the Minami Sanriku and Ojika Peninsulas.  Geographically, it is positioned in the center of Tohoku Region  facing the Pacific. It has been 10 years since Onagawa nuclear  plant's Reactor No. 1 (520,000kW) began its operations. Reactor  No. 2 (825,000kW) currently under construction is in its final  stage, with its operations expected to begin July 1995. It will  be followed by Reactor No. 3 (825,000kW) whose construction is  scheduled to commence in November 1996. Thus the expansion of  the plant facility will be carried out rapidly in succession. By  the year 2002, when Reactor No.3 begins its operations, the  total output of the plant will reach 2.174 million kW. The plant  by then will be poised to play a central role in satisfying  energy demand of the 21st century for Tohoku Electric Power.    Tohoku Electric Power's first ``nuclear light,'' Onagawa  Nuclear Reactor No. 1 (Boiling-Light-Water-type Reactor=BWR) at  present is supplying approximately 30% of electricity  used in  Miyagi Prefecture. Reactor No.2, whose construction began in  August 1988, also is a BWR. It is almost 85% completed. A  building, which houses the main unit of the No.2 reactor, has 3  floors both above the ground and in the basement situated in the  center of the building. It also has a nuclear reactor wing  measuring approximately 66 meters by 55 meters in area;  surrounding the wing is a two-story reinforced concrete annex  building with a 3-story basement. The No.2 reactor power plant  consists of three buildings, with the nuclear reactor building  in the center, flanked by turbine and control buildings.    In addition to the main nuclear reactor unit consisting of  fuel and internal reactor structural elements and a nuclear  reactor pressure vessel, the main system has a nuclear reactor  cooling system centering around a recirculation-main steam  system and a reactor core cooling system for emergency use. A  turbine power generating facility is equipped with condensation  and water-feeding systems, including a water circulation system  designed to circulate main condenser's cooling water.    Reactor No.2 has new features which are not offered in  Reactor No. 1. For instance, in comparison with a flask-type  containment vessel, the ``[marku] type,'' used in Reactor No. 1,  the ``improved [marku] type'' allows sufficient space for  carrying out work. This is designed to improve operational  efficiency in conducting routine inspections inside the  containment vessel.    The condensate filter has been changed from the  pressure-precoat type to the hollow-fiber-membrane type. When  finished with the rotation of a turbine, steam will be cooled  inside the main condenser and become condensate. The condensate  filter, designed to remove the rust and other iron content  cleanly and to prevent nuclear reactor cooling water from  becoming radioactive. The pressure precoating method uses resin  as an auxiliary filtering agent. The hollow fiber membrane  method employed in Reactor No.2, on the other hand, does not use  resin. This means that the hollow fiber membrane can be burned,  thus drastically reducing the amount of radioactive wastes  generated. Moreover, in order to improve thermal efficiency of  the turbine, a ``free moisture separation heating method'' has  been employed in Reactor No. 2. This method is designed to  eliminate steam moisture with a moisture separator, while the  moisture to be sent to a low-pressure turbine using a part of  high-temperature steam, is being heated. This is just one  example of the new technologies incorporated into Reactor No. 2.    In July 1995, when Reactor No. 2 begins commercial  operations, approximately 75% of electric power used in  Miyagi  Prefecture will have been supplied by Reactors Nos. 1 and 2.    As for the additional installation of Reactor No. 3 (BWR),  Tohoku Electric Power added this item to its 1993 facility plans  and submitted an ``environmental impact survey document'' to  MITI on 18 August. Having gone through informational meetings  and a walk-through of the site, the company plans to hold the  first official hearing on the first phase of the construction  and to incorporate the basic power development plans of the  second phase before the end of 1993. The company hopes to have  the proposal put on the agenda of Electric Power Development  Coordination Council, the prime minister's advisory organ, by  the spring of 1994.    In terms of the composition of the electric power source  (volume of power generation), Tohoku Electric Power's 1992  record shows that the ratio of nuclear power was no more than  20%. In 1997, when No.2 reactor will be in full  operation, the  ratio will be increased to 24%, and by the year 2002,  when No.  3 reactor will be used in commercial operations, the ratio will  rise to 26%. This means that nuclear power can be  regarded as  the base electric source. By enlarging the role played by the  nuclear power, the company will be ``opening up electric  sources.''  <H5>  Spend Time on Study Meeting </H5>   As indicated by what thus far transpired at Onagawa nuclear  construction site, Tohoku Electric Power spent 12 years from the  time when the town had decided to invite the company to the  region, to the beginning of the construction. However, once the  construction had begun, it took both Onagawa and Ojika Town  Assemblies only 2 years and 9 months to vote in favor of  accelerating further buildup of nuclear power facilities. In the  case of Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant, there was a clear  difference in the willingness of the local community to accept  the project during the first half(when construction of Reactor  No. 1 was pursued) and the second half(when development of  Reactors Nos. 2 and 3 are being pushed).    Onagawa-machi even today is a ``fishing village,'' which, in  terms of quantities of fish unloaded here, ranks fifth in Japan.  Before the construction of Reactor No. 1 was undertaken,  fishermen put up strong resistance to the nuclear power project.  ``This was what delayed starting of plant construction by more  than 10 years.'' (Zenjiro Suda, town manager of Onagawa-machi).  However, a great deal of time spent to keep dialogue going  between the company and fishermen, as well as study sessions,  served to dispel residents' fear of nuclear power, enabling them  to grasp the fact that nuclear energy can serve as a foundation  for the development of fisheries and other regional industry.  Once they understood this, the nuclear power project progressed  rapidly.    There is no question about the benefit brought to Onagawa by  the nuclear power plant--it is considerable. The amount of  subsidy received by the town under the provision of the three  power-development-related laws, beginning with Reactor No. 1 and  ending with trial calculations made in connection with Reactor  No. 3 is approximately &yen;20.2 billion. The municipal property  tax (city, town, and village taxes; a trial balance at  Onagawa-machi) is approximately 88 billion, and the nuclear fuel  tax for Reactor No. 1 recorded up to now is approximately  &yen;3.8 billion. Moreover, according to the record of purchase  orders sent to local and surrounding areas in connection with  Reactor No. 1 is approximately &yen;43.2 billion and for Reactor  No. 2, it reaches approximately &yen;32.1 billion.    In order to give the benefit generated by the construction  site back to the local community in an equitable manner,  Onagawa-machi organized and operates ``Onagawa Commerce and  Industrial Enterprise Cooperative (230 members).'' In ordering  goods, including daily necessities, the company opted to use the  cooperative as a window. This method is but one example through  which effective cooperation is achieved between the region and  the company in pursuing nuclear power development.  <H3>  Two Projects Planned Following Onagawa and Higashidori  Projects </H3>   As has been described, Onagawa nuclear power development is  accelerating its pace of expansion. However, in addition to  Onagawa and Higashidori, Tohoku Electric Power has plans for two  more nuclear power development sites still pending.    Of these, the site located at Namie-Kodaka (Fukushima  Prefecture) was voted in by the town assembly. This took place  26 years ago; since then, however, no significant progress has  been made. As for the other development at Maki (Niigata  Prefecture). although the problem of compensation to the area's  fishing industry has been resolved completely and the proposal  was approved by the Electric Power Development Coordination  Council in November 1982, there still remains the problem of  private land to be resolved. However, recently, Maki Town  Assembly adopted a ``statement of an opinion on having  development project started as soon as possible,'' indicating  that the town is ready to make a new move. In order to begin  operations (825,000kW) by the year 2002, the company is  developing a policy formulated to create close contact with the  region. This project will become an electric power supply point  following the Onagawa nuclear power plant.  <H5>  Interview with Mr. Zensaburo Suda, Mayor of Onagawa-machi </H5>   NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: It was September of 1967  when both Onagawa and Ojika Town Assemblies made resolutions to  bring Tohoku Electric Power into your region to build nuclear  power plants, wasn't it?    Suda: Although Southern Sanriku was Japan's  foremost fishing ground, since the mid-60s, the region's fishing  industry has been declining. It was back then that my  predecessor began to use the word, a setting sun, to describe  the state of our fishing industry. Certainly, there were a  number of things which appeared to indicate that indeed we were  heading in that direction. We began to hear about the  prohibition of whaling; also Nippon Suisan had pulled out its  entire operation from this region.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Then in December of 1979  that full-scale construction of Reactor No.1 began.    Suda: Beginning in 1975, the 200-mile limit was  imposed on fishermen, which pushed the fishing industry to the  brink of collapse. This factor was directly responsible for our  decision to pursue the plan for nuclear power development. For  local residents, construction at Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant  site ultimately meant the revitalization of the region. How  Japan is going to secure energy is an extremely important  question. Who are going to be responsible for securing it and  how will this be accomplished? We believe that Tohoku as a  region is obligated to do its part. It must take on this  responsibility. Would it be possible for us to provide a site  for power development, and, at the same time, link this to our  regional development plans? All of us gave this matter a serious  consideration.    However, initially, some residents were reluctant. Since our  town is a center of the fishing zone, fishermen put up a strong  resistance. The voices of pros and cons whirled around us, each  side fighting hard for its cause. It was a good thing we spent a  great deal of time talking the matter over, until finally every  one had a clear understanding of what the nuclear power  development had to offer to the community. We used the means of  persuasion and explanation. Because of what both sides learned  in the process, we have chosen the course of action which is  working well for the community today.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Recently, a theme of  ``establishing symbiotic relationship with the region'' is  emphasized by those constructing plants.    Suda: Looking back, we feel that from the very  beginning, our approach was symbiotic. Our role as an energy  supply base was compatible with local industry and fisheries.  This indeed must be an equal symbiotic relationship. No problem  exists between the company and our community. The company and  their affiliates are making every effort to be a part of the  region by participating town's social work and social circles  and they are succeeding. When necessary, I do not hesitate to  speak up, and the other side does the same. This is what  symbiosis is all about.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: What about Three Laws  concerning the development of power source?    Suda: I feel that it would be better if some  restrictions are imposed on them. The present national Three-Law  system is too narrow. Although I have no intention of making a  request outside the legal framework, since industrial structure  and geographical conditions differ from region to region, the  Three Laws must be able to accommodate these differences.  Otherwise, it will be meaningless. It is nice that the Three  Laws pay for costs of construction, but the constructed building  must be maintained, and it costs money to do this. We will be  very grateful if Three Laws takes into consideration operational  and maintenance expenditures as well.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: It will be the 21st century  (2002) when Reactor No. 3 becomes operative. What kind of  buildup plans does do you have for the town?    Suda: Our town has only sea and mountains.  Although the local fishing industry has recovered from slump  through the conversion to ``producing industry,'' it is  dangerous to solely rely on fisheries. On the other hand, even  if we want to invite businesses to this region, we don't have  any land to build on. So we are considering the type of work in  the information-oriented field. Using the energy supply base as  a foundation, we want to combine our coastal fishing industry  with tourism. Also under consideration is the use of the town as  an information dispatch base. The communication industry will  appeal to young people, and so we can make them settle down in  this town.    With respect to the information industry, 11 companies,  consisting of those in the surrounding cities and towns and  power-source-related companies, joined forces and established a  third-sector information service firm, ``Otech.'' We want to  show the world that in spite of the disadvantageous conditions  in which the town finds itself, we can still be innovative,  creating something new and worthwhile.    NIKKAN SANGYO KOGYO: Looks like this will  accelerate your efforts to create ``a new town,'' doesn't it?    Suda: Our decision to offer our town for  development of nuclear power has substantially increased the  town's source of revenues. Other improvements are less tangible  but they are there. The most significant improvement is the way  in which residents now approach problems. Young people have  begun to devote their efforts to build an attractive town. This  indeed is the best thing that has happened to the town since the  nuclear power development project began. Viewed from a total  perspective, this is what symbiotic relationship between the  town and the outside business firm has produced.</p>

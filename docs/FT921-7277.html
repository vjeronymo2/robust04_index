			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Strasbourg places ban on vehicles STRASBOURG, the seat of the European parliament, today becomes the first big French city to ban vehicles from its central business district, AP reports. City officials hope this will reduce congestion and pollution, but the local merchants' association is displeased, predicting a 10 per cent drop in sales. Motorists without special permits will be required to park their cars on the perimeter of the central area. Free shuttle-bus service will be provided into the city centre.</p>

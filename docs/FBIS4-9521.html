			<p>BFN     [Text] Podgorica, 27 Apr (TANJUG) -- The Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia [FRY], created two years ago, is no new state; its  creation merely confirmed the will of the Serbian and  Montenegrin people to set up their own state in a new way, FRY  President Zoran Lilic stated today in an interview to Radio  Montenegro. He said the current Yugoslavia "emerged under  domestic and international conditions of general chaos." The  creation of the FRY was a rational response by the Montenegrin  and Serbian people to this chaos, Lilic stressed on the occasion  of two-year anniversary of formation of the common state of  Serbia and Montenegro. According to him, the founding,  preservation, and strengthening of the FRY are values of such  importance that their full meaning will only be able to be  assessed in retrospect. Lilic also said that it is very  important to preserve continuity in relation to the former  Yugoslavia "both because of specific international rights, which  will have to be recognized, and for the sake of the interests of  parts of the nation outside the FRY."    Most political parties, according to Lilic, have understood  that they cannot disregard the will of the people when it comes  to the reasons for the founding and preservation of the FRY, and  its prospects. The FRY president stated that "sporadic  disagreements" between the two federal units are only a  consequence of the difficult economic blockade and other  unfavorable circumstances. According to him, "the Montenegrin  people have stoically suffered many trials and tribulations"  over the past two years. Lilic said the harsh blockade had  interrupted many positive processes in the FRY. However, even  in these conditions many changes for the better have been  achieved. "During two years of condensed history the hardened  forces have maintained themselves and will be ready for the time  when the sanctions are lifted," Lilic stressed, expressing the  hope that this would happen soon.    The FRY president on this occasion also repeated his view  that a peaceful resolution of all the conflicts on the territory  of the former Yugoslavia remains the only constructive option  and firm orientation.</p>

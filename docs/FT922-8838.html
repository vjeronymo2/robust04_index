			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Leisure centre will open on a sober note BRITAIN'S first tourist attraction where customers will have to pass a breathalyser test before they can join in some of the fun opens in Liverpool tomorrow. After eight years of controversy, the site of the 1984 Liverpool International Garden Festival will reopen in a third attempt to bring it back into permanent use. A central feature will be an indoor, high-tech, army-style assault course of slides, rope bridges and obstacles which only the sober will be allowed to use. There will be no machines or power-driven rides, as in a conventional theme park. Gravity and muscle, combined with hair-raising 60ft drops down helical tubes a metre in diameter will provide the thrills. The organisers promise safety and heavily cushioned landings, but the first-aid room will nevertheless be staffed with qualified nurses. The facilities will also be available for private hire by companies for executive team-building or for entertaining customers. Mirror mazes and laser guns for corporate shoot-outs will come with the package. The site's operator is Tomorrow's Leisure, the Newcastle-based company quoted on the unlisted securities market. It is run by Mr John Sanderson, who founded and still owns two thirds of Norstead, a Tyneside engineering group employing 800 people. The Liverpool venture has created 240 permanent jobs. Tomorrow's Leisure has taken a 125-year lease on the core 88 acres of the festival site and invested Pounds 8m in turning the two-acre, futuristic Festival Hall into a games complex including a 20-lane bowling alley, a roller-skating rink, restaurants and bars. Merseyside Development Corporation has provided Pounds 2.5m and the Department of Trade and Industry Pounds 1m. Mr Sanderson says that concentrating activities indoors in the Festival Hall will make it independent of weather and enable the centre to open every day of the year except Christmas Day.</p>

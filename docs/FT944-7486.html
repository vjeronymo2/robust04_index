			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Shares slip just 3p as Asprey falls to Pounds 3.01m Shares in Asprey slipped a mere 3p to 141p yesterday - their smallest fall for some time in response to company announcements, press reports or market rumours. This time the Queen's jeweller was revealing a sharp pre-tax profits tumble from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 3.01m in the six months to September 30. Group turnover declined to Pounds 82m (Pounds 87.4m). The downturn was foreshadowed in September when the company said the absence of a few high-spending customers would depress profits. That day shares fell 110p to 200p. However, Mr Naim Attallah, chief executive, said that although the six months had been disappointing, with a lack of big-ticket sales in New York, Switzerland and Paris, the weeks since the warning had shown a small improvement. Mr Arnaud Bumberger, managing director of Cartier in the UK, part of the Vendome luxury products group, agreed that customers for the most expensive products were a 'very small and confidential world' and, as such, volatile. However, he stressed that his company was not suffering similar problems to Asprey, 'though nobody knows what will happen next year'. Vendome's interims are due out on December 2. Asprey's share price has declined further since September, as the group has been buffeted by City rumours, which it has been swift to deny, and a leaked and altered memorandum from its bankers, the Bank of Scotland, about its financial position. Mr Attallah said yesterday that he wanted to have a 'good relationship with the City', but that if the shares continued to decline, 'we will buy the shares back'. The Asprey family speaks for some 52 per cent of the stock, lifted yesterday by 170,000 shares bought by Mr John Asprey, chairman, at 143p. The expansion downmarket of the customer base was now over, Mr Attallah added. Stock rose from an 'ideal' Pounds 135m at the year-end to Pounds 147m (Pounds 127m), but should decline if recent trading improvements continue. Its most expensive item, a Burma ruby and diamond suite of jewellery, retails at more than Pounds 4m. Debt at September 30 was Pounds 35.6m, giving gearing up from 14.5 to 22.6 per cent. Mr Attallah said he was 'happy' with that but would not want to see it rise further. Interest payable was flat at Pounds 1.07m. Interest receivable and rents dropped to Pounds 392,000 (Pounds 1.08m). Earnings fell to 0.14p (8.04p) per share with the interim dividend held at 1.25p.</p>

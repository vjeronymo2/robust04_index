			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S., ISRAEL: IS THE PARTY ABOUT OVER?  </P> <P> Three years ago I asked a colleague who worked in network television why the  American media was so fascinated with Israel. Even then, the Israeli Cabinet  was on the brink of collapse. Television news, along with major and minor  newspapers, were saturated with stories and commentary about the unfolding  events. "Israel is always a good story for us," my friend explained, "because  you are a democracy, our strategic ally, sharing our values and have a dynamic  political system."  </P> <P> Today, another Israeli Cabinet has disintegrated and Prime Minister Yitzhak  Shamir has lost a vote of confidence in Israel's Parliament, plunging the  country into a search for a new government. The crisis, set off by a Bush  Administration plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, marks a historic  watershed: Will Israel embark on the road to peace or will the countdown for a  new war begin?  </P> <P> Unlike the past, these events are not dominating U.S. air waves or receiving  much more than perfunctory coverage in America's newspapers. This shift  reflects a waning American interest in Israel, in particular, and in the Middle  East, in general. The Tyndall Report, which monitors the amount of time network  news devotes to stories, ranked the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 10th in 1989.  The previous year it was in the top five.  </P> <P> Even militarily significant defections fail to attract much media attention in  the United States. Five months ago, the three major networks each devoted  roughly 15 seconds of their nightly newscasts to the defection of a Syrian air  force pilot and his MIG-23 fighter to Israel. When an Iraqi pilot landed his  MIG-21 in Israel in August, 1966, the American media's appetite seemed  insatiable. This shift in treatment cannot be explained by differences in the  military-intelligence value of the defections, since there were none.  </P> <P> Although signs of Americans' fading interest in Israeli affairs could be  detected in the early 1970s, the turning point came in December, 1987, when the  Palestinian uprising began. Israel was unrelentingly depicted in the U.S. media  as an uninspired, oppressive force with a government that adamantly refused to  talk peace with the Palestinians. Many Americans were shocked by the Israeli  security forces' treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  Israeli disregard for Palestinian human rights undermines the values that are  the moral basis of Americans' attraction to Israel, the only democracy in the  Middle East.  </P> <P> Talking to American friends and officials of the Reagan Administration in late  1988, I detected a deep sense of disappointment in Israel's unwillingness to  reciprocate for the newly moderate declarations of the Palestine Liberation  Organization. I also sensed a growing American fatigue with the indecisiveness  of Israeli domestic politics. Those impressions linger to this day.  </P> <P> The sensational events unfolding in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, South  Africa and Nicaragua rightly captivate the world's and America's attention. But  sudden reconciliations in some countries also reinforce the frustration many  Americans feel toward Israeli reactions to various Middle East peace proposals.  Israel is seen by the U.S. media and increasingly by its most loyal American  friend -- Congress -- as sinking deeper and deeper into its own political heart  of darkness, most of its leaders as unmovable objects.  </P> <P> Even the attitude of American Jewry, always a constant source of sympathy and  staunch support for Israel, has undergone a major change. A recent public  survey of Jewish leaders in the United States not only showed a sharp decrease  in support but also a readiness (80%) to criticize Israel in public.  </P> <P> Yet most Israelis are unaware of these shifting attitudes. They think and  behave as if Ronald Reagan were still in the White House. The former President  went farther than any predecessor to make Israelis feel secure. His  Administration never fully protested Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982.  Although his State Department railed against the construction of Jewish  settlements in the occupied territories, it took no diplomatic action. The  White House enthusiastically blessed a joint American-Israeli memorandum on  strategic cooperation. And in the 1980s, Israel received close to $40 billion  in economic and military aid from the United States. That kind of generosity  and kid-glove treatment understandably leads Israelis to believe they can do no  wrong in American eyes.  </P> <P> Abundant writing is on the wall, however. President Bush and his secretary of  state, James A. Baker III, lack their predecessors' emotional and ideological  commitment to Israel, the heart of the alliance. Their language and deeds  depart from past practice.  </P> <P> Over Israeli protests, the Bush Administration is continuing a dialogue with  the  </P> <P> PLO. In a recent visit to Los Angeles, the President said that no new Jewish  settlements should be built in the West Bank or in East Jerusalem. His  inclusion of East Jerusalem was unprecedented, raising serious doubts about  Israel's claims to sovereignty there. Earlier, Baker suggested that building  new Jewish settlements or expanding old ones in the occupied territories must  stop before the United States would consider guaranteeing an additional $400  million in loans to pay for housing newly arrived Soviet Jews.  </P> <P> In Congress, the movement away from Israel is no less discernible. The proposal  by Minority Leader Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) -- to cut foreign aid for five  countries, including Israel, by 5% -- is a case in point. I have little doubt  that Dole's suggestion was coordinated with Baker and Bush. The senator's words  were carefully chosen to remind Israel to get more serious about peace  negotiations with the Palestinians. Additionally, they were an indication of  Administration impatience with Israeli leaders.  </P> <P> If my fellow Israelis do not soon recognize the gravity of this situation --  that unquestioning American support can no longer be assumed -- they will wake  up one day in horror to discover what I have already detected: The party may be  over for Israel in the United States.  </P></p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Curtain finally comes down on Greek drama - Kerin Hope finds the state celebrating the sale of Heracles, its biggest cement group When the new owners of Heracles Cement arrive at the company's offices this week, Greece's privatisation team will feel its most arduous task has been accomplished. Heracles, Europe's largest cement exporter, was sold last month to Calcestruzzi, the construction arm of Italy's Ferruzzi group, in a joint venture with the state-owned National Bank of Greece. Calcestruzzi is now responsible for Heracles' day-to-day management. 'Heracles survived surprisingly well under state control, retaining its corporate culture. But at this point, some strategic decisions must be taken,' says Mr Stelios Stavridis, the outgoing chairman. Heracles was the key component of a privatisation programme launched two years ago by the Industrial Reconstruction Organisation (IRO), the state holding group for about 40 companies nationalised in the early 1980s. With a local market share of 44 per cent and exports of 3.5m tonnes a year, it is easily the biggest of Greece's four cement producers. Its two plants in central Greece are close to company-owned quarries and deep-water loading facilities, which means reduced export overheads in comparison with European rivals. As well as operating its own fleet of bulk carriers, Heracles controls a dozen diversified subsidiaries, encompassing packaging, computer software and insurance. Group net profits for 1991 totalled Dr6.39bn (Dollars 33m) on turnover of Dr56bn. The privatisation team at IRO faced a serious problem in disposing of its 69.8 per cent shareholding in Heracles. This stemmed from a legal dispute over the way the company was nationalised, with some Dr27bn in debt compulsorily capitalised in violation of European Community company law. Whoever acquired Heracles stood to lose the entire investment if the debt capitalisation was reversed, making IRO's equity invalid. Moreover, prospective buyers were not encouraged by the Greek government's offer of a guaranteed refund of the purchase price plus interest if the European Court, which is to consider the case, ruled against the IRO. At this point, the National Bank came into the picture with a scheme under which it would join forces with the strongest bidder for IRO's stake in Heracles. It was an attractive offer. If the 1986 debt capitalisation were reversed, National Bank would revert to being Heracles' largest shareholder with 25 per cent. Calcestruzzi - which had acquired 17 per cent of Heracles through the Athens stock market - and National Bank then submitted a joint bid of Dr107bn for the IRO holding. It turned out to be the only firm offer received. Italcementi, the only other short-listed contender following the withdrawal of Holderbank of Switzerland, pulled out at the last minute, claiming that the unannounced alliance between Calcestruzzi and National Bank violated transparency procedures in the sale. However, Italcementi later indicated it was prepared to offer Dr120bn if National Bank changed sides. Instead, Calcestruzzi and the bank raised their offer to Dr124bn. This was just above the value placed on Heracles by Morgan Stanley, acting as IRO's financial adviser on the sale. Calcestruzzi, a ready-mix concrete producer controlling over 1,000 regional construction companies in Italy, is the country's largest customer for cement. It has been trying for years to acquire a large cement producer to ensure a steady source of supply. Its earnings for 1990, the latest figures available, totalled L45bn (Dollars 36m) on sales of L1,178bn. Calnat, the joint venture formed to acquire Heracles, is 52.5 per cent-owned by Calcestruzzi and 47.5 per cent by National Bank. Calcestruzzi has an option to buy out National Bank's stake over the next four years. Calcestruzzi, listed on the Milan stock exchange, is financing its Dr65.1bn share of the deal through bank borrowing, and by selling off some smaller companies under its control.</p>

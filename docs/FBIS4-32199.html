			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Vaclav Havel, president of the Czech Republic, </F> at news conference held at Bucharest Cotroceni Palace -- live in  Czech with passage by passage translation into Romanian,  translated from Romanian]    [Text] It is a particular pleasure for me at the end of my  visit to express thanks for the warm hospitality with which I  was welcomed throughout my visit to Romania.    I can confirm what President Iliescu has said, namely that  between our countries there are no differences at all in the  field of foreign policy regarding events in Europe and the goals  that the two countries promote in their foreign policies. I  have recalled on various occasions the stages that can indeed  confirm the mutual feelings of sympathy that have developed  between our two nations throughout history. I can remember the  favorable way in which the public in Czechoslovakia hailed the  support granted to them by Romania in 1968 and I can remember  just as well the state of anxiety and disgust that the public in  Czechoslovakia felt toward what was happening in the last years  of the Ceausescu era. For example, Ceausescu's initiative to  destroy villages met with the Czechoslovak public's complete  disapproval. I can also remember the great interest showed by  the public in Czechoslovakia in the events that led to the fall  of the Ceausescu regime, as well as the feelings of empathy  nurtured by the Czechoslovak public for the revolution that  unfortunately resulted in the loss of so many lives. Apart from  the political goal of this visit which culminated with the  signing of the treaty on friendly relations and cooperation  between Romania and the Czech Republic, our presence in  Bucharest has also made a contribution to a more profound  familiarization with realities in Romania and with the  development of the political situation in this country.    During the official talks we held with President Iliescu,  Prime Minister Vacaroiu, and the presidents of the two chambers  of the Romanian Parliament, but also during informal occasions,  such as the official dinner that took place last night, I had an  opportunity to understand more clearly the way in which  democracy in Romania operates. The meeting I had at Bucharest  University with representatives of the opposition, with whom I  discussed various aspects of Romanian life, gave me the  opportunity to get to know Romania better.    I am firmly convinced that the economic and political  relations between our countries will continue to progress and I  have the feeling that the next step that we could take would be  to sign an accord on free trade. We estimate that such an  accord could be signed this coming fall on the occasion of the  meeting of the two premiers. In conditions of a market economy,  as far as a development of economic relations are concerned,  everything depends on economic companies. However, governments  can also make a contribution to this development by creating a  concrete framework for the development of such relations and I  am sure that the governments of these two countries, that is, of  Romania and the Czech Republic, can do this.    Once again, I wish to express thanks for this invitation and  the hospitality extended to me and for the fact that I was given  the opportunity to visit Romania for the first time in my life.</p>

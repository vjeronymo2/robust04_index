			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GAS COMPANY BEGINS ITS OWN RECYCLING  PROGRAM  </P> <P> Southern California Gas Co. on Monday announced that its previously wasted  heaps of white paper scrap -- memos, letters, and assorted bureaucratic  leftovers -- will be separated and recycled in a model program that officials  hope other businesses will imitate.  </P> <P> But in fact, such recycling programs are now "very common throughout Los  Angeles," said Joan Edwards, director of the city's integrated solid waste  management office.  </P> <P> "Many paper dealers offer this service. It's their bread and butter."  </P> <P> A news conference in Chatsworth featured Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy  Picus helping to dump sheets of used white paper into a large bin for  collection by a private recycling contractor. Under the plan, used white paper  from the gas company office will be sold to the recycler, with a portion of the  money going to a volunteer service organization in Van Nuys.  </P></p>

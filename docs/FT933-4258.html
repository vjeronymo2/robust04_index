			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Siemens unit makes first profit THE German electronics group Siemens said its Automotive Systems Group will make a small profit in the year ending September 30 for the first time since it was founded in 1984, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. Mr Juergen Mache, board member in the division, told a news conference 1992/93 earnings were barely above break-even point, but said Siemens did not give figures for its different business sectors. Mr Franz Wressnigg, division chairman, said it expected a 'comparatively modest business result' for 1992/93. Despite a worldwide sales slump in the car industry and increasing price pressures on suppliers, orders received will reach last year's DM2.6bn (Dollars 1.56bn) while sales will increase to slightly over the DM2.5bn seen in 1991/92, Mr Wressnigg said. The division had made losses in recent years, he added. Domestic business had levelled off, although foreign business was growing as the US market improved, Mr Wressnigg said. In Siemens' core area of automotive electronics it saw solid growth this year, with unit sales of anti-lock braking system electronics more than doubling. Research and development expenditure, currently some 12 per cent of sales, had grown slightly, while the workforce of over 13,000 had remained steady. A company spokesman said Siemens' group turnover in the traffic and transport sectors overall amounted to DM8bn, some 10 per cent of group sales. The group also said it was expanding its automotive systems production facilities in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and hoped to open a plant for heating and air-conditioning systems in the Czech city of Rakovnik.</p>

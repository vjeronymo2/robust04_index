			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / People: Aston Martin Lagonda Former Ford executive Nick Fry has landed a bigger job than he perhaps bargained for when he first joined Aston Martin Lagonda in last August. That was as operations director. Now he has been made managing director at a time when the luxury sports carmaker, owned by Ford since 1987, is poised for one of the biggest expansionary leaps in its 70-year history. The company is cranking up to quadruple production to 800 cars a year in 1995, by means of a new 'cheap' Aston, the DB7, destined to sell for the paltry sum - by Aston standards - of less than Pounds 80,000. Past models have mostly been designed, developed and built at Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, and the more expensive models will continue to be built there. But the DB7 will be produced at a separate factory being equipped at Bloxham, Oxon, with the main design and development undertaken in Kidlington, Oxon, by TWR (Design), part of Tom Walkinshaw's TWR group. Not only will Fry have day-to-day supervision of this three-ring production 'circus', he is also charged with new product planning and overseeing the expansion of Aston Martin's worldwide sales and service organisation which is a necessary accompaniment to the arrival of the DB7.</p>

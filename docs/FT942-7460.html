'The Asia-Pacific part of the world has a very distinct role to play in the company's path to recovery because it is the fastest-growing, and it's a place where we have very good operations,' said Mr Bobby Choonavala, president of Digital Equipment Asia Pacific. The losses were mainly due to the company's switch to new product lines during the past two years, he said.

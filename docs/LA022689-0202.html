			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 4-AA GIRLS;  </P> <P> AMOROSO DELIVERS, CARRIES VALENCIA IN SEMIFINAL, 51-48  </P> <P> Valencia High School, the team that wouldn't go away, got a little luck late in  the game to go with its game-long perseverance.  </P> <P> And it was enough to help Valencia beat Mission Viejo, 51-48, in a Southern  Section 4-AA girls' semifinal game Saturday at El Toro High.  </P> <P> Nancy Amoroso made three of four free throws with 1 second left to give  Valencia the victory and put the Tigers in the championship game against Canyon  Thursday at Chapman College.  </P> <P> Valencia, which was unseeded in the division, is 19-9. Mission Viejo, which  finished its season 23-5, was the top-seeded team.  </P> <P> The Tigers, who shot poorly and had trouble guarding Jennifer Rohrig, Mission  Viejo's 6-foot-2 center, trailed by as many as five points late in the game.  But Valencia never gave up and hustled its way back into the game.  </P> <P> Valencia made one last, late run at Mission Viejo and tied the score, 48-48, on  two free throws by guard Hsin-Yi Lo with 14 seconds left.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo then called timeout, its last, in order to set up a play.  </P> <P> Tina Ranker, Mission Viejo guard, drove toward the basket, but found her path  blocked by Valencia players. She tried to throw a pass toward the corner of the  key, but Amoroso intercepted it with 1 second left.  </P> <P> And as she did, she was fouled by Mission Viejo's Derrie Nauta, who was running  full tilt toward the ball.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo called timeout, trying to freeze Amoroso, but because it had used  all its timeouts was given a two-shot technical foul. So Amoroso had, in  effect, at least three chances to win it for Valencia.  </P> <P> "I've never been in that position before," Amoroso said. "I was shaking."  </P> <P> She made the front end of the one-and-one, hit the second and then sank one of  two technical foul shots to give Valencia its winning margin.  </P> <P> "No matter who would have won the game, it would have come down to something  lucky at the end," Valencia Coach Debi Woelke said.  </P> <P> It was hardly the best of games for either team, but particularly for Valencia.  </P> <P> Center Kristen McDonald, who averages 19 points a game, didn't score until  there were 5 seconds left in the first half and finished with just 13 points.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the Tigers scored only six points in the third quarter and had  only one field goal in scoring 10 points in the second.  </P> <P> Candy Andersen added 12 points, including eight in the fourth quarter, for  Valencia. Lo and Amoroso had 10 and nine points, respectively.  </P></p>

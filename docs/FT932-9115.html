			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / China may soften on HK poll: Report says broader electoral base is being considered THE prospect of a resolution of the Anglo-Chinese rift over Hong Kong's political development appeared to improve yesterday with a report of a more conciliatory Chinese attitude to the conduct of the colony's 1995 elections. The report, by Reuter's news agency, of a softer line from Beijing came amid conflicting signals from China. On Wednesday, for example, an official Chinese commentary on Mr Chris Patten's recent visit to the US described the governor as a 'whore'. Reuter, quoting Chinese sources in Hong Kong, said Beijing was ready to consider broadening the electoral base for the 30 'functional' members of the colony's Legislative Council proposed by Mr Patten in the autumn. The news agency's sources also said China wanted an electoral college more broadly composed than the one Mr Patten suggested. Mr Patten's proposals for Hong Kong's political development included increasing the number of voters who would be eligible to elect the 'functional' members of the 60-member council, and a requirement that an electoral college, which will appoint 10 members to LegCo, itself be elected. The governor and his officials have indicated in the past that the precise shape of the electoral college was secondary to the requirement that members be elected. Meanwhile, Mr Patten seemed to play down the importance of his blueprint for the colony's political development to bilateral talks which began three weeks ago and which resume next week in the Chinese capital. At a press conference yesterday with Lady Thatcher, former UK premier, he described his proposals as 'part of our thinking as we take part in these talks'. Since last October he has consistently described his proposals as representing his best judgment of the 'balance' in Hong Kong between the desire for more democracy and harmonious relations with China.</p>

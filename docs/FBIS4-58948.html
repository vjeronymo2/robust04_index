			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak's  speech was presented to the Fifth Arab Energy Conference which  opened in Cairo today. In his speech, Mubarak proposed a plan  to act as a nucleus for collective Arab action in petroleum  spheres in light of the huge oil and natural gas resources  available to the Arab countries, with their impact on the world  energy situation.    President Mubarak's plan, which was read on his behalf by  Oil  Minister Dr. Hamdi al-Banbi, calls for finding a mechanism to  achieve cooperation in designing and implementing petroleum,  natural gas, and petrochemicals projects in the Arab countries.  The plan also calls for devising ways to coordinate among Arab  countries so that they will collectively have the ability to  design, implement, and administer petroleum projects and  manufacture the equipment necessary for these projects.    President Mubarak outlined the benefits the Arab countries  would derive from this mechanism in implementing oil and natural  gas projects. These benefits include lower costs, exchange of  expertise, technology transfer, integration among Arab  countries, and boosting capital industries with a view to  creating more jobs and breaking the world monopoly on the  implementation of oil projects.    As part of the executive measures for the project, the  president proposed the formation of a cooperation agency for  petroleum projects comprising a national center for cooperation  in oil projects in each of the member states and a primary  coordination center in one of the Arab countries. This is in  addition to forming a data bank to provide information on  potential projects, the timing of their implementation, and the  equipment and capabilities of the contractors.

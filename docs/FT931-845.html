			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow dragged down by bond market sell-off Wall Street US equities drifted in a narrow range yesterday morning before computer-driven programme selling and a bond market sell-off dragged stocks lower, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 21.34 at 3,439.98. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 3.11 at 447.77, while the Amex composite was up 0.35 at 419.47. But the Nasdaq composite bucked the downward trend, adding 0.53 at 681.54. Trading volume on the NYSE exceeded 219m shares and declines outnumbered rises by 1,002 to 844. Equities shrugged off the economic news of the morning, including a slight downward revision of fourth-quarter GDP, which rose 4.7 per cent. The increased revision of two inflation indicators put pressure on bond prices, which were already shaky after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Federal Reserve was concerned about inflation. Bond prices were also weighed down by an abundance of supply after this week's two and five year note auctions. In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was 1 1/16 lower at 102 5/16 , yielding 6.937 per cent. Northern Telecom was one of the chief contributors to the market's decline as its shares fell Dollars 5 to Dollars 37 7/8 after the company released first-quarter earnings late on Thursday substantially lower than expected. Merrill Lynch reduced its intermediate-term rating on the stock to 'neutral' from 'above average', although its long-term investment rating remains 'above average'. International Business Machines and RJR Nabisco Holdings were among the most active stocks on the New York Stock Exchange after IBM ended speculation about its new chief executive by naming RJR chairman Mr Louis Gertsner to the post. Although the appointment was widely expected, it contributed to heavy trading in the shares. IBM rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 51 1/4 and RJR was unchanged at Dollars 8. Bankers Life Holding was quoted at Dollars 24 1/2 . An initial offering of 17m shares was priced at Dollars 22 a share Thursday. Ashland Oil slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 27 5/8 following the prediction of a first-quarter loss of about Dollars 3m, or 5 cents a share, compared with a deficit of Dollars 13m, or 23 cents, a year earlier. Grim first-quarter predictions from Medic Computer Systems late on Thursday sent shares in the company tumbling Dollars 5 1/8 to a 52-week low of Dollars 6 3/4 in Nasdaq trading. Medic expects to earn about 7 or 8 cents a share in the quarter. In the technology sector, Dell Computer firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 36 5/8 , Apple Computer fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 53 1/4 , Microsoft lost Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 86 5/8 and Lotus Development held steady at Dollars 27. Canada TORONTO ended the week mixed but lower, dragged down by a sharp drop in the industrial products group. The TSE-300 index fell 12.3 points to 3599.74 on volume of 60.09m shares. There was a gain on the week of about 23 points. The fall in industrial products was mostly due to a sharp drop in Northern Telecom which said earnings for the first quarter of 1993 will be below year-earlier results.</p>

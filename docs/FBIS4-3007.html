			<p>BFN     [Text] MING PAO has been informed by its lawyers in  Beijing that after hearing Xi Yang's appeal, the court upheld  the guilty conviction and the 12-year jail sentence. MING PAO  workers will hold a massive protest tonight. Cheung Sau-wan  reports:    [Beginning recording] [Cheung] After deliberating on all the  details of Xi Yang's appeal this morning, the Beijing Municipal  Higher People's Court upheld the original sentence, that is, the  12- year jail term and the deprivation of all political rights  for two years. The written decision has been handed to Xi Yang.  The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court spokeswoman, a Miss  Fan, said that the court had examined all the evidence and  arrived at the decision on the basis of law.    [Fan, in Mandarin] The Beijing Municipal Higher People's  Court on the morning of 15 April made a public announcement  about its decision on the Xi Yang case. The result was to  uphold the guilty conviction, the reason being that, after  examination and a hearing, the court judged that the  intermediate court's verdict complied with the law.    [Cheung] The spokeswoman also said that Xi Yang was present  when the decision was read out this morning and learned of the  result right away. She also said that because Chinese law takes  the second trial hearing to be the final appeal, the defeat of  an appeal against conviction means that no more appeals can be  lodged. After the written decision was announced, Xi Yang was  immediately whisked away to a penal institution to begin serving  his sentence.    [Fan, in Mandarin] After the decision was announced he was  sent to a penal institution to serve his sentence. The whole  thing ended after the decision had been announced.    [Cheung] MING PAO learned of the failure today through its  Beijing lawyers and has decided to hold a massive protest  tonight. Cheung Sau-wan, Commercial Radio. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS;  </P> <P> SEARS REPORTS 63.7% DROP IN NET INCOME  </P> <P> Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. Monday reported a 63.7% drop in its first-quarter net  income but the retailing giant said the results were distorted by an accounting  change that inflated last year's earnings.  </P> <P> Excluding the $544.2-million credit Sears gained in the first quarter of 1988  with a new accounting method, the company's net income rose 56.3% in the first  quarter of 1989, Sears said in a news release.  </P> <P> Sears reported net income of $257.7 million, or 70 cents a share, for the first  three months of this year. The figure compared to $709.1 million, or $1.87 a  share, for the same period a year ago.  </P> <P> First-quarter revenue rose 10.9% to $12.16 billion, compared to $10.96 billion  in 1988's first quarter.  </P> <P> Chairman Edward A. Brennan said all Sears' business groups reported record-high  quarterly revenue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Delighted' With Response  </P> <P> Sales of the Sears Merchandise Group, the retailing division, rose 11.9% to  $6.76 billion during the first quarter from $6.04 billion a year earlier. The  division's revenue jumped 16.4% in March following the introduction of a new  low pricing policy.  </P> <P> "We are delighted with consumer response," Brennan said. "The results confirmed  our belief that everyday low pricing is an idea whose time has come."  </P> <P> Sears also owns Allstate Insurance, Dean Witter Financial Services and Coldwell  Banker Real Estate.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by P. Vucinic: "Volunteers by Force"] </F>   [Text] The story was first raised in the Serbian  parliament. Milisav Petkovic, a Democratic Party deputy, said  that a man who "has been a Serbian citizen for 10 years and was  registered with his military authority in Serbia was taken to a  school in Derventa where he was forced to sign a statement that  he was willing to go to the front."    "This story about volunteers" originates from Mali Zvornik  and there is more than one person involved in it. According to  witnesses, mostly wives of such "volunteers" who were taken away  in the middle of the night, there are at least nine of them. It  can be assumed that they are no longer alive. The secret of  their correct number is hidden in a bus that took them away and  it must also be known by "the official authorities." Judging by  what we heard in Mali Zvornik, it seems that the bus was seen  during the "guilty" night of 10-11 March 1994 only by occupants  of a building on Ribarska Street in Mali Zvornik. The policeman  on duty at the police station "did not know what the whole thing  was about," and recommended that we talk to the police chief who  was not there "at the moment."  <H5>  They Came </H5>   "Two policemen with Serbian police badges came at one in the  morning and knocked at the door. They wanted to speak to my  husband and when he got up they told him to follow them to the  Mali Zvornik police station so that 'they can put down some  information.' I went to the terrace and saw that he was taken  to a bus parked in front of the building," Ljiljana Andric, the  wife of 37-year-old Radovan Andric, told us.    Ljiljana and Radovan Andric have lived in Mali Zvornik, in  the Srpska republic, since December 1991. Radovan Andric was  employed by the aluminum oxide factory of Zvornik, now  controlled by the military and civilian authorities of the  Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since they got an  apartment in Mali Zvornik, Ljiljana and Radomir gave up their  residence in Zvornik and were registered in Mali Zvornik.  Ljiljana Andric told us that Radomir brought his military  documentation to Mali Zvornik in the Srpska republic.    She also told us that her husband remained employed on the  other river bank, in another state. She said that he was very  assiduous in doing his work and came home only once a week  according to a new regulation. That he was a Serbian citizen  made it impossible for the authorities of the Srpska republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina to mobilize him -- until the night of 10-11  March, 1994.    "Nine of them from Ribarska Street 42 were caught like  rabbits," Ljiljana Andric told us. While she was watching the  scene from the balcony, she heard the bell ring for a second  time. One of the policemen came back and offered her his  company since she was "so lonely."    Stevka has a similar story. Her husband Milan Lukic was  taken away in the same way. "He did not protest when policemen  asked for his papers. They said that everything would be over  soon as they had done nothing wrong," Stevka says.    Luka Vidovic was taken away early in the morning. His wife  remained alone with their two children -- an 11-year-old  daughter and a nine-year-old son, who was suffering from  leukodistrophy. Borka told the children "Daddy has gone to pick  up his salary," but they heard at school that their father had  been arrested as a deserter. Borka lives on the ninth floor of  a building in which the elevator is broken and she carries the  sick children on her back even though she is afraid that her  spine might break some day. She told us that the physicians and  engineers who live below her were not bothered, although some of  them had moved from Bosnia to Serbia after the building on  Ribarska Street was completed.  <H5>  Across the Drina River </H5>   "I realized that I cannot complain to anybody," Borka told  us. "We went to the police, but we were told that they did not  know anything about it." Slavica Mladenovic was given a  certificate by the military headquarters in Mali Zvornik stating  that her husband was registered in that commune, but she was  allegedly told that that was a document of no significance in  Zvornik. She was told by the Mali Zvornik police that they "had  nothing to do with the case." A policeman was seen at Zvornik  military headquarters who participated in this action. He "did  not know anything," either.    Authorities from both sides of the Drina River pretended  that  they had not been informed about the case until the nine men  reached a telephone and called Derventa, a village between  Milici and Vlasenica, telling their friends that they had been  arrested and charged with desertion, adding that they would  probably be sent to the front line near Srebrenica. Two of them  who did not want to wear uniforms were beaten up. One of them  was later released as unfit for duty. Luka Vidovic, who was  exempt from military service in his military district because of  his two sick children, was retained.    In the meantime, the women visited their husbands who were  accommodated in an abandoned school; they are waiting now. The  news they receive is contradictory. According to some  information, their husbands will come back, but, according to  other information, they will be retained since the Republic of  Serbia and the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina have signed  an agreement on the mobilization of former Bosnia-Herzegovina  citizens. Borka Vidovic does not know whether or not such an  agreement has really been reached, but she has the feeling that  "the whole case must be based on this."    Official sources have unofficially confirmed that the story  about forceful mobilization in Mali Zvornik (Srpska republic)  for the army of a neighboring state is correct.</p>

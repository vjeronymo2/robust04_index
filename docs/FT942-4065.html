			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Pound stable Sterling yesterday shrugged off the disastrous by-election performance of the ruling Conservative party to trade within narrow margins, writes Motoko Rich. The poor performance was widely expected, while a recent set of robust economic data has also underpinned the pound. Sterling closed in London at DM2.5142 against the D-Mark and at Dollars 1.508 against the dollar, from Thursday's close of DM2.5206 and Dollars 1.5075. The dollar also held its ground after the release of the US producer price index, which was slightly above market expectations. The dollar finished at DM1.6672 against the D-Mark from DM1.6721. Against the yen, it closed at Y103.915 from Y104.155. The markets were unmoved by yesterday's Tankan survey, the Bank of Japan's report of business conditions, which showed a picture of gradual economic recovery. Analysts attributed sterling's firm performance to a forward looking market, which was focusing on next week's retail sales and average earnings figures, rather than election results. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said the market was expecting average earnings to rise from 4 per cent to 4 1/4 per cent. 'An increase in average earnings will no doubt persuade the Bank of England to argue for a tightening of UK monetary policy,' he said. Higher interest rates, however, may not drive up the pound. 'The upside is fairly limited for sterling because in the next few months, political matters will dominate the agenda,' said Mr MacKinnon. 'So that may be a deterrent for foreign investors.' Positive headline data and a worse than expected underlying rise in the US core PPI failed to jolt the dollar. 'The market fell asleep,' said Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank. The US bond market registered little change and Mr Cocker said the dollar needed bond movement to take the lead. Mr MacKinnon said the dollar had remained trapped within a tight trading range ahead of next week's retail sales, CPI, industrial production and current account figures. The US currency also ignored more sabre rattling from Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, who said the US goal was to open Japan 'one way or another'. The D-Mark was mixed in Europe ahead of tomorrow's European elections. The German currency closed in London at FFr3.402 against the French franc from FFr3.405 on Thursday. Against the lira, it finished at L965 from L967.5, but it was stronger against the escudo and the peseta. In the futures market, the December euromark contract traded 34,000 lots and settled eleven basis points higher at 94.91. Short sterling volumes were low at 15,000 and the December contract closed at 93.79, from 93.77. German call money was quoted in a range of 5.00/5.10 per cent from 4.95/5.05 per cent on Thursday. In the UK, the Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 115m to the money market. Earlier the Bank had provided 400m liquidity after forecasting a Pounds 600m shortage.</p>

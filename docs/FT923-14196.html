			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Dixons falls 14% and sees no upturn DIXONS, the UK's biggest electrical retailing chain which is widely viewed in the City as being one of the first beneficiaries of any economic recovery, said yesterday sales had slipped back in recent weeks as it reported a 14 per cent fall in annual profits to Pounds 70.3m. The company's shares shed 9p to 214p on the news that there were 'no real signs in the UK and US of any sustained economic upturn' and helped precipitate a weakening of many other stocks in the stores sector. In January, Mr Stanley Kalms, Dixons' chairman, described how consumers in some parts of the country 'were bouncing with enthusiasm' with sales increases running in the 'mid-teens'. Yesterday he said sales had weakened over the past nine weeks but were still running 'slightly ahead' of last year. 'We are quite shattered that the trend has turned off its line,' he said. In the year to May 2, however, Dixons recorded a continued resurgence of profitability in the UK, where it runs the Dixons, Currys and Supasnaps chains. UK operating profits rose one third to Pounds 71.9m on sales 11 per cent higher at Pounds 1.2bn. Dixons said the improvement largely stemmed from the greater operating efficiencies from its growing portfolio of edge-of-town Currys superstores. Fourteen more were opened during the year bringing the total to 115, while 43 Currys high street stores were shut. Sales of consumer electronics, household appliances and photographic equipment remained weak but computer games, business computers and camcorders showed good gains. The UK profits were inflated by the inclusion of Pounds 10m from the release of excess provisions from its product warranties. Dixons' Silo chain in the US fell into a Pounds 16.9m loss (from Pounds 3.5m profit) on sales of Pounds 580.9m. The company's UK and European property interests contributed profits of Pounds 4.1m (down from Pounds 11m). Total group turnover rose 10 per cent to Pounds 1.86bn. Dixons swallowed an Pounds 11.2m extraordinary charge relating mainly to provisions for discontinuing UK property development. Earnings per share fell from 12.6p to 9.5p. A final dividend of 4.4p lifted the total 3 per cent to 6p. Lex, Page 22</p>

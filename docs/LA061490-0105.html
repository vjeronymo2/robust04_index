			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICANS ARE SCARED SAVERS, SURVEY SHOWS;  </P> <P> CONSUMERS: BABY BOOMERS ARE GETTING MUCH THRIFTIER. MANY FEAR HAVING TO PAY FOR  A PARENT'S CARE AND A CHILD'S EDUCATION AT THE SAME TIME.  </P> <P> Americans -- particularly aging baby boomers -- are increasingly pessimistic  about their financial prospects and, consequently, are beginning to save more  than ever before, according to a survey by the International Assn. for  Financial Planning in Atlanta.  </P> <P> "Pessimism is causing everybody to put away more money," said Robert A. Hewitt,  chairman of the financial planners' trade group. "We, as a nation, are coming  to grips with the fact that we can't spend more than we make."  </P> <P> The U.S. savings rate proves that the respondents aren't just talking, Hewitt  added. Savings as a percentage of disposable personal income has risen from  3.2% in 1987 to 5.4% in the first quarter of 1990, according to the Commerce  Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis.  </P> <P> A variety of factors have weighed in to worry the vast majority of the 1,758  individuals surveyed about their ability to cope with future financial  responsibilities, according to the IAFP.  </P> <P> Older baby boomers, those between the ages of 35 and 44, believe that they are  in a "triple squeeze" -- likely to have to pay for a child's education, support  an aging parent and save for their own retirement at the same time. An  astounding 75% of this group say they are currently saving or planning to save  more in 1990 because of these concerns.  </P> <P> On average, 62% of the general population responded they were planning to save  more this year than last.  </P> <P> But Americans are also worried about mundane, day-to-day expenses, such as  making car and mortgage payments, paying taxes and buying insurance. The cost  of child care has also emerged as a concern, with 4% of the population citing  it as a worry, compared to less than 0.5% in 1989.  </P> <P> Only 8% of those surveyed in 1990 said they had no real financial worries,  compared to 6% in 1989 and 15% in 1988.  </P> <P> The Gallup Organization conducted the survey with a random telephone sample of  1,058 households. It also called 600 additional families with incomes above  $50,000 to determine the concerns of affluent Americans. The margin of error  was given as plus or minus 3%.  </P> <P> The biggest long-term worry for both the general population and aging baby  boomers -- the most concerned and pessimistic group surveyed -- is the  possibility of having to cope with two major expenses, namely a parent's care  and a child's education at the same time. Two-thirds of the baby boomers and  53% of the general population cited this as one of their topmost concerns.  </P> <P> More than half of the respondents were also worried about outliving their  retirement savings -- 52% of the total population, compared to 62% of the baby  boomers. Moreover, 46% of the general population and 59% of the baby boomers  said they were "very or somewhat concerned about meeting all their financial  responsibilities."  </P> <P> Other survey results:  </P> <P> * 86% of those surveyed believe that college costs have risen beyond the means  of most American families.  </P> <P> * 86% believe that severe inflation is likely to be a problem in the 1990s.  </P> <P> * 83% said the cost of day care has become a serious financial burden for most  families with small children.  </P> <P> * 66% believe that there is less chance for retirees to be financially  self-sufficient in the 1990s than in the 1980s.  </P> <P> Women are more pessimistic than men, with 91% of the women surveyed saying  college will probably cost too much for most American families in the 1990s.  Only 81% of the men agreed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SAVING MORE  </P> <P> Gallup surveyed 1,058 households nationwide. An additional 600 households with  incomes of $50,000 or more were surveyed to determine results for the "wealthy"  category. Here is how they responded to the question, "What are your top two or  three long-term financial goals?"  </P> <P> Saving for retirement  </P> <P> General population  </P> <P> 1990: %30  </P> <P> 1989: %28  </P> <P> Wealthy  </P> <P> 1990: %52  </P> <P> 1989: %41  </P> <P> Saving for a child's education  </P> <P> General population  </P> <P> 1990: %17  </P> <P> 1989: %14  </P> <P> Wealthy  </P> <P> 1990: %23  </P> <P> 1989: %21  </P> <P> Buying/making payments on a home  </P> <P> General population  </P> <P> 1990: %16  </P> <P> 1989: %13  </P> <P> Wealthy  </P> <P> 1990: %16  </P> <P> 1989: %10  </P> <P> Increasing savings  </P> <P> General population  </P> <P> 1990: %7  </P> <P> 1989: %5  </P> <P> Wealthy  </P> <P> 1990: %8  </P> <P> 1989: %5  </P> <P> Source: Gallup Organization via International Assn. for Financial Planning  </P> <P> Los Angeles Times  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference given by Defense Minister Volker </F> Ruehe and French Defense Minister Francois Leotard, by Christine  Heuer with unidentified announcer, in Bonn on 27 June]    [Text] [Announcer] On the occasion of the presentation of  his new book, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe met with his French  counterpart Francois Leotard in Bonn today. However, the  reporters who attended the presentation were much more  interested in asking the two ministers about the French  intervention in the civil war in Rwanda and a possible German  commitment there. Did the two minister provide comprehensive  answers to these questions?    [Heuer] Well, Francois Leotard did not answer at all.  Volker Ruehe was apparently very reluctant to reply to  questions about Rwanda. He was very reserved, referring to the  fact that one must await the ruling by the Constitutional Court  on the participation of German soldiers abroad and saying that  he had merely asked his French counterpart, Francois Leotard, to  brief him on the situation in Rwanda.    [Begin Ruehe recording] The Constitutional Court ruling, due  on 12 July, is to be given absolute priority. By the way, we  have made it very clear -- also by providing material support --  that we are ready to provide humanitarian aid if certain  preconditions exist. [end recording]    [Heuer] Ruehe's statement confirmed the well-known position  of the Federal Government. Bonn is only prepared to permit  German soldiers to participate in humanitarian missions in  Rwanda under UN sponsorship if the security situation is checked  by the United Nations in Kigali and found to be such that the  involvement of German Bundeswehr soldiers in hostilities can be  ruled out.    The second topic was the participation of German soldiers in  the parade on the Champs Elysee in Paris on 12 July. Both  ministers commented on this issue. Volker Ruehe explicitly  conveyed thanks for the French invitation to the Germans.  Francois Leotard stressed that the German soldiers are to take  part within the framework of the Eurocorps. Asked about  criticism of the German participation in the parade, expressed  by members of the French Resistance, the French defense minister  said it should not be overvalued.    [Begin Leotard recording, in French with superimposed German  translation] It is true that protests were expressed initially.  However, they mainly came from political parties -- from the  Communist Party. Some of the protests also result from internal  French quarrels. The attitude of the majority of the French  population is absolutely positive. Personally I believe that,  generally, the French are glad that this Eurocorp, which  includes German soldiers, has an opportunity to present itself  on the Champs Elysee. [end recording]    [Heuer] Thus, against this backdrop, Leotard naturally ruled  out active protest by the French side on 14 July.</p>

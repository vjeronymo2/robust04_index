			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in  Ukrainian at 1710 GMT on 12 January carries a report on an  expanded sitting of the Supreme Council commission in charge of  drafting Ukraine's new constitution, held on 12 January under  the chairmanship of President Leonid Kravchuk. The sitting was  attended by chairmen of the oblast and city councils of people's  deputies, president's representatives in the oblasts, and  leaders of political parties.    Correspondent Anatoliy Komirenko says that the current  constitution of Ukraine was adopted in Soviet times and,  although updated, it did not create a legal basis for solving  political and economic problems facing Ukraine, especially in  conditions of a deep economic crisis. Which body is to adopt  the new constitution: the Supreme Council, a constituent  assembly, or an all-Ukrainian referendum to be held  simultaneously with the election of people's deputies on 27  March 1994? Such issues were discussed at the sitting of the  commission.    Komirenko says that in his introductory speech Leonid  Kravchuk indicated that for the sake of a reliable functioning  of all the power structures it is necessary to lay down a  reliable constitutional basis. In the opinion of the president,  one of the ways to do this is to work up the draft constitution  which has been elaborated for more than three years now. This  can be done simultaneously with the elections to the Supreme  Council.    The broadcast then carries a recorded extract from  Kravchuk's  speech, in which he says: "What would we like to discuss at  this meeting of ours? First, if the draft constitution is  submitted for an all-Ukrainian referendum, any aggravation of  political struggle should be (?avoided). For this it is  necessary to polish again and again separate provisions of the  draft constitution. In particular, it is necessary to withdraw  -- or formulate in a more clear-cut way -- those provisions  which may cause aggravation and, by the way, those which can be  solved by the Supreme Council of the next convocation, as is  being done throughout the world. That is to say, not all issues  should be submitted to the referendum in their full volume if we  know that people' opinions on these issues will differ.    "Second, it would be worthwhile introducing relevant  corrections to the provisions of the draft concerning the  delimitation of state power and the structure of power in the  regions, proceeding from the necessity to keep a maximum  balance, precisely a balance, precisely more extensive rights to  the regions, proceeding from the policy of decentralization.  And what's more, all this should be done so as to preserve the  state's integrity.    "Third, it would be expedient to forecast the passing of the  prepared documents and the draft constitution, both our  documents which have been handed to you, to the Supreme Council  and also those to be submitted to the referendum. Nevertheless,  it would be worthwhile having a forecast, to have a plan of  action so as to ensure the adoption of the constitution by the  people of Ukraine. The adoption of the new constitution by a  nationwide vote would be the optimal, ideal way out of the  constitutional crisis."    Korimenko goes on to say that the sitting participants also  discussed the draft law on the structure of state power. In the  opinion of certain speakers, it was elaborated even better than  the draft fundamental law. In particular, Oleksandr Kotsynba,  chairman of the standing commission for issues of legislation  and legality, gave a positive assessment of the draft new  constitution and a negative assessment of the draft law on the  structure of state power. In particular, he said that this  draft law has no mechanism for tackling and regulating a whole  number of problems ranging from the structure to the plenary  powers, to the functions of the state bodies, etc.    Korimenko adds that Vyacheslav Chornovil, chairman of the  Ukrainian People's Movement for Perestroyka [Rukh], disagreed  with Oleksandr Kotsyuba as far as the law on the structure of  state power was concerned. In his opinion the adoption of such  a document is imperative.    According to Korimenko, the speakers pointed out more than  once that the draft constitution should be adopted by a certain  body before it is submitted to a nationwide referendum.  People's deputy Vitaliy Karpenko favored the idea of convening  a constitutional assembly. Certain speakers were concerned  about the fact that the election may fail to take place for one  reason or another, which means that the referendum on the  constitution would also be undermined. This is why it would be  expedient to introduce amendments to the constitution currently  in force so as to ensure the legitimacy of the new parliament's  activity.    The sitting participants agreed that the future of the state  depends on the solution of the issue of power. When it comes to  the constitution, haste is unnecessary; however, further  procrastination is also inadmissible, Korimenko concludes.    The program's announcer then says that, summing up the  results of the sitting, Leonid Kravchuk emphasized the necessity  of forming a working group of the members of the constitutional  commission headed by Ivan Plyushch to summarize the expressed  proposals and remarks. After this the draft constitution will be  considered at the conference of the leaders of councils at all  levels which will take place in Kiev on 18-19 January. With  regard for the results of the discussion at this conference, the  draft fundamental law will be submitted for the consideration of  the ninth session of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. It will  consider this document, and the most important provisions of the  constitution, which will not be approved by the Supreme Council,  will be submitted to the all-Ukrainian referendum on 27 March  simultaneously with the election to the parliament. This  proposal was approved by the majority of votes.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Observer: My word is my. . . Is this a case for Sweden's consumer ombudsman? The most prestigious of the country's banks, Skandinaviska Enskilda Bank, which just a year ago was on the verge of having to call on the state to rescue it, is running full-page advertisements in the Swedish newspapers urging the public to buy its own bonds. 'Bonds,' runs the text, 'are the safest way there is of investing your savings.' Fair enough, if this means gilts or mortgage bonds. But Skandinaviska's bosses should know that an investment in corporate bonds is only as safe as the company which issues the bonds.</p>

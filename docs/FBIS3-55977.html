			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Defense Ministry press service reports the  following for 12 January:    The Armenian military units tried to launch an offensive on  11 January in the Hakop-Kamari [Lulasaz] sector of the front  that lies towards Terter. The enemy, who launched three attacks  during the day, suffered considerable losses in men and material  and had to withdraw.    Our brave soldiers have brought to naught every Armenian  offensive in Agdamskiy and Beylagan rayons.    The high command of the Armenian Armed Forces, whose attacks  towards Beylagan and Terter were defeated, is now working to  exacerbate the situation on our republic's northwestern borders.  The settlements in our republic's Tauzskiy, Kazakhskiy, and  Kedabekskiy rayons came under unceasing long-range artillery  shelling at 1830 on 11 January from Armenia's Berd,  Idzhevanskiy, and Krasnoselskiy rayons. Our army units took  countermeasures to silence the ferocious enemy.</p>

However, recent developments in the conflict over security  guarantees in East Europe, as well as the Yugoslav crisis permit  us to reach some conclusions about the relative character of  U.S. and West European support for a status quo. Clearly by now  and for the foreseeable future, there are no prospects for a  trustworthy dissuasive security guarantee by the West for East  Europe. The vital interests of important West European powers in  this region are mainly defined by the attempt to minimize the  repercussions of social and nationalist conflicts--the principal  concern being how to avoid a wave of refugees and  immigrants--rather than by the preservation of the order that  prevailed after 1945.    The statements made last week by U.S. State Department  officials and by German Chancellor Kohl, regarding the  prohibitive costs of a military intervention in Bosnia, shed  light on the limits of the West's trustworthiness in  guaranteeing stability in East Europe.    Throughout the 19th century and the period between the two  world wars, the status quo and its preservation were part of the  balance of power system. Today, the common denominator of the  goals of the main Western powers in East Europe and the Balkans  is the attempt to minimize the repercussions of a long-lasting  destabilizing situation.    In light of the above, the West's real security policy in  East Europe and the Balkans seems to be the handling of a  troublesome change in the postwar order of things at the least  possible cost. This development is of the utmost importance to  Greece, a country that links its vital interests with the  defense of the present order of things in the Balkans. Close to  our northern border and centering on the fragile Skopje  republic, there are foci of crisis that can threaten the status  quo of international borders at any moment. Under present  conditions, the probability of a decisive preventive and  stabilizing diplomatic intervention by the West in Kosovo or in  Skopje aimed at a political settlement of the problems of the  Albanian-speaking population must be excluded. The West's  intervention in a potential conflict in the southern area of  former Yugoslavia will be limited to restraining the expansion  of an ongoing confrontation that already has abolished the  present order of things, without the possibility of applying  pressure for a return to the "status quo ante."    Consequently, the statement that Athens is a force in the  preservation of the status quo in the Balkans is insufficient.  The United States and West Europe's limited intervention  capabililities in support of this status quo bring into focus  the planning of a Greek foreign and defense policy aimed at  handling the change in the present order of things in the  Balkans.    The fluidity of today's order of things there and the West's  inability to provide essential guarantees in its support  militate in favor of a flexible Greek Balkan policy that would  avoid bilateral obligations and inflexible positions in  conflicts and arguments that, according to all indications, will  follow their own course.    When, for the umpteenth time, Washington repeats that the  importance of the Bosnia conflict in its foreign policy ranks  lower than the Middle East and developments in Russia, it is  clear that this hierarchization applies to all Balkan conflicts.  The prohibitive cost of a land intervention in Bosnia will also  apply to Kosovo and Skopje.    Undoubtedly, the emphasis with which Athens--through the  statements of both the prime minister and the leader of the  opposition--confirmed its alignment with the policy of the  United States and of its European Union partners to support the  Balkan status quo was positive and stabilizing.  However, this was not sufficient to avoid doubts, and does not  make the West's verbal guarantees any more credible.</p>

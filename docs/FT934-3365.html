			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Sunday shopping campaigners rejoice Supporters of Sunday opening were jubilant after last night's vote in the Commons to allow all shops to open for at least six hours. Baroness Jay, chairman of the Shopping Hours Reform Council, which proposed the partial deregulation option, said the vote 'reflected the wishes of the majority of the people'. She added: 'It provides for a good, sound and popular law.' Mr David Quarmby, joint managing director of J. Sainsbury, the UK's largest superstore chain, said: 'The main people who will benefit from this are the millions of people who already shop on Sundays and will be able to go on doing so.' Asda, the UK's fourth-largest food superstore group, said it was pleased that the vote had produced a 'clear-cut decision'. The company said it already opened about 150 of its 200 stores on Sundays, which had become the third busiest day of the week. Mr Nigel Whittaker, executive director of Kingfisher, parent company of B&amp;Q, Superdrug, Woolworth and Comet, said he was 'delighted that parliament has reflected the feeling of the country'. The option chosen was 'practical, workable and provides a permanent solution'. Workers' groups also welcomed the decision. Ms Julie Trussler, chairwoman of the National Association of Sunday Shopworkers, which has campaigned for the right to work on Sundays, said the vote would 'safeguard the jobs of 140,000 Sunday shopworkers'. But Usdaw, the largest shopworkers' union, which switched support at the last minute from the Keep Sunday Special Campaign to the option which was adopted, warned its support was 'crucially linked to the worker protection element'. It added: 'We will now be fighting hard to ensure our members are protected against exploitation, and critically, get double-time payments for working on Sunday.' The Consumers' Association said it was 'partially pleased' with the vote, as it had supported total deregulation. Mr Derek Prentice, assistant director, predicted that parliament would have to return to the issue in a few years' time 'when people realise that total deregulation is really the only complete answer'. The vote was a bitter disappointment for those who had campaigned to limit Sunday opening, warning that even partial deregulation would destroy the unique character of Sundays. Mr Michael Schluter, director of the Keep Sunday Special Campaign, said MPs had been victims of 'a huge deception', as the provisions on worker protection in the bill were inadequate and unworkable. The campaign would be 'exploring all the avenues we can use to lessen the impact of the bill on the most vulnerable sectors of society', including shopworkers, small shopkeepers, and those on low incomes living near city centres. Marks and Spencer, one of the UK's leading retailers and the driving force behind Retailers for Shops Act Reform, which joined forces with the Keep Sunday Special Campaign to support limited opening, said it could 'now get to work knowing there is a solution, even though it is not the one we favoured'. The clothing and food chain said it would now be forced to open some stores on Sundays to avoid losing market share, but would wait for the bill to receive royal assent next year.</p>

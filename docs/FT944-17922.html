			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / World Trade News: China vows to defy US on Gatt entry terms China will not drop its demand that it be readmitted to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a developing country, in spite of US pressure for it to be classified as a developed nation, a senior Chinese official said yesterday. Mr Li Lanqing, a vice-premier responsible for trade, said it would be 'ignorant and absurd' for China to be regarded as a developed country for the purposes of Gatt entry. 'If we assume the duties of a developed country, why would we want to rejoin Gatt?' he asked. His remarks reflect China's determination to preserve its developing country status in international institutions, thereby protecting benefits such as concessionary finance and other privileges. Mr Li, a former foreign trade minister, said China's growing status as a trading nation demanded that it be a founder member of the World Trade Organisation, the successor body to Gatt: 'We are now the world's 11th largest trader. . . Is it possible that the WTO would not include the 11th largest trading nation? Can it be representative otherwise?' 'If they don't let us rejoin the Gatt, China will manage. . . I just don't believe that the world can exclude China. It serves nobody's interests.' Beijing has reduced tariffs on many categories of imports, and has also dismantled a wide range of non-tariff barriers, but western nations led by the US are demanding further liberalisation of agricultural markets and progress in opening up the services sector. Chinese officials complain frequently about 'unreasonable' US demands, but negotiations are said to be making progress, although it is not clear whether they can be concluded in time for China to become a founder member of the WTO next year. In Geneva, intensive talks are trying to wrap up the terms of entry to Gatt and WTO this year. Trade officials say Gatt's working party on Chinese membership will meet as soon as there appears to be the basis of a consensus on the accession protocol and clear progress in parallel talks on improving access to the Chinese market for imports of goods and services. Nearly 25 countries and the EU have been negotiating with China over the past month. However, the most critical talks are those with the US, which has taken the toughest stance in requiring Beijing to comply with Gatt/WTO rules from the outset. China, a founder member, applied to rejoin Gatt in 1986 after pulling out in 1950 following the communist takeover. Membership negotiations began in 1987 but were repeatedly delayed by political and trade rows with Washington. Reuter adds: US House of Representatives majority whip David Bonior said yesterday the House planned to delay a final vote on sweeping Gatt legislation until December, when the Senate is set to vote.</p>

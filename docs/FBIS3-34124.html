The cable says: To the dear comrades, you know these  national occasions, in the book of national strugglers and  revolutionaries of national liberation, provide a good  opportunity for assessment of past achievements in their  struggle.    This anniversary comes amid very complicated and difficult  circumstances brought about by international, regional, Arab,  and national developments fraught with dangers that target all  of us, Arabs and Muslims. The results of these developments and  the way we respond to them will determine the fate of our  people's cause, their rights, and national existence, as well as  the fate of the rights of Arabs and Muslims, their present,  future, and national, regional, and human role.    The cable adds: Historic responsibility entails missions to  be performed by all Arab and Islamic forces that are committed  to the defense of inalienable, historic rights and that are  aware of the comprehensive visible dangers. The purpose of this  is to foil plans to recognize the Zionist enemy and normalize  relations with it, support Palestinian national steadfastness in  the face of the conspiracy, and emphasize the Arab and Islamic  dimension of the cause and the conflict. We think that our  present situation and national performance play a major role in  the nation's awakening to assume its responsibilities.</p>

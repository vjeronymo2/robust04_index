			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Ministers break off talks on Nafta's supplementary pacts MINISTERS from the US, Canada and Mexico yesterday suddenly broke off 10 days of talks on side agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement in Washington. They left strong doubts that they can complete a deal in time to implement the pact on schedule next January. The ministers stated there was 'a handful of remaining issues. Officials will continue to work this week in order to address these issues.' Who those officials are remained a mystery. Mr Rufus Yerxa, US deputy trade representative, was seen leaving for vacation in a van with his family. Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, let it be known that he plans to leave for his vacation on Friday. Mr Thomas Hockin, Canada's trade minister, was to leave yesterday for a cabinet meeting in Ottawa. Officials of Canada, the US and Mexico denied that the latter two countries were negotiating separate deals in the talks over environment, labour, import surges and financing of a US-Mexico border clean-up. Canada has been a firm opponent of a US proposal to create a strong enforcement mechanism if any of the three governments were to fail to enforce its labour or environmental laws. Mexico has backed a proposal to use the levying of fines for enforcement, but this has been blocked by Democrats in the US Congress. At the very least, the US and Mexico are expected to agree to some combination of fines and tariff 'snapbacks' in the event of 'persistent, systematic and unjustifiable' non-enforcement of environmental laws. In Congress, there is much concern that fighting over Nafta has 'turned intensely ugly.' US corporations, hostile to labour and environmental enforcement, are believed to be supplying Mexico with proposals to bring to the bargaining. Ms Lori Wallach, a lawyer of Public Citizen, a citizens' group opposed to Nafta, predicted there would be 'teeth' in the final agreement over sanctions to enforce labour and environment agreements, as the Clinton administration has often promised, but teeth at the end of 'a long, twisted, tortuous' process of dispute settlement. Mr Kantor has made little progress in satisfying Ms Wallach and other opponents of the pact. Disputes between the US and Mexico over the environment can drag on for years, critics say, because there are no precise deadlines for investigations and settlement, unlike commercial disputes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by station </F> editor David Stahlavsky; place and date not given -- live or  recorded]    [Excerpts] [Stahlavsky] [passage omitted] Regarding our  relations with Russia. You have met Andrey Vavilov, first deputy  finance minister of the Russian Federation. How happy are you  with the attitude of our former big brother to the debt owed to  our small country, particularly as this debt is not negligible,  if we take into consideration the size of our country. Is there  not a danger that by having our debt repaid we will get  ourselves into a new form of dependence on Russia?    [Klaus] Somebody keeps going on about this. I must be really  arrogant, as everybody says, because since 15 May I have  repeatedly said that any sort of dependence on Russia is  completely out of the question. No one would dream of it. I do  not know where this idea has come from. We are simply trying to  get something back for our debts; this is our only aim. We have  no other conditions and Russia does not attach any. I think  this is really a fabrication by some politicians, perhaps Mr.  Daniel Kroupa or someone. [passage omitted]    Russia has enormous debts, and not only to us. Its total  debt is a hundred times bigger than what it owes to the Czech  Republic. It must repay it at some point. We cannot have any  illusions that Russia would repay us earlier than the rest of  the world -- we are not the center of the world. [passage  omitted]</p>

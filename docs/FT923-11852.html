			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Top civil servant forced out after clashes with minister SIR Peter Kemp, the top civil servant who masterminded the introduction of private sector management techniques into the civil service, has been forced to take early retirement after disagreements with Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, it emerged last night. As part of a Whitehall shake-up, Downing Street will today announce that Sir Peter, the permanent secretary who heads the Office of Public Service and Science, is to retire two years before the normal civil service retirement age of 60. Sir Peter first came to prominence as project manager for the Next Steps programme, under which civil service functions are being hived off into arms' length executive agencies. He was appointed to his present job less than three months ago, when his department was set up after the general election to oversee the government's plans to shake up the civil service and push forward the Citizen's Charter. There have been persistent rumours of clashes between Sir Peter, Mr Waldegrave and Sir Peter Levene, the government's efficiency adviser, who is attached to the OPSS. Mr Waldegrave is understood to have told Mr Major that he could no longer work with Sir Peter. In the absence of a suit-able alternative post, early retirement was seen as the only option. Ms Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the Association of First Division Civil Servants, last night described Sir Peter's departure after such disagreements as 'unprecedented'. 'Those who talk about civil servants having a job for life are clearly ignorant of the realities of the modern civil service,' she said.</p>

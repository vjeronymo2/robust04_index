			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIAPER SERVICES ARE ANSWER TO POLLUTION  </P> <P> Your Consumer Affairs column, "Needed: A Disposable/Cloth Diaper Hybrid" (Nov.  16), concluded with the theme that a natural solution is still required. The  proven solution to diaper pollution is offered by a professional diaper  service.  </P> <P> At Dydee Diaper Service in Orange, of which I am president, we use a special  10-step process for laundering soiled diapers that includes several flushings,  sudsings and rinsings using only 88% pure soap. This process generates about 4  1/2 gallons of waste water per child per day, less than the water used in one  average toilet flush, and four times less than the amount of water a parent  would use if they were to flush the solid waste from their disposable diapers  as the package recommends.  </P> <P> As for fuel conservation, Dydee's delivery trucks are powered by clean burning  propane, compared to the fuel used to deliver the trees from the forest (more  than 2 million a year) to produce disposable diapers, to deliver them to retail  stores and to take the soiled disposable diaper to the landfill, plus the  powered machinery used to level the trash there.  </P> <P> To conserve energy, we use special equipment that reclaims heat from our dryers  and waste water.  </P> <P> Disposable diapers create 90 times more solid waste than a reusable cotton  diaper. For every baby in cotton diapers, more than a ton of paper diaper waste  is diverted from landfills. Environmental groups will always recommend a  reusable product over a single-use one.  </P> <P> TIMOTHY J. O'NEIL  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

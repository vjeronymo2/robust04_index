			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> An Associated Press article published Thursday about a change in the U.S.  government's allocation of refugee quotas contained erroneous numbers.  President Reagan has decided to increase the quota for the Soviet Union and  Eastern Europe by 7,000, to 25,000, according to State Department spokesman  Charles Redman. The increase will be achieved by shifting 5,500 slots earmarked  for Vietnamese political prisoners, reducing that quota to 19,500; cutting by  1,000 the quota for refugees seeking admission from camps in Hong Kong,  Thailand or elsewhere in Southeast Asia, and trimming 500 from the quota for  refugees from the Near East and South Asia, mostly Afghanistan.  </P></p>

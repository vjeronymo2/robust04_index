			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Personal View: Japan Inc in need of long-term reform If history is the result of a series of accidents, some, in hindsight, can be clearly seen to mark significant turning points. At first glance, the appointment in early August of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa as Japan's prime minister seems precisely such a turning point. On reflection, however, it is only a deepening of the rot in which Japanese politics - and the Japanese economy - have long been mired. Mr Hosokawa comes from the country's fifth largest political party, The Japan New Party, which secured only 35 of the 511 seats in the Diet's Lower House; the Liberal Democratic party is still, by far, the largest single grouping in the Diet. Even within Mr Hosokawa's coalition government, the Socialists, with 70 seats, dominate. Mr Hosokawa was chosen as prime minister by this coalition because he was thought to be, in the eyes of the public, the least of the evils and the safest protection against a revengeful LDP. If a small group of just 33 members fled the coalition, the LDP might well regain control. Most coalition members are already nervous about the next election, given the fact that each of the coalition parties had to suppress its ideological claims in order to form the alliance in the first place. Equally revealing, all the coalition parties have now declared that they will continue to support and apply the politics long advocated by the LDP. As a result, Japan Inc. marches on - unreformed. Thus, the new government cannot - and will not - be able to discuss any serious policy matters for fear of losing its control, temper or harmony (though it has embarked on some reforms to deregulate the economy). So the government will concentrate on reforming the electoral system from its traditional wide area, multi-seat approach to a narrow area, single-seat system. However, once these 300 new electoral districts are agreed, coalition members will begin fighting among themselves for the nominations. In such an environment, serious attention to changing Japan from a producer- to a consumer-oriented society is impossible. There will be no help from Mr Irhiro Ozawa, shadow 'Shogun' of the Shinseito party, whose near 30 years as an LDP politician makes the creation of a new conservative party, with the same structure as the LDP, his easiest and most logical choice. After all, it was he who perfected in the old days Japan's 'iron triangle' of political-bureaucratic-industrial collusion. The fragility of the government, coupled with the strong pull of the entrenched 'iron triangle', is deeply unfortunate. Together, they produce paralysis - and at a time of unprecedented economic slowdown. Although macro indicators suggest positive signs - export surplus at an all-time high of Dollars 150bn; personal deposits and savings at the staggering level of Dollars 500 trillion - the economic gloom persists. Average consumer households already have two TVs and 1.5 cars. They will not buy any more. Nor is there space in their small homes to put additional refrigerators or stereos. Less visible but no less troublesome, most Japanese corporations earning export dollars are actually losing money. They export at a loss because the rigidities of an inflexible employment system mean they cannot adjust their annual business plans. What is counted in national statistics as an export surplus is nothing but an accumulation of money-losing business, especially at Y105 to the dollar or less. The right exchange rate for the yen, as determined by purchasing power, would be about Y180 to the dollar. The current rate is often seen in Japan as punishment by the international community for Tokyo's trade policies (the Japanese government finds it extremely difficult to regulate the currency market as it regulates other markets). The best - perhaps only - way to boost the economy is to invest in housing on a large scale, tapping the huge well of private savings. Average Japanese households comprise 80 square metres of floor space, compared with 100 sq m in the three largest European economies. Given the availability of land and high-speed commuter trains, there is no reason why housing should be so expensive. The ideal remedy is to remove the regulations and lighten the taxes that discourage improvement of housing. Larger houses will, in turn, create consumer demand. Improving the life style of Japanese people will not only boost the economy, but also normalise the exchange rate. Such a move would balance the trade statistics and make the Japanese market more accessible to other nations. In short, creating a good life for Japanese people is in everyone's interest - except the power brokers of the new political system and the remnants of the 'iron triangle' who look, instead, only for the short-term economic 'fixes'. Japan must shift to a genuine free-market economy. Initially, this would certainly lead to a plunge in property values and stock markets. These 'real' prices may also bankrupt over-extended financial institutions and bust the 'bubble' players. But such a move would attract responsible investors and consumers, with their huge savings, back into the market. The practical question is whether a weak new government can tell a powerful 'iron triangle' to keep its hands off. If it will not, or cannot, the good life will remain a mirage and the rest of the world will remain frustrated with our markets and our currency.

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Survey of Fraud - Prevention and Detection (4): Exploiting the EU loopholes - The incidence of false accounting in the European Union Something is rotten in the rapidly evolving mega-state of Europe. The stale odour of systematic fraud is persistently leaking from investigations of the European Union's financial arrangements, but so far there has been little concrete remedial action. Expert opinion is that up to 10 per cent of the EU's budget of Ecu70bn (Dollars 87bn) a year is diverted to the wrong recipients either through fraud or improper exploitation of financial loopholes. The exact figure is impossible to calculate because most fraud is undetected. However, Lord Hunt of Tamworth, a former top-ranking UK civil servant who served as cabinet secretary and who is chairman of the House of Lords' European communities committee, does not dispute the 10 per cent figure. In July, Lord Hunt's committee issued a damning report on EU fraud which said: 'We have increasingly come to the conclusion that most fraud in the EU happens because the administrative procedures and financial controls are not lucidly defined by community legislation, and because the procedures and controls (in member states) are defective. There is no central responsibility in the European Commission for ensuring that new regulations and schemes are foolproof and this is far from being the prime consideration in the policy-making directorates (of the commission).' Most fraud involving EU spending follows directly from the extreme complexity of the rules for channelling money from Brussels to member states for projects such as infrastructure programmes or supporting food prices. This makes it relatively easy for fraudsters - who can range from highly organised criminal gangs to opportunist individuals taking occasional advantage of an EU loophole - to make a financial gain. This can happen, for example, through a farmer applying for an extra subsidy on, say, a cotton shipment simply by filling in a form saying he has grown 10 per cent more than he really has. Behind many of the frauds discovered over the past few years have been such cases of falsified documentation, sometimes created with the connivance of government officials in the state where the act is taking place. Indeed, a factor which may help the fraudster is that often the country where he or she is operating may see no particular advantage in combating the fraud. The government involved may be willing to turn a Nelsonian eye to evidence of what is taking place on the grounds that the cash from Brussels is boosting the local economy whether or not it is being spent according to the letter of EU rules. At the level of the European Commission itself, officials operate within a culture where it is the spending of money that is all important, not the monitoring of the extent to which the spending achieves agreed objectives. Operating along these lines, Brussels officials frequently become embarrassed when the subject of fraud crops up. In many ways they are as reluctant as are some member governments to discuss the incidence of fraud and how to tackle it. This is because raising the subject may irritate the member government where the alleged fraud is taking place and may be seen to be against the co-operative spirit driving the union. Italy is one of the focal points of fraud investigations. Italian prosecutors recently alleged that Filippo Galli, the head of the state organisation overseeing EU agriculture subsidies, took bribes from a big grain trader to ignore evidence of massive corruption. In one instance documented by Uclaf, the European Commission's anti-fraud unit, traders claimed a subsidy of Ecu76m (Dollars 94m) for a large shipment of wheat which supposedly was kept in intervention storage in a government warehouse but which inquiries indicated did not exist. In another recent case, sugar traders in Belgium are thought to have gained about Ecu6m in extra subsidies by claiming to have transferred a large quantity of this commodity out of the EU to states in the former Soviet Union, so qualifying for an export refund, whereas the sugar was really sold at high prices in Spain. What is being done about EU fraud? Several moves are afoot, though the effect of these actions may turn out to be fairly slight. Uclaf, which has a new director, Per Brix Knudsen, an energetic and outspoken Danish customs officer, is doubling its staff to 100 by the end of the year and promises to be more diligent in detecting fraud cases and bringing miscreants to justice through co-operation with national authorities. Second, the EU's agricultural aid programme, which accounts for half the total EU spending and is thought to account for the lion's share of fraud, is being radically changed to cut down on subsidies overall and to change the direction of subsidies towards farmers rather than traders and processing companies where opportunities for false accounting are greatest. Third, the Luxembourg-based Court of Auditors, the EU's financial watchdog, is becoming more eager to highlight cases of fraud or improper action. However, most of its deliberations and actions are kept secret. The court also lacks the self-confidence to take the initiative on big cases of fraud or financial mismanagement, and as a result its power to influence the broad picture on fraud is limited. It seems that the efforts to improve the EU's far from impressive record on combating fraud can only really come from the centre, via the commissioners installed in Brussels by the member governments. Much will therefore depend on how the new crop of commissioners, easing into their positions over the next few months, approach a subject which is certain to command an increasing amount of attention from outside pressure groups and from taxpayers concerned that their cash is being misspent.</p>

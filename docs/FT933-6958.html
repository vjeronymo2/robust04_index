			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Hongkong Bank tightens lending HONGKONG and Shanghai Bank and its subsidiary Hang Seng Bank have tightened their mortgage lending policy, following the release of government figures showing the fastest monthly growth in mortgage loans since late 1991. However, the moves have been seen as largely cosmetic, and unlikely to hold back a property market which withstood the introduction of a 70 per cent ceiling on mortgage lending for new properties in November 1991. The two HSBC group companies yesterday announced guidelines primarily aimed at curbing property speculation. These included an increased penalty for mortgage repayment within 12 months of a property purchase, and an end to loans against properties more than six months before they are ready for occupation. Luxury property prices are estimated to have risen by more than 20 per cent during 1993, and there has been a significant increase in the level of sales. This has been boosted by an enormous influx of capital from mainland China, where investors have been looking for a hedge against the weakening yuan. According to the Hong Kong government's monetary authority, total outstanding mortgage lending increased by 2.2 per cent during July, compared with an average of 1.1 per cent for the previous year. It expects a further increase during August. The authority's deputy chief executive, Mr David Carse, yesterday encouraged the colony's banks to review lending criteria, in the light of the latest statistics. Since mortgage lending is arguably the most profitable part of their loan portfolios, the banks will be anxious to see the property market stabilise rather than actually fall. Hongkong Bank said it would take a flexible approach to the new policy.</p>

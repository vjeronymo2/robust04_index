			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> MONTOYA LAWYERS MINIMIZE CHARGES  </P> <P> Attorneys for state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya sought to minimize the significance  of a superseding indictment filed against the Whittier Democrat, saying it  simply corrected "defects" in the original 10 charges filed against him. In a  brief statement, the law firm of Kelton &amp; Artan maintained that the revised  indictment "appears to do no more than correct errors contained in the original  indictment." The new indictment filed in Sacramento Federal Court by U.S. Atty.  David F. Levi adds two counts of bribery against Montoya based on allegations  already included in the original indictment. At the same time, one bribery  allegation that initially had been cited in a sweeping charge of racketeering  was dropped because it used an inappropriate section of the penal code that  applies to executive branch officials. Lawyers on both sides of the case said  the revised indictment does not substantially affect the case against Montoya.  </P></p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Concentric rises to Pounds 4.76m - Competitiveness increased by programme of running investment Concentric, the Midlands-based engineering group which makes a range of products including satellite dishes and valves, pushed up first half profits by nearly 10 per cent and reported 'an encouraging start' to the second six months. In the half year to end-March, pre-tax profits were Pounds 4.76m, compared with Pounds 4.35m in the same period of 1992-93. Earnings per share edged ahead, from 5.63p to 5.89p. The interim dividend is raised 5 per cent, from 1.77p to 1.86p. Total payments for 1992-93 were 5.86p. Sales during the first half climbed from Pounds 60.7m to Pounds 64.7m, and the group managed to widen its margins slightly. Mr Tony Firth, chairman, ruled out the possibility of price increases in the present commercial environment: 'Prices at the moment are going down,' he said. The increase in sales and profits follows a programme of running investment  -about Pounds 8m last year and the same again this time - which has increased competitiveness. 'We're running round the world and trying to capture market share,' said Mr Firth. The group sells about 60 per cent of its output to the automotive sector and 30 per cent of its production is directly exported from the UK. Although Concentric is still finding that demand is sluggish where its products, like control instrumentation, are part of a customer's capital expenditure, it is facing rising demand from original equipment manufacturers in the automotive and white goods sectors: 'Inquiry levels from potential customers are at an all-time high,' according to Mr Firth. COMMENT Concentric's pressure on its own costs and its willingness to invest, both in and out of recession, are starting to show through in the figures. Its future stream of profits is assured, but growth is likely to be steady rather than exciting without a pick-up on the markets. Certainly it could quickly absorb extra business; overall the group is working at about 80 per cent of capacity. If the encouraging level of inquiries translate into scheduled business, then there will be a quick effect on the bottom line. With market conditions improving, the estimate by the group's brokers of full year pre-tax profits at about Pounds 11m looks realistic. That would mean earnings per share of 13.5p, putting the shares at yesterday's price of 241p on a modestly valued prospective multiple of 17.8.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Arts: European Community Youth Orchestra The main theme of Sunday's concert at the Royal Festival Hall was youth. The event was being given in aid of the Keyboard Charitable Trust for Young Professional Performers and the organisers had ingeniously brought together the European Community Youth Orchestra with both a youthful soloist and a still young conductor, at least for the second half. Yevgeny Kissin announced his energy, boldness, youthful super-confidence from the first notes that he played. One rarely hears the opening flourishes of Beethoven's 'Emperor' Piano Concerto so bright and forward. The whole performance was dominated by Kissin, even when the piano part had relatively unimportant material, because his playing was consistently up-front, demanding to be heard before anything else that was going on. By chance I had not caught this concerto live for a while and one of the last performers was Claudio Arrau, then well into his 80s. It is easy to generalise, but these two performances really were at the opposite extremes  -Arrau thoughtful and mellow, glowing with maturity, Kissin all unabashed power and brilliance. The note-by-note clarity of his scales was dazzling; his attack was metallic and forceful. Played like this, Beethoven can easily start to sound relentlessly triumphal, the 'Emperor' Concerto more than most. The saving grace on this occasion was the effervescence with which the conception was carried through. At one point in the finale, as Claudio Abbado visibly galvanised his orchestra into matching the pianist's exuberance, Kissin let a smile pass across his face - silent recognition that his verve had won through. After the interval Abbado passed the baton to Mark Wigglesworth for Shostakovich's Tenth Symphony. This is the sort of piece in which young players can shine. The virtuosity demanded by Shostakovich is of unanimity, of fearless attack, of bold colours, and in those categories the ECYO musicians are pretty impressive. It is remarkable what a difference it makes when every member of an orchestra is giving his or her all, right to the back desk of the violas. At the risk of pushing the evening's leitmotif too far, it is possible to say that Wigglesworth also has a young man's view of the symphony. The first big climax impatiently arrived too early; later outbursts sometimes ignited spontaneously, rather than coming as the logical end of Shostakovich's long, slow fuse. But the performance had energy and character. It was exciting in the right, youthful way.</p>

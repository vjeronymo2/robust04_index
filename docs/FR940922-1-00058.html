			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA recognizes that the states have authority to adopt whatever measures they choose beyond those mandated in the Act in order to achieve the necessary emissions reductions. EPA is therefore also proposing that it would retain authority in issuing the SIP call to change its necessary determination and withdraw its SIP call for those states that adopt controls, including those applicable to stationary and mobile sources, sufficient to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Legal Basis To Provide for Possibility of Alternative Standards Program in SIP Call <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While EPA believes that the emissions reductions that the OTC LEV program would achieve are necessary, the Agency recognizes that another program to achieve equivalent reductions from the same emissions sources could render the OTC LEV program unnecessary. But at this juncture the Clean Air Act precludes EPA from mandating another program modifying the Tier 1 controls on new light-duty vehicles to achieve further emission reductions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 74 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The OTC's recommendation specifically included in its recitation clauses the OTC's expectation that EPA would evaluate alternatives comparable to the OTC LEV program, ``including the program presented by the automobile manufacturers with enhancements.'' Especially in light of this statement, EPA believes it is appropriate to leave open the possibility that an environmentally equivalent alternative to OTC LEV that is mutually acceptable to the states and automakers could be developed that would eliminate any need for the states to apply the OTC LEV standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 74 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 209 of the Act preempts states (other than California) from establishing new motor vehicle emissions standards, leaving such regulation to EPA under title II of the Act. See EPA's earlier notices regarding OTC LEV, 59 FR at 21734 (April 26, 1994); 59 FR at 12915 (March 18, 1994). Of course, section 177 of the Act provides an exception whereby the OTC states could adopt standards that are identical to California's standards if certain conditions are satisfied. It is this exception that the OTC has relied upon in recommending that EPA require the states to adopt LEV standards identical to those California adopted in its LEV program. But the states in the OTR cannot establish alternative new motor vehicle emissions standards different from but equivalent to California's standards. Likewise, Congress explicitly provided that EPA may not modify the ``Tier 1'' auto emissions standards specified in subsections 202 (a)(3)(B)(ii), (g), (h), and (i) prior to model year 2004, and thus cannot mandate an alternative that would achieve equivalent reductions. See 59 FR at 21730 (April 26, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that it is legally appropriate for it to specify in its SIP call that the consummation of an alternative federal program that achieves equivalent environmental benefits could alter the Agency's conclusion regarding necessity. Thus, the Agency believes it may specify criteria in this regard that, if satisfied, will terminate the states' obligations under the SIP call to apply the LEV standards to manufacturers subject to an equivalent alternative program. At the same time, EPA does not believe there is any reason to wait to determine whether the alternative federal program will be consummated before issuing the SIP call based on the finding that the OTC LEV program is necessary. EPA believes that additional new-vehicle tailpipe emission reductions achievable by the OTC LEV program are necessary. EPA cannot now assume, based on merely the prospect of an alternative federal program and permanent opt-in by all auto manufacturers, that OTC LEV will become unnecessary. Moreover, as explained earlier, EPA believes it is important to act now for several reasons, including the statutory deadline under section 184, the statutory requirement that the states provide two years of lead-time before they can apply standards under section 177 and the length of time it takes for the fleet to turn over. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes it may issue a SIP call that would require that states submit SIP revisions to include the OTC LEV program, but that would allow the states to accept compliance with an equivalent alternative program instead. Under this option, as discussed above, the states' obligation to submit the OTC LEV program SIP revision would not terminate upon the automakers' opt-in to an alternative standards program. This would be necessary, for example, if EPA structured the alternative program such that the automakers could opt out of it. Indeed, the automakers might insist that they retain such an ``escape'' in case any state exercised its continuing authority under section 177 to adopt California standards not consistent with the alternative federal program. Under this structure, the promulgation of the alternative program would not guarantee that the OTC LEV program would not be necessary, even if all automakers were to opt in initially. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rather, EPA believes it might appropriately conclude that, as to any particular automaker that opts in and complies with the alternative program for any period of time, the OTC LEV program would not be necessary for that automaker for that time. Thus, EPA believes it might find the OTC LEV program necessary but allow states to withhold implementation of the OTC LEV standards for automakers that opt into the alternative program for as long as they remain in that program. EPA believes this approach, too, fits squarely within its authority under sections 184(c) and 110(k)(5). That is, just as EPA believes it may take account of the possibility that an equivalent alternative program could render OTC LEV no longer necessary, an equivalent alternative program could render OTC LEV unnecessary for particular manufacturers only for as long as they are bound by that program. EPA believes it may fashion its approach to take account of this, so that the states must revise their SIPs to include the necessary OTC LEV program, but need only apply it to those parties for whom and when it is ``necessary'' in light of those parties' choices. In sum, under section 110(k)(5), EPA believes it may require that states revise their SIPs as necessary to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D), but may allow states to account in such SIP revisions for circumstances where application of the standards may not be necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

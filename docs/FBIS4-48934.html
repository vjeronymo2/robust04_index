			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "State Is To Consolidate Carmaking </F> Industry"]    [Text] China expects to consolidate its more than 120  automotive plants into three or four giants that would enable  the car industry to make 5 million vehicles annually.    The giants, each to annually make at least 1 million  low-priced quality cars with clean-burning engines, are to be  competitive internationally.    In an interview with BUSINESS WEEKLY, a senior official from  the Ministry of Machinery Industry elaborated on the industry's  long- range programme.    This goal of consolidation is the core of the new policies  that are to govern the country's auto industry for the next  seven years, the official said. The policies are to be  announced before long.    By the year 2000, six to seven conglomerates are expected to  be formed from the 13 existing auto groups. Each is expected to  make 300,000 sedans a year.    In the early decades of the next century, the conglomerates  are to be further reshuffled into three or four larger ones.    The official, who declined to be identified, said that the  reorganization will take place in competitive conditions under a  market economy, but that macroeconomic planning by the central  government will be beefed up to ensure the industry develops in  the direction set by the new policies.    The industry, expected to grow into an economic pillar, will  not repeat development formulas used in some Western nations  where auto giants achieved dominance after nearly 100 years of  intense competition among hundreds of carmakers.    He said the 13 existing auto groups, whose size makes them  ripe for further development, will be supported by the central  government.    He cited eight major carmakers in particular: the  Changchun-based First Automotive Works; the Shiyan-based  Dongfeng Group; the Nanjing Automotive Industry Corp; the China  National Heavy-duty Truck Corp; and manufacturers in Beijing,  Tianjin, Shanghai and Shenyang.    The auto groups will be granted preference in financing,  taxation and the issuing of securities.    For the next two or three years, no new assembly projects  will be allowed, but the official did not rule out the  possibility that foreign investment in assembling cars will be  permitted in later years.    "We advocate different policies in different phases," he  said.    Moderate protection of the domestic market from assaults by  floods of Western imports is necessary. Periods of protection  by way of tariffs, import quotas and licenses and other means  will be different for different vehicles, he said.    The protection of the market for trucks needs to span three  to five years but for sedans, 10 years, he said.    Such protection, which is used by nearly every nation, is  needed by China's fledgling auto industry, especially sedan  manufacturers, who turned out 240,000 cars last year. However,  he said the protection will be weakened gradually as the  industry grows stronger.    "So large a market as China's will be vulnerable to free  imports of cars," he said.    The government will pay great attention to improving vehicle  safety, reducing auto pollution and raising fuel efficiency, the  official said.    However, he said the country will probably lag behind  Western  nations, where extremely stiff standards are to take effect  around 1996.    To reduce vehicle emissions and develop fuel-saving engines,  China will beef up investment and draw up new laws and  regulations.    China has participated in international activities related  to  vehicle emissions and fuel consumption and expects co-operation  with foreigners will continue.    It expects to become integrated into the global auto market  with a relatively independent, competitive industry in the early  decades of the next century, the official said.</p>

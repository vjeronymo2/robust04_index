			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Textiles aid sparks anger The British Textile Confederation yesterday reacted angrily to the European Commission's approval of Pounds 61m of state aid for a Northern Ireland textiles plant, saying the industry was already suffering from overcapacity. 'There is just no market for the 30 to 40 per cent increase in British capacity that the new factory would bring,' said BTC's director-general, Mr John Wilson. Under-utilisation was running at about 20 per cent in the European textile industry, he said. The Pounds 157m Belfast factory for Hualon of Taiwan is the largest project ever handled by Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board and would employ 2,000 workers to produce about 23,000 tonnes, of polyester-cotton fabric a year. The IDB yesterday welcomed the commission's decision and said it was optimistic that the project would proceed, although contracts had not yet been signed. Hualon is one of the Far East's leading textile manufacturers, with sales of Pounds 500m in 1992. Much of the output from the Belfast factory would be for downmarket garments, about 40 per cent of which are currently imported into Europe. The company argues that with many European producers having abandoned this market to switch to higher-quality products, the new factory would be substituting imports rather than displacing European producers. However, the BTC says there is 'no proof whatsoever' that Hualon will limit itself to low-cost products. 'The investment is vast and they are going to have to find a huge market for such gigantic volumes,' said Mr Wilson. He also disputed the number of jobs that will be created. 'Up to 2,000 jobs in an area of high unemployment is certainly a compelling case,' he said. 'But there has been no explanation of where these jobs will come from. We find Hualon's figures startling in that the factory will be highly capital intensive.'</p>

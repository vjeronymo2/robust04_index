			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: It pays to be choosy - Investment Trusts at least, nearly everyone says they are - but which one should you choose? Our series* on the sector, which ended last week, profiled some of the leading names. The rationale was that while many articles have been written about investment trusts in general, far fewer have described the activities of individual trusts. Looking at the press clippings, it was surprising to find how limited was the coverage of many trusts with market capitalisations of several hundred million pounds. Some had not been the subject of an extended article for five years. The trusts themselves do not make it very easy for the beginner investor. Many have names which reflect their 19th century roots - such as Scottish Mortgage - and which bear little relation to their present areas of investment. The more information an investor can be given, the better. The Association of Investment Trust Companies has done a good job in this respect in recent years (and it was sad to note the death this week of Philip Chappell, one of the main driving forces behind the AITC). Some individual management groups have also produced very clear guides to their trusts. In all, the series covered 17 trusts, ranging from the largest, Foreign &amp; Colonial, to Pantheon International with a market capitalisation of just over Pounds 21m. And, having met such a wide range of managers, my over-riding impression was that they offer a highly professional service at a relatively low cost. To take the extreme: investors in the Alliance trust can hire the expertise of those who run it for a fee of just 0.2 per cent of the total assets. Fees can, of course, be higher than that in the specialist sector; nevertheless, most trusts represent a very cheap way for investor to get a spread of equities, especially via the savings scheme. Performance, of course, is more important than charges in the long run (although the latter can have a significant impact on the former). Looking at the table, the range of returns over five years varied from Bankers, with a gain of 148.9 per cent, to Throgmorton, with a loss of 4.9 per cent. But even investors most wedded to the building societies can see that many investment trusts have offered returns far higher than those available on the most attractive 90-day account. There is nothing to say that in the next five years results will be similar, or, indeed, that Throgmorton might not outperform Bankers. Part of the return from some of the trusts in the table comes from a narrowing of the discount on which the shares have traded. Since many trusts' shares are now trading at asset value (or even at premiums), such a factor cannot be repeated. Discounts could widen once more. Looking back over the range of trusts covered in the series, I would select a few for particular consideration by investors. Foreign &amp; Colonial and the Alliance trusts are old-established, well-managed companies with low costs and excellent records. Bankers has an even better record in recent years and a manager, Michael Moule, who has proved his skill at several different trusts. For those willing to take extra risk, the venture capital trusts covered (Electra and Pantheon) may prosper from a combination of economic recovery and a narrowing of the discounts. Two trusts, Fleming Claverhouse and TR City of London, would be worth considering if their shares were not trading at a premium to net assets. It makes little sense to pay 105p for assets of 100p when shares in other well-managed trusts are available at a discount. But Fleming Claverhouse launched a share issue this week, which could reduce this problem. Plenty of good trusts were not covered in the series, and a stockbroker or good independent adviser should be able to guide you through the maze. For those who like to do their own research, trusts marked with the 'ace of clubs' sign on the FT's London Share Service pages will provide free annual reports by ringing 081-643-7181. Callers will need to state the code number which appears every day at the end of the FT's share listings. *For back copies, call 071-873-3324. Copies cost from 65p plus postage to Pounds 1 plus postage, depending on issue.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INVESTMENT TRUST SERIES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Publ    Market*  Nav per  Share  Yield  Perform- Trust                 date     Cap*     share   price   (%)     ance**                              (Pounds      (p)    (p)                                 m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TR City of London    Jan 16    256.2    130.1    134   4.4    136.8 Lowland              Jan 23     58.2    250.8    250   4.2     93.1 Edinburgh            Jan 30    781.5    296.6    266   4.0    107.5 Foreign &amp; Colonial   Feb 6   1,166.0    237.0    222   1.9    131.4 Alliance             Feb 13    817.5  1,784.6  1,622   3.5    140.5 Second Alliance      Feb 13    272.7  1,602.5  1,420   3.2    135.0 Fleming Claverhouse  Feb 20     82.4    188.9    199   3.4     85.6 Electra              Feb 27    377.1    324.1    218   3.8     24.8 Scottish Mortgage    Mar 6     683.5    218.6  189.5   2.7    113.2 Scot Am (SAINTS)     Mar 13    308.6    160.6    138   4.0     97.1 Govett Strategic     Mar 27    233.7    270.8    238   3.5     22.8 Anglo &amp; Overseas     Apr 3     390.6    418.0    342   2.5     89.4 Throgmorton          Apr 10    184.8     75.4   65.5   4.4     -4.9 Pantheon Int'l       Apr 17     20.6    177.7    141   2.2    133.2 Secs Trust of Scot   Apr 24    260.2     83.7     80   5.1     99.9 Bankers              May 1     230.8    154.6    149   2.9    148.9 Merchants            May 8     243.4    240.6    238   5.6    109.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Figures for Mkt Cap, nav per share, share price and yield taken from May 11.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Bardin: "Property of Russia in the FRG: </F> Germany Will Not Increase Our Wealth"]    [Text]    [Begin boxed item]  <H5>  Metamorphosis of Organs of Supervision over Russian Property </H5> in Germany    --State economic commission under the president of the USSR  (1990)    --Commission under the president of the USSR on questions of  withdrawing Soviet troops from Germany (1991)    --Commission under the Government of the Russian Federation  (May-November 1992), within whose scope in August 1992 the  currently existing apparatus of representatives of  Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for Management of State  Property] was established.    --Federal service under the president of the Russian  Federation, placed under the jurisdiction of Vice President  Aleksandr Rutskoy (established on 1 March 1993 and dissolved on  28 June 1993)    [End boxed item]    The government decree "On State Property of the Russian  Federation in the FRG," which was put into official distribution  yesterday, assigns to Goskomimushchestvo the right to manage all  Russian real estate in Germany, except that which is under the  operational jurisdiction of "Russian ministry establishments  abroad." The latest attempt to regulate the relations of Russian  departments associated with property abroad was undertaken when  what is most valuable for Russia in Germany--the legacy of the  Western Group of Troops--is already being turned over to German  authorities; moreover, free of charge.    There is nothing new in the text of the decree. Its central  point is this: Decisions on the sale, assignment as security,  placement in authorized capital, or removal of Russian property  in the FRG are made by the Government of Russia on the  representation of the State Committee for Management of State  Property, and in no other way.    The former Union property in Germany will be transferred yet  again to the management of Russia's State Committee for  Management of State Property, although Ukraine continues to  demand a foreign share that is due it. While the Ukrainian  reasoning may not be clear, the fact that the decree does not  mention the Western Group of Troops requires comment. There is a  presidential edict--"On Procedure for Selling Military Property  Being Released" of 30 November 1992--according to which military  property is sold by the Ministry of Defense, while the functions  of control are reserved for the State Committee for Management  of State Property. On the other hand, on 16 December 1992, Boris  Yeltsin and FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared jointly that  real estate of the Western Group of Troops will be transferred  to the German authorities without compensation. Thus, the train  has already left (it is worth mentioning that the not unknown  Dmitriy Yakubovskiy in his time valued Union military property  in Germany at the lower level of DM12 billion.)    What does the civilian Russian property held in abeyance in  Germany represent? The "apparatus of representatives" of the  State Committee for Management of State Property in Germany, the  weak descendant of the State Economic Mission in Germany under  the president of the USSR, is seeking an answer to this  question. The genealogical tree of the "apparatus of  representatives" is branching out, reflecting the abrupt changes  regarding military property, and has naturally taken on a  political coloration. Some answers have been found. A typical  example--the former House of Soviet Science and Culture has been  transferred by presidential edict to the Federal Information  Center. As is known, on 6 May 1992, Mikhail Poltoranin tried on  behalf of the Russian Government to transfer the building free  of charge to a German company with limited responsibility;  however, the transaction was declared invalid. As a result, the  State Committee for Management of State Property will have to  bear responsibility for the possible commercialization of  Russian real estate that remains in Germany.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Weapons bound for Ulster seized A bid by Ulster loyalists 'preparing for war' in Northern Ireland to boost their arsenal with a shipment of arms and explosives was foiled yesterday. The outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force admitted that the shipment - which included 300 assault rifles and two tonnes of explosives - had been destined for it. The group added that the seizure was a 'logistical setback' but pledged that they would make efforts to find new weaponry. Customs officers, who described the find as the biggest ever arms seizure in Britain, swooped at Teesport, Cleveland, on a container ship from Poland carrying the cache after a tip-off from MI6. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, congratulated British customs and security authorities on the find. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said the operation was a good example of the continuing successes in the fight against terrorist evil by law enforcement agencies in the UK and elsewhere. Mr Peter Robinson, Democratic Unionist Party deputy leader to whose east Belfast constituency the arms were headed, said he thought loyalist paramilitaries were arming themselves in the event of the British and Irish governments doing a deal with the IRA. Mr Seamus Mallon, Social Democratic and Labour party security spokesman and deputy leader, said the seizure was 'clear evidence that loyalist paramilitaries are intent on pursuing their campaign of violence, rather than pursuing a lasting and peaceful settlement'.</p>

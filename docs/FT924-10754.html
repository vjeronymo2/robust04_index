			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: A silk purse for the pig breeders - The creation of a Chinese-European super-sow THE MEISHAN pig from the Lake Taihu region of north-west China looks as if it belongs in a zoo. It has a hide reminiscent of a rhinoceros, a face like a basset-hound with a snout, and eyes that disappear behind ridges of fat. Pig breeders, however, have long admired Meishans for their astonishingly high reproduction rate. A Meishan sow has up to 20 teats, compared with 12 to 14 in a British breed, and regularly delivers 16 piglets. She can also come into puberty in as little as 2 1/2 to 3 months compared with 6 months for a European pig. But when fully grown the Chinese pig is all fat and bone, with little lean meat - hence the Chinese passion for suckling pigs. Now one of the leading UK pig breeding companies has succeeded in capturing the prolificity of the Meishan in a pig with lean meat. Far from being in a zoo, the Meishan is at the centre of a high-tech breeding programme aimed at transforming the productivity and profitability of the pig industry. The National Pig Development Company of Driffield, East Yorkshire, was one of five breeding companies that formed a consortium to import the first Meishans into the UK in 1987. Until then political problems had prevented the Chinese from exporting. The first animals went to the Institute of Animal Physiology and Genetic Research in Edinburgh for research into the genes carrying prolificity. When the numbers were sufficient, animals were released to the five breeders. Mr Stephen Curtis, managing director for production at NPD, believes that his company was the first to breed a commercial hybrid because of its drive over the last 20 years to produce pigs with a high lean meat content. He proudly points out that for eight years the company has come out top in tests conducted by the Meat and Livestock Commission. 'Because we are that much leaner, by systematically crossing our pigs with the Chinese pig we've been able to produce a hybrid with an acceptable carcass that is only slightly fatter than a standard hybrid,' he says. NPD was founded in 1969 by Mr John Curtis, who was anxious for his two sons to be able to earn their living from farming. He decided to concentrate on pigs as he felt poultry were being overproduced and cattle and sheep were too long-term. He remains chairman of the company, which now has an annual turnover of about Pounds 20m, some 250 employees and what he believes are the best computerised records in the industry. 'The pig development industry is only 25 years old - by many standards this is rather new,' says his other son David, who runs the marketing division. 'We are becoming more and more sophisticated.' The pigmen at NPD need to know as much about computers as they do about buckets of swill. Each pig at the company's 24 farms and the thousands of farms it supplies with breeding stock is tattooed with an individual number and has its own computer record. The computer programme stores a complete medical record for 150,000 breeding sows, and knows exactly how productive each animal is. Stephen Curtis believes use of the computer has increased the accuracy of breeding selection by 15 per cent and put the company three to four years ahead of the opposition. The new hybrid, known as the Manor Meishan, was launched in some style at the Cafe Royal in London last May. Next year the company plans to sell 6,000 breeding gilts, worth Pounds 225 each, in the UK. But David Curtis also has ambitious plans for the US market. Last year it signed a franchise agreement with Smithfield-Carroll, a large pork company based in Virginia, which is taking NPD's breeding stock. Every six weeks a jumbo jet carrying 800 pigs flies to the US to build up a breeding stock that is expected to reach 1m sows by the year 2000. However, the Manor Meishan will not be sent to the US until the UK market is satisfied. 'We have always taken the view that you need to be strong at home to give a springboard for work abroad,' says John Curtis. At present NPD claims 20 per cent of the UK gilts market. Eventually some Manor Meishans could even find their way back to their ancestral homeland. Scientists from China's Guizhou Province this summer visited NPD as part of a programme to improve production of pork, which makes up 90 per cent of the meat consumed in the province.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Fernando Lima] </F>   [Excerpts] After the introduction of the Indicative  Prospective Plan, the project of the Decade of Victory Over  Backwardness, the megalomaniac 400,000-hectare project in Niassa  and Cabo Delgado Provinces, when everyone thought the government  had cognizance of the situation, the Mozambican Government has  decided to create a "paradise on earth."    Finance Minister Dr. Eneas Comiche, representing the  Mozambican Government, signed an agreement with the Maharishi  Heaven on Earth Development Corporation BV (Mahedco) [company's  name in English] based in Holland on 6 July 1993.    The agreement was signed one day after President Joaquim  Chissano's departure from Holland where he received in Vlodrop,  Mahedco's headquarters, a Honoris Causa Doctorate Degree from  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the oriental guru who is behind  "paradises on earth" projects. [passage omitted]  <H5>  The Terms of the Agreement </H5>   Terms and Conditions of the Agreement for the Establishment  of an Integrated Project in Mozambique called "Paradise on Earth  Project":    The main aim of this agreement is to promote the  implementation of the project...through the following programs:    1. To improve the quality of life, including health care and  education, as well as significantly improve the per capita  income of Mozambican citizens and the whole country's economic  growth;    2. To optimize the development of agriculture, horticulture,  floriculture, etc., in order to increase foreign exchange  revenue and achieve self-sufficiency in domestic production;    3. To create agricultural and industrial enterprises to  produce different kinds of products, including dairy products  for domestic and foreign markets;    4. To establish industries that would offer high quality  alternative products to replace imports, as well as establish  alternative nonpollutant industries.    5. To establish mining enterprises in the country for  greater  mining production and exploration.    6. To promote integrated agricultural and forest projects in  a responsible manner so as to protect the environment;    7. To develop basic social infrastructure, housing, roads,  schools, hospitals, power supply, communications, cities, and  villages.    8. To develop other areas of mutual interest.    The agreement's preamble refers to the government's duty to  guarantee "quick development without increasing foreign debt and  dependence from abroad" as well as the company's commitment to  obtain financing "avoiding as much as possible using substantial  funds coming from the international financing market in order  not to expose the country to unnecessary economic pressures."  <H5>  The Allocation of Areas and Operation Rights for the Project </H5>   To implement the Paradise on Earth Project...the government  will allocate unutilized land in the Provinces of Niassa, Cabo  Delgado, Tete, Gaza, Inhambane for agriculture, silviculture,  and reforestation. For the continued development of the  project, the company will apply for necessary licenses in  accordance with the specific legislation in force governing  economic activities in Mozambique, particularly the Land and  Mineral Resources Law.    The government grants the company all operation rights for a  period of 50 years, which will be renewable. Relevant  regulations will also apply to all other kinds of activity.  <H5>  General Responsibilities of the Parties </H5>   The company undertakes to organize and supply all "know  how",  train local staff, provide basic social infrastructure and  promotion and export services, as well as all other activities  needed in the project.    The company will organize foreign financing needed to  implement the project. The servicing of the debt used in  financial undertakings of the project will be covered by the  money obtained from the exports and the sale in Mozambique of  products generated by the project.    The company will organize the supply of necessary tractors  and other equipment which does not exist in the country for  agriculture and mining exploration, and technicians specializing  in the building of infrastructure needed for the project.    The company will have the right to contract technicians from  anywhere in the world to develop the project and guarantee the  training of local farmers.    The company is responsible for the implementation of the  project.    The government must guarantee that land is available for the  project as well as all the relevant information required for the  project.    The Center for Investment Promotion (CPI) will make  available  services to facilitate the company's negotiations with the  government.  <H5>  Training, Education, and Health </H5>   All the education and training of people taking part in the  project at all levels will be provided by and in accordance with  the principles and regulations of national and international  institutions under Mahedco. The company will establish in  Mozambique educational institutions at different levels to  educate Mozambicans at all levels, including primary, secondary,  and professional levels.    Within the framework of the national health policy, the  company will implement a system of health care, based on the  traditional system of natural medicine (on the basis of herbs  and medicinal plants), the Maharishi Ayur-Ved system.  <H5>  Incentives </H5>   The government will grant the following rights and  incentives  to the company:     -  all export incentives, as well as the exemption of taxes  on export and import of equipment, imported material for  investment in the project, and raw materials to produce exports.    -  exemption of circulation tax and excise duty for the  equipment  and material imported for investment in the project.    -  reduction by 50 percent of industrial tax (CI) and  supplementary tax, not exceeding 10 years after the beginning of  production in each one of the operations.    -  at the expiry of 10 years, the investments in Niassa, Cabo  Delgado, and Tete will benefit from an additional reduction of  50 percent in industrial tax for a period of six years (Niassa)  and three years (Cabo Delgado and Tete). The investments in  Gaza and Inhambane will benefit from a reduction of 25 percent  in industrial tax for an additional period of two years.    -  costs incurred by the company in the development of  infrastructure in the country will be reduced from taxes to be  paid.    -  costs incurred in the training of Mozambican workers may be  deducted from the amount subject to industrial tax up to a  maximum limit of 5 percent of that taxable amount.    -  capital, loans, and interests will be tax-exempt.    <H5>    Cessation of the Agreement </H5>   If the agreement is terminated by the relevant authorities,  or in case of expropriation, revocation, or suspension, the  company has the right to commercial compensation, as defined by  just market criteria.    The text of the agreement, also signed by Mahedco's  Executive  Director Dr. Jacques Uijen, does not define the investment sum  for the implementation of the Paradise on Earth in Mozambique.  <H5>  A Paradise With 20 Million Hectares </H5>   For a country with 80 million hectares of land, 20 million  hectares signify a quarter of the national territory, simple  arithmetic.    Twenty million hectares is the size of land that Mahedco  intends to explore in Mozambique. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Projects Reconverted </H5>   In the midst of silence and embarrassment from a number of  government officials, the Investment Promotion Center assured  SAVANA that the agreement signed with Mahedco is not being  implemented.    "The project is being renegotiated at present," an official  from the Investment Promotion Center told us. Without providing  details, he said the present philosophy is to impel Mahedco to  support "people with land rights." [passage omitted]</p>

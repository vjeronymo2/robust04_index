			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (20): Structural changes inevitable - Anthony Robinson examines Europe's last bastion of peasant farming POLAND is the last bastion of peasant farming in Europe. Stalin, who cynically recognised that 'imposing communism on Poland is like saddling a cow', accepted that imposing Soviet-style collectivisation was beyond the reach of local communists. After the war, the big estates were seized and broken up. But most of the large state farms were established in the western part of the country, on former German land abandoned in the face of the Red Army's advance and then incorporated into the new People's Republic. Around 75 per cent of the land, split into 2.7m farms, has remained for more than 40 years in the hands of peasant proprietors. But, as a recent World Bank study of Polish agriculture underlines, 'the rural sector, although mostly private, was, and still is, totally dependent on the state and co-operative sectors for the procurement of all inputs and services and for the sale of all production'. Reform of the farming sector fundamentally means abolishing this artificial and distorting relationship which meant that for 40 years farmers despised and mistrusted the state, yet acquired a dangerous dependency upon it. This 'withering away' of the Marxist state is now being tackled with gusto. Dramatic changes are under way with the abolition of consumer subsidies on food, a sharp fall in producer subsidies and growing competition from imports - including politically sensitive subsidised imports from European Community countries. Nearly 30 per cent of the population is still employed in agriculture, so reforming the agricultural sector is politically highly sensitive. Farmers, still largely hooked on the attitudes of the past, continue to demand minimum guaranteed prices and protection from imports. Like their counterparts in the European Community they frequently blockade towns and throw eggs (and worse) at politicians. But, with 24 per cent of all farms less than two hectares in size and the average size of private farms under six hectares, huge structural changes leading to fewer, larger and more productive farms are inevitable. At the same time, the voices of Poland's old landed aristocracy are to be heard demanding the return of at least part, if not all, of their old pre-war estates. Many of the small farms will disappear naturally over time as their ageing proprietors die out. Their farms will be absorbed and consolidated into larger units, a process made infinitely easier in Poland by the very fact that private property ownership - and hence its legal sale or transference - was never abolished through collectivisation. Existing state farms are likely to be converted into genuine co-operatives. The hope is that dispossessed farmers will find alternative employment in the expansion of underdeveloped rural services in food processing, transport and marketing. It is here, in the privatisation of the former monopolistic state marketing and processing sectors that the World Bank pinpointed the greatest scope for investment, rationalisation and growth. 'Agricultural production should be on land that is essentially private. Similarly marketing, transport, processing and storage activities should be private. As for prices they should be determined by market forces', the Bank report indicated. It also underlined the need for Poland to have access to foreign markets. 'Agriculture should be free to use all trade possibilities, domestically and internationally, since this is the only way it can fully exploit its competitive advantage at any given time.' Brave words - totally contradicted in the annex by this advice from the European Community, co-author of the report. 'The government should allow itself all types of border measures including quantitive restrictions to set the price of cereals where, for political reasons, it would like it to be.' The EC also recommended that domestic prices should be stabilised by a system of EC-style variable export taxes/subsidies and corresponding import measures . . . 'and aim deliberately for an agricultural production somewhat below self-sufficiency.' It is advice such as this which fuels the growing conviction that eastern and central Europe will only achieve its desired integration into a larger European Community after a huge battle for fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Meanwhile, Polish farmers and the government face the immediate problem of how to dispose of last year's surplus of grain, meat, potatoes, sugar beet and other products. On his trip to Moscow last month, Prime Minister Jan Bielecki offered the Soviets 1m tons of grain and 100,000 tons of meat. The Soviets replied they had no cash, were not prepared to deliver more oil in exchange but were prepared to supply more gas and consider barter deals involving ferrous and non-ferrous minerals and other products. Talks continue. The trade issue is becoming increasingly serious - both because Polish farming has become more productive over the last decade and because plans for 4-5 per cent annual growth in agricultural production depend on export outlets. Last year Poland produced a record 28m tons of grain, up 1.5m tons from 1989, and 2.4m tons of meat. Sugar beet production was also 300,00 tons higher at 2.1m tons. Farm exports last year at Dollars 2.1bn exceeded imports of Dollars 897m to provide a Dollars 1.2bn net contribution to the overall trade surplus. Higher exports were also a function of lower domestic demand, itself a function of the sharply higher prices which followed the abolition of consumer price subsidies. The meat and food queues which were once the butt of countless Polish jokes, and countless wasted queuing hours, are now a thing of the past. So is the wastage associated with feeding cheap processed food to pigs. In the old days the joke was that the well-fed Czech dog would visit Poland from time to time because in Poland, although there was nothing to eat, a dog at least had the freedom to bark. It is now possible in Poland to both bark and eat. The only question is how to pay for it.</p>

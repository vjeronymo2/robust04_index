			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (9): Plans face heavy criticism - Apprehension over the UK's new-style venture capital trusts When the the UK's chancellor announced a new type of venture capital trust with tax-free returns for investors in his last Budget, the venture capital and investment industry was delighted. The new trusts seemed to be offering a solution to the long-standing problem of the 'equity gap', first identified more than half a century ago - the gulf between the small amounts of short-term loan finance offered to small businesses by banks, and the substantial amounts of long-term capital available to larger, more established companies. But since details of the proposed trusts' likely structure were published in a consultative document this spring, the chancellor's plans have come in for heavy criticism. The industry's clamour for changes in the draft rules has centred on two issues: the tax incentives offered to investors, and the restrictions on the size of target companies and the maximum investment allowed in each company. The Inland Revenue discussion document proposes that dividends and capital gains from venture capital trusts should be tax-free, but there should be no up-front relief, and losses should not be allowable against tax. This would put VCTs on a level with personal equity plans, except that the maximum investment by each individual would probably be about Pounds 100,000 a year, rather than the Pounds 9,000 annual Pep limit. So far, the venture capital section of the investment trust industry has not benefited from the massive popularity of using personal equity plans to invest in collective funds. Venture capital trusts are usually excluded from Pep investment by rules stipulating that at least half the fund must be invested in ordinary shares in listed companies. Venture capital funds by their very nature invest largely in unquoted companies, and often provide debt rather than equity finance. As Peps are aimed mainly at small-scale investors, this has not been too big a problem - anyone investing in venture capital should have a broad enough portfolio that they can use up their annual Pep allowance in other ways. However, VCTs want to attract a larger, wealthier type of investor, and the industry believes that more sweeteners are needed to make investors stomach the extra risk. One favoured solution would be for venture capital trusts to be classified as unquoted companies for the purpose of qualifying for reinvestment relief from capital gains tax - the last Budget introduced a scheme whereby individuals disposing of other investments, from shares to second homes, can postpone the capital gains tax bill by reinvesting the proceeds in unquoted trading companies. Another popular option would be to give VCTs the same tax breaks as the enterprise investment scheme, which offers 20 per cent up-front tax relief, and allows losses to be offset against income or capital gains tax. The industry is united in its demand for better tax breaks, but there is less agreement on whether the limits on size of investment and size of company should be changed. The Inland Revenue's consultative document suggests that there should be a limit on investment in any one company of Pounds 1m a year, and target companies should have assets of less than Pounds 10m to qualify - 'the scheme's aims would not be served if funds were diverted into very large unlisted companies,' the document says. But venture capitalists and investment trust managers have been bombarding the Inland Revenue with submissions on how the limits on the size of investment will mean it will not be worth fund managers' while to run such trusts, because researching small companies thoroughly for the sake of an investment of less than Pounds 1m would cost far too much. The Association of Investment Trust Companies, for example, has submitted a demand that the limit for each investment should be raised from Pounds 1m to Pounds 3m (with a requirement that at least 20 per cent should be of less than Pounds 1m), and the size of potential target companies should be increased to between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m. 'The lower limits proposed in the consultative document would generate uncommercial administrative and management costs,' the AITC said. The opposite view is put by Mr Ian Tulloch, a director of Glasgow-based fund managers Murray Johnstone. He believes that allowing larger investments would make managers concentrate on the more cost-effective upper end of the scale, and would work against the principal objective of the trusts, which is to help bridge the equity gap - 'VCTs should be used to support small and medium-sized companies, not medium sized companies only,' he says, as small companies seeking injections of more than Pounds 1m are already well-served by current sources of venture capital. Mr Gilbert Chalk, chairman of the British Venture Capital Association's taxation committee, proposes that as an alternative to giving investors 20 per cent tax relief, the trusts themselves could be given a 20 per cent incentive on investments of less than Pounds 500,000, to encourage trusts to focus on companies at the smaller end of the scale. The research involved in making small investments in very small companies might be too expensive for London firms with high overheads, says Mr Tulloch, but he believes that regional venture capital managers with lower costs and better links to local businesses would have no problem with operating venture capital trusts using the lower limits. 'Provided that the tax incentives are such that we believe we can attract money, we would be very interested in running a venture capital trust.' He also suggests the development of partnerships and co-investment arrangements between venture capitalists and business angels, which would help spread the burden of costs. Responses to the consultative document are now under consideration by ministers. The final form for the new trusts will not be announced until later this autumn, possibly in the next Budget. There is a strong belief within the industry that the Inland Revenue will make some concessions in line with submissions - the most likely is thought to be allowing the trusts to qualify for roll-over capital gains tax relief  -but there is still apprehension in some quarters over whether the concessions will go far enough. The extent of the revenue's generosity will determine whether VCTs develop into a sturdy bridge across the equity gap, or just another lifeline to a lucky few businesses.</p>

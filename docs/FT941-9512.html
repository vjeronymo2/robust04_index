			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Major backs Russia's G7 application Mr John Major last night became the first western leader to give public backing to Russia's demand for full representation in the political deliberations of the Group of Seven western industrial nations. As the British prime minister arrived in Moscow last night for talks with President Boris Yeltsin, British officials said Moscow should be granted 'full and equal' treatment during political discussions at annual G7 summits. For the past two years it has had only observer status. Mr Yeltsin called for a place at the G7 table in a letter to leaders last month. Officials travelling with Mr Major said the UK prime minister had the tacit support of President Bill Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. But Japan, still in dispute with Russia over sovereignty of the Kurile islands, was likely to oppose the move. France might also be less than enthusiastic. They accepted also there was no question at present of admitting Russia to the G7's economic deliberations. Other members are Italy and Canada. Mr Major believes strongly that with Mr Yeltsin under threat from both the old Communist guard and the Russian nationalist right, the west cannot afford to treat Russia as a 'second class citizen'. He wants Mr Yeltsin's application accepted in time for the president to play a full part in this summer's Naples summit. Officials denied any direct link with Mr Major's attempt to persuade Mr Yeltsin to give tacit support to last week's Nato ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs. But they stressed that if the west expected Russia to continue to play a constructive role in deliberations over Bosnia in the UN Security Council, it had to offer Mr Yeltsin real influence in the wider deliberations of the G7.</p>

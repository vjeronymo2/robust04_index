			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Ambitious debt-based expansion that's providing some food for thought - Questions raised by Waterford Foods' latest buy THE BATTLE for scale and market share in the Irish food industry was highlighted earlier this month by Waterford Foods' IPounds 62m (Pounds 57.8m) acquisition of Express Ireland, which was accompanied by a rights issue of IPounds 25m. By fighting off other sizeable contenders, such as Avonmore and Golden Vale, Waterford is now one of the Republic of Ireland's largest dairy companies. It has annual turnover in excess of IPounds 500m and has ambitions to become a IPounds 1bn company over the next few years. Starting out as a milk producer's co-operative, Waterford has undergone rapid growth since it was floated on the stock market in 1988. The flotation was part of a strategic expansion plan, mapped out in 1987, which according to Mr Stephen O'Connor, managing director, was aimed at doubling the company's turnover in four years. An aggressive acquisition programme ensued starting with the purchase of the Heald dairy group in the UK in 1989, Galloway West in the US in 1990 and United Co-operative Daires in northern England last year. Together with Express Ireland (formerly a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan), Waterford has spent over IPounds 200m on its spate of acquisitions, mostly financed through debt. Although largely welcomed by shareholders and market analysts, the debt-based expansion strategy has not been without its critics. One Dublin stockbroker estimated group debt to be 'in the region of IPounds 150m', which he described as a 'millstone'. 'The growth in scale has not been matched by a growth in the bottom-line figure,' he added. Earnings per share have not matched the doubling in growth of turnover and 'shareholders are still waiting for the pay-off of the expansion,' he said. Others, however, are more upbeat. Davy, one of Dublin's leading stockbrokers, noted in a recent review of the Irish food industry that 'there is a pervasive view that milk processing, at least domestic milk operations, are a liability. 'This is not the case. The fact that the companies are diversifying away from domestic operations reflects more the growth constraints on these than any risk attaching to their long-run profitability or good cash flow potential', it said. Davy pointed out that recent acquisitions would leave Waterford's 1991 balance sheet 'prospectively some 90 per cent geared . . . but with the profits outlook positive . . . gearing on our estimates will fall to less than 40 per cent by the end of 1993.' Several factors could upset this forecast: the cost impact of reduced milk supplies due to lower EC milk quotas; a failure to achieve savings through the marriage of the UK operations of Heald and UCD; the effect of a weaker sterling and US dollar. In the longer term, some analysts believe the group's exposure to door-to-door milk deliveries in Ireland and the UK could present problems as the trend of milk sales appears to be leaning more towards retail outlets. The market was disappointed by the failure last year of merger talks between Waterford and Avonmore which, had they succeeded, would have produced a substantial, diversified food group with cost-savings potential and the financial and management muscle for further expansion in the European and US markets. It would also have spread Waterford's debt burden across the two groups. However, having now to compete alongside Avonmore and the other big Irish dairy groups, Waterford's management will be under pressure to produce good results in 1992 to justify its debt-based expansion programme. The group's shares have not performed as well as its competitors over the past 12 months, and if good bottom-line results do not appear in 1992, Waterford's expansion programme could well be pulled up short.</p>

Rybkin was speaking Friday at a plenary sitting  the Duma held to discuss President Yeltsin's address to  parliament.    In Rybkin's view, Yeltsin had summed up the results of two  years of destruction, rash moves and sacrifice and by his words  proved he had come to realize it was about time for Russia to  stop seeking foreign advice and live, instead, in conformity  with its national characteristics, relying on its own forces.    Ivan Rybkin suggested that the lawmakers uphold Yeltsin's  call for increased political responsibility for civic peace in  Russia and that they sign an appropriate formal declaration to  confirm this at the upcoming All-Russian Congress of Political  Parties and Movements.    To make the Duma's legislative moves more effective, Ivan  Rybkin suggested changes in the legislative procedures. He said  a number of parliamentary factions, including the Liberal  Democrats, felt each and all of the Duma's committees must be  turned into a kind of micro-parliament whose job it would be to  discuss and coordinate, with the factions, all amendments to  existing legislation. The Duma would then meet in plenary  sittings only to vote but not to discuss new bills.    In the speaker's view, what the factions were calling for,  would, in fact, speed up the lawmaking process. And, Rybkin  felt, work on concrete bills would divert the lawmakers'  attention from purely political matters.</p>

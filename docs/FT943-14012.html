			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / International Company News: Telefonica poised to sell Tisa stake Telefonica, Spain's national telecommunications operator, is negotiating the sale of a minority stake in Telefonica Internacional (Tisa), the profitable holding company that groups its substantial Latin American assets. The deal is likely to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. A stake in Tisa, which raised first-quarter profits by 89 per cent to Pta3.8bn (Dollars 30.8m) and has a market capitalisation of between Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7bn, is an attractive proposition to leading US operators because of its Latin American holdings. Tisa groups stakes in 20 South and Central American companies, including local and long-distance operators and data transmission and mobile telephone companies. It is the largest single telecoms group in the fast-growing Latin American market. Telefonica, however, denied reports that GTE of the US had acquired a stake of up to 30 per cent in Tisa. 'We are talking to GTE and to others about alliances (in Latin America). . . but no agreement has been formalised,' the company said. In addition to GTE, Telefonica is understood to be discussing the sale of Tisa equity with three other groups: AT&amp;T, the largest US operator; South-western Bell, a regional US operator; and Unisource, a joint venture between the Dutch, Swedish and Swiss national operators, in which Telefonica itself is to buy a 25 per cent stake. The negotiations come at a critical stage in the formation of international telecoms alliances. US and European operators are manoeuvring to become 'one-stop' providers to multinationals through such groupings, in order to exploit the rapid opening of telecoms services to competition in Europe, Latin America and Asia. Until last month, Telefonica had remained unaligned in the international struggle, while strongly resisting the early introduction of competition within Spain. It appeared to have been successful last year, with the European Union's decision to grant Spain a five-year extension to the 1998 deadline for competition in basic telephone services which was imposed on most of the rest of the EU. However, last year's Dollars 5.3bn alliance between British Telecommunications and MCI, the second-largest US operator, and the launch of AT&amp;T's Worldsource international venture, left Telefonica feeling exposed. Earlier this month it joined Unisource, which at the same time forged a partnership with AT&amp;T. The Spanish government also agreed to waive its five-year extension on the 1998 competition deadline, a decision endorsed by Telefonica. Mr Bill Coleman, analyst at James Capel, the UK securities house, believes Telefonica, which owns 76.2 per cent of Tisa, is considering the sale of up to 10 per cent of Tisa via an issue of new equity which could raise between Dollars 600m and Dollars 700m. A second route into Tisa for potential strategic partners could also be opened through the possible disposal by the Patrimonio del Estado, the government's portfolio group, of the 23.8 per cent stake it holds in the company. A decision is expected shortly. The Patrimonio could either float its Tisa equity or sell it directly to one or more of the operators that are talking to Telefonica. Either way, the Patrimonio, which is also Telefonica's largest single shareholder with a 32.2 per cent stake, stands to raise some Dollars 1.5bn.</p>

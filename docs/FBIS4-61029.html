			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Stepanov, head of Republic of Karelia </F> Government, under the "Politics" rubric: "Confrontation Is  Hopeless, Viktor Stepanov, Head of Karelia Government Believes"]    [Text] When pondering the prospect of securing civil  accord, I remember December 1992 and the Seventh Congress of  People's Deputies. The country was on the verge of an acute  crisis, but a means of accord was found then nonetheless.  Regrettably, it was later cut short by the hard-line stance of  both sides -- that is how I regard the political events of the  past year. And that is why I am convinced that it is not enough  to make commitments, you have to know how to carry them out. I  also apply that to myself. And that is what I expect of others  too. We have a Constitution. However anyone looks at it, it has  been adopted and is in force. And I think that not only the  rights but also the duties of citizens, including officials and  including in connection with the signing of the Treaty on Social  Accord, should be observed. Not only in the political but also  in the economic sphere. The state must make concrete pledges to  formulate ways of escaping from the crisis. I am profoundly  convinced that if we do not find ways of stabilizing the  economy, ways of financial recovery, if we do not overcome the  paralysis of the financial-credit system, this treaty may remain  a pipe dream. Accord in society depends on the position of huge  social groups of the population, and if we do not succeed in  halting the impoverishment of the very poor, it will be fairly  hard to actually secure accord. I think that the treaty is the  first step toward our getting away from last year's tragedy.  Confrontation is hopeless. I think that both those who  subscribed to and are yet to subscribe to the treaty and those  who do not sign it should all realize the responsibility they  bear. It is not a question of each one of us, it is a question  of Russian citizens and Russia.</p>

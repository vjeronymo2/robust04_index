			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'IT'S PRETTY SENSATIONAL STUFF' AS HUDSON'S LOVE LIFE UNFOLDS IN COURT  </P> <P> It was a revealed in court this week that a man hid behind a barbecue pit and  watched Rock Hudson and his former lover have sex next to the Jacuzzi after a  birthday party at the late actor's home.  </P> <P> But the man behind the barbecue isn't the only voyeur who has emerged in the  trial.  </P> <P> The press and a parade of curious onlookers have staked out the courtroom in  downtown Los Angeles each day to hear about the former leading man's secret  love life, the subject of more than 20 years of rumors and speculation. Today,  it is the center of a lawsuit, filed by Marc Christian, 35, Hudson's former  lover, who is suing Hudson's estate and personal secretary for allegedly  conspiring to conceal that Hudson was dying of AIDS for more than a year.  </P> <P> Christian, a former bartender, claims he suffered extreme emotional distress  when he found out about Hudson's illness, because they continued to have  frequent, high-risk sex for eight months after Hudson's illness was diagnosed  as AIDS. The testimony has been so risque that lawyers have repeatedly  apologized to the jury for the questions and responses deemed necessary to  uncover the truth in the case.  </P> <P> So far the onlookers have not been been disappointed. Besides the graphic  details of the extended love affair and active sex life between Hudson and  Christian, they have been regaled with a series of unexpected and sensational  tales. Among them:  </P> <P> * Hudson refused to take Christian to a state dinner at the White House because  he feared that Nancy Reagan would discover he was gay. Christian testified that  Hudson told him, "Nancy Reagan would figure out our relationship because she's  a very bright woman."  </P> <P> * Pat Boone's wife, Shirley, performed spiritual incantations over Hudson's  body minutes after the actor died of complications from AIDS in his Beverly  Hills home on Oct. 2, 1985, at age 59. She was speaking in tongues while  holding Hudson's legs, saying, "Please get the AIDS out of his body," Christian  testified.  </P> <P> * Hudson's personal secretary, Mark Miller, allegedly asked Christian to  recruit young men to have sex with the actor, "to kind of spice things up,"  Christian said. He said he politely declined.  </P> <P> * After Hudson died, Christian began work on a book about their relationship,  "Between Rock and a Hard Place," but has since abandoned the project.  </P> <P> * Hudson was paid $2.5 million for a guest-starring role on six episodes of the  television soap "Dynasty" in 1984. At the time, he had lost nearly 30 pounds  because of his illness. Christian advised Hudson not to do the series, saying  he looked like a "walking cadaver," but Hudson persisted. "I'm not going to  turn down 2.5 million bucks," Christian quoted the actor as saying.  </P> <P> * Hudson purposely left the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences out of  his will because he never liked the organization. He left his estimated  $8-million estate to a trust.  </P> <P> * Hudson not only had AIDS, he also had herpes, Christian said. Although  Christian has continued to test negative for the AIDS virus, repeated medical  tests show that he has the antibodies for herpes. He claims he did not have  herpes before his relationship with Hudson.  </P> <P> To catch these juicy tidbits on film, photographers and television producers  have been jockeying for camera position in the courtroom while longtime court  observers spend hours following the trial. At one point, a television monitor  was set up in the hallway outside the courtroom, drawing a huge crowd of  attorneys, court clerks and idle jurors from other cases.  </P> <P> "It's shocking, that's why we come," said Sam Brotman, one of about six retired  men who are courtroom regulars. "It's pretty sensational stuff. We read about  it at the beginning and decided it was more interesting than the murder trial  we were watching."  </P> <P> The trial so far may have dispelled some romantic notions Hudson's fans have  held of him. He was treated as a hero in the fight against AIDS when it was  revealed during a 1985 television broadcast that the actor had contracted the  disease, even prompting a telephone call from President Reagan. But that same  broadcast triggered Christian's lawsuit, and subsequent testimony that Hudson  purposely lied to his lover so that they could continue to have sex.  </P> <P> Christian has portrayed Hudson as a loving partner, but a person gripped by  self-denial, who steadfastly refused to reveal his own illness or take steps to  protect others.  </P> <P> He testified that the late film star said, "they get what they deserve," when  they watched a television program about the spread of AIDS in gay bathhouses.  And he told the jury that when he asked Hudson what he would do if the actor  contracted AIDS, Hudson replied, " 'I'd have one last good (sex act) and then  I'd say 'goodby cruel world.' "  </P> <P> Even after Christian confronted Hudson when the actor was being treated for his  illness at UCLA Medical Center, Hudson refused to apologize, Christian said.  </P> <P> For his part, Christian has been painted by defense attorneys as a  money-grabbing opportunist who used his relationship with Hudson to further his  ambitions for an acting career. The attorneys have pointed to a series of  interviews Christian gave to Penthouse, the "Larry King Show," the "Phil  Donahue Show," "Good Morning San Francisco" and others to publicize his suit  after Hudson's death.  </P> <P> Yet under cross-examination, Christian testified that he has never sought  professional psychiatric treatment for his alleged mental distress, in part  because he was reluctant to make public his private moments with Hudson.  </P></p>

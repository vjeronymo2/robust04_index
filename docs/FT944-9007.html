			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television What constitutes a riot? Tonight's revelation of Forbidden Britain (9.45pm, BBC2) is too vague, including Orange march scuffles, striking miners and the 1946 Bolton football disaster when 33 were crushed to death. But riots? You might as well include Harrod's sale. Despite Zoe Wanamaker's portentous tones claiming that riot coverage has always been censored, there's plenty of the real thing, notably a 1932 hunger march that turned violent and the battle of Cable Street. Wry recollections never fulfil the subtitle's promise, 'Our Secret Past'. Finney (9pm, ITV), a new drama series hovering dangerously near cliche, is worth a look for the acting. Warm-hearted Geordies have a criminal underworld and gangster sub-culture that can turn nasty to the family white sheep (David Morrissey). Family ties of a different kind are infinitely moving in Witness: The Search for Alison MacDonald (9pm, C4). The mystery is less what happened to Alison when she vanished in India but why her father, a Scottish minister, is convinced of both her survival and God's goodness.</p>

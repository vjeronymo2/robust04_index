			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> INTEREST RATE CAP FAILS IN COMMITTEE  </P> <P> A bill that would limit to 18% the interest rate a retailer can charge failed  in an Assembly committee. The measure was an attempt to revive the Unruh Retail  Credit Act of 1959, which was repealed by legislation signed by Gov. George  Deukmejian in 1988.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos) said he will either reintroduce his bill  next year or seek to qualify for a ballot initiative. The Assembly Finance and  Insurance Committee voted 10-7 against the bill. Areias and several consumer  groups argued that the retail industry had failed to deliver on its promise  that, if the interest rate ceiling was repealed, interest rates would not rise  and more credit would be available to low-income customers. Areias said  interest rates since the repeal have averaged 20.15% and sometimes run as high  as 24%.  </P></p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Auditors press for liability changes Britain's largest accountancy firms yesterday warned of higher audit fees and a more restrictive service if the law on audit liability was not reformed. In a submission to the Department of Trade and Industry made public yesterday, they urged the government to change the law to allow them to limit their liability with companies. The firms say that without such a change they would be reluctant to provide assurances on forward-looking financial data, or to comment on internal controls and other proposals in the Cadbury code of corporate governance. The submission, given to officials on Tuesday, responds to a number of questions from DTI officials since a meeting held between the firms and Mr Neil Hamilton, minister of corporate affairs, last July. It says the number of writs outstanding against the six largest accountants last year was 627, compared with just three writs a decade ago. Premiums have risen by 37.5 times in the same period and deductibles - the amount paid by the firms before triggering any payment from commercial insurers - by 27 times to Dollars 45m. Other information prepared by Minet, insurance broker to the firms, says that the average of the three largest claims was Pounds 500m last year, the average of the five largest was Pounds 350m and of the 10 largest Pounds 250m. These figures exclude the outstanding writs seeking more than Dollars 8bn in connection with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. They have risen sharply in the past few years to well in excess of the upper level of commercial insurance cover, which stands at Dollars 105m. A subcommittee of three of the firms' senior partners has been meeting to discuss the subject every two weeks, and Ian Greer Associates, a political lobbyist has been hired to help promote the case. The firms want removal of section 310 of the 1985 Companies Act, which expressly forbids them from negotiating any upper limit on their liability in audits. Grab for a lifebelt, Page 22</p>

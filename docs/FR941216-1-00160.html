Operational shields, when designed in accordance with MIL&hyph;STD&hyph;398 should protect personnel and assets from thermal, pressure, and fragmentation hazards resulting from an accidental or intentional detonation and deflagration of ammunition or explosives. Existing reinforced concrete walls built to resist the effects of accidental explosions and designed and built in accordance with requirements applicable at the time of construction may be used as operational shields, with the following guidance as a minimum requirement: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A 12-inch reinforced concrete wall (see definition ``substantial dividing wall'' of this subpart) provides adequate protection for operations involving an item containing 15 pounds TNT equivalent or less of high explosives when the nearest part of the item is at least 3 feet from the wall and the item is 2 feet from the floor. Care shall be taken to use appropriate equivalence data for close-in effects. Explosives characterized by greater brisance than that of TNT may have very high equivalencies at small distances from the explosives. When equivalence data is not available, existing 12-inch reinforced concrete walls may be used for operational shields for protection from items containing not more than 6 pounds of high explosives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A 30-inch reinforced concrete wall provides adequate protection against the effects of an item containing not more than 50 pounds TNT equivalent of high explosives. The same separation distance as stated in paragraph (1) of this definition applies. When equivalence data is not available, a 30-inch wall may be used for an operational shield for protection from items containing not more than 20 pounds of high explosives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A 36-inch reinforced concrete wall provides adequate protection against the effects of an item containing not more than 70 pounds TNT-equivalency of high explosives. The separation distance as stated in definition ``operational shield,'' paragraph (1) of this definition applies. When equivalence data is not available, a 36-inch wall may be used for an operational shield for protection from items containing not more than 28 pounds of high explosives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Potential explosive site (PES).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The location of a quantity of explosives that will create a blast, fragment, thermal, or debris hazard in the event of an accidental explosion of its contents. Quantity limits for ammunition and explosives at a PES are determined by the distance to an ES. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Prohibited area.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A specifically designated area at airfields, seadromes, or heliports in which all ammunition and explosives facilities are prohibited. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Propellant.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Explosives compositions used for propelling projectiles and rockets and to generate gases for powering auxiliary devices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public highway.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any street, road, or highway used by the general public for any type of vehicular travel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public traffic route.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any public street, road (including any on an establishment or military reservation), highway, navigable stream, or passenger railroad that is routinely used for through traffic by the general public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pyrotechnic material.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The explosive or chemical ingredients, including powdered metals, used in the manufacture of military pyrotechnics. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Quantity/distance (Q/D) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The quantity of explosives material and distance separation relationships providing defined types of protection. These relationships are based on levels of risk considered acceptable for the stipulated exposures and are tabulated in the appropriate Q/D tables. Separation distances afford less than absolute safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Renovation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

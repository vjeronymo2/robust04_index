			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / International Company News: Alberta sells stake in Energy unit THE ALBERTA government is selling its 36 per cent interest in Alberta Energy, the Canadian resource company, for CDollars 476m (USDollars 378m). Mr Peter Lougheed, former Alberta premier, set up AEC 20 years ago, when oil and gas prices were booming, as a vehicle for Albertans to share in the prosperity. About 7.5m shares were sold at CDollars 10 each to Alberta residents. The 36 per cent interest is held by the Alberta Heritage Fund, a CDollars 7bn investment pool set up by Mr Lougheed to invest excess oil and gas tax revenues after the energy crisis in the 1970s. About 25m shares are to be offered at CDollars 19 each with payment of CDollars 9.50 each on May 11 next and May 11 1994. Albertans are being offered 40 per cent of the block. AEC stock closed at CDollars 19 1/4 on Friday, up from a 52-week low of CDollars 9 3/4 with the turnround in the oil and gas industry and a better outlook for the company's newsprint investment. The company swung back to strong profitability last year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>   [Text] Edib Bukvic, the deputy prime minister of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, arrived in Tehran yesterday for talks with  Iranian officials on broadening bilateral relations. The  Bosnian deputy prime minister, who is accompanied by a  delegation of government officials, met with our vice president.  In addition to issues pertaining to bilateral relations, the  Bosnian delegation expressed its hope that the Islamic Republic  of Iran's support for the efforts of the Bosnian Government and  people to put an end to the inhuman atrocities being perpetrated  by the Serbs and to find a humane and just solution to the  Bosnian crisis would continue.    Upon his arrival in Tehran, Bukvic described the Islamic  Republic of Iran as the Bosnian people's best friend, which is  an indication of the deep relations between the two countries  based on a longstanding and common Islamic culture which  transcends all boundaries. In fact, despite the atrocities  committed against the Bosnian Muslims and the propagandistic  clamor in the mass media of various countries, the Bosnian  Muslim nation has few friends. Even among those, there are not  many who are ready to extend active support for the territorial  integrity, independence, and survival of the oppressed Bosnian  nation. The friendship of the Iranian nation with the Muslim  Bosnian people, which is rooted in ideological bonds, is an  example.    During the past two years of an unjust and unequal war  against the Bosnian Muslims, the Islamic Republic of Iran has  actively extended serious support to the Bosnian people.  Unstintingly and in the most difficult circumstances, it has  risen in their support. The Islamic Republic of Iran has had to  endure political pressures and restrictions and negative  propaganda by the common enemies of the Iranian and Bosnian  people because of this.    The Muslim Iranian nation has always declared its readiness  to actively participate in the jihad of the Bosnian Muslims  against the criminal Serbs. Recently, the Islamic Republic of  Iran reiterated its willingness to dispatch military assistance  in order to prevent the Serbs from continuing their crimes and  aggression. In any case, the relations between the two Muslim  nations of Iran and Bosnia-Herzegovina, based on ideological  Islamic tenets, will continue to broaden in the future.</p>

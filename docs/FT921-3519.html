			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Rise in sales of new homes reported MINISTERS anxious for evidence of the long-awaited upturn in the economy will today take comfort from a report suggesting sales activity in the housing market is beginning to show a marked improvement. The House Builders' Federation said a recovery in sales experienced in London and the south-east in January had started to spread to the rest of the country. East Anglia experienced the biggest increase, the report found. Mr David Holliday, the federation president, said that there was positive evidence that purchaser interest in new homes was being converted into sales. He went on to predict that the housing market would now begin to move forward strongly throughout the remainder of 1992. 'Other surveys have shown increased purchaser interest. This is the first positive interest that has been converted into sales,' he said. The federation report is based on responses from 41 of Britain's biggest building companies, which together account for about half of new house sales. In January 80 per cent of builders reported improved sales compared with January last year. The figure rose to 84 per cent in February. Nearly half of the respondents said February sales had jumped by more than 25 per cent. The report concludes that there has been a 'considerable improvement' in confidence among home buyers in the first two months of 1992, which has gained momentum in February. Earlier this month Halifax, the UK's largest building society, said it saw some signs of a revival in the housing market. It said that it expected a small increase in house prices by the second half of this year.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Stranded by a Labour tide: Philip Stephens examines the ramifications of a crushing by-election defeat for the UK Tories By-elections do not change the tide of history. They do tell us which way, and how fast, the tide is flowing. After the defeat in Dudley West, this government is as close as any postwar administration to drowning in the breaking waves. Everyone knew the result would be bad. In the event it was awful. Conservatives now always seem to exceed their worst expectations. Ministers may mutter about a low by-election turnout and mid-term protest votes blues. But the 29 per cent swing from Tory to Labour - or new Labour, as Mr Tony Blair insists his party must now be called - was the largest since 1935. Scratch beneath the surface of the opinion polls, and it is clear the electorate has not embraced the Labour cause with enthusiasm. Many remain uncertain of Mr Blair's prospectus. But the fear that has kept the opposition party out of government for so long is fast dissipating. One minister confessed he had not found a single Tory voter in the Midlands constituency, after half a day on the stump (it was all he could stand). A former cabinet member chimed in that the electorate in this sensible patch of middle England regarded the Tory party as a shambles. Surveying the warring factions on the backbenches and the disunity in the cabinet, he found it hard to disagree. Neither man had to ask why the government was more unpopular than at any time during the past 15 years. The economic recovery is well-balanced, with inflation low and growth driven by exports rather than consumption. It is not being felt where it counts, though. Higher taxes, a squeeze on wages, and job insecurity have depressed both the incomes and the confidence of the voters. The disenchantment is reinforced by the spectacle of a party preoccupied with its own political infighting rather than the concerns of those it promised to represent. The defeat over value added tax on fuel - smack in the middle of the by-election campaign - epitomises the problem. An out-of-touch government was determined to double the level of the most unpopular measure since the ill-fated poll tax. The measure was abandoned not because ministers had listened to the voters but because their hand was forced by backbench Tory rebels. Dudley West, one of the swathe of Midlands seats that will decide the outcome of the next general election, has been Tory since 1979. A mix of the old industrial and more prosperous residential areas now typical of the black country, the constituency is a natural home for the skilled workers - the aspiring C1s - who turned to Mrs Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s. The boundaries will be redrawn before the next general election. But if Labour holds on to seats like this, Mr Blair will replace Mr John Major in 10 Downing Street. Ministers yesterday were primed with excuses. This was a mid-term protest - louder maybe than some before it, but a protest nonetheless. Mr John Major's government, like others before it, would be forgiven once the recovery began to put money into the voter's pockets. Look at the history, they said. The government lost seven by-elections during the last parliament. Every seat was recovered in 1992. Remember Mid-Staffordshire? Labour under the leadership of Mr Neil Kinnock won that Midlands seat in March 1990 with a massive 21 per cent swing. At the 1992 general election it was returned safely to Tory hands. Go back further. In November 1981, Mrs Shirley Williams grabbed Crosby for the now-defunct Social Democratic Party with a 25.6 per cent swing against the Conservatives. The chattering classes were convinced that her victory marked the beginning of the end of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's government. A year later, Mrs Thatcher won the war in the Falkland Islands. A year after that she won an impregnable 144-seat majority. But there are many threatening precedents also. The Labour government's crushing mid-term defeat in the mining constituency of Ashfield in 1977 foreshadowed the mass desertion of its traditional supporters two years later. The Conservatives' loss of Orpington in the 1962 by-election was the precursor to the end, two years later, of 13 years of Tory rule. Mr Edward Heath's loss of the Isle of Ely in mid-1973 provided a similar premonition of impending doom in February 1974. Closer to home, the by-election defeats of the last parliament may not have dislodged the Conservatives from power. But the succession of ever-more disastrous losses from mid-1989 onwards was a sign that the tide had gone out for Mrs Thatcher's brand of Conservatism. She went. Mrs Thatcher, of course, had a majority of 100. Technically, Mr Major has headed a minority government since the suspension of nine Tory Eurosceptics from the party whip. Even if they are eventually brought back into the fold, the government's majority would rise to just 13. A few more by-elections and it could vanish. For now the support of nine Ulster Unionists improves the arithmetic. As long as the prime minister retains their confidence over the peace process in Northern Ireland, the unionists are ready to sustain him in in office. But more convulsions are threatened on the Tory backbenches. Europhobes and Europhiles have drawn battlelines for the 1996 European Union conference on the next stage of integration. Mr Major's hint of a referendum was designed to encourage a truce. Instead it threatens a still more protracted battle. The factionalism stretches well beyond the divide over Europe. There are pro and anti-Major camps, radicals and consolidators, self-appointed holders of the Thatcherite torch and the merely disgruntled and dispossessed. Like the factions that nearly destroyed Labour in the early 1980s, these cliques see party infighting as a way of life. The Tory coalition is on the edge of disintegration. The divisions have spread to the cabinet. Mr Major does not have a grip over his colleagues. He is unable to prevent them from promoting their own agendas, personal and political. To listen, say, to Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, and to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is to imagine two politicians from different political continents. Both are contenders for the future Tory leadership. Neither seems willing to call a halt to the sniping that could destroy their inheritance. Publicly, cabinet ministers insist the divisions can be bridged, the wounds healed. But in private moments, the same ministers are surprisingly candid in contemplating the party's self-destruction. One of Mr Major's colleagues ventured this week that defeat at the general election was inevitable unless the party managed to seal the fissures. And defeat, he suggested, would be followed by a holocaust that would deprive the Conservatives of power for 15, maybe 20, years. Forget about turning tides, he said. Mr Major's successor would inherit a funeral pyre.</p>

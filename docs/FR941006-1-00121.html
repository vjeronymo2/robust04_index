			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Labeling iron-containing products with statements warning that accidental ingestion by children can be lethal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Packaging changes for iron-containing products with 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit, including packaging these products in child-resistant unit-dose (e.g., blister) packages and not offering such products in packaging that is not child- resistant (no exempt sizes).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Reformulating iron-containing products that resemble candy and that have a sweet outer coating to discourage consumption of large amounts by small children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Requiring prescription status for iron products, reducing the number of units per package, and closer monitoring of the iron status of pregnant women to determine whether iron supplementation is really needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Multi-ethnic educational efforts to increase public awareness of the dangers associated with iron and patient counseling by obstetricians, gynecologists, and pharmacists, because many poisonings involve iron-containing drug products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several participants at the conference commended the trade associations for their voluntary programs. However, some participants urged that child-resistant unit-dose blister packaging, an element not included in the voluntary industry programs, be implemented as a significant measure to reduce the incidence of iron poisonings. The participants in the conference called upon industry, government, and the healthcare community to undertake efforts, including cooperative efforts, to address this problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. The Scope and Purpose of this Document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this document is to: (1) Propose requirements designed to reduce the risk of pediatric poisonings from the accidental ingestion of iron-containing products, (2) solicit additional information concerning the issue, raised in the petitions, of reformulating iron-containing products to avoid the resemblance to candy and to avoid use of a sweet outer coating, and (3) describe the efforts that FDA intends to undertake to respond to the need for public education concerning iron poisonings, reinforcing the NDMA/CPSC education campaign.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated above, the agency believes that the new requirements that it is proposing, in conjunction with CPSC's existing requirements for CRP for iron-containing products (see section II.B. of this document), will significantly reduce the risk of accidental pediatric iron poisoning. FDA and CPSC have worked together closely in coordinating their respective efforts toward this goal, and the two agencies intend to continue to work in close cooperation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Regulation of Iron-Containing Products <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Regulation by FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Types of Iron-Containing Products Addressed in this Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal addresses iron-containing products available as dietary supplements and as prescription drug products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA defined ``dietary supplement'' as a food, not in conventional food form, that supplies a component to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake of that component (59 FR 425, January 4, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 201(f) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(f)) defines ``food'' as: (1) Articles used for food or drink for man or other animals; (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article. In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nutrilab Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Schweiker,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 713 F.2d 335, 338 (7th Cir. 1983), the court noted that taste, aroma, or nutritive value were the primary reasons why people consume food. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nutrilab  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> court said that in section 201(f)(1) of the act, the statutory definition of ``food'' includes the common sense definition of food: ``When the statue defines `food' as `articles used for food, it means that the statutory definition of food' includes articles used by people in the ordinary way most people use food_primarily for taste, aroma, or nutritive value.'' Other courts have followed suit. (See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Undetermined Quantities of Cal-Ban 3000,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 776 F. Supp. 249, 254&hyph;255 (E.D.N.C.1991);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> American Health Products Co.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hayes,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 574 F. Supp. 1498, 1508&hyph;1509 (S.D.N.Y. 1983), aff'd 744 F.2d 912 (2d Cir. 1984).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Types of iron-containing products that meet the definition of a dietary supplement and are regulated as foods include products intended for use primarily to supplement the dietary intake of iron (iron supplements) and multi-vitamin/mineral supplements that contain iron. Products intended for use as iron supplements generally contain 30 mg or more or iron per dosage unit, while multi-vitamin/mineral supplements generally contain 18 mg or less of iron per dosage unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 201(g)(1) of the act, drugs are defined as:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Articles recognized in the official United States Pharmacopeia, official Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States, or official National Formulary, or any supplement to any of them; and (B) articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals; and (C) articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals; and (D) articles intended for use as a component of any articles specified in clause (A), (B), or (C). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

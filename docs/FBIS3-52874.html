			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Lebanese Forces' Central Information </F> Agency issued on 8 January--read by announcer]    [Text] Some media organizations have recently leaked  fabricated news on an alleged attempt to assassinate President  Ilyas al-Hirawi in 1990-1991 [date as heard]. The reports made  implicit and sometimes explicit references accusing the Lebanese  Forces of being behind the alleged attempt. In view of the  persistent reports on this issue, despite the denial made last  week by presidential sources, the Lebanese Forces finds itself  compelled to announce the following:    1. The contradictory information contained in the leaked  reports regarding the alleged attempt to assassinate the  president shows that the reports are not valid. One of the  fabricated reports spoke of an attempt against the president's  life in his office in the temporary presidential headquarters in  al-Ramlah al-Bayda', another report mentioned the Cabinet  meeting room, and others mentioned his house in al-Hazimiyah.    2. Such media schemes are part of the ongoing efforts to  cause confusion in the public and create an atmosphere of  mistrust among official, political, and party leaders. The  Lebanese Forces views these schemes as an attempt to undermine  national unity, internal peace, and public stability.    3. On this occasion, the Lebanese Forces would like to  reiterate its positions on the Lebanese legitimate authority  established under the National Accord agreement. The Lebanese  Forces also would like to remind everyone of its repeated calls  on all parties to get involved in national reconciliation and  join the legitimate institutions, which would be the strongest  proof of the invalidity of the fabricated news about imaginary  operations and attempts. Such news only serves the interests of  those who are trying to cause new rifts within the Lebanese  official body at a time when the officials who are the subject  of such rumors know what is happening.    4. The insistence of treating the Lebanese Forces as a  former militia, disregarding the vast political current it  represents, seeks to undermine its role and image by searching  in the past for twisted and untrue incidents to use against it  in the present. This is proof that some people are adamant not  to accept the realities of coexistence, accord, and political  and democratic practices, as stipulated under the law and  guaranteed by the Constitution.    5. While expressing its deep regret for the failure to  comply with the great national decision to close the chapter of  war with all its details and to engage in public affairs, the  Lebanese Forces calls on all Lebanese to live up to the current  stage and to concentrate their efforts on exposing the schemes  hatched against Lebanon at present and in the future. Instead  of attempting to distract attention from the real dangers facing  Lebanon and its people, efforts should be made to reveal the  real perpetrators and planners of recent bombings, such as the  one against the Phalangist Party headquarters, as well as other  incidents that have sought to disrupt security.</p>

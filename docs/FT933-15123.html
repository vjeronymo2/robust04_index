			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Tories rethink sports shake-up PLANS to restructure the Sports Council have been abandoned by the government - to ensure that as much money as possible goes directly to sport rather than to administration. Mr Iain Sproat, national heritage minister, told the House of Commons yesterday that proposals for an English Sports Council and an over-arching Sports Commission for the whole of the UK had been dropped. Mr Sproat said that 37 per cent of the Pounds 51m allocated to sport each year was already taken up by running costs and he did not want to see the creation of a 'vast bureaucracy' that would increase that percentage. 'I want to make sure that when we give money to encourage sport in this country, it goes to sports people at the sharp end and not to bureaucrats,' he added. He said he would announce fresh proposals as soon as possible bearing in mind 'the need for effective management of the new stream of income for sport which will follow the introduction of a National Lottery'. The changes - sparked by the Atkins Review of sport and active recreation, published in December 1991 - were due to take place in October. Labour attacked the government for instituting another review after two years of continuing discussions on the best approach to sports funding. Mr Tom Pendry, the party's sports spokesman, urged ministers to 'get talks on the road again' without delay. The Sports Council said it was 'disappointed but not surprised at the policy change'. The latest review was the seventh in the past five years and none of the conclusions of the previous six had been acted on by government. The council, it added, would 'not be looking forward to another review with unqualified rapture'. Mr Pendry emphasised that each of the reviews had added substantially to the council's administrative costs.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Union Pacific lifts income by 8% UNION PACIFIC, one of the largest US railroad companies, kicked off the sector's reporting season with news of an 8 per cent improvement in fourth-quarter operating income at Dollars 359m. At the after-tax level, this reduced to a 5 per cent gain, but the railroad operations earned Dollars 163m, up 13 per cent on the previous year. The company said the operating environment throughout 1991 was 'very difficult', but car loadings during the 12 months had increased by around 4 per cent, despite an industry drop of 3 per cent. It also held out some hope for an improvement in 1992. 'We remain cautiously optimistic about the coming year,' commented Mr Drew Lewis, Union Pacific's chief executive. Nevertheless, shares in Union Pacific, whose track is concentrated west of the Mississippi, still closed Dollars 1 lower at Dollars 46 3/4 . Later in the day, CSX, another of the large transportation companies, also reported an underlying 4 per cent increase in fourth-quarter net earnings, to Dollars 134m. The company had already warned of a Dollars 755m one-off charge to cover labour reductions and other productivity moves, and after this, the net loss for the quarter was Dollars 356m. The net loss for the year, after the charge, was Dollars 272m - compared with 1990's profit of Dollars 416m. Like CSX, Union Pacific figures for the full year bear the brunt of a hefty Dollars 870m pre-tax special charge, taken in the third quarter to cover labour productivity changes, including large redundancies, and the abandonment of certain light-used track. After this charge, 1991 operating profits fell from Dollars 1.32bn to Dollars 461m, on revenues of Dollars 7.02bn, against Dollars 6.96bn. Net income fell to Dollars 64m, against Dollars 618m in the previous year. Meanwhile, at Santa Fe Pacific - a third railroad operator owning the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, together with other minerals and pipeline interests - fourth-quarter results showed a Dollars 32.8m profit after tax, a considerable advance on the Dollars 54.6m loss in the same period a year earlier. Operating profits from the rail business reached Dollars 65.1m, compared with Dollars 22.4m in the final quarter of 1990, with car loadings up by 8 per cent. For the full year, net income was Dollars 96.4m against a Dollars 111.8m loss. The shares closed Dollars  3/8 down at Dollars 12 3/4 .</p>

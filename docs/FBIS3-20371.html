			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikael Holmstrom report: "NATO Cooperation Urgent"] </F>   [Text] The government expects Sweden to join NATO's new  form of cooperation, Partnership for Peace (PFP), within a  month. Yesterday the government submitted a document to the  Riksdag that will make it possible for Sweden to join soon. The  first exercises could be held this fall.    "It is important to initiate Swedish involvement in PFP as  soon as possible," the government writes.    Swedish involvement in PFP will take place "on the  foundation  of military nonalignment. This cooperation represents no  defense commitments." It is part of the attempts to construct a  new pan-European defense order.    On 10 January the NATO nations invited the rest of Europe to  join Partnership and as early as 13 January the Foreign Affairs  Council was already agreed that Sweden should join. Initially  the government wanted to say yes to the invitation immediately.    But the Social Democrats in particular wanted to give time  for the Riksdag Foreign Affairs Committee to deal with motions  shelved on the subject of PFP. The committee has reached an  agreement in principle, but last week the Social Democrats, the  Left Party, and New Democracy surprisingly called for a separate  document that the government delivered yesterday after a  lightning action. It means that new motions can be submitted up  to 12 April.    All countries around the Baltic Sea are participating in PFP  or have said that they will do so.    The first step is to sign the framework document that the  NATO summit set out. Today 13 countries have done so. The  government will sign as soon as the Riksdag has completed its  consideration of the matter in a month, government sources have  told SVENSKA DAGBLADET. The document is primarily intended for  the countries of East Europe and does not represent any  complications for Sweden.    It is true that the participating countries are promised the  right to consultations with NATO if their security is  threatened. But an unofficial Swedish interpretation is that  this is chiefly a "reassuring teddy bear for the countries of  the East" (that want to but as yet are not allowed to become  NATO members). Officially the government is saying: "No state  can be included unless it wants to be involved. Sweden's  freedom of action is not therefore restricted by this offer."    In saying this the government ignores the fact that Sweden  is  acquiring yet another diplomatic card to play in a serious  crisis in our immediate environs if the United Nations and the  CSCE fail in their missions.    In only a month Sweden could therefore take the step of  entering this cooperation. There is a so-called document of  introduction, with a list of Swedish offers to NATO. This  document is effectively already complete, SVENSKA DAGBLADET's  source has said.    Sweden is offering courses for other states on how to carry  out peacekeeping actions and humanitarian operations.    In addition Sweden is prepared to support the peacekeeping  force that the three Baltic states want to set up for operations  in other countries. Finally Sweden is offering to promote  democratic control and openness in military structures in East  and Central Europe.    The third step along the road to PFP is consultations  between  NATO and the states involved about what in concrete terms should  be done. Here increased Swedish military contacts with the NATO  headquarters in Brussels and NATO military headquarters in Mons,  also in Belgium, will be needed. The government stresses how  important it is for Sweden to be involved at an early stage in  order to be able to influence the discussions that have already  begun at diplomatic and military level.    A fourth stage is that a fixed-term agreement between NATO  and each PFP country is concluded about what is to be done.    Sweden is already prepared to take part this fall with at  most a company (this will require a change in the law that the  government will propose later this year) in the first exercise  abroad involving peacekeeping forces.    The cost through to the spring of 1995 is estimated at 26  million kronor and will be met from the Foreign Ministry's  budget.</p>

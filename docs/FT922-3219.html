			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: ConAgra predicts small earnings rise for year CONAGRA, the diversified US food group, expected earnings per share to show only a small advance for the year ended May 31. It predicted that earnings for the 12 months would be about Dollars 1.50 a share, compared with Dollars 1.42 in 1990-91. Earnings for the final quarter would probably be static at around 43 cents. Some parts of ConAgra's business have faced tough operating conditions in recent months. Its consumer frozen foods business has been embroiled in a price-war, with ConAgra's Healthy Choice brand coming under intense pressure from other manufacturers of reduced calorie frozen dinners, like Nestle and Heinz. On the cattle feed front, ConAgra said there was a return to profits 'a few months ago', but it acknowledged that chicken products, like cattle feed, experienced a cyclical downturn in 1991-92. It suggested results here could improve 'meaningfully' in the new financial year, if industry supply was not excessive. ConAgra said 1992-93 earnings should rise 'significantly' in the last nine months, after a flat first quarter.</p>

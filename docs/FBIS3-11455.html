"It is different to negotiate from a hostile perspective  than  to do so from a perspective of two countries that want to work  together," he added in brief statements from Casa Rosada after  the meeting between President Carlos Menem and U.S. Vice  President Al Gore.    Granillo Ocampo said that the Menem administration "is very  interested in the approval" of this law on pharmaceutical patent  rights, which is currently being discussed in Congress.    "We believe patent rights must be recognized. We are also  discussing the way in which national interests must also be  taken into consideration," the diplomat said.    Making a balance of his work, he pointed out the  strengthening of the national image and a greater understanding  between Argentina and the United States.    "Several problems that were harming our relations have been  solved, we have obtained important visits, and all this is  positive for the five months I've been in my post," Granillo  Ocampo said.</p>

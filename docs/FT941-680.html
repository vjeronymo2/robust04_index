			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Time to stop digging Mr Douglas Hurd exhibited all the skills of a conjuror in the account he gave yesterday to the House of Commons of the Ioannina compromise, on which he and his cabinet colleagues have to take a decision this morning. The first time he went through it, it sounded for all the world as though Britain had won. In cases where states holding 23 votes or more were against a proposal, the Commission and the presidency would make every effort to seek a consensus, and there would be no time limit. Only when he went over it the second time did it slip out that in the last resort, when all such efforts had been exhausted, the proposal would be adopted unless 27 or more votes were cast against it. Mr Hurd moved on with such alacrity, holding the House bemused with his effortless mastery of so much complex detail, that few MPs seemed actually to hear the dreaded figure 27 pass his lips. And none of those that caught the Speaker's eye was quick-witted enough to pin him down on the crucial point, which is how it will be decided that the search for consensus is exhausted and that the last resort has arrived. According to senior EU officials, quoted in yesterday's Financial Times, the answer to this question is contained in the words 'always respecting the Rules of Procedure of the Council'. This means that the procedural decision will be taken by a simple majority, on a vote which can be called by any one member state. In other words, Britain will not be able to block legislation unless it can muster 27 negative votes - precisely what ministers have claimed it is essential to avoid. Mr Hurd said he had secured two important concessions. One is that the above arrangement will be 'legally binding'. The other is that it will last only until the end of the 1996 intergovernmental conference (IGC), which will now deal with the issue of the blocking minority as well as with the relative voting weight of different member states. This is actually not a concession at all, since whatever happens in 1996 there will not be agreement to reduce the blocking minority. That Mr Hurd took such trouble to camouflage the deal on offer makes it clear that he is desperately hoping the cabinet will accept it. His refusal to 'recommend' it in so many words merely preserves his options if the cabinet rejects his advice. He is not a resigner by nature, but he surely must make it clear to his colleagues that if they reject this offer they will put him in an impossible position. Spain has already accepted it, so Britain would find itself isolated. There is no chance of wringing further concessions from the other member states. And the issue has already been blown up far beyond its real importance. As Mr Hurd reminded the House yesterday, Britain's 'veto' is not at stake. It is only the voting procedure for certain specific categories of legislation. The number of proposals in these categories during 1995 and 1996 which Britain will wish to oppose, and against which it can muster more than 22 but fewer than 27 votes, can hardly be very great, and might even be smaller than the number it will wish to see adopted but which could be blocked by the same number of votes from other states. And while Britain has good reasons to wish to restrict the competences of the EU, it should not wish to make decisions more difficult in areas where EU competence has been accepted by all member states.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Base metals prices were mostly lower at the London Metal Exchange in line with copper (see story above). The three months ALUMINIUM price slumped to a 4 1/2 -month low of Dollars 1,125 a tonne and dealers said fresh production cuts were sorely needed to turn sentiment around. Losses were pared in late trading but the price still ended ended Dollars 6 down at Dollars 1,128 a tonne. Three months TIN slipped to a fresh 20-year low of Dollars 4,510, maintaining the current downtrend, and ended at Dollars 4,525, a Dollars 25 fall on the day. The NICKEL market was depressed by rising stocks and lessening concern over supply disruptions at Inco's Thompson Manitoba facilities, as a tentative pact was agreed. Some support appeared near Dollars 4,500, however, and final business was at Dollars 4,530a tonne, down Dollars 20. ZINC generally ignored the trend, with trade interest helping to hold the market steady, and the three months price closed at Dollars 887.50 a tonne, a Dollars 1.50 gain. At the London bullion market the GOLD price steadied after an early fall to finish just above the technically significant Dollars 345-a-troy-ounce mark. Compiled from Reuters</p>

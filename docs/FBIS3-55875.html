He also said that the information about consultations in the  parliamentary factions suggests that the work of the new  parliament, above all the State Duma, would not be easy.    "Confrontational moods may triumph," he said. He noted,  however, that the new Constitution gave the president enough  powers to prevent revenging forces in the parliament from fully  expressing themselves.

"Yeltsin is the president of all Russian  citizens and respects the choice of the nation, however  contradictory it might be," he said.</p>

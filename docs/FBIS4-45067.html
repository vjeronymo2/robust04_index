			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dr. Bashir al-'Allaq] </F>   [Text] Let us begin with a well-established, inescapable  fact: Cooperation with the student and youth sector is no easy  or routine task in a country thatpects its people, looks  discerningly toward its people's future, glorifies its  independence and sovereignty, and follows a policy of maximum  self-reliance. Such cooperation--in order to be genuine,  effective, and fruitful in building the nation's power  base--requires a large measure of skills that are not developed  within conventional contexts. The development and consolidation  of this vital base requires aware leaders to possess not only  concrete capabilities but also the humanitarian, spiritual,  physical, and moral leadership qualities connoted by the word  "leader." This base also requires innovative, enterprising  leaders with firm resolve, i.e., who can make decisions at the  appropriate time, not in isolation from society at large, but  through interaction with it. In other words, a successful,  effective, productive student and youth leadership is one that  can directly and indirectly influence not only students and  youths, but also the country or society at large, including all  of its cultural institutions, subdivisions, and links.    It is extremely important to understand, absorb, and act  according to this last point, because the young generation is  society's foundation, the nation's springboard, and, by  extension, the nation's "most" vital segment. Therefore, crises,  muddled perception, or psychological shocks affecting the young  generation endanger the entire nation and its future. Hence, the  importance of the young generation being led by leaders of great  substance, who can scout out, nurture, bring to fruition, and  unleash the latent creative abilities of this "priceless  resource."    The leaders whom we have in mind are not just  "administrative  leaders," although such leaders are important. The leaders whom  we have in mind are "vital, combative, believing leaders with  spirited approaches to life," who marry their consciousness to  the struggle, the battle [jihad], and development, who can  unleash the fresh, active, spiritual energies of the young.    Only with such leaders can we say--with the utmost optimism,  confidence, and trust--that the young generation will proceed on  the path to building the civilized, strong, fortified society  for which we hope.    Based on the preceding, the election of comrade 'Udayy  Saddam  Husayn to be chairman of the Executive Office of the National  Federation of Students of Iraq and the General Federation of  Youths of Iraq is a great gain for this vital sector. It marks  the beginning of a new phase in which the marrying of  consciousness to the struggle, battle, and development will be  prominent, clear, and manifest as it rises up before all  segments and components of our society at large.    Comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn is not a traditional leader. He  is not a youth or student whose ideas are framed academically or  bound by his age. True, comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn possesses  all of the characteristics of youth in terms of the freshness of  his spirit and his innovation, ingenuity, initiative,  creativity, and vitality. However, comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn  also possesses--and this is extremely important--the wellsprings  of his father, the leader and symbol, Saddam Husayn, who is an  inexhaustible well of combative action, brilliant combative  conduct, maturity, superior ability to make decisive decisions,  human touches, bravery, boldness, patience, and hearty  identification with the nation's history, land, and combat  mission. Comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn is not only a graduate of  the school of the great leader Saddam Husayn. He is also a  primary link in the equation that links the past with the  present and the future. This is the link that the enemies of  Iraq and the nation [ummah] are attempting to break with their  reprehensible conspiracies. These conspiracies aim to deprive  young Arab generations of their role and cut them off from their  spiritual and combative history and legacy, in addition to  distorting their culture, motives, and standards, and destroying  their personality.    We are thus facing a new period for students and youth that  is based on the foundation built by the great leader Saddam  Husayn, with his great, unlimited concern for students and  youth. There are many justifications and reasons for this  exceptional concern. Foremost among them is the leader's firm  conviction that students in Iraq understand that educational,  intellectual, and philosophical goals converge in their sector,  making it a pivotal sector. Youths--of whom students comprise a  large segment--are the nation's most vital segment, as stated  above. Concern with youths is thus tantamount to concern with  the nation's present and future.    It is certain that the new leadership of the National  Federation of Students of Iraq and the General Federation of  Youths of Iraq will shoulder many tasks that will guarantee the  achievement of qualitative leaps in student and youth activity.  We believe that this will happen. In order for student and youth  activity to be successful, fruitful, and effective, all state  institutions must cooperate with the programs and plans of these  two federations. We should realize that the development of  mature students and youths is society's collective  responsibility to its young generation. By themselves, neither  the two federations nor other organizations can cultivate mature  young people. Vital slogans must be highlighted, and efforts  must be made to translate them into reality. This requires  collective efforts in which the two federations are  participants, but not the sole participants.    The party for example, as the leader in society, can take  action within social channels on two related tracks. First, it  can protect students and youths from possible behavioral  deviations. Second, it can solve, through education, problems  that might obstruct the progress of students and youths. In this  regard, the party must expand the two federations' cooperation  and integration with pertinent official agencies, e.g., the  Interior Ministry, the Labor and Social Affairs Ministry, the  Health Ministry, the Education Ministry, and the Higher  Education Ministry. The party must also emphasize basic, vital  slogans, and it should do so in harmony with what is put forward  by the two federations and other organizations involved in  student and youth welfare.    Field studies on students, for example, show that most of  the  problems facing students lie outside of the educational  framework (e.g., the college, university, etc.), and even  outside of education itself. In other words, they are social,  economic, and other problems. This means that the scope of  national action with respect to youths will be very extensive  when it is supported by the efforts of other organizations that  bear responsibility for the welfare of students as human beings,  members of this nation, and future leaders.    The election of comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn as chairman of  the Executive Office for Students and Youth will be a great help  and a major, decisive factor in making all party and state  organizations work like a beehive with the two federations to  achieve the goals that have been set. The moral and practical  value of comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn's election by a consensus  to the chairmanship of the student and youth sector is apparent  in this regard. For comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn will solve the  problems of students and youths based on a scientific,  revolutionary, cultural, humanistic, completely integrated  method. Our great leader Saddam Husayn will also solve the  problems of Iraq and the nation. The results of this type of  problem-solving will be great and brilliant.    Comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn's solutions to the problems of  students and youths will certainly be suited to and commensurate  with the major challenges facing Iraq and our nation. They will  be formulated in the light of creative, theoretical thought and  the Ba'thist action of the essential leader, Saddam Husayn. And  they will be formulated within the framework and approach of the  blessed July Revolution, which has supported students and youth  unlike any other revolution, Arab country, or foreign country in  our contemporary history.    We fully trust that the son of the great leader Saddam  Husayn  will play a role--the one for which our leader has raised  him--in enriching the march of students and youths toward  concrete action, and in enriching the major achievements that  have been and will be accomplished for great Iraq. For Iraq has  won its bet through the cooperation and solidarity of its  resistant, patient people. It has won its civilizational bet.  The glorious mother of battles has given us one proof after  another that our future will be bright. The mother of battles  multiplied our reserve of optimism, which is based on facts and  givens.    We have great confidence in our students and youths, because  this faithful, primary segment--which has been raised on true  patriotic principles, on the principles and values of the  nation, and on the directives of the nation's leader, and which  has helped defend the nation at all costs--is no longer an  experiment. It is a living accomplished fact, the crown and wall  of this nation, and the symbol of its vigor.    The historical initiative will always remain in the hands of  generations that maintain the vitality of their combative youth,  the generations of the Ba'thist school, the school of the great  leader Saddam Husayn, and the school of the glorious mother of  battles.</p>

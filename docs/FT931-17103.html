			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Hanson Industries halts Costain's sale of its Australian coal business HANSON Industries, the US arm of the British conglomerate, has won a preliminary injunction in the Missouri courts preventing Costain, the UK construction company, from selling its Australian coal mining business to Altus Finance, part of the French Credit Lyonnais banking group. The court set a trial date for obtaining a permanent injunction for January 19. Costain, however, has filed an appeal over the ruling and requested expedited consideration. Costain had originally agreed to sell the coal mining assets to a Hanson subsidiary, but subsequently announced that it had accepted a higher offer of Dollars 245m (Pounds 160m) from Altus. In early November, Hanson filed a suit in the US courts, seeking to have its Dollars 200m deal enforced and alleging that Costain had given the Hanson subsidiary exclusive negotiating rights.</p>

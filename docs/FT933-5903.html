			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Management: Digging out value for money - Union Miniere of Belgium has employed a wide range of cost-cutting measures Earlier this year Union Miniere, Belgium's big metals producer, found it was paying membership fees for various trade associations totalling BFr165m (Pounds 3m). The discovery was made as the new management dug into every corner of head-office operations, primarily to see if UM was getting value for money but also as part of a quest for further spending cuts. Jean-Pierre Rodier, chief executive, says the divisional managers may still join trade associations but the fees are no longer a corporate, head-office expense. Managers must first justify the memberships and then pay from their own budgets. Rodier's cost-cutting exercise is an illustration of just how much money can be saved by companies which really put their mind to the task. Individually the initiatives can seem relatively minor - the group, for example, found it could save BFr500,000 a year by installing water fountains rather than sticking to tradition and distributing bottled water to staff. Cumulatively the savings can add up. UM used to take pride in the fact that, if any senior executive asked for some information, it was usually provided within two hours. The company found that BFr30m to BFr40m a year could be saved by assessing which data banks were absolutely necessary to the group and by insisting that, whenever possible, these should be accessed at night when rates were cheaper. There was also scope for reducing the cost of employing outside consultants. UM had so many on retainers that it took a great deal of head-office time to manage them. Rodier has now set new guidelines for a 'just in time' system, or 'using a consultant only when we are certain we need one', and reckons UM will save BFr100m a year. Then there was the question of whether Centre du Zinc, an organisation to promote the use of zinc in France, was giving value for money. It was costing UM and Metaleurope, another zinc group, BFr45m a year each to finance the centre. Rodier says UM calculated that, to have justified this outlay, zinc consumption in France would have to increase at 10 per cent a year. 'Of course, this was not happening so we came to the conclusion that we should close the association. It terminates in October.' UM in its present form started life in 1989 when the hitherto autonomous metals-related companies owned by Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's biggest holding company, were brought together. Rodier decided to merge six separate head offices, all in different cities, into one in a small office on the outskirts of Brussels. This action reduced head-office staff numbers from 460 to 235 and cut annual running costs by BFr700m. Rodier says the measures mentioned above, and others, will save another BFr400m a year. The inspiration for these was a cost-value analysis where all spending was itemised and a small management committee decided whether it was of value to the company or not. The cost-value analysis was part of a group-wide exercise to improve annual margins by BFr4bn by 1994-95 compared with 1991. This BFr4bn figure was arrived at by establishing what was necessary to move UM's historic return on equity from the average of 8 per cent which it has achieved over the business cycle to the 14 per cent target which its parent, SGB, sets all its operations. UM, the world's biggest producer of refined zinc, with 11 per cent of the world market and 23 per cent of the European market, also used benchmarking for its manufacturing plants to establish what the targets should be. Benchmarking is a systematic process for identifying, measuring and improving the critical success factors of a business against competitors, especially those recognised as industry leader. This benchmarking exercise identified a BFr500m annual cost gap between the best zinc businesses in the world and UM's - a finding which at first the UM management found difficult to believe because the Belgian group uses some of the best technology available. But when UM looked more closely to see how the gap could be closed, it found a host of very small differences which added up to BFr450m. 'We were not paying enough attention to the day-to-day details of the business, probably because of our excellent technology,' says Rodier. Other areas that required attention included the way maintenance was carried out, the number of people looking after raw materials and even the number of people cleaning buildings. UM's Balen refinery is now using an outside cleaning contractor which pays its employees less than what UM paid each employee, and is expected to clean 50 per cent more area. UM has also changed its pay policy. Bonuses used to be linked to financial results. As Rodier says: 'When zinc prices were high, you got a bonus, when the dollar was high, you got a bonus - no matter what you did.' Now bonus payments are paid only if there is an improvement to bottom-line profit compared with the previous year after the impact of the metal price and dollar rate movements have been removed. Rodier stresses, bonuses are not linked with budgeted figures.</p>

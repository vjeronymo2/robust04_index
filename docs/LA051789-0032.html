			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FERGUSON STILL HOPEFUL OF QUALIFYING AT INDY  </P> <P> Dick Ferguson of Glendale is still confident of making the field for the  Indianapolis 500 despite engine problems that prevented him from qualifying  last weekend at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.  </P> <P> When Ferguson arrived in Indianapolis earlier this month, he accepted an offer  from a local racing car firm to use a March 87C car for qualifying and save his  own March 86C for the race. He installed one of his Cosworth Ford engines in  the March 87C and took it on the track for two days of testing, but  fuel-related problems damaged the engine and forced him to the sidelines.  </P> <P> "We're up against the clock now, but we should be OK," Ferguson said by phone  from Indianapolis.  </P> <P> There are seven positions open for the Memorial Day race -- 26 cars have  qualified -- and Ferguson feels that he can get the March 86C "up to speed" in  this weekend's final qualifying sessions.  </P> <P> "The qualifying speeds are low," he said. "Everybody feels that 212 should be  enough" to qualify. JEFF MEYERS  </P></p>

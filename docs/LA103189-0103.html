			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACEMAKER FIRM TAKES COMPETITION TO HEART;  </P> <P> HEALTH: SYLMAR'S SIEMENS-PACESETTER HAS UNDERGONE ENORMOUS GROWTH TO BECOME THE  INDUSTRY'S NO. 2 COMPANY.  </P> <P> In mid-August, Siemens-Pacesetter Inc., a Sylmar manufacturer of heart  pacemakers, got federal approval to start selling its latest pacemaker, the  Synchrony.  </P> <P> The device, which costs doctors $6,300, is the most sophisticated and expensive  pacemaker Siemens-Pacesetter has yet designed. Chairman Alfred E. Mann believes  that Synchrony will enable his company, the industry's No. 2 player with about  25% of the $1.2 billion in annual worldwide pacemaker sales, to grab an  additional 4% to 5% of the market.  </P> <P> A big jump on the competition? Hardly. Before you could say cardiovascular  system, Medtronic Inc., the industry leader with about a 43% market share, also  got federal approval to start selling its Synergist II pacemaker, which  competes head-on with Synchrony.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Siemens-Pacesetter's ability to bring new products to market in  tandem with Medtronic reflects its rapid growth over the past decade. A unit of  the West German conglomerate Siemens AG, Siemens-Pacesetter expects to post  sales of $250 million for its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, compared to $10.8  million in 1979, Mann said.  </P> <P> Siemens-Pacesetter has fought to overcome the effects of a 1983 scandal in  which the company, a former president and two other executives -- but not Mann  -- pleaded guilty or no contest to federal charges of paying kickbacks totaling  up to $140,000 to doctors who used Pacesetter's pacemakers. The company and the  executives were fined between $2,000 and $40,000 each.  </P> <P> Since that low point, Siemens-Pacesetter has continued growing from an also-ran  to second place in the industry, and its rising stature now forces Medtronic --  and the half-dozen or so smaller pacemaker companies -- to stay on their toes.  </P> <P> "Everybody views Siemens-Pacesetter as the competition," said Bernard F.  McDonagh, who follows the industry for the investment firm Piper Jaffray &amp;  Hopwood in Minneapolis. "You've got Siemens behind them with deep pockets and a  long-term commitment."  </P> <P> Case in point: Siemens, with $30 billion in annual sales, gave  Siemens-Pacesetter the go-ahead to build a $30-million, 208,000-square-foot  plant about a mile from its current headquarters.  </P> <P> Mann said "our ambition is to catch up with Medtronic" in leading the industry,  but he acknowledged that "we have a ways to go." Indeed, although Medtronic's  sales -- which totaled $742 million in the year ended April 30 -- have slowed  from their double-digit growth rate of the mid-1980s, they are still growing.  </P> <P> Carol D. Winslow, an analyst with the brokerage firm Dain Bosworth Inc. in  Minneapolis, where Medtronic is based, said that while Siemens-Pacesetter has  taken some business away from Medtronic, it is mostly snaring market share from  smaller competitors.  </P> <P> Siemens-Pacesetter is "probably hurting Medtronic, but they are not eating  Medtronic's lunch by any means," Winslow said.  </P> <P> About 100,000 Americans will get pacemakers this year; another 18,000 of the  500,000 who already have them will need replacements. The devices cost doctors  between $2,000 and $6,500, Mann said. The cost to patients, after the doctor  and hospital have added their fees, is substantially higher.  </P> <P> Pacemakers help the heart maintain a steady beat by electrically sending pulses  to the heart. Normally, a part of the heart called the sinus node conducts the  heart's rhythm, slowing it down or speeding it up to match blood flow -- and  thus oxygen needs -- to match a person's activity. But when the sinus node's  ability to pace the heart fails, a pacemaker is often needed.  </P> <P> Early pacemakers (the first one was implanted in a human in 1958) simply kept  the heart at a constant rate of 70-75 beats per minute, regardless of whether  the patient was running or sleeping. They also were "single-chamber" devices,  meaning that their pulses were sent only to the lower half of the heart, where  the main pumping activity occurs.  </P> <P> About 75% of pacemakers sold today remain single-chamber devices. But the new  versions can adapt the pacemaker's rate to the patient's activity level. Many  do so with sensors that pick up the body's muscle activity.  </P> <P> The other 25% of pacemakers are "dual-chambered" products, which send pulses to  both the upper and lower chambers of the heart for patients that need such  help. And the Cadillacs of the business are the dual-chambered,  activity-responsive pacemakers such as Synchrony and Synergist II. After they  are implanted, doctors use a tabletop computer to program the pacemakers, thus  synchronizing the upper and lower chambers of the heart.  </P> <P> Mann, 63, started the company as Pacesetter Inc. in 1969 with Johns Hopkins  University, whose Applied Physics Laboratory was searching for ways to improve  the longevity of pacemakers. After more than a decade of development,  pacemakers then lasted only about 18 months before they had to be replaced.  Today, they typically last between five and 20 years, depending on the model  and the patient's needs.  </P> <P> A Portland, Ore., native, Mann already was running two Los Angeles companies  that he had founded -- Spectrolab and Heliotek, which made power systems for  spacecraft -- when he started Pacesetter. He earlier had sold the first two  companies to Textron, with his share of the proceeds totaling $10 million, but  continued managing them until he turned his full attention to Pacesetter in  1972.  </P> <P> In 1983 came the kickback scandal. Mann said most of the charges related to a  program in which Pacesetter gave doctors discounts on Pacesetter pacemakers if  they used the devices to replace patients' current pacemakers, even if they  were rival brands. Mann said he approved the program, and "we still don't think  it was unethical, but it's technically a violation of the Medicare statutes."  </P> <P> Other charges involved some of the Pacesetter executives allegedly paying  doctors in advance for clinical evaluations of their products. Mann said he was  not involved in those incidents, which "were totally contrary to my  directives."  </P> <P> Brian M. Mann, Mann's son and Siemens-Pacesetter's current chief operating  officer, said the kickback case "had a negative effect, but not a major  effect," on the company's sales growth. But he said it was not the reason that  Siemens, which had unsuccessfully made several attempts to invade the U.S.  pacemaker market itself, bought its way in by purchasing Pacesetter in 1985.  </P> <P> Alfred Mann declined to disclose the purchase price, but sources said it was  between $100 million and $200 million, with just under half going to Mann for  his stake in the company.  </P></p>

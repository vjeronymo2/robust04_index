			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Economics: Focus turns to Germany and worries about interest rates and prospects A RUSH of figures in Germany will turn attention this week to the state of Europe's biggest economy. Analysts are expecting the indicators - including industrial production, manufacturing new orders, and employment data - to confirm that the economy is 'going nowhere'. Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Greenwell Montagu, suggests that 'a barely changed level of industrial output in January on the month may look better than December, but it ranks poorly in comparison to rises of 5.1 per cent in January 1992 and 2.7 per cent in 1991'. Prospects for monetary easing after the Bundesbank's regular council meeting on Thursday will add to the interest in Germany although the market is divided over whether the central bank will cut officially posted rates. Labour figures on Friday are forecast to show a fall in west German employment of around 20,000 reflecting the decline in manufacturing industry. The following are some of the week's other economic highlights. The figures in brackets are the median of analysts' forecasts from MMS International, a financial information company.

			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> QUAKE FISH: Oscar, Corona del Mar High's famed earthquake prognosticating fish,  wasn't around to forecast Wednesday's temblor (A1). . . . "Oscar bit the dust  -- he took a deep-six on us about a month ago," said Principal Tom Jacobson. .  . . The one-eyed South American red oscar died of "simple old age," he said.  </P> <P> "The legend of Oscar is that just prior to a quake, rather than swim  vertically, he would swim flat on his side." His keeper, biology teacher Ron  Schnitger, credited Oscar with correctly predicting up to 20 quakes in three  years. There were no funeral services. Kristina Lindgren and Mark Pinsky  </P></p>

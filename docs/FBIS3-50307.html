The meeting was also attended by Czech  Defense Minister Antonin Baudys, President's Office Head Lubos  Dobrovsky told journalists.    Havel and Kolodziejczyk agreed that the approach of the  Czech  Republic and Poland towards the U.S. Partnership for Peace plan  was very close and in many points fully identical, he said.  Havel spoke in favor of continuing consultations and  cooperation in those fields where they could speed up the  modernization of armaments systems in the cheapest way.    Baudys described Kolodziejczyk's visit as the beginning of a  broad cooperation between the two countries' armies and defense  ministries and as the starting point of realizing the necessity  of a dynamic approach towards the Partnership for Peace project.    Kolodziejczyk said NATO standards should be introduced in  both armies as soon as possible and that they should jointly  proceed towards a secure Europe. He invited Baudys to visit  Poland. Kolodziejczyk, who is leaving for home today, was in  the Czech Republic at Baudys's invitation.</p>

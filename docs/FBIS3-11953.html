			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] FRAPH, the Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and  Progress of Haiti protested the U.S. Embassy's initiative to  organize a ceremony to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the  ratification of the Haitian Constitution. FRAPH reminds the  American Embassy that the Haitian Constitution remains a Haitian  matter.    [Begin Emmanuel Constant recording] Given the irresponsible  behavior of some of our politicians, the U.S. ambassador thought  it was useful to remind the Haitian political sector, all ot  them together, that there is a Constitution in Haiti and that  our country's fundamental law provides very clearly in Article  1: Haiti is an indivisible, sovereign, independent, democratic,  and social republic. FRAPH is making a point in referring to the  tactlessness of reminding all foreigners who are not subtly  interfering in our internal matters that Haiti's law formally  prohibits interference. FRAPH urges the Haitian people to be  more vigilant to safeguard the higher interests of the nation.    Therefore, since it is a matter of commemorating the seventh  anniversary of the vote on our constitution, we invite all  foreign personalities to carefully read our fundamental law,  particularly Article 19. As for Haitians who intend to respond  to this invitation, we tell them that the Haitian nation will  finally know who are the real stateless persons and who are the  real collaborators.

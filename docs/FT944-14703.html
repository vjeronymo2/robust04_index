			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Butte Mining Butte Mining, the London-listed company, is to receive 400,000 shares in Gem River Corporation, equivalent to 8.5 per cent of the issued capital, as a reward for its work exploring Gem's sapphire property in Montana. Gem has completed a private placing of 850,000 shares at Dollars 2 each to raise about Dollars 1.7m (Pounds 1.07m) net and intends to seek a listing on a recognised stock exchange. Butte has been given pre-emptive rights to participate in the public offering to be made when the shares are listed. Butte's employees in Montana will transfer to the Gem River project with a consequent reduction in Butte's costs. Gem will use the money raised to acquire the freehold of a 600-acre property, which is said to have proven and probable reserves of more than 3m carats of sapphires.</p>

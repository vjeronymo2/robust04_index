			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LENNON PHOTOGRAPHER HAPPY WORK IS BACK;  </P> <P> ART: BUT ANNIE LEIBOVITZ IS STILL DISTURBED BY THE EARLIER ACTIONS OF  FULLERTON'S MUCKENTHALER CULTURAL CENTER.  </P> <P> Photographer Annie Leibovitz issued a statement Friday saying she is "glad"  that her nude portrait of John Lennon is again part of the Muckenthaler  Cultural Center's "Heroes, Heroines, Idols and Icons" show. But she added a  cautionary note.  </P> <P> "I fear this is not the last time this sort of censorship will be attempted,"  she said. "In the current political climate, people are running scared. What  worries me is how much self-censorship there is. Artists and cultural  institutions are anticipating controversy and backing off from something they  think might be criticized. This is no way to run a culture -- or a free  country."  </P> <P> The portrait -- which appeared on newsstands around the world nearly 10 years  ago, as a cover of Rolling Stone magazine -- had been removed by some trustees  who said they didn't think it was in keeping with the show's theme. Thursday,  after nearly a week's worth of controversy, the full board of trustees voted  unanimously to put the picture back on the wall.  </P> <P> But though Lennon's portrait was back, eight photographs of homeless men by  Mark Story had been taken down.  </P> <P> Despite the trustees' reversal, Story sent a telegram to the center Friday  asking for the immediate return of his works, which had been part of the same  exhibit. "I don't like the general smell of pressure (when) art that isn't  deemed acceptable (is) removed from a show," he said. Friday afternoon,  according to a spokeswoman for the center, Story's pieces were being packaged  for shipping.  </P> <P> Curator Norman Lloyd, who himself has resigned over the controversy, was  nonetheless upset by Story's action. "He's made his statement," Lloyd said  Friday. "Now all he's doing is ruining the show. Why punish the whole city for  the actions of a few?"  </P></p>

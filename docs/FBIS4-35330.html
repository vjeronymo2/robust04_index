			<p>BFN     [Text] In an exclusive statement to the MBC Television,  Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has stated that the government he has  been charged with forming aims to end the war and to prevent the  disintegration of Yemen. He stressed that contacts are under  way with parties and independent people in the south to form a  government.    [Begin recording] [Al-'Attas] By taking this step, we hope  to  prevent disintegration and to maintain the situation that  existed before unity was established on 22 May 1990, that is the  existence of two states in Yemen. In light of the bitter  experience of unity over the past four years we can examine this  experiment and its problems and mistakes and lay down the  foundations to make things right.    [Question] What is the working program of this government?    [Al-'Attas] The main task is first to implement the Pledge  and Accord Document which enjoys national consensus in Yemen and  which was endorsed after being formulated by various political  forces. Within the framework of this task, we must remove the  effects of the war which has destroyed numerous establishments  and left a great deal of damage in the hearts of the people. We  must act to remove these effects.    [Question] You have visited the United States, Britain,  Egypt, and now Syria, did you gain support from these countries  for your stances?    [Al-'Attas] Certainly, in all our meetings in the United  States, Egypt, and Syria we felt considerable support for the  efforts being made in the Democratic Republic of Yemen to halt  the war and address the damage, primarily to end this war which  is destroying our people and exposing them to the danger of  disintegration.    [Question] Thus, there is hope for establishing a unified  Yemen in the future. What are the foundations on which Yemen  must be built?    [Al-'Attas] During the national dialogue we emphasized the  principle that resorting to war would mean striking at unity.  This war that was declared by the military leadership in Sanaa  has struck at the Yemeni unity. However, the failure of this  unity now does not mean that the goal is gone, or removed from  our national tasks. We must assess the situation, pause, and  look to the future with optimism.    [Question] In Cairo, you requested placing the Yemeni crisis  on the UN Security Council agenda. What do you expect from the  Security Council?    [Al-'Attas] As an international organization responsible for  security, stability, and peace in the world, we expect it to  take the necessary measures and pass resolutions to halt the  bloodshed and the ongoing war. We have great confidence that  the Security Council members and the permanent members will make  a decision to stop this war. [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["hen"-signed report: "Iranian Risks Do Not Require </F> Addendum to the Budget"]    [Excerpt] Bonn -- The FRG Finance Ministry on Friday [18  February] confirmed upon inquiry that Iran is in danger of being  in default with approximately 4 billion German marks [DM] of  short-term liabilities, which have developed within the  framework of Hermes-covered trade. In this connection, however,  the ministry denied a report by DIE WELT, claiming that this  loss in payments would have already its full effect on the  federal budget in 1994 and would require an addendum to the  budget.    Rather, it is true that Iran currently has problems with  repaying short-term Hermes-covered trade loans on time.  Meanwhile, DM420 million of that have been recognized as losses  and compensation has been paid to the German creditors. The  total amount of DM4 billion will be "refinanced" from short to  medium-term loans by a German banking consortium -- as this has  been done in the past -- so that one cannot speak of a specific  risk to the budget for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, it  is a fact that Iran has serviced its medium and long-term loans  punctually so far and is, therefore, not to be considered a bad  debtor, it was noted. In the view of experts, Iran's short-term  payment problems are primarily due to oscillating oil prices, as  well as the country's temporary great need for imports. [passage  omitted]</p>

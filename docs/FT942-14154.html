			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Sales growth puts Bentalls back in the black at Pounds 1.75m Bentalls, which operates seven department stores in the south-east of England, returned to the black for the year to January 29 on the back of good sales growth. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.75m, compared with losses of Pounds 986,000, although the the latest figure contained non-recurring profits of Pounds 321,000, largely reflecting successful appeals against the uniform business rate. Turnover from continuing operations was 11.3 per cent higher at Pounds 78.9m. Turnover last time of Pounds 72.4m included Pounds 1.55m from discontinued operations, mainly from the charge card business sold in November 1992. Mr John Ryan, finance and property director, said turnover had improved because of an increased number of customers passing through the store at the flagship Bentall Centre in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, and a good performance at the store at Lakeside, Essex, acquired from receivers in 1991 for Pounds 1m. Christmas had seen the emergence of pent-up demand following the November budget. He said, however, that sales so far this year had improved by only 6.7 per cent, reflecting consumer caution ahead of the April tax rises. The group said that 86 per cent of space at the Bentall Centre, excluding the department store, had been let. Under an agreement with Norwich Union, its co-developer, Bentalls will receive a minimum income of Pounds 1.65m a year from the centre, and does not expect this to be exceeded until 1996. The high tax charge of Pounds 799,000 (Pounds 872,000 credit) reflected the company's depreciation policy which is higher than allowed for by the Inland Revenue. Net interest payable was Pounds 1.74m, compared with Pounds 1.11m in 1992, when Pounds 1.62m of interest was capitalised. Earnings per share were 2.25p, against losses of 0.28p. A final dividend of 1.4p is proposed, taking the total to 2p (1.9p).</p>

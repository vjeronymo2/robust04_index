			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Do It All chain could be halved - Decision on future of lossmaking DIY stores expected next week WH Smith and Boots are expected to announce early next week that they plan to sell or close up to half the stores in their lossmaking Do It All DIY chain, with resulting provisions totalling more than Pounds 60m. Analysts believe the joint venture partners are preparing to announce that they have already agreed to dispose of slightly fewer than the 70 stores - almost a third of the chain - which had been widely mooted. However, they plan to sell more stores, taking the eventual total to about 100, or almost half the chain. Boots and WH Smith refused to comment on the speculation surrounding the disposal package, but confirmed that a statement would be made soon. Boots announces its full-year results next month. The total provisions, divided equally between the two groups, are expected to be more than the Pounds 55m to Pounds 60m previously forecast - reflecting the increased number of stores to be sold - but less than the Pounds 80m quoted in recent press reports. They include asset and stock write-offs, redundancy costs, and a provision to cover the cost of converting remaining stores to a new format, called the New Trading Concept. The partners plan to spend about Pounds 10m this year converting a further 38 Do It Alls to the format, taking the total to 82. The new concept groups products together according to different projects, with customer displays on how to carry out these projects. Analysts believe the main buyers of the Do It All stores are Asda, which will convert them into Dales discount grocery stores; PC World, the computer superstore chain owned by Dixons; and Staples, the office superstore joint venture between the UK's Kingfisher and Staples of the US. Among other buyers are thought to be Courts, the furniture retailer, Aldi and Netto, the discount food retailers, and the Focus DIY group. WH Smith said in January that its share of losses at Do It All, after interest, for the six months to November 27 were Pounds 8.3m. The partners believe that if they can dispose of underperforming stores, Do It All can return to profit relatively quickly. But analysts suggest returns would have to be increased substantially before the group could be sold.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] We begin this newscast with the full text of the  agreement on the Bosnian-Croat federation.    In accordance with the resolutions of the constituent  assembly of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, its authorized  representatives at a meeting held in Vienna 7-11 May 1994  concluded the following agreement:    A proposal will be submitted to the Bosnia-Herzegovina  constituent assembly that the first president of the federation  for the interim six-month period will be a candidate from the  Croat people and the vice president will be a candidate from the  Bosnian people. On the expiry of the six-month period the post  of president will be taken by a representative of the Bosnian  people and that of vice president by a representative of the  Croat people.    The first president of the federation following the interim  period will come from the ranks of the Bosnian people.    In the coming government reconstruction it will be ensured  that the post of prime minister goes to a representative of the  Bosnian people and the post of deputy prime minister to a  representative of the Croat people. The deputy prime minister  will also head the Ministry of Defense. Under the draft law on  the government of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, the  government will comprise the prime minister, the deputy prime  minister, 11 ministers with portfolio, and four ministers  without portfolio.    Ministers from the Bosnian people will head the following  ministries: Internal Affairs; Foreign Affairs; Transportation  and Communications; Energy and Industry; Urban Development;  Resources and Environment; Refugees and Social Policy; and the  Ministry of Education, Science and Culture.    Ministers from the Croat people will head the following  ministries: Defense in the person of the deputy prime minister;  Finance; Justice; Trade; and Health.    Of the four ministers without portfolio, one will be from  the  Croat people. The territory of the federation was defined on  the basis of the criteria agreed by both sides and attached to  the agreement. The maps defining the territory of the  federation and of the cantons constitute an integral part of the  agreement. In the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina there will  be two cantons with a special administrative arrangement  [rezim]; their working names are the Central Bosnia and Neretva  cantons.    In accordance with the above, arrangements will be proposed  for inclusion in the constitution of the federation to ensure  that, in line with the arrangements applicable in the  federation, the cantons will guarantee equality to the  constituent nations of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The harmonized text of the proposed changes to the  constitution of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina is an  integral part of the agreement.    The signatories of the agreement are committed to starting  work immediately on setting up bodies of municipal authorities  in accordance with the constitution of the Federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the areas where there are justified  interests provisions will be made on the basis of common  criteria defined in accordance with the constitution to redefine  and change municipal borders.    A commission set up on a basis of parity will be formed to  search for missing persons.    The signatories have agreed to recommend to the constituent  assembly of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in accordance  with the agreement, to pass relevant bills within its  jurisdiction.    Following consultations with President Izetbegovic it was  agreed that the first president of the federation in the interim  six-month period should be from the ranks of the Croat people.</p>

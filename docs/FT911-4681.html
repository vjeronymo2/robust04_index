			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Bond Corp subsidiary in winding up reprieve EUROPEAN bond holders owed a total of USDollars 1bn by Australia's teetering Bond Corporation are due to hold their delayed meetings next month to vote on a proposed reconstruction of the group in which they would take about 70 per cent of the equity. The bond holders were given some hope yesterday that Bond Corp would survive until the meetings when the liquidator to subsidiary J. N. Taylor agreed in an out of court settlement to delay winding up proceedings against Bond Corp Finance, the Bond Corp finance arm. BCF owes J. N. Taylor Dollars 180m. When J. N. Taylor was placed in liquidation last year it also triggered the collapse of Bond Corp. The J. N. Taylor liquidator, Mr Richard England, agreed yesterday to temporarily withdraw his action to seek a provisional liquidator to BCF while he examined BCF's books. He has agreed to stay his hand until next Friday. Yesterday's proceedings in the Supreme Court of South Australia, the state in which J. N. Taylor is incorporated, were adjourned until Monday week pending the outcome of Mr England's examination. He is expected to decide then whether to press ahead with his winding up application against BCF, or take part in the reconstruction. Bond Corp's largest single creditor, Bell Resources (now known as Australian Consolidated Investments), which is owed Dollars 430m, has tentatively agreed to take part in the scheme of arrangements and exchange its debt for equity in Bond Corp. Bond Corp executive director Mr Kim McGrath, said yesterday the company would begin advertising the dates of the bond holders' meetings in European newspapers today. Convertible bond holders will be asked to meet in London on May 9, the Swiss debt holders in Geneva on May 16 and the German Eurobond holders in Frankfurt on May 31.</p>

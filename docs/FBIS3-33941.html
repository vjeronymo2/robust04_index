			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Palestinian authority in the Gaza Strip and  Jericho will receive $170 million annually from taxes collected  by Israeli Government bodies. Ya'ir Fidel, our economic  correspondent in Tel Aviv, was apprised of this fact by a  business source connected to the political process. This sum  will furnish one-third of the Palestinian authority's budget.  The source of the money will be port taxes, fuel surcharges,  other taxes, and national insurance dues, which will be  collected for the Palestinians by Israel.</p>

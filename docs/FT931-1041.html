			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Brazil: 'the problem is lack of shame, not lack of money' GERALDO MARINHO lives on a hill with one of the most spectacular views in the world. Spread out below is the palm-fringed crescent of Rio's Sao Conrado beach, lined with luxury apartments blocks, their rooftop swimming pools glimmering in the sun. Unlike those he looks down upon, Mr Marinho lives with his seven-member family in a crumbling two-roomed shack in Rocinha, one of the many favelas, or slums, clinging to the hills of Rio, and the largest in Latin America. Mr Marinho's home is reached through a labyrinth of narrow passageways, crowded with similar shacks. No door can shut out the fetid smell from the black stream of sewage and litter gushing alongside with its constant threat of diseases such as cholera. Mr Marinho is one of 43m Brazilians living in poverty. Brazil has one of the world's biggest gaps between rich and poor. The richest 20 per cent earn more than 26 times the poorest. Despite being the richest economy in Latin America and the ninth largest in the world, Brazil's infant mortality and illiteracy rates rank along with Bolivia and Guatemala as the worst in the continent. The world's second largest food exporter, Brazil has scenes of hunger comparable to famine-struck Africa. Mr Jutahy Magalhaes, minister for Social Well-being, sums up: 'We are simultaneously the most developed and the poorest country in Latin America. We export technology and manufacture satellites yet we have not erased diseases of the middle ages.' Long ignored by politicians, Brazil's 'social apartheid' is now provoking hot debate. The army minister has warned of social unrest and President Itamar Franco has called for his ministers to devise poverty eradication programmes after receiving a 'hunger map' showing 32m Brazilians suffering chronic malnutrition. Those in Rocinha are sceptical. 'Governments are just for the rich,' says Mr Jose Carlos de Souza from the Favela Association. The rapid industrialisation which transformed Brazil from a sleepy coffee economy to an industrial power and saw an annual growth rate of 7 per cent between 1940 and 1980 served largely to strengthen the grip of the elites. Today's real minimum wage of Dollars 64 (Pounds 45) per month for example is two-thirds of its 1940 level. The recession of the past three years has worsened the situation, with higher unemployment and inflation. Brazil's poverty has been made more visible by the rural migration which accompanied industrialisation. Since 1960 the proportion of the population living in cities has risen from 40 to 75 per cent. Official figures show the number of favelas in Rio has increased from 373 to 570 in the past 10 years; in the city of Recife they are home to 44 per cent of the population. According to Mr Jutahy, Brazil's housing deficit is 10m and rising. Most poverty is concentrated in the north-east. The area suffers blistering yearly droughts because of the lack of infrastructure to harness the country's rainfall. Despite the government's current cash crisis, Brazil's social problems do not emanate from a lack of funds. Rather than tackle the real causes, politicians have offered short-term solutions such as emergency food-baskets, usually around election time. Much of the money allocated to social programmes is lost through waste and corruption. Mr Jutahy estimates as little as 15 per cent of federal funds reach their intended destinations. A World Bank official says: 'This wouldn't be so bad if what was left was spent usefully, but it's not.' This has discouraged action by international agencies. Mr Agop Kayayan, Unicef representative in Brazil, says: 'I feel like Don Quixote tilting at windmills.' The fact that the problems can be tackled is demonstrated by the recent experience of Ceara, Brazil's third poorest state. Despite inheriting a bankrupt administration on becoming governor in 1986, Mr Tasso Jereissati managed to reduce infant mortality by a third. He says: 'The problem in Brazil is far more lack of shame than lack of money.' The Jereissatis in Brazil are few; people are losing hope in the future and all faith in the political system. 'We are heading towards an explosive situation,' says Mr Jutahy. Brazil is the world's second largest market for private jets, yet 52 per cent of the working population earn less than Dollars 120 a month. Shocked by the contrast between Brazil's haves and have-nots, particularly visible in Rio, visitors often ask why there is no revolution. In fact, groups from the favelas have taken to attacking supermarkets and emptying them of produce. One can be shot for a pair of sneakers or have one's hair hacked off at knifepoint. In some ways the revolution has already started.</p>

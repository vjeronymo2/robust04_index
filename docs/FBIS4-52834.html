			<p>BFN     [Text] The Panel on Import Promotion, Market Access  Improvement, and Distribution under the Administrative Reform  Promotion Headquarters held a meeting at the Prime Minister's  Official Residence on the morning of 12 May to discuss ways to  relax regulations in the distribution field. Isao Nakauchi,  chairman of Daiei, other businessmen, and scholars, who attended  the meeting as members of the panel, criticized government  ministries and agencies for balking at relaxing bureaucratic  regulations.    The panel held the meeting for the first time since the Hata  cabinet was inaugurated. Speaking to members of the panel, Prime  Minister Hata stated, "It is the mission of my cabinet to relax  the bureaucratic regulations effectively." After the prime  minister left the meeting room, bureau chiefs from ministries  and agencies concerned briefed members of the panel on their  respective plans for deregulation in the fields of opening of  outlets by large-scale department stores, the sales of  second-hand goods, and the establishment of gas stations.    In their briefing, all bureau chiefs indicated the  difficulty  in promoting deregulation. In response, one member after another  of the panel voiced discontent with the briefing, saying: "We  want to hear from you about how your ministries and agencies  plan to vigorously relax the regulations. We believe that it is  time for ministries and agencies concerned to pool their wisdom  and announce plans for fruitful deregulation."    The Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters will  include  deregulatory steps in a package of external economic measures  that the government will map out at the end of June. The  headquarters will use the discussion at the panel only as  reference material. The business community is voicing discontent  with the government, saying, "If the work of relaxing the  bureaucratic regulations is left in the hands of bureaucrats,  bold measures for their relaxation cannot be expected."</p>

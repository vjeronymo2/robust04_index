			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIDWEST QUAKE FEARS ARE BOON TO COUNTY COMPANIES;  </P> <P> SAFETY: MARKETERS OF SURVIVAL KITS REPORT SURGE IN BUSINESS FROM THE NATION'S  HEARTLAND, WHERE A MAJOR TEMBLOR HAS BEEN PREDICTED.  </P> <P> "The Big One," NBC's fictional account of a major earthquake in the Los Angeles  area, hadn't yet hit the airwaves when the phones started ringing at Great  Shakes Inc. in Brea a month ago.  </P> <P> The company, which packages earthquake survival kits, wasn't getting inquiries  from local folks worried about a calamity. The pickup in business came from  folks living half a continent away.  </P> <P> Great Shakes is among a number of Orange County companies who report a spurt in  business due to a surge in earthquake awareness along the Mississippi River,  from Chicago to Memphis, where residents have been warned by a scientist to  prepare for a major temblor in early December.  </P> <P> "There aren't very many businesses back there that specialize in earthquake  survival," said Tommy Rainey, vice president of Emergency Lifeline, a Santa Ana  firm that sells emergency survival kits and conducts earthquake preparedness  seminars. "When people in Missouri think of quakes, they think of Southern  California."  </P> <P> Climatologist Iben Browning, 72, of New Mexico said in March that an unusual  alignment of planets on Dec. 2 and 3 would create a 50% chance of a major quake  then on the New Madrid fault.  </P> <P> In response, several school districts and cities in the fault zone, which runs  from Marked Tree, Ark., to Cairo, Ill., have made tentative plans to dismiss  students and pull together disaster and public safety workers during the  critical two-day period.  </P> <P> And as December draws near, newspapers and radio and television news programs  in the region have focused attention on Browning's warning and reminded  residents of the great New Madrid quakes in the winter of 1811-12.  </P> <P> A series of quakes, including four that scientists say would have measured  between 8 and 8.7 on the Richter scale had that measuring system existed at the  time, rocked the then sparsely settled region that winter. No other earthquake  in the United States has been rated as high as 8.7. The San Francisco quake of  1905 has been rated an 8.3-magnitude temblor, and the Bay Area quake of Oct.  17, 1989, was recorded at 7.1 on the Richter scale.  </P> <P> The New Madrid quakes -- which were felt as far east as Washington -- destroyed  scores of cabins and farm buildings, killed dozens of people and reportedly  reversed the flow of the Mississippi River for a brief time.  </P> <P> As people living along the New Madrid fault have been reminded of the nearly  2-century-old devastation, the fear in the heartland has meant better business  for certain companies in Southern California.  </P> <P> Emergency Lifeline, started in 1985 by Kathy Gannon -- a native of Missouri --  has seized the opportunity to plug into the region's new quake awareness by  launching a program of safety seminars in Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee and  Kentucky. The firm also has mailed 10,000 catalogues to quake-zone addresses,  hoping to spur mail-order sales of its survival kits.  </P> <P> Great Shakes sales manager Marvin Marquis said his firm also has mailed  catalogues -- more than 5,000 of them -- to schools and businesses in the New  Madrid fault zone and has been receiving inquiries about its survival kits from  people in that region for more than a month now.  </P> <P> The company, which has 300 employees and operates several branch offices around  the country, offers a variety of retail and custom-designed survival kits that  include food and water, first-aid and sanitation supplies, survival equipment  and, at the upper end of the price scale, emergency shelter.  </P> <P> Retail kits, the type generally ordered by individuals or small businesses,  cost $12.95 to $3,995, Marquis said. Custom kits can run "many thousands more,"  he said.  </P> <P> Like Emergency Lifeline, Great Shakes also conducts safety seminars and just  completed a series in Chicago and Memphis that was geared to earthquake  survival.  </P> <P> Officials at several civil and structural engineering firms in Orange County  said they haven't experienced any recent increase in business, either from the  Midwest or from locals responding to NBC's two-part earthquake movie, which  ended Monday night.  </P> <P> But that, they said, is because they deal with corporate and government clients  and not with individuals, who are more likely to be upset and spurred to action  by a movie like "The Big One."  </P> <P> Shawna Sandoval, a receptionist and secretary at American First Aid Supply in  Brea -- another of Orange County's survival-kit marketers, said Monday that she  saw an increase in phone orders after the first part of the TV movie aired  Sunday night and that she expects more calls today "after the part runs that  shows all the destruction."  </P> <P> Sandoval, who handles the company's phone orders, said she also has seen a  definite increase in orders and inquiries from the Midwest in recent weeks.  </P></p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Letter: The FT and the British election - wrong, wrong but for the right reasons, and right Sir, Following your editorial supporting the Labour party in the election I have cancelled my regular order for the FT. I do not support the left in politics. Therefore, as it is all too obvious the FT feels that way inclined, I have no alternative but to cease taking it.

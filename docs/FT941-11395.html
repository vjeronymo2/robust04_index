			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Arts: Today's Television There are trios of programmes on both BBC2 and C4 tonight which, though not compelling, are tempting. At 9.00 BBC2 shows the fifth episode in its re-run of the first series of Red Dwarf, which satirises all those deep-space movies from Star Wars to Alien. That is followed by Further Abroad, the last in Jonathan Meades' hilarious series that folds architecture into social observation. This week's subject is Belgium (9.30). Then comes a repeat of Blackadder II in which Miranda Richardson gives an unforgettable portrayal of Elizabeth I as a mischievous eight-year-old (10.00). Two repeats, but good repeats, and one wholly original programme. At 9.30 C4 shows the first episode in a new American comedy, Home Improvement, which seems to have a doubtful basis for an entire series (a DIY obsessive whose home 'improvements' always go wrong). That is followed (10.00) by Roseanne, which makes some people laugh. Then (10.30) comes the extraordinary series The Unpleasant World Of Penn &amp; Teller, also American, which blows the gaff on conjuring.</p>

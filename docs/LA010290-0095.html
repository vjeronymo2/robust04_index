			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: WHITLOCK GIVES LOARA MORE THAN A SHOT IN THE ARM  </P> <P> Two things could be predicted about the Loara High School basketball team the  last two seasons: Tes Whitlock would score a lot and the Saxons would lose a  lot.  </P> <P> As a freshman, Whitlock averaged about 15 points a game and Loara won five only  games. Last year as a sophomore, he averaged 22.7 and the Saxons won four.  </P> <P> This season, there has been quite a turnaround. Whitlock is averaging 30.8  points, but the Saxons are 11-0.  </P> <P> It's the Saxons' best start in the history of the school and the most games  they have won in a season since 1978, also the last time they qualified for the  playoffs.  </P> <P> "If I didn't score 28 (last year) we weren't even close," Whitlock said. "This  year I can score 14 and we can still win."  </P> <P> That hasn't happened often this season for Whitlock, the Times' Athlete of the  Week.  </P> <P> Friday, he scored 40 points, including 17 of the team's 19 first-quarter  points, in Loara's 70-65 victory over Pacifica in the championship game of the  Pacifica tournament. He also scored Loara's first 17 points, making his first  seven shots. He made 14 of 20 shots in the game, missing only a dunk and five  three-point shots.  </P> <P> Whitlock, whose full first name is Monttes, scored 108 points in three  tournament games and was named the most valuable player of the event. He also  led Loara to the championship of the Garden Grove tournament earlier in the  month and was named the MVP.  </P> <P> But it's a mistake if opponents believe that they can stop the Saxons if they  can stop Whitlock, said Coach Jerry Halpin, who is in his first season at  Loara.  </P> <P> "We're not just a Tes team," he said.  </P> <P> Though Whitlock scored 27 of Loara's 37 first-half points against Pacifica, the  Saxons still trailed by five. It was only when other Loara players contributed  that the game was turned around. Whitlock only scored 13 in the second half.  </P> <P> Halpin said Whitlock, who moved with his family from Chattanooga, Tenn., before  the seventh grade, has improved his perimeter shooting since last season when  opponents would stop his drives and force him to shoot outside.  </P> <P> "He's killing people who are doing that to him this year," Halpin said.  </P> <P> But Whitlock, who is averaging 8.8 assists, isn't selfish, Halpin said. He only  takes shots when he is open and there are no plays designed to get him the  ball.  </P> <P> "I know I get a lot of individual attention, but the team knows I'm with them,"  Whitlock said. "It's not just me. We won two tournaments together."  </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Guard Augustin Heredia of Estancia averaged 21 points in four games to lead the  Eagles to third place in their tournament. Heredia scored 26 points on Saturday  as Estancia defeated Los Alamitos, 79-60.  </P> <P> Cherokee Parks averaged 26 points and 12 rebounds for Marina in the Orange  tournament. Wednesday, he had 37 points and 19 rebounds, making 14 of 15 field  goals in an 82-71 overtime victory over El Toro.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda's Keith Walker set a school record on Saturday by making 26 of 28  free throws as he scored 47 points in the Wildcats' 84-53 championship victory  over Compton in the Brea-Olinda tournament. Walker also had 16 rebounds and six  assists before fouling out with a minute to play.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tes Whitlock  </P> <P> Loara High School  </P> <P> Position: Guard  </P> <P> Height, Weight, Class: 6-2, 185, Junior  </P> <P> Last Week: Whitlock scored 108 points in three games as Loara won the Pacifica  tournament title.  </P> <P> Season: Whitlock is averaging 30.8 points and 8.8 assists.  </P></p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Markets: Concerned consumers worry the brokers - Wall Street THE STOCK markets are approaching the second quarter reporting season with trepidation. This might seem odd, since most economists on Wall Street agree that economic growth between April and June will prove to have been healthier than during the previous three months, when gross domestic product grew by a miserly 0.7 per cent. Yet, if recent profits warnings are to be believed, the (admittedly modest) improvement in underlying economic conditions during the second quarter will not have translated into a widespread improvement in corporate profitability. Over the past two weeks companies representing a broad cross-section of business have announced that their second quarter profits will not match market expectations. Among the bigger names warning of poor earnings were Kmart, Nike, Reebok, American Airlines, USAir, Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, Apple Computer and Chemical Waste Management. Investors are so jittery about corporate earnings that even companies whose earnings are holding up have suffered at the hands of the edgy markets. This week Caterpillar stock dived briefly on reports that the company had indicated its overseas sales were weak. Caterpillar denied the reports. Earlier, similar rumours struck Hewlett-Packard shares, even though the computer group insisted it remained upbeat about its prospects. While there has been a smattering of positive corporate news lately - Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber predicted on Thursday that its second quarter income would be better than analysts' forecasts - there has not been enough to rid the markets' nagging concerns that the coming reporting season will prove a disappointment. Recent economic reports have been equally discouraging. This week saw a big drop in May durable goods orders, unexpected weakness in mid-June car sales, the downward revision in first quarter GDP numbers, and a Federal Reserve survey (the 'Beige Book') which reported only moderate economic growth and forecast that business activity would probably slow. The news from the political arena was not particularly helpful, either. The Clinton tax-raising, expenditure-cutting, deficit-reducing economic package may have squeaked through the Senate on Thursday night, but investors were not necessarily overjoyed at the President's good fortune. While the bond markets like Clinton's economic measures because they are seen as an attempt to shrink the federal deficit, the stock markets worry that higher taxes and lower government spending will undermine an already fragile economy. Thus, over the next few weeks investors face the prospect of a muted economic recovery and less-than-sparkling second quarter corporate earnings. If the economy and earnings fail to catch up with the optimistic expectations that have been built into share prices, then the markets will have to give back some of the gains earned earlier this year. Yet stocks have been holding their ground. At around 3,490, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still within 70 points, or 2 per cent, of its all-time high, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index is also within a couple of percentage points of its record. This resilience is primarily a reflection of continued huge flows of investor cash into equities (much of it via the booming mutual fund industry) and hopes that low interest rates will fuel the market, and the economy, for the rest of the year. These two factors are inextricably linked, because investors are shifting large amounts of money into stocks because low interest rates are destroying the returns they earn on short-term assets like money market funds and bank certificates of deposit. So long as rates remain low, that money will keep rolling into equities. And rates remain extremely low. Earlier this year the yield on the 30-year government bond was above 7 per cent. This week, thanks to encouraging inflation data, the 30-year yield dropped to 6.72 per cent, close to its all-time low. Low interest rates, however, are not enough to sustain corporate America. Companies' borrowing costs may have been lightened because of the easing in credit conditions, but domestic demand has proved worryingly fickle. Fearful of unemployment, unhappy about the prospect of higher taxes, and pessimistic over the economic outlook, consumers are retreating. This explains many of the recent profits warnings. Clothing sales have been poor at Kmart, too many Nike and Reebok sportshoes remain on the shelves, and seats are empty on American and USAir. People are not spending, and the markets are worried.

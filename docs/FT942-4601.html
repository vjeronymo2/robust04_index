			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Mexico-US sugar row looms - A potential trade dispute with its roots in Nafta A planned switch by Mexico's Coca-Cola bottlers from domestically produced refined sugar to imported corn syrup is threatening to set off a trade dispute between the US and Mexico, the world's largest per capita consumer of soft drinks. It all began with last-minute changes to the sugar export provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which both the US and Mexico argued were necessary to win ratification of the accord in the US Congress. The original rules gave Mexico an annual sugar export quota of 250,000 tonnes, which the US promised to lift automatically if Mexico proved to be a net sugar exporter for two consecutive years. This rule was designed to prevent Mexico from importing cheap sugar to satisfy national demand while exporting domestically produced sugar to the US market where tariffs keep prices high. Under the revised provisions, Mexico agreed that imports of corn syrup would be included, thus preventing soft drink bottlers and other industrial users from switching to imported corn syrup to free up sugar for export. A third of Mexico's average 4m-tonne annual sugar production is consumed by industries that could switch to cheaper corn syrup. Now, as Coca-Cola bottlers study plans to switch - for a capital outlay of between Dollars 1m and Dollars 2m per bottling plant they can save several million dollars a year on raw materials and transportation costs - they and the US Corn Refiners Association are accusing Mexican trade officials, sugar producers and Pepsi bottlers of erecting an embargo against corn syrup. The CRA has alleged that the Mexican sugar industry with the support of Dr Jaime Serra Puche, Mexico's minister of trade, has put pressure on Mexican bottlers not to use high-fructose corn syrup. It also alleges that bottlers have been threatened with a boycott by sugar suppliers - which would mean they would have to convert 100 per cent to a sugar replacement - if they do not co-operate. The trade ministry is under political pressure to protect the domestic sugar industry. Militant sugar workers hurt by the industry's privatisation have taken over various mills while others are permanently camped in front of the presidential palace in Mexico City. Coca-Cola bottlers say that sooner or later competition from low-cost imported soft drinks made with corn syrup will force them to move away from refined sugar. The boycott threat would be real only if domestic sugar producers can limit the amount of sugar traded on Mexico's sugar futures market, which began operations in March. So far only 38 per cent of monthly sugar purchases are taking place on the market. The rest is sold directly by mills to industrial users and by middlemen who still control about 30 per cent of the sugar trade. Coca-Cola bottlers say that with such little volume traded on the new market, they would be forced to pay even higher prices for their principal raw material should mills cancel their direct contracts. The current average price of refined sugar traded on the futures market - Dollars 656 a tonne - is already about 7 per cent higher than industrial users pay in their direct contracts with refiners.</p>

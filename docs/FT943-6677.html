			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Stake sale hope lifts telecoms Enthusiasm for cellular telephone stocks spilled over to Securicor and its subsidiary Security Services. Some in the market became convinced that Securicor would sell its 40 per cent stake in Cellnet to majority stakeholder BT sooner rather than later. Mobile phone take-up has escalated this year and the arrival of Mercury one-2-one, the Cable &amp; Wireless subsidiary, and Hutchison's Orange have only served to stimulate demand. An industry lunch with analysts focused attention on Cellnet and the potential boost to the Securicor share price following a stake sale. Some specialists say the shares could hit 1400p. The tightly traded A shares consequently rose 54 to 984p with relatively heavy turnover of 1m. Meanwhile, C&amp;W improved 9 to 478p as speculation returned that its Hong Kong telecom arm was poised to win the principal telephone contract in China. Also, some specialists returned to the sum-of-the-parts argument which sees the Hong Kong stake as being worth around 400p to 420p a share. This would mean that the remaining businesses were sorely undervalued. BT shares firmed a penny to 390 1/2 p.</p>

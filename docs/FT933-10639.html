			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / The school of hard knocks: Can the European Community survive the pressures imposed by the ERM debacle In Brussels yesterday, senior European Community officials appeared in shock as they woke up to a world of floating European exchange rates. The explosion within the European exchange rate mechanism ends 15 years of relative currency stability and will play havoc with farm support prices, the Common Agricultural Policy and the EC budget. 'We have not experienced anything like this,' said Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner. 'We may have to adjust farm prices every third day.' Sir Roy Denman, former EC ambassador in Washington, was one of the few looking beyond immediate setbacks and remaining sanguine. He argued that the case for exchange rate stability and monetary co-operation leading to a single currency is as strong as ever. Paraphrasing General Charles De Gaulle's message on June 18 1940, Sir Roy said: 'Europe has lost a battle, but it has not lost the war.' As the dust settled, the list of political casualties grew. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, who pleaded in vain on Sunday night for the D-Mark to leave the ERM, looks mortally wounded. For it was Mr Delors who seized upon the ERM as the vehicle for forcing European economies to 'converge' in order to reach European Monetary Union (Emu) within a fixed timetable. Mr Delors' world of grand designs and logical structures was suited perfectly to the expanding European economies of the 1980s, which paved the foundation for the single European market; but the pillars of the old order came tumbling down through the external shocks of German unification and a deeper-than-expected recession. Now the Community must discover whether it has the strength and political resilience to recover its internal equilibrium, or whether more turmoil is in the offing. As one senior EC official put it: 'The question is not whether we can move forward, but whether we avoid going backwards.' Commission officials are already starting to lay the groundwork for a rearguard action. The strategy will be discussed at a meeting of the full Commission on Friday, at which Mr Delors, still suffering from sciatica, will be present. The first priority will be to stress that the ERM is not dead but remains 'in suspended animation'. All the EC finance ministers, including Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, came down against suspending the entire ERM system when they met in Brussels on Sunday. There was a common understanding of the importance of trying to maintain currency stability. Thus the old EMS structures remain intact; the same rules on intervention apply, albeit within much wider fluctuation margins; and there is at least the technical possibility that the one-time hard core of stronger currencies, including the German, French and Benelux, can be put back together again. Meanwhile, the Commission will continue to press the case for economic convergence according to the timetable laid down in the Maastricht treaty, stricter budget discipline, and the preparation for the second stage of Emu, due to begin on January 1 1994. This involves tighter EC surveillance of European economies and the (largely symbolic) opening of the European Monetary Institute, the forerunner of the putative European Central Bank - assuming EC leaders can agree on a location and a president. The second priority will be the single market. Largely ignored in recent months because of monetary turmoil, the 1992 project to allow the freedom of movement of goods, services, people and capital continues to gain in credibility. Last week the Commission unveiled plans for harmonising the protection of design and intellectual property rights; this week, the risk is that de facto floating exchange rates could tempt member states into competitive devaluations which could undermine the single market. The third priority is enlargement negotiations with Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Community membership for the sceptical Nordics was always going to be a hard sell; the dent in the EC's image means it will be even harder. The fourth priority will be Mr Delors' own white paper on competitiveness - the wide-ranging study on why Europe is failing to create jobs at the rate of the US and Asia, and what it can do to restore steady economic growth. Mr Wim Kok, Dutch finance minister, said early yesterday that the Delors paper could serve as the basis for a much more profound reflection on the common push for Emu. In Mr Kok's view, the crisis in the ERM had exposed fault-lines within the Community. The deflationary pressures inherent in Maastricht's convergence criteria had pushed up unemployment in member states, raising threats to social stability. Some member states were clearly unwilling to pay the price of staying the course - a blunt reference to France. It is now clear that it will be virtually impossible for most EC member states to meet the convergence targets on government debt, inflation and budget deficits by 1997, the date for monetary union. Mr Christophersen conceded as much yesterday when he agreed that the earliest date for Emu could only occur if a majority of currencies were in narrow ERM fluctuation bands by the end of 1994 - a prospect that seems remote. Some in the Commission would like to see a loosening of the convergence criteria to make Emu more credible. But such a development looks unlikely in the face of Germany's insistence that domestic economic interests take precedence over European considerations, and that the price of giving up the D-Mark for a single currency must be price stability. These twin imperatives were displayed by the Bundesbank's token interest rate cut on Thursday. This left the French franc at the mercy of the financial markets. The climax came on Sunday when the Germans would not let the French bully them into a de facto revaluation of the D-Mark or a public commitment to reduce short-term interest rates. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, spelled out on several occasions in his early morning press conference yesterday that the Bundesbank had gone out of its way to support weaker member currencies. 'We have more than fulfilled our (ERM) obligations.' Such strong words betray a certain resentment over French tactics; but one European monetary official countered that the French and Germans had at least opened the crisis talks on Sunday with a joint proposal for the D-Mark to leave the system - only to have the deal founder on the opposition of the Dutch, followed by Belgium, Luxembourg and Denmark. Thus, Germany is ready to compromise; but continues to be the dominant force within the Community. In the past 12 months, events such as the initial Danish rejection of Maastricht have raised questions about whether the treaty is the correct approach for accommodating Germany, or whether looser arrangements are required - for example, accelerating membership of former communist countries. Commission officials argue that inviting Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, or even Slovenia, into the EC would destabilise the Community and could wreck uncompetitive eastern economies. But some German officials and other diplomats acknowledge that early membership could help to balance German might while strengthening the political cohesion of the former eastern bloc countries. An equally profound question-mark hangs over the resilience of the EC itself, and whether it is simply 'a fair-weather community', an institution which can function efficiently only in good economic times but which remains acutely vulnerable to external shocks - such as the war in former Yugoslavia. This is the third time, after all, that the dream of European monetary union set out in the Werner report in 1970 has foundered. First came the 1973 oil-shock; then the second oil-shock in 1979. Now, German unification appears to have blown the project off-course. Mr Christophersen is optimistic. Putting on a brave face yesterday, he rejected the UK government's assertions that there were 'fault-lines' in the ERM. 'I don't think the system was flawed, but the system was more fragile than we thought.' He could well have been talking about the Community.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Building workers 'cheated' of wages on German sites Hundreds of British construction workers lured to German building sites by the promises of high wages have been left destitute after being cheated by unscrupulous labour agencies and employers, the UK Building Employers Confederation said yesterday. In a single month this year, British consulates in Germany made arrangements to ship home 150 construction workers in distress, according to the Foreign Office. The confederation claims many more workers are still stranded or trying to make their way home unaided. Consulates will make travel arrangements and help individuals trace friends and relatives who might pay for fares, but they do not provide money. One 19-year-old Londoner was paid the equivalent of Pounds 10 for four weeks grinding the surface of bricks in a German car park before being dismissed for allegedly poor work, according to the confederation. Conditions on the site were very poor. A big rise in eastern German construction following the unification of the country has increased demand for cheap labour sucking in thousands of temporary workers from eastern Europe, Turkey and Britain. German construction workers, under the country's strict labour laws, are much more costly than foreign workers, many of whom are uneducated or do not speak German. They find it difficult to complain about appalling living standards or dangerous working conditions. Mrs Elizabeth Bridge, the building confederation's director of taxation services, said she was alerted to the scale of the problem after UK construction workers requested information on how to reclaim German tax paid on wages. They had been duped into accepting lower wages on the false grounds that British authorities would repay the tax. Many of the labour agencies advertising for bricklayers, plasterers and scaffolders in British national newspapers are based in Belgium or the Netherlands. Job seekers mostly are interviewed in bars or public places. The agencies cannot operate legally in Germany itself. A 36-year-old scaffolder who answered an advertisement in the Sun newspaper was told to make his way to a Frankfurt hotel where he waited for three days with about 50 other workers. Their potential employer never arrived - presumably because he did not get the contract - and the scaffolder was left with a Pounds 400 bill. The agents could not be traced. Two brothers from Glasgow told how they were expected to live in a hut on the building site, without sanitation or electricity with nine other workers. After complaining of the stench, one of the brothers was placed in bed and breakfast accommodation. After various deductions, including paying for their accommodation, they received less than Pounds 25 for two weeks' work.</p>

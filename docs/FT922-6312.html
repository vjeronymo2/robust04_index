			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Central Capital's deficit deepens after write-offs CENTRAL CAPITAL, once one of Canada's fastest growing financial services groups, suffered a final loss of CDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 1.25bn) for 1991 after writing off Dollars 760m covering its investment in 80 per cent-owned Central Guaranty Trustco. In 1990, Central Capital reported a loss of CDollars 44m. Central Capital, controlled by financier Mr Leonard Ellen, quadrupled its assets to CDollars 17bn in a buying spree in the last half of the 1980s. Guaranty Trustco operates the country's fourth largest trust company, which has been hit by the long recession and drastic decline in property values in eastern Canada. Central Capital's total loss also included write-downs of investments in subsidiaries and a CDollars 200m write-off of goodwill. It is negotiating with its vendors to restructure its debt. About 63 per cent of the trust company's business, including assets of CDollars 7bn, is being sold to Canada Trustco and National Bank of Canada, and the rest will be consolidated mainly in southern Ontario, if regulators approve.</p>

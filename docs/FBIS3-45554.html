He emphasized that as long as  both sides strictly abide by the principles guiding the  establishment of diplomatic relations and relevant principles  underscored in the Sino-French joint communique, Sino-French  relations will be gradually improved and grow.    Wu Jianmin made these remarks in response to a question at a  news conference this afternoon.    A reporter asked: The governments of China and France issued  a joint communique on 12 January. Please comment on the  prospects for developing Sino-French relations.    Wu Jianmin said: "In most of the past 30 years since the  establishment of Sino-French diplomatic relations, fruitful  cooperation has been conducted in the political, economic and  other fields. However, in recent years, the authorization by  the previous French Government of the sale of arms to Taiwan  seriously undermined bilateral relations. We believe that as  long as both sides strictly abide by the principles guiding the  establishment of diplomatic relations and relevant principles  underscored in the Sino-French joint communique, Sino-French  relations will be gradually improved and grow."</p>

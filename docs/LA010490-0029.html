			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MAQUILADORA GROWTH DOWN CONSIDERABLY IN '89  </P> <P> Affected perhaps by political uncertainty and insufficient labor and water  supplies, the growth in maquiladora permits issued in the Tijuana region slowed  considerably in 1989 contrasted with the previous year.  </P> <P> Maquiladoras, the plants operated by foreign manufacturers in Mexico to take  advantage of low-cost labor, reached a total of 680 in the Tijuana-Tecate area  at year's end, up 17% from the 579 foreign-operated plants in operation a year  ago. The total of new permits issued in 1988 represented a 45% increase from  the previous year.  </P> <P> Despite the decline, Mexican officials said the permits demonstrate that  maquiladoras are still popular among foreign manufacturers, particularly those  making products destined for the U.S. market. Employees working at the plants  in the Tijuana area increased over the year to 70,758, up 34% from the 52,957  workers employed at the end of 1988.  </P> <P> And maquiladoras should continue to proliferate in 1990 if the recently  liberalized rules governing them have the desired effect of boosting  applications, said Jose Luis Ascolani, the Baja California delegate of the  federal Secretary of Commerce and Industrial Development, the agency  responsible for issuing maquiladora permits.  </P> <P> Among the changes decreed Dec. 22 by the Mexican federal government is the  centralization of seven different permits and approvals required to open a  maquiladora within the regional SECOFI offices, Ascolani said, a move that  should considerably streamline and shorten the time required for permit  approval.  </P> <P> The new laws also ease the transference of supplies and components among  foreign manufacturers in Mexico, and increase the percentage of goods produced  by maquiladoras that can be sold inside Mexico, from 20% to 50%.  </P> <P> The laws, which also allow foreign companies for the first time to bring their  own telecommunications equipment into Mexico, also make maquiladora permits  good for an indefinite period, as opposed to the two-year limit previously in  force.  </P> <P> In another move to attract more maquiladoras, the Mexican government, in  response to protests lodged by foreign manufacturers, has indefinitely shelved  a proposed 2% tax on maquiladora assets, Ascolani said.  </P> <P> Some foreign manufacturers considering moves to Mexico were discouraged last  year by the shortage of labor in the Tijuana area, a condition that has  resulted in fierce competition for workers and a high rate of employee  turnover, said Tony Ramirez, vice president of Made in Mexico, a Chula  Vista-based consulting company that assists manufacturers in setting up  maquiladoras.  </P> <P> Political uncertainty caused by the election in July of Ernesto Ruffo Appel as  governor of Baja California. Ruffo, who was a candidate for the National Action  Party, or PAN, opposing the entrenched Institutional Revolutionary Party, or  PRI, may also have given some companies pause, industry observers said.  </P> <P> Shortages of water and power in certain areas of Tijuana may also have been  responsible for the drop-off in maquiladora permit applications in early 1989,  Ramirez said. He said interest has rebounded in recent months, however, largely  because some of the shortages have been alleviated.  </P> <P> Acknowledging problems with Mexico's "infrastructure," the broad-based term  used to describe utilities, public works, transportation and labor, Ascolani  said the government hopes to improve the situation in part by privatizing many  state-owned corporations, a move designed to attract increased foreign  investment.  </P> <P> For many manufacturers, Mexico's disadvantages are obviously outweighed by its  pluses, led by low hourly wages. Including taxes and benefits, average hourly  wages are about $1.30, a fraction of the cost of comparable labor in the United  States, Ramirez said.  </P> <P> "The maquiladora concept is generating a lot of interest in other than U.S.  companies," Ramirez said. "We have seen a lot of European interest, electronics  companies mainly. Manufacturers of wood-related products, such as furniture and  cabinetmaking, also showed increased interest last year."  </P> <P> The largest category of maquiladoras at year's end was electronics, with 131  plants, Ascolani said.  </P></p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / People: Bank of England Jon Foulds, chairman of Halifax Building Society since 1990, has been appointed an independent member of the Bank of England's board of banking supervision, otherwise known within the bank as 'Bobs'. He takes up his appointment to Bobs following the death of Nigel Robson in February this year. A former chief executive and deputy chairman of the venture capital 3i group, the 61-year-old Foulds holds a number of other directorships including Eurotunnel, London Atlantic Investment Trust and Mercury Asset Management. In mid-1990, he left the engineering and aerospace group Brammer where he had been non-executive chairman from 1988. An advisory body, Bobs has a widely roving brief to speak to the governor of the Bank of England on a variety of issues, particularly general principles and policy concerning supervision of institutions which are authorised to act under banking legislation. It has teeth, if it cares to use them; during its last financial year, 1992-93, a period of upheaval in the aftermath of the collapse of BCCI, it met 19 times as opposed to its more conventional 11. 'Appointments to the board are made jointly by the governor of the Bank and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and its members have the right to speak directly to the Chancellor if they feel the advice they are giving is being disregarded,' says Foulds. The board has six independent and three ex-officio members from the Bank - the governor, deputy governor and head of banking supervision. The shooting, skiing and tennis-playing - 'when I have time' - Foulds will receive a remuneration of Pounds 11,000 annually for his five-year stint at the board.</p>

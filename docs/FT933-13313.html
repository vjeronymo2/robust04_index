			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Observer: Adam's angel Adam &amp; Co, the small Edinburgh private bank snapped up by the Royal Bank of Scotland, was yesterday sounding a little uncertain as to whether Madame Francoise Schlumberger Primat would accept its invitation to remain on the Adam board. On balance the view was that the septuagenarian angel who injected Pounds 21m last year when the bank was on the brink of collapse would not be staying on. Although the reclusive grande dame shuttles regularly between her two French chateaux, her estate in Shropshire and her house in south-west Ireland, and could presumably still fit in a side trip to Edinburgh on occasion, she is 'hedging slightly' over accepting the directorship, according to Adam's outgoing managing director, James Laurenson. 'Although her English is quite good, she finds a lot of people talking together at board meetings quite hard.' She's a realist and is not upset at any aspect of the sale, says Laurenson, who claims that all her business will be staying. No doubt RBS will be pleased to hear that; she is easily the private bank's largest customer.</p>

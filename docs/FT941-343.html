			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Morgan Grenfell Latin trust raises Pounds 64m Morgan Grenfell has raised Pounds 64.2m with the launch of its Latin American Companies investment trust, Pounds 53m of which came from an institutional placing. A similar fund, the Inca trust from Edinburgh Fund Managers, raised about Pounds 30m during its placing. The result of its public offer is not yet known. Both trusts had initially set higher targets, but Morgan Grenfell said that given market conditions during the offer period, it was very satisfied with the amount raised. The placing for a third Latin American fund, from Templeton, is still under way. Dealings in the Morgan trust's shares and warrants are due to start tomorrow.</p>

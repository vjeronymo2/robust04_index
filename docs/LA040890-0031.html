			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PATHS TO PARK VARY, BUT HOMELESS FIND A COMMUNITY THERE;  </P> <P> ALONDRA: REGULARS WORRY, RAGE, GRIEVE, AND POOL RESOURCES OF FOOD, BOOZE AND  COMPASSION.  </P> <P> The glistening lake and inviting lawns of Alondra Park lure visitors from all  over the South Bay.  </P> <P> Some come for a stroll, some a bicycle ride, others spend an afternoon fishing  or feeding the ducks and geese.  </P> <P> Some people, however, come to stay.  </P> <P> Nestled in a stretch of unincorporated county land surrounded by Torrance,  Lawndale, Gardena and Hawthorne, Alondra Park has become an unofficial haven  for the South Bay's homeless population, a place where they gather to share  what meager resources they can scrounge in their constant struggle to survive.  </P> <P> "You get people who are anywhere from their 20s to their 50s," said Michele  May, chairwoman of the South Bay Homeless Coalition. "The reasons (they are  homeless) vary greatly. For one person, it's a divorce. For another, they were  laid off. Basically, it's the cost of housing around here and . . . then just  one little thing seems to set a whole wheel of things into motion that makes  them end up here."  </P> <P> May estimates that 50 people call Alondra Park home, but social workers say as  many as 30 more people who live in corrugated cardboard huts on nearby freeway  embankments can be counted as part of Alondra's community.  </P> <P> During the hours when the park is open to the public, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.,  Alondra's regulars can be found in scattered groups throughout the park,  sleeping on tattered blankets, sorting through soiled bags and boxes of  belongings and, sometimes, sharing a bottle of cheap wine.  </P> <P> After 10 p.m., however, the homeless of Alondra melt into the darkness to stay  clear of the county's Safety Patrol officers, who enforce park hours, and to  dodge police officers from the three city departments and the county Sheriff's  Department, who want them to stay out of their jurisdictions.  </P> <P> At times, the homeless spend their nights being bounced from one jurisdiction  to another.  </P> <P> "I was at another park, and the police hassled me and said, 'Go to Alondra  Park,' " said Gary Ellison, 36, an out-of-work electrician. "You go across the  street, they say, 'Go back to Alondra Park.' You go back in the park, they say,  'Get out of the park. It's after hours.' That's how I get my exercise, going  back and forth."  </P> <P> The more fortunate residents of Alondra own the battered cars and vans that dot  the park's long, narrow parking lot along Redondo Beach Boulevard. The cars  must be moved every night, but in the eyes of those with nothing at all, even  the most dilapidated car is a treasure -- a private place to store belongings,  to stretch out for an undisturbed nap or to escape the rain and winds of  winter.  </P> <P> Alondra Park's regulars are as attentive to their community as a first-class  Neighborhood Watch group. They carefully check out newcomers, freezing out  belligerent people who could pose a threat to the park's harmony, but creating  a network of emotional support for those who pass muster.  </P> <P> Barbara Chew, 47, joined the group in February when several Alondra Park  regulars met her at the Inglewood armory, where the homeless are allowed to  stay during the area's coldest weather. Delighted by the fast-paced tales she  told in her breathless New York accent, they took her back to Alondra with them  after the armory closed in the morning.  </P> <P> Gnawing on a raw carrot, Chew rocks nervously from foot to foot as she explains  how she hit the streets after her husband died in 1988, eventually wandering  down to the South Bay from the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> "I just couldn't take life anymore. I was very down and depressed," she says.  </P> <P> Tears well up in her eyes and slide slowly down her face.  </P> <P> "I just know if my husband was here, I'd be OK," she says.  </P> <P> One of her new Alondra friends looks up as he digs through a box of groceries.  </P> <P> "We're here," he tells her. "You're OK."  </P> <P> Over the years, residents of the park have broken into two factions of  homeless. The gregarious old-timers, eager to show newcomers the ropes, tend to  stay in the park's southern half. Chronic alcoholics, drug addicts and the  isolated troublemakers of the park, many incapable of coexisting peacefully  with anyone, stick to the park's north side.  </P> <P> Grocery distribution takes place in the uneasy neutral zone that Alondra's  residents call "middle park."  </P> <P> Those who live this tenuous existence often make light of it to outsiders. All  view it as a temporary condition. To do otherwise, even briefly, is to admit  defeat.  </P> <P> But even approaching Alondra Park as a short-term home can be demoralizing.  </P> <P> "I'm going to get work again, and I'm going to get out of here, but, man, it  seems like forever," Ellison said, wiping his hand across his forehead. "You're  homeless, you're depressed, and you're going to be tempted. Yeah, I drink. . .  . Otherwise, you're going to go insane."  </P> <P> On this day, Ellison and some buddies have gathered to get groceries from a  group of church volunteers, who each Wednesday stage a morning worship service  before distributing the overripe fruit and vegetables, day-old bread and other  excess food they have collected from local markets and restaurants.  </P> <P> The grocery distribution creates a rare festive atmosphere at Alondra. Even  homeless women and families, usually so careful to blend into the mainstream or  hide elsewhere, come out openly for their share of the food.  </P> <P> Cynthia May, 30, (no relation to Michele May) used to walk her dog in Alondra  when she lived with her boyfriend in a nearby house.  </P> <P> "He met somebody else, and he said, 'Goodby,' " May said, shrugging as she  talked about the loss of her home last June.  </P> <P> Now, she sleeps behind one of the park restrooms and sorts through the  vegetables and instant noodle packets offered by the church workers each week.  </P> <P> "I've learned the ropes. I share with everybody," she said.  </P> <P> Like many of Alondra's regulars, May relishes good community gossip, eagerly  whispering confidences about who's going into a detoxification clinic and who  might be pregnant.  </P> <P> "It's just like a 'Peyton Place' around here. Everybody knows what everybody  else is doing," she says.  </P> <P> Many residents of Alondra Park are mentally unstable and unable to care for  themselves. Those who are stable keep an eye on their incapacitated friends. If  they sleep too late in the morning, they wake them to check that they're all  right. They bring them food and water when they are too lethargic to find it  themselves or when hallucinations make them lose track of when they ate their  last meal.  </P> <P> Alondra's regulars have been especially worried these last few weeks about Ted,  a bedraggled street person who has lived on the corner of Prairie Avenue and  Manhattan Beach Boulevard for two years.  </P> <P> For months, Ted's only delight was his dog, a black, hairy mass of an animal  named Pal that slept peacefully by his side as Ted sat under the park's  bleachers, carrying on conversations with himself through an imaginary  telephone receiver in his hand. Passers-by would stop to talk to Pal and Ted,  occasionally drawing Ted out of his dementia for a few minutes.  </P> <P> But Pal didn't have a license, or a leash. In January, animal control officers  took her away. Ted's tenuous grip on reality has faded dramatically since then.  </P> <P> "I hate to see people lose their self-respect," Mike Smith, 27, resident  philosopher of Alondra, said sighing. "They lose so much of their self-respect  out here. It's a hurt. It's a hurt to see."  </P> <P> That pain is shared by a growing group of local volunteers, who have begun a  slow process they call "outreach," a careful building of trust that they hope  will let them match some of Alondra's regulars with social programs that could  bring them back into the mainstream of society.  </P> <P> "I used to go to Alondra to feed the ducks and then I found out that people  were going there to feed people and I said, 'This has got to stop,' " said  volunteer May, 32, a Torrance administrative assistant who became an advocate  for the homeless less than six months ago.  </P> <P> The coalition she chairs was created last year to bring attention to the  problem.  </P> <P> "They're just people like you and I, and it's not right at all that they have  to be reduced to this," May said. "There has to be something more we can do for  them."  </P> <P> Social workers for Crossroads, a Redondo Beach program for mentally ill  homeless people, began bringing sandwiches and clothing to the park a year ago  in an effort to find out who was living there and what services they could use.  </P> <P> Since then, their outreach program has been turned over to the coalition, whose  members take turns keeping tabs on residents of Alondra and several other South  Bay parks. The problems they have found at Alondra are typical of homelessness  everywhere.  </P> <P> "Approximately one-third are mentally ill," said Caroline Hill, a Crossroads  employee who helped create the outreach program. "At least 80% are (occasional)  substance abusers and of those, about 20% are what you would call the real  chronic alcoholics or drug addicts. The rest just use it to cope with their  situation."  </P> <P> Instead of helping them survive, however, the drugs and alcohol more often  slowly destroy all hope for Alondra's regulars.  </P> <P> "You have to drink. This park will drive you out of your gourd if you don't,"  explained Mitch Nicholson, a 28-year veteran of the Marines, one blustery day  just before Thanksgiving. "I have to get out of this park. Somehow, someway, I  have to get out of this park."  </P> <P> A bandy-legged, tough-talking, hard-drinking little man, Nicholson won a soft  spot in the hearts of his Alondra friends through his generosity with his  pension checks and beer. Late last year, he announced that he had heard of a  program in Santa Monica that might help him get back into an apartment.  </P> <P> "I'll probably end up dying in this dump," he groused, shortly before leaving  Alondra. "You got to die someplace. Might as well be Alondra."  </P> <P> Nicholson disappeared shortly after. Several weeks later, he was found dead,  apparently of natural causes, in a Santa Monica alley.  </P></p>

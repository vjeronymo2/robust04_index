			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, April 19 (AFP) -- The Somali Patriotic  Movement (SPM) and the Somali National Alliance (SNA) have  pledged to cooperate with all foreign humanitarian missions  operating in southwest Somalia and to contribute towards a  peaceful atmosphere in the region.    A statement, released here on Tuesday [19 April] and signed  by SPM chairman Omar Jays, was reacting to Monday's attack on a  UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) relief plane at the  southwestern Somali town of Afmado, in which a Gambian UNHCR  employee was killed.    In the statement, the two factions which control southern  and  southwestern Somalia also pledged that they would carry out  investigations to determine who were responsible for the tragedy.    Alhadji Keba Sanneh, 53, was in an UNHCR plane arriving in  the southwestern town from Nairobi when unidentified armed men  opened fire, killing him, but four other people inside the  aircraft escaped unhurt.    Sanneh was nominated last week by UN High Commissioner for  Refugees, Sadako Ogata, as head of the cross border aid  operations organised from Kenya since September 1992.    In her reaction to the death on Monday, Ogata said in Geneva  that "the death will remind Somali leaders of the tragedy into  which Somalia has been plunged and encourage them to renew their  determination to find peace".</p>

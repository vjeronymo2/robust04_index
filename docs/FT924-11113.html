			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Jupiter Tyndall tops Pounds 3m after acquisition push JUPITER TYNDALL, the fund management and banking group, yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.16m for the six months to June 30 1992. The figures reflected the acquisition of Tyndall Holdings, announced in August 1991. Mr John Duffield, chairman of Jupiter Tyndall, said, therefore, that the interim results published last year were not directly comparable. Mr Duffield said that about 55 per cent of profits came from the investment management division, where funds under management stayed constant at Pounds 950m. Mr Leonard Licht, formerly of Mercury Asset Management, has joined the group as head of the investment division. He has been given a 'golden hello', believed to be about Pounds 1m, which will be treated as an exceptional item in the year's accounts. It is also proposed to grant Mr Licht a special option scheme, which will need the approval of shareholders at an extraordinary meeting. The board is planning to bring in three further option schemes; for domestic employees; for overseas employees; and for executives. Jupiter has spent much of the year in dispute with investment trusts in the former Tyndall stable and has lost two management contracts. However, earlier this week it won victory in its efforts to have three representatives appointed to the board of one former Tyndall trust, CST Emerging Asia. The banking division was able to maintain deposits at Pounds 350m, despite the loss of some funds following the sale of the Jersey Trust administration business. After tax of Pounds 575,000 and minority interests of Pounds 151,000, earnings per share were 7.02p. An interim dividend of 3p is declared. In last year's interim results, pre-tax profits for the four months to end-June were Pounds 455,000, earnings per share were 2.69p and the interim dividend 2p. Mr Duffield said 'The economic climate has, always, many uncertainties and, in fund management, profits must always be sensitive to the respective levels of the stock market. 'Subject to these matters, I am confident of the prospects of our group.'</p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMS TRADE  </P> <P> The role of the United States as a peacemaker in the world brings into question  the flourishing international arms trade, with the United States as the major  supplier of armaments.  </P> <P> In 1985 the global trade in major weapons reached $36 billion, of which $24.7  billion went to Third World nations. The United States is also the major  supplier of the technology that other countries want in order to produce their  own nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. The military industries thrive  while the weapons we sell or give outright to countries with whom we share  security interests encourage invasions, civil wars and the migration of 14  million refugees roaming the world, driven from their homes by war.  </P> <P> Before World War II the hidden arms trade and black markets were the domain of  munitions makers. As contracts have grown into billions of dollars, the sale of  weapons has become government policy.  </P> <P> What is the response of Congress to all of this? What do the American people  want? Do they want to live permanently in a war economy?  </P> <P> ALICE BANOS  </P> <P> Concerned Faculty at UCLA  </P></p>

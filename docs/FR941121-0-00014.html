			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Notice to Existing Accountholders <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A national trade association commenter requested that NCUA delete a statement in proposed comment 4(c)&hyph;4, which stated that credit unions complying with part 707 in advance of the compliance date would need to comply with all aspects of part 707. NCUA staff has verified the position in the proposed comment with FRB staff, and since NCUA must maintain substantial similarity with the FRB, and no uniqueness grounds were presented in order that an exemption could be justified, NCUA has not changed the proposed comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four commenters requested that NCUA clarify that credit unions that have complied with TISA and part 707 requirements before the compliance date, need not send second disclosures. The NCUA Board has clarified this in comment 4(c)&hyph;4. The Board also wishes to clarify, in response to a question raised by a commenter, that NCUA does not require any credit union to issue new accounts, including new certificates, on the mandatory compliance date of part 707. All that part 707 requires is <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  that credit unions send a notice to certain members of the availability of disclosures, or the disclosures themselves, by, on or soon after the compliance date, to have disclosures reflecting the terms of accounts offered available, to make certain periodic statement and advertising disclosures, and to pay dividends on the full balance in the account using the daily balance or average daily balance method. Basically, no new accounts need be issued; only accurate disclosures conforming to part 707 reflecting accounts need be available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 707.5_Subsequent Disclosures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Change in Terms <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)(1) Advance Notice Required <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the comments of eleven commenters, including a national trade association commenter, comment 5(a)(1)&hyph;1 has been amended to clarify that unless credit unions have reserved the right to change terms in the account agreement or disclosures, they cannot change terms by simply providing a change-in-terms notice, and to clarify that change-in-terms notices can be included as a highlighted portion of a credit union's newsletter provided to all affected members. Another commenter requested that guidance in the final NCUA Truth in Savings rule allowing notice by means of mail, newsletters, and statement stuffers, be provided in the commentary. Final Rule, 58 FR 50394 at 50422. The Board has added this information to the final commentary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 5(a)(1)&hyph;3 provides guidance on an institution's responsibility to provide change-in-term notices when account disclosures reflect a term that will change upon the occurrence of an event. The comment has been revised to conform with the final Regulation DD commentary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter requested guidance on which terms needed change-in-terms notices in order to be changed. Section 707.5(a) refers to those terms required to be disclosed under &sect;707.4(b), if the change may decrease the APY or adversely affect the member. The NCUA Board believes the spirit and intent of TISA is that most changes in the required account disclosures should be disclosed to members to enhance the ability of members to comparison shop for accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (a)(2)(ii) Share Draft and Check Printing Fees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to FRB comments received, comment 5(a)(2)(ii)&hyph;1 has been expanded to exclude increases in fees for printing deposit and withdrawal slips from change-in-term notice requirements, although NCUA, like the FRB, believes that separate charges for deposit and withdrawal slips, which are typically provided along with checks, are seldom imposed. Many FRB commenters stated that, like check printing fees, fees for printing deposit and withdrawal slips are not within the institution's control, since the consumer determines the quantity ordered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Notice for Term Share Accounts One Month or Less That Renew Automatically <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NCUA believes that 20 days is a reasonable amount of time to provide these disclosures, particularly in light of small credit unions, some only open one day each week, which would be subject to this requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 707.6_Statement Disclosures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

And the government should the measures to guarantee pupils  nine-year compulsory education.    Education lags behind economic development due to the more  than four decades of centrally planned economic development  which preceded the market reforms of the early 90s.    And experts say that the geographical distribution of  universities and colleges is irrational--they are sited  according to old administrative district boundaries.    Most of the country's universities and colleges are located  in big cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Xian while backward  areas, where talent must be nurtured as a matter of urgency,  still have to rely on government allocation of university places.    In many colleges, the curricula lack flexibility and are  limited in scope.    As a result college students graduate with little knowledge  of areas outside the subjects they have majored in and may find  it difficult to fit into the work environment.    Universities usually emphasize theoretical knowledge at the  expense of practical know-how.    For decades, the country's education system has been  government- dominated. The State used to pay tuition fees and  had the final say in the students' job assignments.    Though the situation has improved quite a bit in the last  few  years, public enthusiasm in the form of donations--money,  facilities, private schools--has been either neglected or  discouraged, experts say.    Enterprises failed to play their role in helping students  combine theoretical studies with work experience.    But as local governments get more industrial power and new  geographical economic blocks take shape, it is inevitable that  the distribution of the country's colleges and universities will  become more rational, experts say.    And the "invisible hand" of the market will also stretch out  and influence university curricula, the experts point out.    But the State, while loosening its grip on university  management, should not completely give up its educational  control. The government should see to it that due attention is  paid to underpinning courses like teacher training. These  courses, the experts point out, are vital to the country's  national long-term interests.    Out in the business market, success will depend on workforce  training programmes, according to enterprises managers in the  People Daily's forum.    After all, high-level technical and managerial personnel  help  enterprises improve product quality which in turn brings the  firms more profits.    And professional management skills in key civil service  sectors like the treasury, tax office and judiciary are vital to  the creation of a sound business environment for manufacturers,  the managers agreed.    Both experts from universities and managers of enterprises  are concerned about the situation of the country's basic  education.    Academics and businessmen concerned about the future of  education in China have all called upon the government to be  responsible for financing the country's basic education.    Primary and secondary education provides youngsters with  basic knowledge which is vital, if they are to go on and learn  specialized skills.    Basic education does not aim at getting immediate economic  returns. But it develops the youthful potential. And since the  young are the labourers of the future, their enhanced capacity  for professional knowledge can only profit the country.    So it is not surprising that many countries have set up  compulsory, free basic education system, which guarantee poor  children a schooling.    China has already launched a nine-year compulsory education  system. However, many localities have failed to effectively  implement the compulsory system.    And random collection of fees from students in primary and  secondary schools has deprived many poor children of their  rights to a basic education.    Statistics show that more than 10 percent of the country's  pupils and middle school students quite school last year. And  prohibitively high school charges were one of the biggest reason  behind this.    Some localities also try to shirk their financial  responsibilities for basic education under the cover of giving  schools more say in their own management.    Government financing and management aid should be made  available to support the compulsory education system, according  to experts.    The government should campaign to encourage individuals and  groups to give financial and social support to basic education,  experts say.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Guillermo Endara has requested a review of  the U.S. proposal to make changes in the law that regulates the  operation and administration of the Panama Canal. U.S.  President Bill Clinton sent to the U.S. Congress a number of  suggestions for changes in the law that regulates the Panama  Canal. The proposal includes changing the Panama Canal  Commission into a government corporation, making the  requirements for the composition of its Board of Directors more  flexible, and permitting the participation of international  advisers in board meetings. In Panama, the president is  studying the proposal.    [Begin Endara recording] I am not familiar with the details  of Bill Clinton's proposal. From what I understand, President  Clinton's proposal stems from a senator's proposal, which was  studied by Panamanian authorities, and, in general, we agreed  with it. Nevertheless, I am going to ask the five [number as  heard] Panamanian members of the Panama Canal Commission's Board  of Directors and the Presidential Commission on Panama Canal  Affairs to undertake a study to enable the Panamanians to  respond to the proposal. In general, I understand it is a good  proposal. [end recording]    The changes suggested by Clinton include the review of tolls  and the strengthening of the Panama Canal Commission  regulations. In our country, sectors such as the Interoceanic  Region Authority [ARI] agree with these changes.    [Begin ARI member Carlos Mendoza recording] The goal is to  more smoothly, expeditiously, and functionally conduct the  transition of the U.S.-administered Canal to a Panamanian  administration, which begins on the first day of the year 2000.  [end recording]    While officials evaluate the proposal, President Endara will  discuss this topic with U.S. Vice President Al Gore in Honduras  on 24 May.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The hidden costs of a mortgage - Scheherazade Daneshkhu urges borrowers to look closely at the insurance policies tied to a home loan LOW interest rates on a home loan may look attractive but beware the hidden costs. Borrowers often will find they have a host of insurance policies thrust at them. Some customers have little choice. Many lenders offer a discount on their mortgages, but only on condition that you take out their buildings or home contents policy. These include Halifax, Abbey National, Nationwide, Britannia and National &amp; Provincial. Borrowers should, however, be aware that even though they get a good deal with the discounted mortgage, the lender claws back a proportion of it by charging more for the insurance policies. Even those who have a choice may be tempted, for simplicity's sake, to cave in and opt to hold these policies with their lender. But how do you tell whether you are getting a good deal? All policies should cover you for loss or damage caused by theft, vandalism, fire, natural disasters and subsidence. In most cases, your policy will not cover your possessions if the home has been left empty for more than 30 days. But no two policies are exactly the same, which adds to the headache of the home purchaser when it comes to deciding which policy is the 'best.' In its latest survey of contents policies, Which?, the Consumer's Association magazine, rated Countrywide as its best-buy insurance policy for the home. So, we asked it for a quotation for a 30-year-old male non-smoker  -a first-time buyer - who had purchased a three-bedroomed house for Pounds 70,000 in Countrywide's highest-risk area. Countrywide said the combined rate for buildings and contents insurance would be Pounds 206 a year. Apart from Countrywide, Lloyds Bank also provides a competitively-priced combined buildings and contents package known as Mortgage Value Cover. This would cost Pounds 228.96 a year with a first-time buyer's discount of 20 per cent included. Contents cover of up to Pounds 30,000 is provided by the policy. Using this information, we can make a rough assessment of the offers available from those lenders who insist that you take out an insurance policy with them. A first-time buyer visiting the Halifax for a repayment mortgage would get 1.5 percentage points knocked off the variable rate. Our 30-year-old male is taking a 95 per cent mortgage on a Pounds 70,000 home, so will benefit from an additional reduction in the rate of 0.45 per cent. If we assume interest rates stay at present levels, he will be paying 9 per cent while the discount lasts (until July 31, 1993). Compared with the present variable rate of 10.95 per cent, that is an annualised saving of Pounds 951.24. Our male must, however, take out a Halifax Xtracover combined buildings and contents policy to enjoy this discount. This will cost him Pounds 434.04 a year for his high-risk area - Pounds 228.04 more than the amount quoted by Countrywide. Put another way, the borrower's saving is effectively Pounds 723.20 rather than Pounds 951.24. More than a fifth of his mortgage discount has disappeared. First-time borrowers from Abbey National also enjoy a 1.5 percent discount, bringing the present variable rate down to 9.05 per cent. Instead of paying Pounds 6,846.84 on a repayment mortgage for the first year, our man would pay Pounds 6,118.80, a saving of Pounds 728.04 a year on a loan of Pounds 66,500 (95 per cent of the cost of the Pounds 70,000 house). Once again, the borrower must, to receive this discount take out Abbey's buildings and contents insurance policy. Not only does this cost Pounds 383.52 a year in a high-risk area, it does not cover 'personal possessions' including clothes and jewellery. (Borrowers do not have to take out cover for personal possessions as part of the first-time buyer's deal at Abbey, but these are included in Halifax, Nationwide and Countrywide's policies.) Cover for these will cost our male another Pounds 90.96 a year, bringing the Abbey total up to Pounds 474.48, which is Pounds 268.48 more expensive than Countrywide's policy. The effective saving on his mortgage from Abbey has been reduced by more than a third to Pounds 459.56. First-time buyers might be better off at Nationwide, where they do not have to take out the society's buildings and contents policy. Nationwide does, however, offer a package where a discount on larger loans depends on a new borrower taking out a buildings and contents policy. The mortgage rate is 10.55 per cent on a loan of over Pounds 60,000 instead of the society's present variable rate of 10.99 per cent, which means a saving of Pounds 218.40 a year on the mortgage. But our male would have to pay Pounds 411.48 for the society's buildings and contents policy. Considering that you could have secured this insurance for Pounds 206 at Countrywide, that is an extra cost of Pounds 205.48, which means the saving effectively is reduced to Pounds 12.92 a year. In none of these cases are you given any choice in the sort of buildings and contents policy you take out. First-time buyers may be better off in the first year through these packages. But if they do not want to see such savings drain away in higher premiums in the second or third year of the loan, they will then need to cancel the expensive policies and opt for one of the cheaper deals on the market. A spokesman for one of the societies could not have summed it up better. 'The customer is getting such a good deal with the mortgage discount that we have to make them take out the policy,' he said.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COMBINED BUILDING AND CONTENTS COVER  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Institution         Annual premium (Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Countrywide*              206.00 Lloyds*                   228.96 Halifax                   434.04 Abbey National            474.48 Nationwide                411.48  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * includes first time buyer discount.

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banana islands aim to calm US 'hostility' THE POLITICAL leaders of Caribbean banana producing countries are to meet US trade officials next month in an attempt to dispel what the leaders say is Washington's 'hostility' to the new European Community regime for importing the fruit. Mr John Compton, the prime minister of St Lucia, said he and his colleagues from St Vincent, Dominica and Grenada, will meet the US trade representative to discuss the US attitude, which he said threatened the economic foundation of the four islands. The four, which make up the Windward group, and other producers of the African, Caribbean and Pacific group, are seeking protection for their market share in Europe, and fear competition from cheaper Latin American fruit. The EC's agriculture ministers have proposed that from July there will be a 2m tonnes-a-year quota for Latin American fruit and that this will attract duty of Ecu100 (Pounds 78) a tonne. Imports of Latin American fruit above this level will attract a duty of Ecu850 a tonne. Caribbean and other traditional suppliers, such as those in Africa, will have access for the remainder of the EC's needs, which traders say is about 1.5m tonnes a year. This fruit will pay no tariff. The new regime has been criticised by the US and by the Latin American countries. In a statement to St Lucia's parliament, Mr Compton said that the US position on the issue showed that the Clinton administration was 'even more unsympathetic' to the EC's proposed regime than was the Bush administration.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Let us see what has changed in the political  balance, and what will happen to the alliances in the future.  Sergio De Luca reports:    [De Luca] It will not be easy to form a government,  primarily  because, as you have heard, the Freedom Alliance does not hold a  majority of seats in the Senate. Silvio Berlusconi will be  forced to turn to Mario Segni and Mino Martinazzoli in order to  obtain the votes that he lacks. However, neither one seems very  inclined to make an alliance with the Right. Segni and  Martinazzoli seem to prefer being in opposition.    Berlusconi must then reckon with the Northern League.  Umberto Bossi has already uttered two no's. He has said no to  forming a government with Gianfranco Fini [National Alliance]  and no to Berlusconi's candidacy for the post of prime minister.  These are two formidable obstacles which Berlusconi must  overcome.    It is difficult to make any forecasts at present. The  postelection games have not even begun. However, it is clear  that there will not be any clearcut choices and nor the  stability which we expected from the new electoral system.</p>

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In 1972, the Board permitted bank holding companies to serve as an investment adviser to mutual funds and other registered investment companies. See 12 CFR 225.25(b)(4). When the Board added this activity to Regulation Y, it also published an interpretive rule that placed certain prudential and other limitations on the manner in which bank holding companies could conduct the activity. 12 CFR 225.125.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Among the restrictions in the interpretive rule is a requirement that a bank holding company and its bank and nonbank subsidiaries should not purchase, in its sole discretion in a fiduciary capacity, any securities of an investment company advised by the bank holding company. 12 CFR 225.125(g). The Board adopted the restriction because of concern that a bank holding company might use its position as a fiduciary to support an investment company that the bank holding company advised, to increase the asset size of the investment company or as a means of increasing advisory fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of bank holding companies have recently indicated that a mutual fund advised by the bank holding company is often the most cost-effective method of providing investment advice to customers and is increasingly attractive to customers because a mutual fund provides customers with a readily marketable and easily valued investment product. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These bank holding companies point out that a number of statutory and regulatory developments have occurred since 1972 that address the concerns that originally prompted the Board to adopt its prohibition on fiduciary purchases by a bank holding company of shares of a mutual fund advised by the bank holding company. In light of these developments, several bank holding companies have requested that the Board modify its current interpretive rule to permit bank holding companies to purchase, on behalf of fiduciary customers, shares of mutual funds advised by the bank holding company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Letter, dated August 12, 1994, to Chairman Greenspan from Edward L. Yingling, Executive Director Government Relations, American Bankers Association.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the Board adopted its investment advisory interpretive rule, Congress enacted section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which specifically permits a bank or its subsidiary to purchase securities, as a fiduciary, from an affiliate if such purchases are permitted by the instrument creating the fiduciary relationship, by court order, or by the law of the jurisdiction governing the fiduciary relationship. In addition, in an analogous area, the Board since permitted fiduciary purchases of securities that are underwritten by a section 20 affiliate if the purchase was specifically authorized under the instrument creating the fiduciary relationship, by court order, or by the law of the jurisdiction under which the trust is administered. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Citicorp, J.P.

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Nordbanken surges in first half Nordbanken, the worst casualty of Sweden's 1992 banking crisis, yesterday reported the biggest profit of any of the country's banks in the first half of this year. It was lifted by the acquisition last December of Gota Bank, the other chief victim of the loan-loss shock. Nordbanken, bailed out by the government two years ago but now set for privatisation, announced an operating profit in the first six months of SKr2.46bn (Dollars 315.3m), ahead of the SKr2.3bn achieved by Svenska Handelsbanken, the only bank which survived the crisis without seeking state aid. It said it expected profits in the second half to be about the same, implying a full-year profit of close to SKr5bn. As was the case for Handelsbanken and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Nordbanken's rising profits were largely attributed to a big fall in loan losses. Nordbanken's credit losses tumbled to SKr1.09bn in the first half, of which SKr167m was accounted for by Gota Bank. Nordbanken's loan losses were SKr2.78bn in the first half of 1993. Nordbanken did not show comparative consolidated figures including Gota Bank for 1993. The result will strengthen the case for the privatisation of Nordbanken, supported by the governing right-centre coalition and the opposition Social Democratic Party. The bank is hoping for a decision after next month's general election. Privatisation will help the state recoup some of the large sums it paid out to keep the banking system afloat. The lion's share of the support - worth about SKr80bn - went to Nordbanken and Gota Bank in an operation which included hiving off SKr110bn of their bad loans to separate bad banks, which will remain under state management until fully unwound. The extent of the clean-up at Nordbanken and Gota Bank provoked protests from its rivals that Nordbanken had gained unfair competitive advantage. It is now the country's biggest bank by market share with about 25 per cent of the overall domestic market. Nordbanken said that its non-performing loans still totalled SKr15bn - down from SKr15.9bn at the beginning of the year - and it made provisions for loan losses of SKr9.2bn. The bank warned that a recent rise in interest rates could extend the period of high loan losses. Nordbanken was badly hit by a fall in earnings from trading on its bond portfolio, which slashed profits before loan losses. Excluding Gota Bank, Nordbanken's operating profit was up only slightly at SKr1.97bn, compared with SKr1.74bn in the same period last year. It was slowed by falling lending volumes and narrower margins which left net interest income, excluding Gota Bank, at SKr4.38bn, compared with SKr4.36bn in the first half of 1993. Net interest income including Gota Bank was SKr5.54bn.</p>

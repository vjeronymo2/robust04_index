			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hanson asset sale raises Dollars 54m Hanson is maintaining the pace of asset sales with the Dollars 54m (Pounds 37m) disposal of its half share in North Texas Cement and 15 ready mixed concrete plants. The move continues its strategy of concentrating the US building materials business on aggregates. The net value of the assets being sold was Dollars 45m at December 31, and in the year to September 30 1993 they contributed operating income of Dollars 3m. Ash Grove Cement, of Kansas, bought the stake in North Texas Cement, while the ready mixed plants, located in the Dallas and Fort Worth areas, were sold to Pioneer Concrete of Texas. The deal brings to Dollars 500m the proceeds from sales in the US so far this financial year. The largest was the flotation of Beazer Homes USA, its US housebuilding business which raised Dollars 232m. Hanson also completed the sale of its US office products business for Dollars 162.5m this week.</p>

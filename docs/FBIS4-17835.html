			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaking at a news conference held in Lvov on 25  April, People's Deputy Yaroslav Kendzior said that after holding  talks with a number of Ukrainian lawmakers with different  political views, Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch, and  President Leonid Kravchuk, he came to the conclusion that  "presidential elections will, most probably, take place."  According to Kendzior, Plyushch categorically insists that the  elections be held in June, while Kravchuk "still cherishes hope  that the elections will be annulled or postponed."    Kendzior also pointed out that since President Kravchuk's  recent visit to the United States, "certain circles in that  state have had an interest in him and will help him become  president of Ukraine."</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> CUSTOMS FINES BUSH EX-AIDE $648 IN FAILURE TO DECLARE FURS  </P> <P> Jennifer Fitzgerald, deputy chief of U.S. protocol and a former aide to George  Bush, was fined $648 by the Customs Service for failing to declare the true  value of two fur coats from Argentina, officials said today.  </P> <P> Anita Stockman, a spokeswoman for the State Department, said the investigation  of the case is ongoing.  </P> <P> Stockman confirmed that the investigation began in January after an anonymous  tip was received on the "hot line" of the department's inspector general. The  caller said that Fitzgerald, traveling on a U.S. government aircraft, had  failed to declare some items when she returned to Andrews Air Force Base from  South America.  </P> <P> Ed Kittredge, a spokesman for the U.S. Customs Service, said Fitzgerald was  summoned to the Office of the Special Agent in Baltimore on March 23, where she  was assessed $648 under the Custom Fraud Statute. He said the case was handled  as a civil matter, not as a criminal case.  </P> <P> According to the Customs Service, Fitzgerald, who had traveled to Argentina as  part of an official U.S. delegation, returned with a raincoat purchased abroad,  which she declared to be worth $300. She did not mention in the customs  declaration that the coat was lined with nutria fur. The customs agent  appraised the coat at $1,100, and Fitzgerald was asked to pay a penalty of  $440.  </P> <P> For a fur cape worth $1,300 that she failed to disclose altogether, Fitzgerald  was assessed $208.  </P></p>

On the afternoon of 20 January, when strong icy winds were  blowing on a very cold day, Comrade Yang Shangkun came to the  city government building. He wore a gray overcoat and walked  with firm steps. He smiled and shook hands with people in the  welcome crowd one by one and then talked cordially with the  Shenzhen City leaders.    Comrade Yang Shangkun said: I have special feelings toward  Shenzhen. When Comrade Xi Zhongxun and I worked in the  Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, the central authorities  decided to adopt special policies in Guangdong. In particular,  after the establishment of the special economic zones, they  played a great role in leading and promoting reform and opening  up. I have visited the special zones often since then. In  general, I found that there were changes every year in Shenzhen.  Last year, from the Shenzhen Airport to Zhuhai via Shekou, I  saw large stretches of empty land along the roadside, but, this  year, new buildings have cropped up there, and the road has also  been improved. I am really glad to see all this.    Making a gesture, he said: The city party committee has just  held a meeting to decide the principles and policies for future  development, and this is very good. Yesterday, I read an  interview with Comrade Liu Tianfu in SHENZHEN TEQU BAO. He  hoped that Shenzhen would make further progress. This is also  the common hope of all of us old comrades. This year, the state  will adopt many major reform measures and the pace of reform  will be quickened, meaning that the tasks will be pressing and  will cover a broad scope. Efforts should be made to deal with  new issues and overcome new difficulties. New experience should  be summed up. Reform, opening, and economic construction in the  special economic zones should be carried out positively and  prudently. Last year, Shenzhen experienced fires and floods,  but you nevertheless have made great achievements in your work.  Comrades, you should make greater efforts this year, continue  to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, and do a better  job than last year.    Comrade Yang Shangkun particularly appreciated the  appearance  of a large number of competent young cadres in Shenzhen. He  said that he had come into contact with some cadres in Shenzhen,  including some entrepreneurs. They are all quite young -- some  are just in their thirties. This shows that our cause has no  lack of successors and is full of bright hopes.    Li Youwei said: Two years ago today, Comrade Deng Xiaoping  was inspecting Shenzhen and made some important speeches. At  that time, Comrade Yang Shangkun was also in Shenzhen to help  promote our country's further reform and opening. Today, after  an interval of two years, Comrade Yang Shangkun has once again  inspected Shenzhen. This gave great encouragement and support  to the special economic zone. He said that the people in  Shenzhen would never let down the proletarian revolutionaries of  the old generation and would certainly build the special  economic zone into a more beautiful place.    Li Youwei extended a new year greeting to Comrade Yang  Shangkun on behalf of the entire people in Shenzhen and wished  him good health.    On the morning of 21 January, Wang Zhongfu and other  principal city leaders once again reported their work to Comrade  Yang Shangkun.    Comrade Yang Shangkun arrived in Shenzhen by special plane  from Beijing on the morning of 8 January. Huang Huahua, Fu Rui,  and Li Youwei met him at the airport.    On the morning of 12 January, accompanied by Wang Zhongfu,  Comrade Yang Shangkun, full of zest, visited the wild animal zoo  in Shenzhen. That afternoon, Xie Fei, secretary of the  Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, particularly came to see  Comrade Yang Shangkun. On the morning of 16 January,  accompanied by Yuan Geng, Comrade Yang Shangkun inspected  Shekou. On the morning of 17 January, accompanied by Li Youwei  and Li Po, Comrade Yang Shangkun, full of zest, visited  Shenzhen's Golf Club.    In Shenzhen, Comrade Yang Shangkun also paid special  attention to the development of the high-tech industries. On  the morning of 19 January, accompanied by Huang Liman, he  inspected two high-tech companies, Anke and Huawei, and  expressed satisfaction with the remarkable achievements and  technological breakthroughs made by these two companies in the  fields of sophisticated medical equipment and programmable  digital telephone exchanges. In Anke, Comrade Yang Shangkun  wrote: "Developing high technology, promoting the new  development of the national economy." On the morning of 20  January, being accompanied by Yang Guanghui, he inspected the  Kaifa Science and Technology Company. There, he inquired about  the details of the production process and encouraged the company  to make new progress in the new year.    Yesterday, Comrade Yang Shangkun finished his inspection and  left Shenzhen.</p>

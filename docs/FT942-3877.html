			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (12): Luceplan's designs stand the test of time Family has long loomed large in Italian industry, but it played a very special part in the creation of Luceplan during the late 1970s. The three founders - Riccardo Sarfatti, Sandra Severi Cristalli and Paolo Rizzatto - met while studying architecture at university. They went on to work together at Arteluce, a lighting company owned by Sarfatti's father, until it was bought by Flos, the bastion of Italian lighting. They stayed there for a while before leaving to start on their own. Luceplan is now Italy's third largest lighting company. Its annual turnover is almost L20bn (70 per cent of which is exported) and it has 55 employees at its Milan factory. Yet the three founders and Alberto Meda, the fourth partner, think their real achievement is that all the 20 lights they have produced since the 1970s are still on the market - proof of a commitment to design that has earned one of this year's EC Design Prizes. It can seem cliched when companies wax lyrical about design being an integral part of their business, but it happens to be true for Luceplan. Where other Italian lighting companies work with external designers - as Flos does, for example, with Achille Castiglioni, Philippe Starck and Marc Newson - the Luceplan partners stick to the Bauhaus model of designing all their own products alongside their factory production team. 'We don't believe it is possible to have a design studio in one place and a factory in another,' says Paulo Rizzatto. 'We are dealing with very complex products which require a high level of technical expertise. It is essential that the design and production process is homogeneous.' This commitment to homogeneity is best exemplified by Luceplan's headquarters: a complex of five early 20th century warehouses, specially converted to accommodate product development, manufacturing and distribution. The partners also co-ordinate the design of all Luceplan's packaging and publicity material to ensure that it conveys the correct image. Until recently the company concentrated on domestic lighting, but its latest venture marks a new departure into heavy duty lights for public spaces such as apartment blocks. The catalyst, Riccardo Sarfatti says, was the realisation that existing products in that market were not only of low quality, but also had failed to take advantage of the development of technically advanced light bulbs. Luceplan's response was to devote 30 months - and a tenth of its turnover - to developing the Metrop. After a year on the market it has already sold 20,000 units and recouped the investment.</p>

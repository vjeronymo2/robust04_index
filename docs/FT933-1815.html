			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Arts: Secondhand soap loses its froth - Television As actors grow old they convince themselves that less is more; that the pinnacle of acting is the portrayal of the simpleton. Peter Sellers was, by all accounts, obsessed with the idea of playing the featherbrained gardener in Being There, his last major film, and now we hear that Alec Guinness was dead keen to play the part of the mentally damaged Amos in Roy Clarke's 'Screen One' drama on BBC1, A Foreign Field. At the age of 79 Guinness took on the part of a man with the mind of an eight-year-old, having just five words to say (so we are told; I must have missed most of them) and was finally able to try his hand at emulating his hero, Buster Keaton. Of course Keaton was silent of necessity, having become a film star before they invented talkies. It is very different, and surely a little perverse, to revel in the eschewal of language once it is available to you. As you might expect, Guinness was pretty impressive in the role, but it is sentimental and dishonest to pretend that there is something mystically enriching about being a dumb septuagenarian. For the audience, watching an actor playing an old man without the aid of dialogue may be a little more interesting than watching a drama school exercise in minimalism with students obliged to 'be a table', but not much. ***** By the time this column appears in print, perhaps Nigel Short will actually have triumphed over Gary Kasparov and won his first game. Let us hope so, for the sake of Channel 4's World Chess series which is becoming more and more embarrassing. Even in the earliest stages, before it began to look ominously like a Kasparov walkover, the programme felt a bit hyped. Though there were only three people in the studio, including the presenter; there seemed to be too many experts; and the desperate desire to talk up a storm resulted too often in a babel of voices. Presenter Carol Vorderman's technique is to ask a girlish question and then, just before we get to the point of the answer, butt in with a girlish comment or a new girlish question. Apart from those late night 'animal watch' programmes where the presenters try to obscure the tedium of somnolent rodents by pouring out a stream of hushed burbling commentary, World Chess is proving just about the most irritating programme on television. ***** The chip-on-the-shoulder view within the Murdoch mass media empire is that Murdoch television networks and newspapers attract endless sneering because the old English public school establishment is deeply snobbish and turns up its nose at Rupert Murdoch whom it sees as a jumped up colonial with more money than taste. Gosh, the Murdoch adjutants keep telling us, he's a great businessman who never, well hardly ever, interferes with editorial content. He phones up often enough to talk about marketing or the competition, but never dictates leader policy, what more could you ask? You could ask that he did take a bit of interest in the content. How much more admirable and inspiring if, faced with a lack of success at The Times, instead of turning to a marketing mechanism and lopping a third off the cover price, Murdoch were to declare that they would improve the editorial content to such an extent that it would outsell all competitors on merit. How exciting if, instead of the Murdoch satellite television channels being hyped so absurdly in the Murdoch press, Mr Murdoch himself were to say 'We're one of the world's richest mass media conglomerates, so we'll stop filling our channels with all this secondhand Australian and American rubbish and invest money in the origination of high quality comedy, documentaries, drama, wildlife programmes, music and arts.' ***** Not that the satellite is the only place where you find Australian and American rubbish. Switching off a tape at lunchtime on Monday, I found myself watching Neighbours on BBC1; Australian, of course. ITV was simultaneously screening another Australian soap: Home And Away. BBC2? An Australian cookery programme, presented by a man of abnormally repellent tone and manner. Meanwhile Channel 4 was showing Bobobobs, a half-hour American cartoon show. Last week, according to the BARB figures, these four terrestrial channels took 93.2 per cent of the audience with all the satellite and cable channels managing only 6.8 per cent between them. But if the terrestrial channels are going to force us, like their satellite competitors, to choose between secondhand Australian and secondhand American programmes, with not a single home produced programme on the air, it is going to be difficult to defend them against the worst excesses of the market place. ***** There have been transatlantic format deals which worked: Till Death Us Do Part and Steptoe And Son went west and became highly popular in the US as All In The Family and Sanford And Son. ITV's current series The Upper Hand in which Joe McGann plays a sort of au pair to a shoulder padded businesswoman is an example of the process travelling east, and quite a lot of viewers seem to like it. But, so far, ITV's Brighton Belles has been a disaster. It might, perhaps, seem less dreadful to somebody who had never seen The Golden Girls, but anybody who became fond of the American original on Channel 4 must surely find this wan English copy desperately difficult to watch. Sheila Gish, Sheila Hancock, Jean Boht and Wendy Craig are good enough actresses (though it seems ludicrous to ask Boht, who looks about 55, to play the mother of Hancock who looks about 57) but they simply are not the wise-cracking ball breakers for whom the original ideas were created. It is bad enough to rely for laughs on such awkwardly contrived lines as 'I'm as jumpy as a virgin in a tentful of Boy Scouts', but catastrophic to cap that with the line 'That's pretty jumpy'. It seems clear from the nervous over-manipulation of the laughter track that the producers are keenly aware of their difficulties. ***** However, while The Golden Girls may have been highly successful in its eastward move, the same cannot be said for C4's American Football; not so far as this viewer is concerned, anyway. Having previously sampled it, recorded my boredom, and been assured by enthusiasts that it is a splendid spectator sport once you really get into it, I tried again with The Big Match. It still looks tediously static, with ground usually being gained at about the speed of a self-advancing pit prop. Moreover the players still look like a lot of strutting cissies with their absurd Tweedledum padding, and the unceasing Gatling gun commentary is unendurable. Hurling, on the other hand, as brought to us by C4 in Gaelic Games seems to be a breathtakingly exciting sport which is wickedly under-reported on television. Perhaps the All-Ireland final between Galway and Kilkenny was an unrepresentatively magnificent match, but it was one of the fastest and most spectacular sporting occasions I have ever seen. There seem to be few rules: you can throw and catch the ball, kick it, run with it, toss it up and whack it with your stick, score goals in the net or points by getting the ball over the uprights above, and the ball moves from one end of the pitch to the other in seconds. Tackling is rough and nobody goes whining to the referee if, as frequently happens, a stick comes down inadvertently upon a head. Hurling makes American football look like something invented for kindergartens: television should bring us much more hurling, and not after midnight.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] During the recent session, OPEC petroleum ministers  renewed the existing agreement among members on an oil  production of 24.52 million barrels a day for another nine  months. This decision was made at a time when not only the  majority of OPEC members but the eight non-OPEC members had  announced their willingness to reduce oil production. However,  Saudi Arabia's disagreement on dropping production compelled  OPEC to renew the agreement that was adopted six months ago on a  daily production of 24.52 million barrels a day until the end of  the current Christian calendar year.    Commenting on the renewal of OPEC's existing production  ceiling, several petroleum ministers--the Qatari petroleum  minister who also heads OPEC, the Libyan petroleum minister who  is also a member of the three-man committee that studies  possible violations by members, and the petroleum minister of  the Islamic Republic of Iran--made separate statements  criticizing Saudi Arabia. They also said that the decision was  made to renew the production ceiling to avoid indecision.    Following Saudi Arabia's refusal to reduce its production,  the OPEC secretary general and some members said that the  renewal of the production ceiling was the only decision that  members could practically and collectively agree on.    Our correspondent Hafezi has prepared the following report  on  the impact of this decision on oil prices and on our country's  economy.    [Begin Hafezi recording] Following OPEC's recent decision,  incoming reports from oil markets show that the continuation of  oil production at the former production ceiling during a season  when OPEC would have normally reduced production has led to an  estimated $1 drop in oil prices in comparison with the period  before the OPEC session. Meanwhile, a number of oil market  analysts have noted that since the oil market foresaw a renewal  of the agreement even before the current session, prices have  sufficiently dropped and the official announcement will not  reduce oil prices more than one more dollar during the next six  months.    Meanwhile, OPEC members have agreed to maintain the former  official production level even during the three months of autumn  when oil demands increase. In this case, oil prices can be  expected to strengthen during the three months of autumn.    As for the recent OPEC decision's impact on the Islamic  Republic of Iran, domestic observers point out that since oil  incomes in the 1373 budget law [year beginning 21 March 1994]  were less than the estimates in the budget bill and are based on  $13 per barrel, lesser foreign exchange expenditures have been  foreseen for projects in that year. These observers have  pointed out that determining two separate methods for foreign  exchange expenditures, which are in ratio with oil prices, can  help the government confront the drop in foreign exchange  income. The observers add that it is ultimately an increase in  domestic production and more use of domestic products that can  help drop foreign exchange needs. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A former presidential candidate, Chief Moshood  Abiola, has appealed to his supporters to refrain from media  attacks on the Hausa-Fulanis for his failure to become president  of Nigeria. In an interview with newsmen at his Ikeja  residence, Chief Abiola appealed to politicians, the media, and  traditional rulers to prevail on their people to make more  responsible utterances, in the interest of peace and national  unity. He recalled that in the annulled presidential elections  he won more support in Kano than Ogun, his home state, stressing  that such people deserve better treatment than attacks on pages  of newspapers.</p>

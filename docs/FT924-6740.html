			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Blue Circle to cut jobs and capacity BLUE CIRCLE, Britain's biggest cement manufacturer, is expected to announce plans today to cut its workforce by a fifth in response to the recession. The company is expected to announce that more than 500 jobs will go as a result of a series of kiln closures at its 10 UK plants. The move is expected to reduce Blue Circle's annual capacity by about 1m tonnes to 7m tonnes. This compares with sales of just under 6m tonnes forecast for this year - accounting for just under half of the UK cement market. The cuts will be a further blow to the UK construction industry, which has lost more than 400,000 jobs since 1989. Annual sales by UK cement manufacturers have fallen by a third since 1989, from 17.5m tonnes to just under 12m tonnes. The industry has warned that sales could slide further in 1993 when UK construction output is forecast to fall by up to another 2 per cent. Blue Circle has been operating its plants at under 75 per cent of capacity. It is understood to have decided that it can no longer postpone kiln closures given the delay in recovery. In September Blue Circle reported a fall in pre-tax profits for the first half of the year from Pounds 57.5m to Pounds 42.7m. After the latest cuts, the UK's three largest cement manufacturers - Blue Circle, Castle and Rugby, which produce more than 95 per cent of cement sold in Britain - will have annual capacity of 13m tonnes, about 1m tonnes more than current sales.</p>

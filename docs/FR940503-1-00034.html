			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Basis for Hearing Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the Act explicitly indicates that hearings in field  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citation cases are not subject to the provisions for formal APA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjudication, it does not prohibit the Agency from exercising its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion and providing such procedural rights. There are two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primary benefits in using part 22 to govern hearings on field  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citations: (1) It would consolidate Clean Air Act administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty hearings under one set of procedural rules, minimizing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the need for the Agency and the regulated community to learn and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> become proficient in more than one set of procedures; and (2) it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would use a penalty assessment procedure with which both the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency and the regulated community have a great deal of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act as amended in 1990 authorizes the Administrator to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue administrative penalty orders under section 113(d)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These administrative penalty orders, which may assess civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalties of up to $25,000 per day of violation, are generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to situations where the total penalty sought does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceed $200,000 and where the first alleged date of violation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurred no more than twelve months prior to initiation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative action. Similar authority was provided under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 205(c) and 211(d)(1) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The penalties contained in administrative penalty orders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issued under section 113(d)(1) are assessed pursuant to the part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22 procedures, as are administrative penalties assessed under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 205(c) and 211(d)(1). Part 22 was amended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporate these provisions on February 4, 1992 (57 FR 4318).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, using part 22 to govern hearings on field citations issued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under section 113(d)(3) would consolidate all of the Clean Air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act administrative penalty hearings under one set of procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the Agency has used part 22 for assessing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative penalties under other environmental statutes since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1980. Consequently, both the regulated community and the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have considerable experience with these procedures, thereby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simplifying the implementation of the field citation program. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed later, minor revisions to part 22 procedures would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted to account for certain statutory provisions in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 113(d)(3) and to account for the types of violations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalties associated with field citations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Hearing Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under part 22, the field citation would be issued by an EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officer or employee as an administrative complaint. Within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> twenty days after service of the citation, the Respondent must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> file an answer. In the answer, the Respondent may contest the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facts in the complaint, the size of the penalty, or claim that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Respondent is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested by the Respondent, a hearing will be held on the issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raised in the citation and answer. The Presiding Officer has the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion to allow the Respondent to amend his answer. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> default order, which allows the full proposed penalty to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collected, may be issued upon motion if the Respondent fails to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> file an answer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Respondent may simultaneously pursue informal settlement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and a hearing. During settlement negotiations, the parties may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informally exchange information, if appropriate. For example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency may supply copies of the documentation used to support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its case and the Respondent might provide any evidence that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tend to disprove the allegations or to mitigate the penalty. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written Consent Agreement and a proposed Consent Order are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted for approval by the Regional Administrator, if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties reach a settlement of the claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Either party may file a preliminary motion for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accelerated decision if no genuine issues of material fact exist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Respondent may file a motion for dismissal of the citation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A mandatory prehearing conference is held to simplify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues; to limit the number of potential witnesses; and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address other matters that may expedite the hearing. An exchange  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of witness lists and documents occurs at the prehearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The hearing is held for the presentation of evidence and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testimony concerning the facts relating to the violation and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the size of the penalty. Except as otherwise provided by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Presiding Officer, witnesses are to be examined orally, under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oath or affirmation, at the hearing. The parties have the right  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to cross-examine witnesses who testify at the hearing. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Presiding Officer may take notice of any matter judicially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noticed in the Federal courts and of any facts falling within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specialized knowledge and expertise of the Agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

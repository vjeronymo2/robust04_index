			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Euro Disney rebounds before rise in base rates Lacking a further push from Wall Street, bourses consolidated, or declined a little, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS closed before four French banks added 25 basis points to their base lending rates, a move which Mr Michael Woodcock at Nikko Europe thought was politically driven. Earlier, market turnover fell from FFr2.4bn to an even thinner FFr1.96bn as the CAC-40 shed 14.90 to 2,060.37. Once again, the main highlight of the day was the gyrating Euro Disney, suspended limit down early in the morning when it hit a low of FFr7.55, and three times limit up: the company met analysts in the afternoon and the shares eventually closed 70 centimes higher at FFr9.10. Elsewhere, Docks de France climbed FFr26, or 3.5 per cent, to FFr778 on renewed rumours that the UK's J. Sainsbury, which has already denied the story, would buy the French supermarket operator. Among the day's losers, Elf Aquitaine lost FFr4.50 at FFr414 ahead of tomorrow's first-half results. Mr Woodcock noted that the oil company had already flagged a 20 per cent drop in operating income, and said that analysts will be looking for signs of a recovery in chemicals, and progress in debt reduction. Michelin had its fourth day on the downgrade, losing FFr2.40 at FFr232.60 on fears of a price war in the European tyres market. FRANKFURT followed Monday's pattern in the morning, doing its best to consolidate the previous day's post-bourse gains, but it had nothing left in the afternoon and the Ibis-indicated Dax closed 9.90 lower on the day at 2,205.82. Turnover rose from DM6.9bn to DM7.6bn. In the automotive sector, BMW was down DM9 to DM831 at the end of the day and Continental, the tyremaker, by DM4 to DM256.50. Analysts said that BMW had simply run out of momentum; Conti, last week, forecast only a slight increase in profits this year after reasonable first-half gains. In retailing, lower first-half earnings at Kaufhof left the shares down DM9 at DM547; among the engineers, recently popular stocks such as Linde and Preussag fell DM13 to DM949 and DM7 to DM496; but a strong technical position took Veba up DM6 to DM555.50 in utilities, and its competitor Viag DM5.30 higher to DM506. ZURICH consolidated after Monday's sharp rise, the SMI index ending 0.5 higher at 2,635.7. UBS bearers, however, remained in favour, adding another SFr7 at SFr1,167 and Ciba, due to release half-year profits figures this morning, put on SFr6 at SFr827. Alusuisse, which said it expected consolidated sales to rise above SFr7bn this year and net profit to be double the 1993 level, rose SFr11 in immediate response before easing back to end SFr8 up at SFr700. Insurers closed slightly higher, with Zurich Insurance registered shares SFr5 ahead at SFr1,275. AMSTERDAM turned lower after five straight days of advances, under pressure from Wall Street, softer bonds and the weaker dollar. The AEX index retreated 3.60 to 421.00, also depressed by ABN Amro and Aegon trading ex-dividend. The publishing sector bucked the trend as investors were seen switching from cyclical stocks. Wolters Kluwer added Fl 1.60 at Fl 121.30 and VNU rose 60 cents to Fl 185.50 ahead of first-half results expected today. Stork, the machinery group, declined Fl 1.60 to Fl 47.50, with its announcement of a 33 per cent increase in first-half profits failing to match expectations. The group will release further details to analysts today. Philips fell 90 cents to Fl 58 on US selling and Royal Dutch gave up Fl 1 of recent advances to finish at Fl 198. MILAN continued to await tangible budget news from the government and shares slipped back in thin trade, with many investors still away on holiday. The Comit index receded 5.88 to 688.82. Among the large industrial stocks, firm on Monday, Fiat gave back L80 to L6,535, Montedison relinquished L12 to L1,412 and Pirelli declined L30 to L2,600. Benetton was one of the few stocks to advance, as the firming dollar prompted arbitrage trade between the shares listed in Milan and New York. The Milan shares advanced L413 to L25,166. Insurers were subdued, having already discounted the announcement that the government had suspended the 15 per cent tax on contributions to private pension schemes for six months. Generali fell L333 to L42,053 and Ras was L265 lower at L25,994. MADRID featured a drop in turnover from Pta18bn to Pta15.7bn as the general index closed 1.29 lower at 313.18, but there was some joy in the market after a 41 per cent rise in first-half net profits at Gas Natural, which rose Pta260 to Pta10,450. Repsol, the oil company which owns 46 per cent of Gas Natural, rose a token Pta10 to Pta4,195. STOCKHOLM was lower on profit-taking and the Affarlsvarden index lost 10.90 to 1,451.40 as initially quiet trading picked up late in the day. Volvo 'B' shares fell SKr3 to SKr147 in spite of six-month figures at the top end of expections. In subsequent New York trade, the Volvo ADR dipped Dollars  3/8 by early afternoon to Dollars 19 1/8 as investors took quick profits. Skandia, the insurer, fell SKr4 to SKr113 in response to its half-yearly figures which came late on Monday. Among companies due to report interim figures today, Astra's 'A' stock shed SKr3 to SKr175 and MoDo 'B' gave up SKr6 to SKr350, but SCA 'B' rose SKr3 to SKr114. COPENHAGEN, weak this month, blamed the impending expiry of the KFX September future as the KFX index hit a new low for the year, down 1.36 at 96.84. TEL AVIV's recovery took it through 183.40 - the level at which it stood before a selling stampede, following news of a 10 per cent capital gains tax on share transactions, pushed it down 9.9 per cent 10 days ago. The Mishtanim index moved ahead a further 3.81, or 2.1 per cent, to 183.75.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Corneliu Coposu, president of the National </F> Peasant Christian-Democratic Party, by Roxana Badralexi; place  and date not given]    [Text] [Badralexi] Mr. Coposu, why do we all have the  feeling that everything ends in smoke?    [Coposu] Generally Romanians are fatalistic people and  display this mood when they see that their sustained and  repeated efforts yield no concrete results. For four years,  people have been waiting for changes for the better, but we are  moving from bad to worse. Thus, two groups of people take  shape: some vindicative ones who are building up an indignation  that is very dangerous for social stability, and another group  which includes people who become apathetic and embrace the  fatalistic theory that nothing can be changed anyway. This  second group was the reason for the large number of expatriates,  who are, unfortunately, mainly young people. One exclamation  that one can hear more and more often: It was much better in  Ceausescu's time.... is also justified. When you compare the  zero prospects in the time of the Vacaroiu government with a  situation of oppression that nevertheless ensured a minimum of  misery, and when the miserable life was supplemented through  theft, the options are in favor of the former regime. But let  us not forget that there are also people who lived before the  Communists....  <H5>  Under Current Conditions Except for the Constitutional </H5> Monarchy, Nobody Is Capable of Polarizing the Trust of the Public    [Badralexi] Most of the disappointed people look with  resignation toward the opposition. In this context, your recent  public declaration regarding the monarchy shocked many people.  Why have you made this statement now?    [Coposu] I believe that principles cannot be negotiated.  The 45 years of communism imprinted in the mind of people the  complex of mistrust. Two generations that were born and raised  in the communist regime were instructed under the sign of lies.  Those people knew that you have to think in one way and express  yourself in another way. This complex still persists today.  There are telling examples of this in parliament. The  president, who affirms that he has embarked on the path of  democracy, does not give up his Marxist-Leninist concepts. I,  contrary to this group of people, had the luck to be in jail  while the population of the country was practicing the complex  of mistrust. I did not adopt it and I believe that the duty of  a person who is responsible for a certain political situation  must be sincere and firmly affirm his principles, without  resorting to petty calculations about the opportuneness of a  certain attitude. I was surprised by the explosion of  commentaries in connection with my statement regarding the  monarchy. I said that our party voted against the current  Constitution and that, as long as it is in force, we are  duty-bound to respect it, but that nobody can stop us to improve  it and bring it up to the level of people's expectations. The  modification of the Constitution can also mean a change of the  constitutional form. We believe that the democratic form that is  most suitable for the difficult circumstances that our country  is currently facing is the restoration of constitutional  monarchy.    [Badralexi] In your case, can we talk about a historic  nostalgia....    [Coposu] There is no nostalgia here whatsoever. I have  strictly pragmatic arguments. They have no connection with any  sentimental or romantic feelings that some people have. My  arguments are not based on the desire to have royal continuity  or to connect the series of rulers who were at the helm of the  Romanian Principalities with the royalty that modernized  Romania. However, under the current circumstances, there is  nobody capable of polarizing the trust of the public and of  attracting the Romanian people to make the necessary efforts,  apart from the constitutional monarch. We have never concealed  the fact that we are dissatisfied with the current Constitution.  We have never concealed the fact that when the electorate is  going to empower us with the levers of power, we are going to  improve this Constitution. We have never concealed our  adherence to the principles of constitutional-monarchy.  Therefore, I do not understand Adrian Nastase's surprise at my  statements, as if I had said something special or something new.  He forgets that when I was next to him, in front of millions of  television-watching people, I affirmed the same thing!  <H5>  I Believe That We Are Duty-Bound To Direct the Public </H5>   [Coposu] In the same way that I cannot contest his devotion  to the president, Mr. Nastase has not got the right either to  show surprise at my option, which is not made in any personal  interest, but in the interest of my country. The only thing  this pretended stupor might do is to assist a possible  diversion. As far as I am concerned, the laws of the country  and democracy give me the right to present my viewpoint. More  than that, I believe that I am duty-bound to prevent the options  of the public and to direct it toward concrete objectives that  are useful to the nation and the future of the country. I have  learned from the results of current opinion polls that no more  than 30 percent of the electorate favors monarchy. Why? This  is the result of the job that the Communists carried out for  almost half a century.    The disinformation "divisions" of the Communists, which are  still in good shape today, if not even in better shape than  ever, are operating through the dissemination of lies. They  retain those lies that are meant to be picked up by the public  and abandon the others. We cannot afford to adopt such methods  and that was one of the reasons why we lost votes in the last  elections. Because we did not come up with petty lies. To say  that the restoration of monarchy means to take the land away  from peasants is an aberration and it is unacceptable that such  an idea can be born in the mind of some people who have  political responsibilities.    [Badralexi] You probably understand that, for the younger  generations who have no idea what monarchy in fact means, such  slogans as "The King and the Homeland" are not sufficient. Why  doesn't a monarchist campaign include the information, for  example, on who gave land to peasants?    [Coposu] King Ferdinand and King Mihai, who else?! Who took  away the land from peasants?! The Communist Party! I do not  throw responsibilities at Mr. Iliescu, who -- at that time --  was only minister of youth or first secretary. But there is no  doubt that all the nomenclatura of that time and of today agreed  with taking the land away from peasants. To come now and claim  that the opposition took away the land and, as a matter of fact,  that Communists who are currently ruling the country returned it  to peasants is a monstrosity! But let me return to what you  were saying before. I have to tell you that there has not been  a monarchist campaign.    [Badralexi] But why should there not be such a campaign?    [Coposu] In this case, I have to admit that the opposition  could have made such a campaign. It did not do so. Why?!  Because the Romanians do not know their own history. As long  as we cannot find a handful of historians who can rehabilitate  the truth, at least for the interwar period and the communist  period, the world will remain with information shrewdly supplied  at the time of communist domination. Thus, it is useless to  raise issues that provoke surprise. If you talk to the young  people who were born after 1945 about the institution of  monarchy, they ask you what that is. As if Romania, which has  never been a republic, has never been anything else, except for  a republic!! Today Romania's history is being taught only up to  the time of the end of World War I. Is that not convincing?!    [Badralexi] However, in your capacity as a politician, how  would you plead for the restoration of the monarchy?    [Coposu] The constitutional monarch does not govern, but  rule. This cannot be said about a president, who represents a  political formation and who, although he is duty-bound to be  equidistant, nevertheless remains the slave of the party that  promoted him. Thus, instead of a person with a certain  political orientation who is incapable of being independent in  his judgment, we would have a neutral referee, who is not  involved in political trouble, and for whom all Romanian  citizens are equal. The monarch would have the capability to  notice the serious moments in history and would not act the way  a president who is faithful to a party acts, that is, a  president who is clinging to the prolongation of governmental  agony.  <H5>  It Does Not Matter To Me What the Name of the Monarch Is. I </H5> Plead for Him as an Institution!    [Badralexi] Are you referring to any president?    [Coposu] I am talking about the situation in Romania. There  is no doubt that in advanced democracies it is possible that a  president might be above any suspicion and does not ignore the  will of the people.    [Badralexi] Let us try to speculate on something. We are  talking about King Mihai, a historical personality who has been  acquitted, from a moral viewpoint, by the history that has not  yet been written in school books. I am referring to you and to  the other political leaders in Romania. Thus, do you believe  that if King Mihai, installed on Romania's throne, would be  faced with a situation where he would have to mediate in a  dispute between you and, let us say, Oliviu Gherman, might he  take your side?    [Coposu] A constitutional king cannot take one side or the  other. Apart from that, we are not talking about a dispute  between myself and Mr. Gherman. Moreover, if all the FDSN  [Democratic National Salvation Front, former name of the ruling  party, PDSR] -- we call the ruling party by a feminine name --  would include only "Ghermans," I do not believe that the  situation would have reached the current troubled extent.  Unfortunately, Mr. Gherman, whom I even deplore, endures the  pressure of cripto-Communists in his own party. But let us  become serious. I am not talking about King Mihai or about  myself. I am saying it only in brackets, that King Mihai, at a  very early age, displayed balance, serious judgment, and a love  of the homeland. But this was only in brackets. Now, I am  talking about an institution. I believe that, for quite a long  time from now, the constitutional monarchy is indispensable and  is the only one that can ensure a democratic regime in Romania.    [Badralexi] On what are you basing your ideas when you plead  for this cause?    [Coposu] The truth will emerge eventually, I am sure of it.  However, there is an element that, I do not know why, is  overlooked here: The famous institution that is the Romanian  people has never made a mistake. Not even in crucial moments  when it was kept under control by force or by lies. The  Romanian people has a remarkable political intuition and we rely  on it. There is a saying that the pitcher goes so often to the  well that at last it breaks, and this is true. I count on early  elections for next spring and then the institution I was talking  about will prove itself.   <H5>    The Western Policy Is a Policy of Opportunity </H5>   [Badralexi] Can we or should we count on international  support in any way?    [Coposu] No, we cannot, and we have no right to do so. We  have to reach the right path that we have to follow alone. It  is true that the appearances are discouraging. Recently, I was  again surprised by President Iliescu's behavior. It is true  that I should be used to any paradox by now. However, I never  cease to be surprised at certain behavior. Recently, President  Iliescu promulgated the law on agricultural taxes. I nurtured a  faint hope that ultimately Iliescu, who pretends to be a lover  of the peasants, would not agree to sign such an aberrant law  that puts a tax on the amount of land and not on income.  Moreover, I can even see his picture in the newspaper, holding  the arms of peasant women who are happy that a law has been  voted in that forces them to pay taxes on a nonexistent income.  Everything that is happening around me seems to belong to the  world of fantasy. But, nevertheless, I am optimistic.    [Badralexi] Even lately, we constantly see representatives  of the civilized world coming to our country and shaking hands  with the current rulers, pleased with the "achievements" of the  past years. Doesn't it seem that the West has accepted them?    [Coposu] The policy promoted by the West is a policy of  opportunity. It is true that Romania represents a great  geopolitical interest, especially in the current period. Thus,  it is logical that the West tries to promote stability here in  our country.    [Badralexi] However, as a witness of historic events, aren't  you a little afraid?    [Coposu] ....Certainly, sometimes I think that the adventure  of Western-communist relations that existed in the past might be  repeated. Nevertheless I have to repeat it: I am an optimist.  I believe that it is a passing stage that is nearing the end.  Still, a force that is capable of destroying a nation like ours  has not been born yet. Soon we will live a normal life.</p>

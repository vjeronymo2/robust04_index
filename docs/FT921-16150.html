			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / European Futures: Volatile conditions boost trading levels FINANCIAL futures trading in Europe reached record levels in 1991, as volatile market conditions encouraged more market participants to use futures and options to take positions and to hedge exposure. European bond markets became increasingly futures-driven, as institutional investors made use of liquid stock index and bond futures and options to shift the composition of their portfolios. New products were plentiful. Italian bond futures met an enthusiastic welcome, while the reception for pan-European stock index futures and options was positively frosty. Competition between exchanges for new products intensified, as exchanges launched competing contracts and rushed to grab new markets. Rivalry was most intense between the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe), the Matif in Paris, and the Deutsche Terminborse in Frankfurt, part of a wider battle for pre-eminence as Europe's financial centre. In addition, two new exchanges were established: Belfox, the Belgian futures and options exchange, started trading futures on the Belgian government bond market in December and plans to launch options on six Belgian stocks and futures and options on its Bel-20 Beglian stock index this year; Otob, the Austrian exchange, also plans to add to its initially successful options contracts on five companies. Liffe won the battle for trading volume in 1991 by a surprisingly small margin over the Matif. Liffe traded a record 38.6bn contracts in 1991, compared with 37.1bn, also a record, for the Matif. Average daily volume rose 13 per cent on Liffe, compared with 30 per cent for the Matif. Each won a round of the fight for dominance of two new contracts - Ecu and Italian bond futures - with London recording a decisive win with its successful Italian bond contract, while Paris gained the upper hand on the Ecu bond contract, which, although not yet heavily traded, could soon be the most important European contract. But the fiercest contest has been for dominance of the heavily-traded Bund futures market. The DTB, backed by the German banks, put its full weight behind efforts to attract Bund futures trading from Liffe. The DTB, which traded 15.4bn contracts in 1991, was partially successful in winning business back, but not without prompting accusations of unfair tactics, such as the setting of minimum trading levels by some members, which the DTB denied. In equity options trading, the DTB overtook the European Options Exchange as the leading European exchange in traded options. Volume in options contracts reached 11.6bn on the DTB, up from 6.7bn, compared with 10.5 for the EOE, virtually unchanged from the previous year. Among other exchanges, Soffex, the Swiss exchange, traded 10.3bn contracts, up 14 per cent, while OM, the Swedish exchange, recorded volume of 9.2bn contracts. Competition between European exchanges, and increasingly with their US counterparts, is likely to mount this year. In a few months, the merger of Liffe and the London Traded Options Market, will make the new exchange, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffoe), the third largest in the world after the two in Chicago. The battle for dominance of various European contracts is set to continue, as the number of new contracts emerging slows. One of the few contracts expected to emerge this year is a short-term lira contract. Meanwhile, the Italians are planning to win back futures business on Italian government bonds, when they launch their own screen based trading system, planned for June. With Globex, the global electronic trading system created jointly by the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters, set to go on trial in January, for launch in the summer, the trend could be set for a shift away from open-outcry trading. A number of European exchanges are already considering further automation. Liffoe will have to decide whether to shift stock options trading on to a screen-based system in resuscitate the market.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Jordan bank deal imminent Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation are close to signing an agreement which will give the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) wide-ranging monetary responsibilities in the occupied territories during the transitory period of Palestinian self-rule. A draft copy of the document gives Jordan's central bank the job of supervising and monitoring banks which open branches in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It provides for the continuation of the Jordanian dinar as legal tender during the interim period. And it gives the CBJ ultimate responsibility for control of the money supply in the occupied territories and inflation and capital flows. Mr Mohammad Nashashibi, chairman of the PLO's department of economic affairs and planning, says once the agreement is signed within the next few weeks, a joint Jordanian/Palestinian monetary and banking committee will be established to oversee the bank's policies in the territories. This will include CBJ officials and Palestinian economists approved by the PLO. The agreement is still pending approval by the PLO in Tunis which remains nervous about giving too much control to the Jordanian monetary authorities. PLO officials insist the arrangements will be temporary. Mr Michel Martou, deputy governor at the central bank, says it is happy to play the role of supervisor but before the agreement enters into force it must iron out differences with Israel over foreign exchange controls and the convertibility of the Israeli shekel. One of the first tasks of the central bank will be to help commercial banks open branches in the occupied territories. Eight banks operating in Jordan, including the British Bank of the Middle East and ANZ Grindlays, have expressed an interest in re-opening branches closed after the 1967 war. The Jordanian/Palestinian draft agreement stipulates that banks in the occupied territories will operate solely under Jordanian law. It also provides for Palestinian companies in the territories to issue shares on the Amman financial market. An official announcement is expected by mid-December. Meanwhile, Palestinian officials have announced plans to establish a mixed-sector Palestinian Bank for Development and Reconstruction in the West Bank town of Jericho. Mr Nashashibi says the bank's capital will come from wealthy Palestinian businessmen and the PLO and will be used to develop housing, industry and agriculture. The Palestinians eventually want their own central bank, currency, and a Palestine stock exchange. But Mr Mohammad Saed Nabulsi, Jordan's central bank governor, recently said in a speech to Jordanian businessmen that such ideas would be unmanageable. Since the announcement of the PLO-Israeli peace accord, Jordan has been concerned about economic marginalisation by both Israeli domination of the Palestinian market and foreign aid aimed at developing the occupied territories to the exclusion of Jordan. However, monetary and banking responsibilities in the occupied territories goes some way to allay these fears. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin yesterday hailed the killing of Imad Aqel, a Hamas guerrilla considered the most wanted fugitive in the Gaza Strip, saying this would be the fate of all extremists who try to murder Israelis, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. The killing took place yesterday in a shoot-out with troops.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Borovkov] </F>   [Text] Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy 18 April, TASS --  Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Frontier Guards Troops Andrey  Nikolayev arrived in Kamchatka today. The main objectives of his  visit are to get acquainted with the Far Eastern frontier guard  districts and to start the putina (fishing season) operation.    The putina operation will begin in the Far East in the third  decade of April. Its purpose is to stop the illegal fishing of  Russian and foreign poachers in the economic zone of the Russian  Federation. For half a year frontier guards jointly with the  Fish Protection Service and the Navy will exercise a tough  round-the-clock control over a vast part of the Pacific zone --  from the Chukotka Peninsula to the South Kuril islands.    Nikolayev said at the ramp of the plane that the operation  would not affect the central part of the Sea of Okhotsk where  Polish, Chinese and South Korean poacher vessels are illegally  fishing the young fish, which are maturing there. "This is the  problem of the national resources of the whole world and not  only of Russia. It is necessary to resolve, in the first place,  international problems connected with the use of biological  resources of the Sea of Okhotsk," Nikolayev said.    Responding to the ITAR-TASS question about the reaction of  Russia's Far Eastern neighbours to the putina operation,  Nikolayev said that "all law-abiding states approve of those  actions, aimed at protecting Russia's economic interests in the  region."</p>

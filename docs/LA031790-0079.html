			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> BAKERY NOW MEETS STATE HEALTH CODE  </P> <P> After a rare conviction for violating state health laws, the LA Central Bakery  in Oxnard was found to be in compliance after an inspection was conducted this  week, according to a prosecutor.  </P> <P> Charges were brought against the firm at 600 Meta St. after investigations in  August and November by the state Department of Health Services revealed that  the bakery was unsanitary, said Deputy Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Jeff Bennett.  </P> <P> The bakery was also selling tortillas and other foods that did not meet legal  standards of purity and processing, Bennett said.  </P> <P> The bakery and its chief executive officer, Frank Rodriguez, pleaded no contest  to misdemeanor violations and were sentenced last month to three years  probation. A summary probation does not require reporting to a probation  officer. They were also ordered to pay a fine of $500 each.  </P> <P> Bennett said while he suspected many establishments were in violation of the  Health and Safety Code, the conviction was "a little unusual."  </P> <P> The bakery had been given two warnings before charges were filed, he said.  </P> <P> Photographs taken by health inspectors showed that the ceiling was  deteriorating in some places, the kitchen floors were dirty and parts of the  refrigerator were rusting, he said.

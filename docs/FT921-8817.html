			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Letter (1): Women, child care and a tax anomaly Sir, Mrs Johnson's letter (February 13) regarding work (or the lack of it) for women over 40 misses the point. Better childcare provision now will ensure that more of the managers of the future are women, who are less likely than their male counterparts to discriminate against older women. It is in the interests of everyone to ensure that education and training are not wasted in women - whatever their age] Maureen Gore, 5 Elms Farm Road, Hornchurch, Essex RM12 5RH</p>

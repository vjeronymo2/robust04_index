The first, who claimed he was  APLA Internal Commander Karl Zimbiri and used a pre-arranged  codeword, said regional and sectional commanders as well as  ground forces of the Pan Africanist Congress' [PAC] armed wing  had met in Bloemfontein for five hours earlier in the day.  While he respected PAC leader Clarence Makwetu, it was  premature for Mr Makwetu to announce a moratorium in APLA's  armed struggle. "We will strike tommorrow and today...We are  always on the offensive," he said.    Later on Monday night two men, calling within seconds of one  another and claiming to be APLA commanders, also rejected any  cessation of hostilities. Neither was aware of an identifying  codeword.    The man who said he was Ropa Hondo, "commander of special  forces", stated: "APLA will not suspend the armed struggle and  it is not true we have started to tell our forces on ground to  prepare for a ceasefire or moratorium." Mr Hondo said he was  calling from Grahamstown. "More blood will be spilled until the  land is returned to its rightful owners, the toiling masses of  Azania," he declared. Caller Hondo claimed APLA had always been  suspicious of the PAC's participation in the World Trade Centre  negotiations in Kempton Park and viewed the talks with contempt.    Within seconds, [words indistinct] told SAPA Mr Makwetu's  decision had not been welcomed "by me or by forces on ground".  "Claims that the APLA leadership has begun informing cadres of  the moratorium is a lie," caller Haladi said. He added that the  PAC was moving away from its original policy of armed struggle,  and that the decision to suspend the fight had been made by  bourgeoisie politicians. "The armed struggle will continue  until our people have bread and their freedom."</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / International Company News: Hudson's Bay improves 47% HUDSON'S BAY, Canada's largest retail group, has reported a 47 per cent gain in earnings for the third quarter ended October 31. It was helped by a strong performance from its Zellers discount store chain. Net profit was CDollars 21.7m (USDollars 16.9m) or 44 cents a share, up from CDollars 14.8m or 29 cents a year earlier. Zellers posted a sales gain of 8 per cent, bringing the Bay's total revenues to CDollars 1.26bn against CDollars 1.22bn. Nine-month profit was CDollars 24.5m or 49 cents a share against CDollars 12.3m or 18 cents on sales of CDollars 3.43bn against CDollars 3.44bn. Hudson's Bay is 25 per cent owned by the Kenneth Thomson family. Mr Rolph Huband, vice-president, said Zellers continued to gain market share steadily, while heavy cost cutting improved performance at the department store chains. The Bay closed down three distribution centres earlier this year. A committee representing CDollars 525m of Bramalea senior debentures has agreed to the property group's plan to restructure its CDollars 4.8bn debt. They will exchange 30 per cent of their debt for new convertible notes and the rest for equity.</p>

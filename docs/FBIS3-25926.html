The project was sponsored in 1989 by the Chinese Communist  Youth League, in a bid to help children nationwide who have  dropped out of school for various reasons to resume their  studies.    In the past three years, the province's Hope Project  Foundation has received some one million yuan in donations from  about 260,000 home and overseas donors.    With these funds, the province has also established seven  new  "Hope primary schools" in its poverty-stricken areas.    Meanwhile, schools in such areas have received more than  300,000 yuan worth of teaching aids as well as articles for  daily use.    Located in the remote northeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet  plateau, the province is one of the most underdeveloped  provinces in China.</p>

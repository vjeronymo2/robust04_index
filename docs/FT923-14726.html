			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Turkish economy shows signs of growing malaise AN Istanbul district court in an unprecedented ruling recently granted alimony to the wife of a well-known businessman in US dollars. Loss of public confidence in the Turkish lira is the latest symptom of the growing malaise afflicting Turkey's economy, as Mr Suleyman Demirel's government fights to reduce inflation and contain the public deficit. This week, the government faces the first test of its commitment to fiscal austerity when it sets civil servants' salaries. The budget allows for a 13 per cent increase. But Mr Erdal Inonu, deputy premier, said the six-month rise should be in line with inflation, running, on an annual basis, at about 70 per cent. Over the next few weeks, farm-support prices will be announced and wage negotiations start with the big public-sector unions. However, the outlook is not altogether gloomy. First-quarter economic growth was over 6 per cent, against under 1 per cent in 1991. Average public debt maturities on government paper have increased from eight months to 19 months, easing the government's interest burden. But money supply has shown a worrying rise, with the treasury resorting to short-term central bank credits. If a bill awaiting presidential signature becomes law, the government will be able to borrow beyond the legal ceiling of 15 per cent of the budget. Ms Tansu Ciller, chief economics minister, has repeated her pledge to cut inflation to 42 per cent by year-end. But many economists believe triple-digit inflation is possible, unless the government brings in a major stabilisation strategy. Interest rates are holding up obstinately, and corporate borrowers are paying over 100 per cent for working capital. Turkey's foreign exchange position should improve this summer, with remittances from abroad and tourism. But with unions set for a new wage round, and farmers seeking generous subsidies, monetary growth is likely to renew pressure on the lira.</p>

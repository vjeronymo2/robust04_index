			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Milan Knazko, chairman of the Alliance of </F> Democrats of the Slovak Republic, by Maria Hluchanova and Jana  Pankovcinova; place and date not given: "We Are All Defectors  From Totalitarianism"]    [Text] We have learned that, on Saturday [26 March], the  government took stock of the economic situation in individual  government departments. Deputy Prime Minister Schmognerova had  visited the IMF, chiefly to discuss the extension to the Slovak  Republic of the so-called standby credit. The government will  apparently have to decide either to introduce unpopular economic  measures or to consider drawing on the standby credit, which  would be connected with restrictive measures in the social  sphere.    [SME] What is the opinion of the Alliance of Democrats of  the Slovak Republic [AD SR]?    [Knazko] We do not want this government to behave like a  government that has elections in mind. Although the  government's situation is not easy because some departments have  deficits amounting to billions [of Slovak korunas], it should  establish good conditions for the next government, even at the  expense of electoral preferences. It is necessary to explain  pragmatically to the citizen where we stand and stop making  promises. I am confident that the coalition will come to an  agreement. The path toward it will be difficult and  complicated, but the decisions will then be all the more  responsible and conceptual. Let us not anticipate events.    [SME] The present opposition is sending out signals about  imminent mass dismissals from the state administration to be  carried out by this government. If this is true, which and how  many posts will be affected?    [Knazko] Professional expertise is the number-one criterion.  We have not yet discussed this issue in the coalition, but there  cannot be any talk about sweeping or ideologically motivated  dismissals. We are not going to make the same mistakes as the  previous government; we are not going to make any changes that  are not well founded.    [SME] Why did the centrist parties--that is, your party and  the followers of Moravcik and Cernak--not merge last weekend?  The reasons for the failure to merge cited in the media  included technical and legislative, but also other, personal,  ones. What was the main problem?    [Knazko] These matters must be decided by the party's  political bodies. I will clearly work toward the liberal, or  right, center being formed by a single party that would be  capable of representing a genuine counterbalance to other  political entities. I do not consider having a number of small  parties to be an optimal solution at present. I have discussed  my ideas with Messrs. Cernak, Roman Kovac, and Moravcik, and we  have essentially agreed that we will strive for unification. I  think that differences in programs will be minimal, and we have  also practically agreed on personnel issues. The merger between  the AD SR and the followers of Moravcik will take place in the  very near future.    [SME] And what about a merger with Cernak's party?    [Knazko] We will definitely remain open to this possibility.  This will depend on the decision of Mr. Cernak and his party.  Ludovit Cernak's statements to the effect that we do not want to  build the new party any further than the district level or that  we have only intellectuals at the top and no structures are  imprecise and the result of a lack of information. It is  self-evident that we have the ambition to build our political  structures in the same way as any serious party.    [SME] Why then did the three parties not merge this weekend,  as heralded one month ago?    [Knazko] We can still merge. This also depends on Mr.  Cernak's interest in being represented in such a bloc with such  an orientation and on his readiness to accept the fact that a  person will become chairman of the center party who is the most  acceptable from the viewpoint of objective criteria, from the  viewpoint of the approaching elections, and from the viewpoint  of the post he holds.    [SME] Do you think the parties of the center will actually  merge or that they will merely form a preelection coalition?    [Knazko] The AD SR is contemplating a merger rather than a  coalition.    [SME] Do you not think your failure to merge right away also  with Cernak's group represents a wasted chance?    [Knazko] This is everyone's own decision, but it is a  pity--for us but also for Mr. Cernak. I believe that the  differences from the viewpoint of being oriented toward the  European Democratic Union or the Liberal International are not  such that they cannot be overcome. The differences between our  programs will be equally minimal, so I regard this [separate  existence of two parties] as a waste of energy and time.    [SME] You and the group around Jozef Moravcik define  yourselves as a liberal entity. Mr. Cernak, on the other hand,  said on Saturday [26 March] that "the new alternative cannot  rest in boundless liberalism with its `dog eat dog' mentality."  What kind of liberalism do you represent?    [Knazko] Nothing boundless has a place in contemporary  society, only in an extreme one. We have already defined some  liberal priorities--from the citizen, via the community, to the  state, from courage for changes to support for the private  sector. Those are our points of departure, in the implementation  of which it is necessary to accept our social and economic  reality. Our party operates within the context of the Liberal  International. It is a waste of time to talk about  boundlessness. Rather, we hould build firm boundaries and seek  European contacts.    [SME] Right-wing parties, not to mention liberal-oriented  ones, flopped in the last elections, plainly speaking. There is  more and more talk about liberalism at present, yet the poll  results do not support this. According to the preelection  polls, the AD SR currently has the support of slightly over 1  percent of voters, and Mr. Moravcik's group does not even figure  in the polls. How do see the prospects for the liberal-oriented  parties in the September elections?    [Knazko] I think this political orientation will stop being  the isolated voice of individuals and tiny parties. I therefore  expect much of the unification of persons and programs. I set  great hopes in the membership base growing more numerous and  being able, by virtue of the numbers, to assert liberal policies  more effectively throughout Slovakia. There will also be far  more visible political personalities representing this kind of  policy. In my opinion, this is the result of a certain process  that was perhaps inevitable. It started in the Public Against  Violence movement [VPN] and continued, in part, in the Movement  for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. Through natural  crystallization, a certain selection of political personalities  took place who will be capable of representing liberal policies.  And I have no doubt that this will also find its expression in  public opinion polls--in a substantially increased percentage of  electoral preferences.    [SME] Are you not afraid that the people associated in the  AD SR and around Jozef Moravcik will be regarded by the people  as HZDS defectors, who have nothing in common except their  distaste for Vladimir Meciar?    [Knazko] No, not at all. This is a very simplified and  demagogic perception of some commentators, by which I do not  mean you. We all are defectors from totalitarianism, defectors  from the VPN because, without them, the present party structures  would not have been created. One of the reasons the HZDS was  formed as a broad spectrum movement was to make it possible for  new political parties to emerge from it. Some people have  supposedly broken away from the HZDS and are now so-called  defectors. I consider this, however, to be a very positive  process that has not yet ended. Let us return to the defectors.  Why use such pejorative terms? These are people whose political  views have become crystallized thanks to HZDS policies. These  so-called defectors underwent baptism by fire and were forced to  defend their views, in defiance of HZDS methods. The HZDS  played a positive role in this regard.    [SME] HZDS Deputy Chairwoman Olga Keltosova said on Saturday  [26 March] that the movement wants to transform itself into a  party of the "pragmatic center." In this context, she said  that, personally, she prefers liberal values. How do you assess  the possibility of the HZDS joining the Liberal International?    [Knazko] It does not matter who declares what. What matters  is the kind of policy one actually practices. The HZDS has  convinced me of many things, except that it prefers liberal  values. That is the last thing that would occur to me. Had  this been true, we all could have calmly remained in the HZDS.</p>

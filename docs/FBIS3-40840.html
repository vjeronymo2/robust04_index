			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Chandra Shekhar interviewed by Ram Bahadur Ray: "Using </F> Religion as a Support Is Not the Only Danger, So Is Using  Casteism"; place and date not given]  <H5>  [21 Jan pp 1, 10] </H5>   [Text] Former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar talks  openly, rising above the party politics and election benefits  level. When talking about national issues, his openness has hurt  him in his political life. Be it the issue of the emergency,  Punjab, Ram Janambhumi-Babri Masjid, or Mandal, Chandra  Shekhar's opinion was always different and far from the beaten  path. During the emergency, even though he was in the Congress  Party, he supported JP [Jay Prakash Narayan]. On the issue of  swadeshi, he did not hesitate in supporting the RSS [Rashtriya  Swayamsevak Sangh]. He is as worried about the religious  politics of the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] as he is about  Kanshi Ram and Mulayam Singh Yadav's caste politics. We are  giving excerpts from an interview on political and social issues  with Ram Bahadur recently.    [Question] Before the election, you announced that both the  Congress and the BJP are dangerous to the nation. Regardless of  which one wins, in your opinion, what is the danger now? Do you  see a third danger?    [Chandra Shekhar] The results of this election have given us  two kinds of hints. One is that the danger of the BJP has been  pushed back some. But this danger is not totally gone. The BJP  defeat in Uttar Pradesh [UP] is being given too much importance;  however, the narrow slogans that it used to win the elections of  the past were stolen by the people who defeated it. As dangerous  as using religion in politics to win a government is,  encouraging caste feelings for this purpose is no less  dangerous. Narrow politics always takes us into blind alleys. I  do not want the situation to become any worse; however, the  preliminary indicators tell us that the situation is taking a  dangerous turn. Another thing is that if regional political  parties form governments in different places, then the unity of  our nation will be jeopardized. I believe that regional parties  should come into power in the federal system of a government.  However, the indecisiveness of the central government about  these challenges worries me. The recent elections have made it  clear that the power of regional parties will continue to  increase. At the same time, it is clear that the present  government at the Center cannot make a clear decision in any  difficult situation. Running a country and running a government  are two very different things. Our present prime minister is  expert in running the government; however, it is clear that he  lacks the ability to make decisions in running the country.    If the Congress Party breaks up, then there will be a danger  similar to the emergence of regional parties. I am not a  supporter of the Congress Party; however, disintegration of the  Congress Party will directly benefit the BJP at the national  level. It is true that the danger from the BJP will come after  some time. However, in a country like India, with so much  diversity, the BJP will be unable to maintain unity. Gaining  power through the use of blind religious feelings will make a  party autocratic. It is impossible to run this country through  an autocratic system. It has not happened in the past, nor will  it happen in the future.    As for the third power, I have tried for it. But the people  who were so eager for unity suddenly retreated. This makes clear  one more aspect: that we consider politics only as a timely  success. Politics is a long-range pursuit. It is a kind of  hard work in which a person, after failing many times, gives a  new message and strength to the future generations. But the  present leaders consider it only as an ideal. They say that only  unsuccessful and failed people talk like that. The results of  the recent elections clearly indicate that many leaders lose  everything with one bump. The people who, until yesterday,  claimed to write a new history are seeing their castles of hope  destroyed like a house of cards. If they do not have enough  power to even oppose consistently, then they cannot talk about  writing history. They cannot even take a preliminary step in  politics.    [Question] If we forget the caste equation from the recent  U.P. election results, will the major part played by the  backward people there strengthen Indian democracy?    [Chandra Shekhar] I would be happy if this happened now. But  judging from some incidents in Uttar Pradesh, it is clear that  this will not happen. The slogans that were used for uniting the  backward groups could result in a caste struggle because of  voices raised by the higher-caste people. In this struggle, only  the poor will suffer. It is important to pay attention to the  fact that the slogans used to get the support of the poor can  arouse some special emotions. If emotions are aroused on caste  hatred and not on the rich and poor equation, then it would not  be very difficult to change this to an economic war. We are  successful in efforts for which we try hard. The question of a  revolution is a separate one. I believe that we are looking at  this problem within the framework of parliamentary democracy,  and therefore, we do not see any danger here. It is easy to  arouse emotions, but it is hard to direct them for productive  work. This is clear from our political experience over the last  few hundred years.    [Question] Keeping in mind the character of the middle class  during the last 50 years, or the kind of people that have been  becoming the leaders in government, do you consider them the  reason for their failure to keep their promises?    [Chandra Shekhar] The kind of society we create will result  in the same kind of people emerging into our social, political,  and economic life. Therefore, what is important is the kind of  society we create. The leaders in various regions are surrounded  by their narrow spheres. We have spread the limits around  ourselves. We have to start this work somewhere. I believe that  beginnings should take place where decisions about India's  future are made.    There are two great qualities that our country has. First,  our people are not ignorant. If we disregard religious history  and tradition, we will find that the people are very flexible  about creating a society. If we explain to them the interests  and negative aspects of our country, then they accept our  argument after some hesitation--that is, if those who understand  it realize these facts during their lifetime. The sadhus and  saints get thousands of disciples. Some of these are of bad  character; however, that is our country's greatest strength.  This has been our tradition for thousands of years. We have to  give the right direction to this strength, so that it benefits  our country. The second quality is that we have the tendency to  be satisfied with very little. In no other country are laborers  willing to work so hard for so little as in India. They have to  understand that their hard work will benefit the children of the  future. However, we could not use both these qualities. Neither  did we present examples to the people, nor could we give the  right direction to our country's energy and its inherent  strengths.  <H5>  [22 Jan pp 1, 5] </H5>   [Text] Former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar is not  disappointed, even in this disheartening atmosphere. He feels  that our country is in the process of change. This period,  instead of disappointing him like it does other people, also  gives him hope. He has faith in the inherent powers of the  Indian society. The government has opened the door to world  powers to let them play openly here. Still, the society will  rise against the new challenges. This is the second part of  Chandra Shekhar's talk with Ram Bahadur Rai.    [Question] Those who lead India during this time of change  do  not care about long-range results. Do not you think that this is  a period of change for our country?    [Chandra Shekhar] I believe it is a period of change. I also  believe that some people are trying to give a specific direction  to history, which is not permanent. However, we cannot isolate  ourselves to make a decision, because the world has become very  complex. Other countries are trying to influence our political  character. In this context, we remember Mrs. Indira Gandhi. You  are aware that I strongly criticized her policies, but she  should be praised for two things. First, she did not tolerate  even the slightest interference of another country in our  national politics. Second, she did not allow the Center to  become weak. It has become clear during the last few years that  our prime ministers have failed on both these fronts. It is also  clear that in any country where foreign interference was  increased in internal politics, the government could not be  saved. It has not been long since the Soviet Union fell. Not  only did the government fall there, but the people also lost  their prestige, glory, and self-respect.    [Question] Do you mean that regional politics will cause  foreign interference, and that this will cause the fall of our  nation?    [Chandra Shekhar] It is imperative to encourage regional  politics in order to increase foreign interference. All this  will not happen suddenly. These tendencies have been encouraged  over the last few years. They were encouraged to flourish in  various ways. Now, with all the variance here, with people  living in luxury on one side and a society living in poverty on  the other, it is difficult to feel the pulse of the society with  only one slogan. In such a time, the government's role becomes  very important. Our constitution was written with all this in  mind.    The efforts made to encourage regional powers during the  last  few years are not hidden from anyone. Many people in the Indian  government know this well. Buta Singh, home minister during  Rajiv Gandhi's government, told me many things as the home  minister. I cannot share those with you without his permission.  I did not say anything at that time, because that would have  weakened the central government, and would only have encouraged  those elements that were giving importance to such tendencies.    [Question] The truth is that we have a society with open  democratic values inherent in it. The social inequities are part  of it. We have opened all kinds of doors to the world. This is  giving an opportunity to all world powers to interfere in our  internal affairs. Those powers are inciting our people's  desires, and are taking advantage of them. There are some  dangerous signs. No other country has ever opened itself to our  side interference like we have during the period of infancy of  democracy that we are in. You are talking about the inherent  powers of the Indian society. But what will the opposing forces  in our society do to confront these developments?    [Chandra Shekhar] I have visited many universities over the  last few days. I feel that our youth are very much aware of  this. They understand the problems in our country. They have the  courage to understand and solve these difficult problems and the  situation. I have seen the appropriate feelings among them.  Unfortunately, the real issues are not being brought into focus.  We are neither bringing these issues to the people, nor are we  talking about them at their level. These questions are not  discussed in Parliament or in the media. These are the platforms  on which the youth are educated about the legislatures. I am  sure that the time will come when the people will realize the  dangerous results and rise up in opposition. Today's situation  is not as disappointing as that of the 1920s, when Gandhi was  towering over the Indian political horizon. Even in that  disappointing situation, a new power emerged that had risen to  protect the nation's pride and respect. When the people feel  that the pride and glory of our nation is in danger, then they  will react strongly. The people will not remain silent. The  binds of caste and religion will be broken then. This is our  only hope. This process can be accelerated and made effective.  All we need is to do something about it. If we try, then this  process of opposition will start soon. The people will rise up  against this opportunist tendency in our Indian politics.    [Question] Do you see any time lines?    [Chandra Shekhar] This work is done through the inherent  power of the people. No one can say how much time it will take.  For example, look at 1975. When an emergency rule was imposed on  the country, the people outside said that democracy had been  ended in India for good. Elections, however, were announced in  1977, when the emergency was still in force. At that time, many  leaders were still in jail. Except for two or three persons,  everyone thought that they would not take part in the elections.  No one wanted to run against Indira Gandhi. They felt that the  election would not be free and unbiased. The Jan Sangh,  Samajwadis, and many other parties even passed resolutions about  it, and issued important statements. I do not want to take the  credit that only two or three people, including Morarji Desai  and I, believed that people would finally run for election. When  elections were announced, a reaction surfaced within one week.  The more serious the problem, the faster and more powerful the  reaction. A time will come when the people will say that they  will not go with the politics of slogans. They will demand the  politics of real and basic issues.    [Question] You have said correctly that people were hurt  during the emergency. That was one reason for their rising.  However, the hunger for self-respect of the backward classes is  hidden behind the caste slogans. Their efforts to come into  government is an expression of their self-respect. For what  reason could they believe that some people are cashing in on  their hunger for self-respect, using some slogans about castes?    [Chandra Shekhar] This is a very sensitive question. Our  caste system is very complex. No caste or group of castes can  unite everyone using the slogan of self-respect. Let us look at  the SP-BSP [Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party] government in  Uttar Pradesh. The struggles that started soon after its  emergence were between the higher and lower castes. It also  started between the lower castes and the Dalits. Thus, slogans  about castes have a hole in them for uniting everyone.    [Question] You are talking about a struggle in the people's  everyday life. The politics of elections gives them the  opportunity to express their feelings about castes. Can the  contradictions of daily life get their political echo?    [Chandra Shekhar] Let us look at it with a liberal point of  view. People do not live on caste slogans. They are tired of  such a voting system. Let us look at the other forces that were  in the arena of elections. One was the BJP, which floated all  kinds of communal slogans. Let us look at the party within the  Janata Dal of which I was the member. We also raised the same  one-sided slogans. We kept kicking social justice again and  again. We did not focus on industrial policy, economic policy,  and unemployment. When, in an opportunist type of politics,  there is an open competition, the people will lean toward the  louder slogans. I have told some of my BJP friends that if they  can use slogans of dividing people over religion, then in some  regions and at some other time, the slogans of caste could be  more effective. In an election, everyone is competing in raising  slogans. In this situation, the poor people had only one option:  to pick the louder slogan.    [Question] Did animal feelings erupt in this competitive  situation?    [Chandra Shekhar] This time around, in this political  opportunist atmosphere, the vote went to animal feelings. I will  not say that I was the first in this area; however, these  slogans will not remove illiteracy, unemployment, and hunger.  Let us think: Imagine you are a Dalit, you are enjoying all the  luxuries of life, and economic prosperity. On the other side is  a high-caste person who is dying of hunger. Now, who is getting  privileges and benefits? Since you are enjoying all the  luxuries, cannot we say that you are getting unique treatment?    [Question] At one time, you said that the youth, the RSS,  and  the bureaucracy are the three institutions on which the country  can depend. What is your opinion of these three now?    Let us talk about the bureaucracy first. My opinion about it  has been clear from the beginning. In 1971, a Yugoslavian  professor came to see me. He asked me about our bureaucracy. I  told him that the bureaucracy in our country is the best in the  world. He was surprised; however, he also felt the same. He said  that over 10 million refugees had come to India from Bangladesh,  and an equal number had gone back. All this was done very  efficiently by our administrative service officers within six  weeks. He had just returned from there. He told me that no other  leader had said this about our bureaucracy. When I was in the  government for six months, I did not have any experience to  indicate that these people delay cases. After all, there are  always one or two persons everywhere who make problems. Before  we get their opinion, we should consider two things. First, we  must let them know that we cannot punish them for what they are  saying. Second, we should not made decisions before even asking  their advice on it. We have to assure them that if we have  ignored any opinion, then it will not be considered their crime.  If we pay attention to this, I do not think there would be a  better bureaucracy than we have. I am very proud of the  achievement of our bureaucracy in some difficult situations.    As for the youth's power here, everyone says that after  independence, our youths lost the patriotism and ability to make  sacrifices they once had. They are moving toward a life of  comfort. They cannot follow ideals in a crisis. But I believe  differently. Between 1947 and 1993, we saw a number of youth  sacrificing themselves for their ideals. Their number is greater  than what we had during our struggle for independence. We may  not agree with their talk or their viewpoints; their path may be  very different than ours. But this does not mean that their  inherent ability is any less. Many people were killed in the  Naxalite rebellion. How many people were killed in the uprisings  in Punjab and Kashmir? Many of them may have been deceived by  others; however, we have to understand one thing. They were  sacrificing their lives for other people. It does not matter how  much one may curse me about it. We just cannot ignore their  inner feelings and energy.    I am opposed to the way the RSS thinks, but some of the  ideas  this organization has--for example, the nationalism and swadeshi  issues--are things they will always follow. I do not agree with  their definition of nationalism, but if the country needs  anything, they will never hesitate to do it for the nation.  There is a small faction within the RSS that does not think that  becoming an MP [member of Parliament] or an MLA [member  Legislative Assembly] is necessary. During our struggle for  independence, there was a group which sewed hand-spun cotton all  its life, or spent its life herding cows or working with the  Harijans. Similarly, there is a group within the RSS that will  always raise its voice on these questions. I have criticized the  RSS a lot, and it does have many flaws. However, wherever there  is power in our society, we cannot ignore it. In this critical  situation, we are not using all of nation's energy to protect  our society. Therefore, I have to say that it will be the RSS  that will become a problem for the BJP in the future. Advani or  Atal Behari Bajpayee can openly support the present economic  policies. But a man like Murli Manohar Joshi can still shut them  up over the swadeshi issue because of the RSS policies. The joy  with which Mr. Advani during his travel in the United States  supported the economic policy was emulated by Atal Behari  Bajpayee, when he said that should Narasimha Rao resign and he  were to form government, he would follow the same policies. The  RSS people are traveling around the country and propagating the  kinds of policies put forth by Bala Sahab Deoras and Murli  Manohar Joshi. While I disagree with other policies of the  RSS, you cannot ignore their effort to bring feelings of  swadeshi to every person in the country. If you ignore it, then  you are not using the power of our people appropriately. This is  the main support system in a democracy, and it is necessary for  any national campaign to use as much power and support as it can  get. We have to reach our goal, and it does not mean that  everyone else will reach their goal. However, we have to take  people with us; it does not matter how many steps they take with  us. Perhaps it was Marx who said it; maybe it was Lenin, or it  could be Mahatma Gandhi. Mr. Gandhi was an idealist, but you  cannot say that from among his supporters there were no people  who drank or ate meat. You cannot even say that Mr. Gandhi did  not know that there were people in his party who lied without  hesitation. Still, Gandhi used whatever support and strength he  got from them. However, he never compromised with various  tendencies. We do not have to compromise with the RSS  tendencies. But we should use their competence.  <H5>  [23 Jan pp 1, 7] </H5>   [Text] Former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar does not  consider himself capable of playing the role of Gandhi or Jay  Prakash Narayan. However, he considers it important to learn  from their mistakes. He spoke openly about the Bihar campaign,  and analyzed its strengths and weaknesses after two decades. He  threw some light on it for the first time. He never joined a  cabinet headed by another prime minister. He did not discuss why  Jay Prakash Narayan made a historical mistake by appointing  Morarji Desai prime minister in 1977. This is the third  installment of Chandra Shekhar's interview with Ram Bahadur  Ray.    [Question] It appears that the bureaucracy, the youth, and  the RSS all feel helpless now. Can the influence of these three  still be used to help our country?    [Chandra Shekhar] No. I do not believe that they consider  themselves helpless. I am sure that you and I have both felt  that people do not listen to what they are saying. One should  not worry about this, because it happens in every critical  situation. When problems increase extremely, they also open the  path for a new solution. As the saying goes, too much pain  becomes a medicine in itself. There is another strange thing. In  our country, when we have political differences, we do not want  to have any personal relationships. I do not believe that I am  washed in milk [flawless]. But because of some mutual  misunderstanding, insulting someone else is not something I  consider a part of politics. I have never compromised my  beliefs. Therefore, I will take anyone as far as he can walk  with me. I want to say that if some people had not tried to make  accusations against the RSS in 1977, then the RSS of today would  not be what it is now. Some people tried to accuse it, and some  did succeed. The leaders wanted to accuse the RSS, and the RSS  leaders retracted their accusation. The reason for this is those  "good" powers that I failed give proper political direction even  after cooperating with them.    [Question] The people had similar hopes for the 1977 change  in government as they had with the 1947 change. It was also  believed that the change in government would lead to a change in  the system. But during the Janata Party rule, this did not  happen within the party or the government's administration. This  disappointment gave birth to the present crisis. If you get  another opportunity, would you take a lesson from those failures?    [Chandra Shekhar] I have some experience that is very  difficult for me to share publicly. I will have to talk with  some of the people who were running the government at the time.  This is a very painful issue. What you people know is not  enough. What happened was that the 1975-77 emergency era was  very short. People were in jail for 18 months. Later, anyone  who emerged in the political arena had arrived there after  winning the election. When they won, they not only became MP or  MLA, they even became ministers. They understood neither the  struggle nor the society, nor did the understand the complexity  of the problems. They did not even understand the goal of the  movement about which you are talking now.    [Question] Before that movement, I told Jay Prakash:  "Keeping  in mind the people's opinion, if you are thinking that the  people will join the movement, Indira Gandhi will send you to  jail, public rallies will be held, there will be a tumult in the  Lok Sabha, the Rajah Sabha, and the Vidhan Sabha; and public  opinion will be formed, then you are wrong. This will not  happen. Your voice will be muted. The opposition that is  following the whole movement now, for the most part, has nothing  to do with the campaign itself. They have no respect for the  feeling inherent in this campaign. These people want to get into  government on your coattails. They may be successful in their  goal, but you will only be disappointed." I told this to Jay  Prakash Narayan not alone, but in the presence of 10 other  people.    I also wrote letters to Jay Prakash and Indira Gandhi. I  wrote to Indira Gandhi that the communist leaders were trying to  have her and Jay Prakash clash with each other, and that they  were conspiring to enter the government through the back door. I  also wrote that her clash with Jay Prakash would be fatal to our  country. Jay Prakash was not fighting to get into government;  therefore, he could not be pressured with the power of  government. If Jay Prakash is ready to die by himself, I told  her, she still could not save the government. Therefore, it  would be best that she stopped the confrontation with him. Her  government's power and Jay Prakash's moral strength could save  the nation. I wrote another letter to Jay Prakash. I told him  that his followers wanted government, and not a total  revolution. Therefore, he should talk to Indira Gandhi.    He did not listen to me. Both of them are not here now, and  I  am talking about them now. I was a bit successful in my efforts.  This success was limited to Indira Gandhi writing a letter to  Jay Prakash. But their followers increased the tension between  them. The leadership of both those people depended on the  continuing fight between Indira Gandhi and Jay Prakash. Later,  when the emergency was implemented, I also went to jail. There  was another problem. You cannot name even two dozen such young  people who walked with the feeling of revolution. I remember  that after 18 months, 52 young people from the student movement  applied for election tickets.    I obtained tickets for 45-48 of them after talking with  Karpuri Thakur. Some of them won elections and even became  cabinet members. After my government was formed, I went to Patna  as the president of the Janta Party. We had a meeting at night  there. In one of the speeches, someone said that the right  people were not elected to the government. After half an hour, I  said that I became a legislator in 1962, and have not even been  able to become a deputy minister in 15 years. I said that I did  not have the skill to become a minister, and that they could ask  about this of anyone. I was very disappointed that day. One boy,  who had gone to jail while attending college, had become an MP  after 18 months, and wanted to become a minister immediately. He  had forgotten sacrifices, Jay Prakash Narayan, and the whole  movement. We have to admit that this was the greatest weakness  of the whole campaign.    Second, there was no one in the Janata Party that considered  himself equal to another. Everyone thought himself superior to  others. It is useless to say anything about Morarji. Talking  about Charan Singh is also useless. The Jan Sangh people had  come as a power group. The idealism of the socialists had gotten  to their heads. What could be done in that situation? When I  remember those incidents, I wonder: How did the government last  for 28 months? I can remember, based on those experiences, that  running a government in a country like India, in today's  situation, requires a lot of courage and clear thinking. We have  to prepare ourselves for the fact that we may have to leave the  government tomorrow. The way we have to run the government today  is a separate issue.    There was one great benefit from that movement, however.  That  was the world's agreement that democracy had died in India, and  that it would never thrive there. In this situation, return of  the democracy could be considered the greatest gain of our  campaign. The 18-month emergency, followed by the return of  democracy, is not a gain that we can ignore. I told Jay Prakash  not to advise anyone anymore. I told him, "You achieved  everything in the twilight of your life, even things that Gandhi  did not attain. Therefore, please keep yourself separate from  everyone. Both Sardar Patel and Pundit Nehru rejected Gandhi,  and today's leaders will not accept him. Your health is not  good, either."    [Question] There are dozens of people in the next row of  this  movement who did not go to any leaders to ask for any party's  ticket for election, who were devoted to the cause during the  whole period of this campaign. Still, it is a fact that this  flow stopped after the Janata government was formed. Who do you  blame for this?    [Chandra Shekhar] Listen, there are two things. Please  forget  that all of this happened because of the Janata Party  government. The ambiguity that was rampant in the movement was  the reason for it. To those who ask me to play the roles of  Gandhi and Jay Prakash, I say that I do not agree, and people  think I am striving to get into power. I have been a student of  political science and have had open discussions with Jay Prakash  many times. I do not understand impartial politics. There can be  social reformers, but there cannot be political workers who are  impartial. You were right in what you said about the young  people. It is not that they were disappointed in no time. Some  young people worked for a long time. However, after that, they  stopped. Let us look at Jay Prakash's example. He opposed the  politics of parties. But when we had to change the government,  he had to depend on the parties that he had opposed strongly.  Therefore, the greatest weakness of this movement was that we  said all the negative things, but did not clarify the positive  aspects. There were many young men in this movement who were  intelligent. But where did they go from there? Some of them had  worked for 12 years, staying hungry. I have met people like  that. They stopped after reaching a specific point, because they  were taught not to follow the politics of parties. Had they  continued, and were they still working now, then some new  politics could be started. You say that there is such a large  force; however, new youths are not joining us. And if they do  join, then they do not have contact with us. We have taught the  young people who worked with us in old times that the politics  of parties is a bad thing. However, politics has to run with  them. If a house is dirty, then someone has to clean it.  Standing outside and saying that the house is dirty will not  clean the house.    [Question] Two decades have passed since your movement. What  is your evaluation of the movement?    [Chandra Shekhar] Before we understand this movement, we  have  to first understand JP, and many people have misunderstood him.  There were two sides to his personality. In the area of  philosophy, he always worked like an investigator. Therefore,  his thoughts always changed. JP had to change his philosophy,  starting with Marx, to Vinoba Bhave, until this movement.  Therefore, many times, people said that he was ambiguous. He  understood that there was no limit to thinking, and that there  was no finite thought. One must look for new ideas and  philosophy according to the situation. This was his unique  quality. His decision in the area of action was unbreakable. For  example, in 1942, he put forth the slogan of "do or die." While  other Congress leaders thought this was just another Gandhian  slogan, JP followed it all his life. His jumping the walls of  Hazaribagh jail was an example of putting the "do or die" slogan  into practice. I wrote in an article that Jay Prakash's idea  could change, but when he would jump into the arena of action,  no power in the world could shake him. Therefore, these people  in government could never understand the real meaning of what he  said. Jay Prakash's movement depended on these two aspects.  There was always a lot of action in the area of philosophy. He  talked a lot and wrote a lot about the total revolution. This  was a result of his profound thinking, which he had taken to a  logical conclusion. One main reason was his ill health. But he  moved this revolution very rapidly. One reason was the  situation, and the second was his own personality. Therefore, if  anyone evaluates this revolution after 20, 50, or even 100  years, then that person must conclude that one must be willing  to accept new ideas and changes, and must not hesitate in  following one's determination and decisive ideas. Therefore, the  Jay Prakash revolution was unique in itself. Had the emergency  stayed for six months or a year more, then perhaps there would  have been more logical results.    [Question] JP played a major role in selecting a prime  minister in 1977. Do you feel that he selected the wrong person  for this position?    [Chandra Shekhar] Former Prime Minister Morarji Desai is our  respected politician. What can I say about him? I changed my  opinion at that time. You may remember that I was asked to  become a cabinet member. When I declined, Jay Prakash asked me  why I did that. I told him that he knew my opinion. I did not  want to be a member of that cabinet. It was wrong that I wanted  to join the cabinet to straighten out the prime minister,  because remaining a cabinet member depends on the wishes of the  prime minister. If you do not agree with the prime minister, to  be able to run the government according to his wishes, then it  is neither moral nor honest to be a member of such a cabinet.    I want to tell you one more thing. People say that Chandra  Shekhar had his eye on the chair of the prime minister;  therefore, he never became a minister. This is not true. I  believe that if you go into government and do not change the  government system, it will be difficult to change society. I  believe that I should not join the cabinet of a prime minister  whose philosophy I do not agree with. One after another, whether  it was Indira Gandhi, Morarji Desai, or V. P. Singh, none of  them had the same philosophy that I did. I was not willing to  work with them. I do not believe that I should work against the  person in whose cabinet I am a member. Therefore, if some  minister says that he had joined the cabinet to change the  government, I will not believe him. It is not possible in a  parliamentary democracy. Therefore, I did not join any cabinet,  and it was not because of sacrifice or unselfishness. I never  even dreamed that I would become a prime minister by following  this path. I became prime minister for six months. That is  another story.  <H5>  [24 Jan pp 1, 10] </H5>   [Text] Former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar has had  the experience of running the government. His period was short;  however, he had experienced many new things. His experience with  the bureaucracy and the army, especially amazes people. During  this interview, he talked about two positive forces which, if  used appropriately, could accelerate the change. He also shed  some light on their weakness. We often think negatively of our  bureaucracy. A lot has been said about the negative aspects of  the RSS. Chandra Shekhar has the ability to look at this from a  different perspective. This is his specialty. This is the fourth  installment of Chandra Shekhar's interview with Ram Bahadur  Ray.    [Question] What possibilities do you see, looking at the  social, economic, and political character of the RSS, the  bureaucracy, and our youth?    [Chandra Shekhar] These three forces are organized  separately. The RSS and the bureaucracy, of course, are  organized. The young people are also organized in a small way.  These are not the only three powers. The farmers and the  laborers have their own power. They also have some organization,  borne out of their own pains. There are different possibilities  with each of these forces. Let us talk about the bureaucracy  first. Its greatest quality is its ability to solve various  problems. It can combine the experience of the world with its  own experience. The bureaucrats understand the principles that  are important to this country. These three things make them a  very positive force for us. However, there are some weak  elements. When a person gets a job, he has a great desire to  serve the people. Slowly and gradually, however, as they get  promotions, the greed for luxuries increases their tendency to  become yes men. They cannot tell the truth, even when they know  what is right and what is wrong. Therefore, if we want to use  them appropriately, then the political leaders must assure them  that if they give an opinion, it should not affect their jobs.  The politicians lack this quality. We want to run them according  to our own wishes. We do not let them do their duties according  to their wishes. If we discipline ourselves, then the  bureaucracy will also be disciplined. It is clear that the  faster the politicians change themselves, the more effective the  bureaucracy will be. They will also change. Now that the  character of politicians has fallen at a large scale, this will  naturally influence the bureaucracy.    [Question] Mr. Trilok Singh was a very effective bureaucrat,  and he worked around the clock. Can we reform our bureaucracy by  imposing the Trilok Singh model? You said that the bureaucracy  can be reformed by reducing political pressure. Can we run a  model here like the one in France?    [Chandra Shekhar] First of all, it took a long time to  establish a bureaucracy like this in France. Then, there are  many differences between India and France. They do not have  inconsistencies and diversity like we have here. As for Trilok  Singh or L. P. Singh, they have high standards. Despite all the  weaknesses, the level of the politician was very high at that  time. On one side there was Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad, Pundit  Nehru, and Keshav Dev Malviya. There was also Morarji Desai,  whom I consider in the same class. What did Lal Bahadur Shastri  not do to protect the image of the cabinet? Let us look at the  attitude of this government a few weeks ago. There is no meaning  in comparing the leaders of that time and of today. That time  was very different.    There are many good people in the bureaucracy now. But  because of pressure, they cannot write their honest opinion on  the files. We should not expect the bureaucracy alone to make  all the changes. The degeneration of character is common now; if  hemp has been mixed in water of the well itself, how can the  bureaucracy be left unaffected? Therefore, efforts to change  should be made at every level. If the people at the top do not  feel the need for change, then it will not be effective. Because  of the internationalization of our economic system, our  bureaucracy is coming into contact with the whole world. But the  people they are coming in contact with are mostly ignorant about  the problems of our country. If we ignore some exceptions, I do  not think that those people working for multinational companies  and international organizations are fully aware of the problems  of our country. They do not use the perspective necessary to  look at our country's problems. This will have bad results. We  used to say that we would make social progress through hard  work, according to our resources, and by being simple and  frugal. The slogan has changed now. The world is changing very  fast. We have joined the race for luxury goods. The work to  change mentalities is starting there, and a small group will get  all the luxuries. It is said that liberalization will give  freedom to everyone. But what exactly will happen is that those  who are rich will have more freedom to hoard wealth, and those  who are dying of hunger will have the freedom to die suffering  of hunger. It would be wrong to believe that the bureaucracy  will be unaffected by this change. Therefore, I believe that  those connected with international organizations are not aware  of our backward nature and poverty. That is why there is some  distortions in setting our policies.    [Question] This makes one believe that the bureaucracy is  working for three percent (upper class) of the people. It is not  worried about the remaining 97 percent.    [Chandra Shekhar] The bureaucracy cannot provide any  leadership. It does what we tell it to do. The bureaucracy  implements the plans that we assign it. Therefore, when we ask  it to lead, we are ignoring our responsibility.    [Question] You are warned us of the danger of the new  political culture that is thriving. You have told us how to  change that at the intellectual level? What methods will be  necessary to change it at the political level?    [Chandra Shekhar] After joining the bureaucracy, people  become part of a circle. They try to do their duty as well as  they can. This is not a personal weakness; it is the weakness of  the whole system. The bureaucracy has its own limitations for  making sacrifices for the future. It cannot go any farther than  that.    The young people have to prepare themselves mentally for a  long time to face the challenges. This is their helplessness.  For them, the life of tomorrow is not the only important thing.  They have to think about their own lives. The politician who has  earned respect today will be satisfied by doing some work for  immediate gratification. But young people who understand the  future will not hesitate to make sacrifices to make the future  more productive and stable. There is no dearth of such young  people in our country. Many young people made sacrifices during  the last 46-47 years. We can trust them even today. No society  falls at once. The Indian society, after all, will collapse only  after great crises. This is clear after the history of the last  5,000 years. Let us forget the era of Rama and Krishna. History  clearly shows us that our society cannot break down. There can,  of course, be some ups and downs.    The third issue is the RSS. It has its own beliefs. We  cannot  ignore their positive aspects. I have also tried to understand  the RSS from the beginning. They are told that they should not  hanker for higher positions, and should not be involved in  day-to-day politics. They are not involved in blind competition,  allowing them to finish their work and become MPs or MLAs. We  have to admit that this approach of self-control is better for a  long-range struggle. Therefore, it is not wrong to expect these  people to do something for the society. Their other quality is  their strong feeling for the glories of our past. Any country  that does not campaign for its achievements of the past cannot  build a better future. There were some bad things in our 5,000  years of history. But there were many positive aspects also. We  should not ignore those. The attitude we had about the human  race in the past has affected these people somewhere--for  example, the question of swadeshi. I do not believe that the RSS  is looking at swadeshi and self-dependence with the same kind of  political perspective the BJP is using. This is clear from the  mentality of these two groups. The RSS people are very  disciplined in their daily work. This discipline benefits them  in a positive way and also hurts them. We can use their  discipline in a positive way to build the future of our nation.  Therefore, we should not ignore their strengths.    There are some negative aspects about the RSS. For example,  their viewpoint about the religion. It is not clear to me what  basis they are making it on. I know that this does not agree  with our traditional humanistic viewpoint. The narrow  description of religion that the BJP is giving is wrong. I said  once in Parliament that I am proud to be a Hindu, because it is  the only religion that does not condemn other religions. We have  adopted every aspect that shows humanity the right path. While  we have considered it important to recognize God, we also  worship Gautama Buddha, who did not believe in God. We also  worship Charvak as a saint, although he was against then-Hindu  beliefs. Perhaps you remember the question of suttee. People  believed in different things. The suttee, on one side, believed  in forcibly burning the widow. On the other hand, there was the  belief to burn themselves of their own desire. I do not say it  is appropriate to commit suttee if God wants you to. But if  Chandra Shekhar Azad shoots himself instead of being caught by  the British, we worship him. Will we condemn Padmini because she  burns herself before she is caught by the enemy? There is a big  difference between the traditions of johar and suttee. The Hindu  religion never endorses the suttee tradition. But if some woman  commits suttee on her own, we worship her. We also worship a  woman who gives birth to a great son. That is why, in the Hindu  religion, we also worship the five holy girls in addition to the  suttees. In other words, the Hindu religion worships  steadfastness. We worship the power to sacrifice one's life for  the good of the society. It is unfortunate that the liberal  nature of the Hindu religion is not brought to the public. I do  not know what the founder of the RSS thought about it. The  weakness of the present spokesmen for the RSS today is they look  down upon other religions. There is a lot of difference between  the opinion of Balasahab Deoras and Mr. Advani over national  issues. This weakness of the RSS is its greatest flaw. That is  why a large majority of our population views the RSS  suspiciously. Because of this suspicious atmosphere, the  capability of the RSS is reduced, and at the same time, the  possibilities of it emerging as a national force also become  minimal.    [Question] Does the RSS divert its philosophy about the  Hindu  religion when it talks about nationalism?    [Chandra Shekhar] There has been a very liberal description  of Hinduism, and its humanist image has been presented to the  society. The RSS cannot be successful in changing that image.  There may be some distortion for a short time; however, the RSS  does not have the capability to change the humanistic viewpoint  of Hinduism. I told Mr. Advani once that he would not rise above  Yagvalkaya. The idea of world Hindutva came to India first. It  did not exist anywhere in the world before. It was also said  that there was only one God, and that there were many paths to  meeting him. This is what teaches us to respect other religions.  We consider eating meat and fish a sin. But we also worshiped  those who ate meat and fish and managed to meet God. In this  country, where we worship Tukaram, Madhwacharya Ramanujam, and  Gynashwar, and at the same time worship Kinaram, it is important  to understand the Hindu religion methodically. Human nature is  so varied and diversified that all cannot be covered within one  system. The people here understood this a long time ago. Doing  good for another person is considered religion in our society.  Tulsi Das defined religion as "doing good to another." That is  the summary of our definition of religion. Those who give new  definitions to religion do not understand that.    [Question] The RSS has tried to tell us that religion is a  part of society. You say that the RSS has tried to join the  philosophy of Hinduism with the country's politics. They want  everything to be done for religion. Are the definitions of  nationalism and religion given by the RSS distorted?    [Chandra Shekhar] The RSS people always say that they have  nothing to do with plain politics. We are speaking based on this  aspect. They also talk about the aspect that tells us that they  have good intentions. We have opposed the RSS strongly at the  political level. After all, there is no one in the world who is  fully a saint or a devil. There is a portion of saintliness and  devilishness in everyone. Some have more of one than the other.  We want to look for the good in every person in this society so  that they can be helpful in bad days.    [Question] The stand of the RSS in Ayodhya--    [Chandra Shekhar] Ayodhya is not the result of RSS actions.  It happened because of an indecisive and weak government's  mentality. Religion is a path to reaching God. We have the full  right to believe in and follow any religion. But when it  influences politics, it becomes dangerous. Therefore, the  government was created. The invention of a government is based  on the cooperation of people and their helplessness. We expect  that when a person tries to hurt other people, the government  should intervene. It is not just a question of punishing  someone. If people knew that the government is determined to do  its duty, then this destruction would not have happened in  Ayodhya. When I was in the government, no one challenged our  authority. What happened in Ayodhya on 6 December is, in my  opinion, the responsibility of the government. I have said the  same thing to the prime minister. The government and the state  were established because in one or the other place there could  be ill feelings in society. Therefore, the government did not do  its basic duty in the Babri Masjid fiasco.    [Question] That was the problem of the organizing--    [Chandra Shekhar] The problem was not of organization; it  was  of indecisiveness. If we consider it a problem of organization,  we will have a difficult time doing so, because we can have  problems over the border also. The leadership was fully  responsible for it.    [Question] What kind of action could be taken at that time?  If they had started firing, it would have resulted in blood--    [Chandra Shekhar] When there is such a crisis, one has to  shoot. The government spends billions of rupees on the armed  forces and defense. This is not done for the wearing of flower  garlands. Firing bullets is necessary if there is a need, and  you do not start shooting out of cowardice and irresponsibility  to the people.    [Question] The government is defensive in a democracy. Are  not there any limitations when it is involved in a campaign like  the one in Ayodhya?    [Chandra Shekhar] It should be defensive, but it does not  happen that way. Many times, we cannot take defensive steps. We  had to do something at the time. During my government, we never  had to shoot at any one.    [Question] Was not it necessary to stop half a million  people  from going there?    [Chandra Shekhar] Yes, it was wrong to let them go there.  That is why I asked the government to stop it when there were  demonstrations in Delhi, and said that if necessary, they should  start shooting. When a BJP friend said that I responded by  saying that if Advani was arrested without reason, that I would  go to his house; if Advani tried to spread restlessness without  any reason, I could stop him.    [Question] Problems arise if positive policies are not  implemented by a government in a democracy. This leads to more  violence.    [Chandra Shekhar] When a government does not take positive  steps, then it creates anarchy. In such a situation, there are  only two options--either controlling these forces or letting the  society break down.    [Question] Both negative and positive aspects of the RSS  emanate from its philosophy. The energy that the RSS is crating  by combining religious and politics....    [Chandra Shekhar] I have nothing to do with that energy. I  do  not consider it energy. I do not even want to know their  definition of religion, which spreads hatred and enmity toward  other people. I do not know much about the RSS perspective of  the world; however, the liberal viewpoint of Hinduism is one  that no one has been able to duplicate. Neither the Vishwa Hindu  Parishad nor the people who call themselves humanists have  arrived there. I am against those people who consider themselves  progressive because they negate everything that happened in our  past. This is not progress; this is deception. Similarly,  distorting the past for some political gain and using religion  to create energy are not acts to help society; it is changing  the energy to fire and burning the society in it.</p>

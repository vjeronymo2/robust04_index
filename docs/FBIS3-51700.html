			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Quito, 19 Jan (DPA) -- Suddenly, and less than 15  weeks from scheduled elections to renew nearly the entire  Ecuadoran Congress, a legislative majority that supports the  liberal government of President Sixto Duran-Ballen today  approved comprehensive constitutional reforms that will alter  the electoral process already under way.    The number of deputies was increased from 77 to 113, and the  requirement of being affiliated to a political party was  eliminated per the sudden decision by Congress, whose sessions  had previously been suspended until 1 February by Fernando  Rosero, acting president of the chamber. However, Samuel  Belletini, the actual president of Congress, refused to accept  the suspension, and he reconvened the session. Within a few  minutes, the controversial package of reforms was approved amid  loud protests by the opposition.    The change in the composition of Congress, which could alter  the traditional balance between the coastal and mountain  regions, might entail changing the terms of the upcoming 1 May  elections, which officially got under way on 1 January under the  constitutional provisions that were in effect at that time.  According to the official call for elections, 65 of the 77  deputies of the unicameral Congress must be elected.    President Duran-Ballen must promulgate the reforms in order  for them to go into effect, and this is practically assured in  view of the support given to the package by the pro-government  wing.    Violations of procedure, including the approval of rules  without the necessary votes, have been alleged by the  opposition, which has announced its decision to ask the  Constitutional Tribunal to annul the reforms. Meanwhile, the  full scope of the reforms was not clarified in today's session  of Congress. While some sectors assured that the reforms will  not go into effect until 1996 and, in turn, the upcoming  elections will not be affected, other blocs claimed that the  changes will go into effect immediately.    The same Congress must determine the effective date for the  reforms to the Constitution that was approved in a 1978  referendum.</p>

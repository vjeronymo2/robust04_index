			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Judge Won't Trim Sentence: A federal judge rejected a request to cut the  eight-year sentence of self-styled financial adviser David Bloom, who admitted  diverting $10 million of investors' money to fund a lavish life style. Bloom,  24, of Manhattan, is serving two consecutive four-year sentences at the  Allenwood, Pa., federal prison camp after pleading guilty to one count each of  mail fraud and securities fraud. He asked U.S. District Judge David N.  Edelstein to reduce the prison term because it was "harsh," compared to the  sentences of other white-collar criminals and because Bloom is remorseful and  undergoing psychological treatment. But Edelstein noted that Bloom's crime  "involved cheating friends and colleagues," while other convicted white-collar  thieves were charged with "crimes that, although they involved more money,  involved fraud on the system, not particular individuals."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- A private panel on defense  created by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa kicked off  discussion Monday with an eye toward reviewing Japan's  two-decade-old defense policies.    "As the world has changed dramatically after the collapse of  the Cold War structure, our country's handling of defense and  security must change as well," Hosokawa said at the outset of  the inaugural meeting of the panel.    The premier called on the forum to debate new defense  policies "from a stance that takes into account the changed  international situation, technological progress and economic and  human resources."    Hirotaro Higuchi, chairman of ASAHI Breweries Ltd., was  elected as chairman of the nine-member group, with Ken Moroi,  chairman of Chichibu Cement Co., as acting chairman.    Higuchi later told reporters the panel will discuss the  background and the underlying philosophy of the national defense  program outline, which has served as Japan's basic defense  policy since 1976, as well as the current international  situation.    The next meeting of the panel is scheduled for March 9.    The group will offer recommendations to Hosokawa by around  summer for a revision of the national defense program outline  after debating overall defense matters once a week, Higuchi said.    The program calls for the government to maintain security  arrangements against large-scale attacks and also to build up  Japan's own defense capabilities to repel limited-scale invasion.    Based on the panel's recommendations, defense policies,  including Japan's future role in United Nations-led peacekeeping  operations, will likely be revised in time for inclusion in the  Defense Agency's budget requests for fiscal 1995.    The nine members include Kuniko Inoguchi, a Sophia  University  professor, Yoshio Okawara, former ambassador to the United  States and currently special adviser to the Federation of  Economic Organizations (Keidanren), Bank of Tokyo Chairman Toyoo  Gyohten, and Makoto Sakuma, former Joint Staff Council chairman  and currently special consultant for Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone Corp.    The other members are Seiki Nishihiro, former vice minister  for the Defense Agency and currently adviser to Tokyo Marine and  Fire Insurance Co., Shinji Fukukawa, vice president of Kobe  Steel Ltd., and Akio Watanabe, an Aoyama Gakuin University  professor.</p>

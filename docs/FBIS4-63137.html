			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`Siemens' Technology Introduced in </F> St. Petersburg"]    [Text] The Russian-German "Interturbo" enterprise has set  up serial production of 150-megawatt gas turbines, assembled  using Siemens technology. In electric power stations using, for  example, the steam and gas energy production cycle, such  turbines generate almost double the output produced by the  industrial energy systems of thermal electric power stations.  Interturbo, which was set up by Siemens and the St. Petersburg  firm LMZ, was initially geared toward production of "high  technology" goods enjoying a stable demand in power engineering  worldwide.    In the first phase of the enterprise's work the St.  Petersburgers are to assemble units from components delivered  from Germany. At the same time the infrastructure for the  production of components and machine parts in Russian plants is  to be set up. Within a few years deliveries of these items will  dominate the list of turbine components, so the  production-sharing program envisages. The high quality of  Interturbo's ouput is confirmed by the international certificate  issued by experts of the German Technical Oversight Association.</p>

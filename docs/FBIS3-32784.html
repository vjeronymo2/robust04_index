The diplomat, who was appointed to represent his country in  Mexico, told LA REPUBLICA newspaper that "Cuba is willing to  consider the issue if the OAS asks for the island's reentry. [no  closing quotation marks as published]    "Cuba was arbitrarily removed from the OAS and now the  decision for its reentry is the organization's problem, not  ours," the ambassador stated. He added that the international  political situation has changed so much "that many people  believe the decision to exclude Cuba is going out of fashion."    Curbelo said integration "was an old historic aspiration of  the continent," and that the regional and subregional advances  in this direction were "interesting." He noted: "For us, the  integration process and the international meetings have an  effective and practical value because, regarding the Caribbean's  participation, they foster rapprochement of all countries."    Cuba, he added, does not participate in any regional  integration process but has made important steps in this  direction through the Caribbean Common Market. Therefore, he  said, the experience gathered at the Latin American Integration  Association will be important in the future.</p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Letter: Continued growth of the socially aware banks Sir, You reported ('Swiss bank capitalises on green sentiments', January 7) that the Zurcher Kantonal Bank, a more traditional Swiss Bank, has decided to follow the Alternative Bank Schweiz by offering an account to customers which pays less interest than usual current accounts. The lower rate would allow the bank to reduce the rate charged to environmentally friendly business customers. The establishment of new socially aware banks and finance organisations has been growing in the last 30 years. More than 30 of them, including five UK finance companies and the Alternative Bank Schweiz, have, since 1989, become members of the International Association of Investors in the Social Economy. The financing techniques for socially and environmentally friendly development which they all use are at the forefront of capital strategies for a sustainable economy. Capital funds, for example, for wind farms, organic farming and co-operative ownership have all been copied some years later by traditional banks. It is important to recognise at a time of big is beautiful in the banking world that room should be left to establish new and small social economy banks which combine innovative banking operations within appropriate standards of banking practice.

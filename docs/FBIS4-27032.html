			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Deputy Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, on a visit in Moscow, said  today that China respects the choice of other nations and hopes  to develop friendly relations with all countries.    Qian was answering questions from reporters on China's  policies towards Central Asian states.    Qian recalled that China had maintained friendly relations  with the Central Asian region.    "As China and Central Asian states have increased contacts,  we hope to develop such friendly relations and expect Central  Asian states to expand their friendly ties and cooperation with  other nations, including Russia," Qian said.    When asked about China's comment on Russia's effort to join  the "Partnership for Peace" program, Qian said, "as a European  nation and a big country, Russia has certainly maintained many  links with the rest of Europe."    "Russia's establishment of a cooperative partnership with  NATO is understandable, but it should be different from joining  any military bloc in the past," he said.    "We hope it will help maintain peace and stability in Europe  and the rest of the world and will not obstruct the development  of good- neighborly relations between Russia and China," the  foreign minister noted.    Russia signed a Partnership for Peace accord with NATO last  Wednesday [22 June] to become the 21st country that joined the  U.S.-initiated military cooperation plan.    On China's position about nuclear tests, Qian reaffirmed  China stands for the total and thorough destruction of nuclear  weapons.    China has unilaterally announced it will not be the first to  use nuclear weapons, will not threaten non-nuclear nations with  force and will not use nuclear weapons against them, he  explained.    China has been very much restrained on the issue of nuclear  tests, he said.    As a nuclear power, the United States has conducted more  than  900 nuclear tests; the former Soviet Union, including Russia,  has done more than 600 such tests; France, more than 200; and  Britain, more than 60.    In comparison, China has had the smallest number of nuclear  tests among the nuclear countries, Qian added.    Qian arrived in Moscow Monday evening for a three-day  official visit. He will also visit Belarus, Lithuania, Estonia  and Finland.</p>

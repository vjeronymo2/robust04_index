Regions inhabited by minority nationalities have specific  characteristics, therefore, stability in these regions is very  important. Many minority nationality deputies said: Since the  founding of the PRC, the central government has expended great  energy on regions inhabited by minority nationalities; adopted  special policies for them; and supported them by apportioning a  large amount of funds to enable them to achieve considerable  development and progress. In particular, these regions have  enjoyed their most prosperous period in history in the past 15  years since China implemented reform and opened its doors to the  outside world.    As I come from a region inhabited by minority nationalities,  I have some experience in this connection. In 1958, Premier  Zhou Enlai personally presided over a meeting to solicit  opinions from all fields of endeavor; decided on the basic  principle of freedom for religious beliefs and of mutual respect  and equality between religions of different nationalities; and  abolished the feudal system on [words indistinct] of the founder  of a religion and Tibet's serfdom, thereby winning the support  of all nationalities and religious circles. The party's  policies on nationalities and religion were undermined by  Leftist influence during the Cultural Revolution. They have  been carried out to the letter again since the Third Plenary  Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. However, when I was  conducting news coverage in some localities of regions inhabited  by minority nationalities, I felt that Rightist deviation had  reappeared in some localities in their implementation of the  party's policies on nationalities and religion over the past two  years. This rendered religious activities out of control and  even resulted in religious forces being placed above the law and  government administration. Religious activities in some  localities have violated the law and become criminal activities,  causing serious damage to social stability and to the lives and  properties of local people. Some deputies said: Freedom of  religious beliefs does not mean there is no rule by law or  government administration. In particular, the feudal system of  the founder of a religion which was abolished must absolutely  not be restored. Regarding criminal activities touched off by  religion, they must be punished according to the law. Likewise,  there is no exception to the above in advanced Western  countries. It seems that it is still necessary for cadres in  regions inhabited by minority nationalities to continuously  study in earnest how to truly do a good job of implementing the  party's policies on nationalities and religion.</p>

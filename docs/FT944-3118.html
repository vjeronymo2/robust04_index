			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / New government for Ireland Ireland is expected to have a new government today, with Fine Gael set to agree a coalition with Labour and the small Democratic Left party. Mr John Bruton, leader of the conservative Fine Gael party, would become prime minister with Labour leader Mr Dick Spring foreign minister and deputy premier. The three parties have been in negotiations since talks broke down last week between Fianna Fail and Labour, the coalition partners in the outgoing administration, over a judicial appointments row. A joint programme for government was due to be published by the parties last night and will be put to the respective parliamentary parties for approval. Mr Proinsias de Rossa, leader of the Democratic Left, said the coalition negotiations were 'making steady progress'. The three party leaders were due to resume talks on a share-out of the 15 cabinet seats last night. Observers expect a deal could be ready to be voted on in parliament today. Outgoing finance minister Mr Bertie Ahern told reporters on Tuesday night that the new government would inherit the best set of accounts any government had enjoyed for more than 25 years.

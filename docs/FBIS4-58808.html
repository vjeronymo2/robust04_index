			<p>BFN     [Text] Major General Matan Vilna'i, commander of the  Southern Command, has said there is as yet no timetable for the  withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. The area will be handed over to  the Palestinians only after three conditions are met: the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] fully completes its deployment to  protect the Jewish settlements, a liaison mechanism is set up,  and the Palestinians are ready to enter the area.    Gen. Vilna'i said that according to plans, Palestinian  policemen will enter the Gaza Strip within the next few days and  that the IDF will hand over to them some 30 facilities formerly  used by the IDF, the Prison Authority, and the Israel Police.  He added that there will be no overlap in responsibility for  the area, and that responsibility will be transferred in its  entirety at a specific time. The transfer of powers will not be  accompanied by joint Israeli-Palestinian ceremonies to prevent  tempers from flaring, he noted.    Maj. Gen. 'Uzi Dayan, head of the General Staff's Planning  Branch and a participant in the Cairo talks, said that all the  points important to Israel had been safeguarded in the security  segment of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Our correspondent  Karmela Menashe reports that the two generals were speaking at a  news conference in Tel Aviv.</p>

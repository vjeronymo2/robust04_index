			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Survey of Italian Banking and Finance (1): Waiting for a puff of white smoke - The authorities prefer that evolution of the sector be left to the market, but many bankers would welcome a philosophical vision of the future Three weeks ago, shortly after being named a cardinal, the archbishop of Ravenna chose to comment on the strictly secular topic of takeovers in the Italian banking sector. Italian newspapers reported that Cardinal Ersilio Tonini and his counterpart in nearby Bologna had come out in support of the local bank, Credito Romagnolo, which was preparing to fight off a hostile bid from Milan-based Credito Italiano. The archiepiscopal intervention prompted some indignant muttering on the part of Credito Italiano's advisers, but it should have surprised nobody. Indeed, it probably helps explain why it has so far taken more than mere legislative reform to restructure the country's overcrowded banking sector. For one thing, the event illustrated how deep the regional roots of some of Italy's 1,037 credit institutions go, and how difficult it could be to untangle them. For another, it drew attention to the atmosphere of papal intrigue in which the Italian banking shake-up is being carried out. Technically, the Bank of Italy - responsible for banking supervision - has limited legal power to impede bids and mergers in the banking sector, except in certain circumstances, such as failure to observe competition rules, or an increased risk of insolvency. Indeed, as Mr Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, the central bank's deputy director-general, told a conference last week: 'It is not up to the supervisory authority to choose the best operation, nor to carry out a particular plan or direct the outcome on the market.' Mr Lamberto Dini, Italy's treasury minister and former director-general at the central bank, has also publicly stated that the treasury will leave the outcome of the banking shake-up to the market. But many senior Italian bankers believe that the central bank must have a philosophy and a vision of the future of the Italian banking sector, and should be exercising 'moral suasion' - or, as one banker puts it, 'nods and winks, like the Bank of England' - to ensure that the myriad institutions under its control move towards that vision. Meanwhile, within the private sector, Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank which has built a network of unparalleled influence over Italy's largest financial and industrial companies, is said to be pulling strings to realise its own vision of Italian banking. Most outside observers believe that both the Credito Italiano approach to Credito Romagnolo, and the almost simultaneous move on Banco Ambrosiano Veneto by Banca Commerciale Italiana, were inspired by Mediobanca. The bank itself, as always, has not commented. The idea that anyone should covertly tamper with the free market is anathema to many in the new generation of Italian investment bankers, weaned on Anglo-Saxon attitudes to banking and market supervision. But the evolution of the Italian financial sector has produced a unique creature, which may require special treatment. The list of more than 1,000 Italian banks is the heritage of decades of restrictive rules, which protected financial institutions from competition by banks from outside their designated territory or sector of activity. With the 1990 Amato Law - named after the Socialist treasury minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, later prime minister - the Italian government put the final element of banking reform in place, giving public banks the chance to change their identity from foundations, trusts and associations into joint stock corporations, and float off part of their banking operations. Reform was also supposed to set off a spate of mergers and takeovers in the sector. Italy's second biggest savings bank, Cassa di Risparmio di Roma, quickly bought 65 per cent of Banco di Roma, in October 1990, to form Banca di Roma. Other casse di risparmio allied with Cariplo, the Milan-based bank which claims to be the world's largest savings bank. But compared with expectations at the time, there have been few attempts to consolidate, and even the largest Italian banks remain small by US, Japanese or British standards. However, within the past 12 months, the sale by IRI, the state holding company, of the rest of its shares in Credito Italiano and Banca Commerciale Italiana has triggered off what could be a second wave of bids and mergers. Italian banks are comparatively well-capitalised. But this only adds to the concern that fear of being overtaken in the national league of big banks will fuel indiscriminate bingeing by nervous financial institutions. The result would be to exchange a range of medium-sized, comparatively lean banks for an uninspiring collection of flabby giants. 'I don't believe the Italian banking system can afford to concentrate just on size,' says Professor Mario Sarcinelli, chairman of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, 54 per cent of which is still owned by the treasury. 'The problem of the Italian banking system is profitability and efficiency, it's not size, or just size.' The past two years have exposed this weakness. In 1993, for example, banks' net profits were hit by heavy provisions and tax charges, in spite of an overall 28 per cent increase in operating profit at the largest Italian banks which account for most of Italian banking turnover. Half-year results for this year suggest that the situation will be worse in 1994. Banks' loan portfolios are still in the shadow of recession, even as industrial companies emerge into a more prosperous period; and the increase in interest rates has hit revenue from securities trading, which was particularly strong in 1993. Productivity is improving, according to the Italian banking association (ABI), and staff numbers are dropping, but there is still a long way to go, and the banks are hampered by rigid labour rules, fiercely defended by trade unions, which have staged a series of one-day strikes. Negotiations between management and unions were completed earlier this month, with workers offering some concessions on longer opening hours, and there are indications that a jobs-for-life mentality is beginning to disappear. But, as one senior Italian bank executive points out: 'The average employee takes it for granted that we have a situation in which there can be no firing or labour-shedding in the Italian banking system. This is clearly wrong.' The reform of the system has helped Italy to increase the number of branches across the country from only 6,000 in 1990 to 22,100, leading to concerns that the network may now be saturated. Now the problem, according to ABI, is that, whereas there is a surplus of branches in some areas (for example, Tuscany, dominated by the ancient Siena-based bank, Monte dei Paschi), in other areas, particularly the poorer south of the country, there is a lack. 'The main towns are certainly overbranched,' warns Mr Luigi Coccioli, ABI deputy chairman and chairman of Banco di Napoli, one of the south's biggest banks. In that respect, the consolidation of northern banks is a worrying development, because it could deprive southern customers of the efficient, stable and customer-friendly banking system which should emerge in the more competitive north, increasing the attraction of usury - which is still widespread in Italy - and other dubious financial services. Hence the attempts of the Bank of Italy and treasury to encourage further modernisation of the system, and, in particular, the increased 'privatisation' of the banking branches controlled by the many charitable foundations across Italy. 'The high proportion of banking activity which, from an ownership point of view, is still in public-sector hands shows that the likely route to privatisation for the banks is still long, and the foundations will be the ones to complete it,' Mr Padoa Schioppa said last week. Clearly, observers will have to wait a while before a puff of white smoke from the Bank of Italy indicates that the new Italian banking sector has been fully installed.</p>

The president mentioned Brazil's  more competitive situation in the international market,  especially its presence in the regional economy:    [Begin recording] Mercosur [Common Market of the South] is a  clear example of success. Exchange among its members increased  from $3.5 billion in 1990 to $8 billion in 1993. Associations  among enterprises and institutions in the four countries are  increasing, and large transnational companies are making  investments in the subregion with an eye on the free trade zone  that will soon take total effect. We will continue prioritizing  Mercosur, whose consolidation we are seeking. For this purpose  we will continue to pursue the objectives of uniform customs in  the terms and conditions agreed upon in Colonia [Uruguay]. [end  recording]    The president also stressed the importance of environmental  matters and he called the attention of the developed countries  to their responsibility in this field:    [Begin recording] Brazil, with its enormous environmental  patrimony, has a share of responsibility in the environmental  issue as well as in the promotion of sustained development. The  developed countries should assume their responsibilities,  especially those related to the transfer of financial resources  and healthy technologies to developing countries. [end recording]    President Itamar Franco told the newly graduated diplomats  that the quest for peace and international cooperation for  economic and social development must be at the top of the  international affairs' agenda.</p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Debt burden slows recovery drive - John Thornhill considers Isosceles' problems as Gateway chief leaves MR BOB Willett's departure yesterday as chief executive of the Gateway grocery chain again brings into sharp focus the severe problems besetting the UK's biggest leveraged buy-out and raises renewed doubts about whether it will ever be able to succeed in floating the business. When the Isosceles investment vehicle won its bitterly-contested Pounds 2.1bn takeover battle for Gateway in 1989 it held out the prospect of slimming the business, disposing of its peripheral assets and returning the grocery chain to the market within three to five years, realising generous returns for its backers in the process. The practice has proved infinitely more treacherous than the theory. Delays in disposing of assets, the severe and lingering recession, and the intensification of trading pressures as a result of competitors opening new stores have combined to throw the scenario askew. Three years on, Isosceles finds itself saddled with Pounds 1.2bn of debt and little prospect of being able to reduce that, even if it could finally succeed in disposing of Herman's, the US sporting goods subsidiary. City analysts suggest Isosceles is now caught on the horns of an acute financial dilemma. The company is under immense short-term pressure to pay the interest on its debt, but can only survive in the long term if it invests in upgrading its core stores and developing its new Somerfield format. Mr Willett was a vigorous advocate of developing the business but his ambitions were kept severely in check by the demands of the bankers. He considered an annual capital expenditure budget of Pounds 100m was insufficient to convert enough Somerfield stores to give the chain critical mass. Mr Bill Myers, food retailing analyst at stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite, said: 'Somerfield is the core of a good idea. It has been very well-received by the public and seems to be trading very well.' To date, however, Isosceles has only opened 60 Somerfield stores and still has more than 600 Gateway stores which are continuing to face severe competition. The trading performance of Gateway's mainstream stores is believed to be well below budget and was one of the contributory factors in Mr Willett's departure. Analysts suggest that Isosceles's remaining businesses can only have a current market value of about Pounds 600m. 'There is a glaring great hole in the company's valuation and I am sure that the banks must know that. It is a grisly scenario,' said one. It is clearly in the interests of the buy-out's backers to continue to support the company until some kind of exit route can be found. No bank is likely to want the embarrassment of crystallising its loss, least of all Wasserstein Perella, the New York investment boutique which owns 40 per cent of Isosceles' equity. It seems improbable that any company would want to buy the entire Gateway business. The only likely contender, Tengelmann of Germany, has its gaze fixed firmly on eastern Europe. Yet Isosceles may still be able to dispose of parcels of its stores to other retailers and attempt to float a far smaller business at some point down the line. Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes, who takes over the operational reins, certainly faces a formidable task in trying to restore morale at the company's Bristol headquarters, re-invigorate the trading performance of the core business and squeeze enough cash from its operations to keep the bankers sweet.</p>

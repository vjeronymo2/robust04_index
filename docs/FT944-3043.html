			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / IBM sells 'surplus' plant to managers International Business Machines has sold its manufacturing plant at Havant, Hampshire, to its management in a deal worth about Pounds 50m. The management group has formed a company, Xyratex, which has been running the plant since the beginning of the month. It will continue to produce disk drives, flexible circuits and networking equipment for IBM. Last year IBM said the plant - one of the company's best-known European facilities, which manufactures disk drives for personal and medium-range computers - was one of three in Europe that was 'surplus to requirements' because of industrial restructuring. Two months ago it became known that IBM was planning to sell the plant and that several manufacturing groups had invited to bid. The management buy-out was led by Mr Ken Wilkie, former managing director, and some 30 managers. Finance is being provided by Murray Johnstone, the venture capital company. Senior debt has been provided by Midland Bank. The plant employs more than 2,000 people and will have revenues of about Pounds 300m a year. It has recently signed contracts to make about 1m units a year of an innovative drive design for JTS, a Californian company, and about 100,000 units a year for Nomai, a French removable drive company. It will continue to develop recently launched lines of business in removable data storage, test systems, network consultancy and applications software. For example, it manufactures engine management systems for Aston Martin sports cars and printing systems for music shops. IBM has been cutting manufacturing capacity as it comes to terms with an industry that has shifted to personal computers and networked systems rather from mainframe computers. Analysts question whether there is a future for disk drive manufacturing in Europe when most electronics companies are transferring production to Asia and the Pacific Rim. A contract awarded to Havant by Western Digital of the US for 2m drives annually was cancelled earlier this year as a consequence of changes in manufacturing strategy. Mr Wilkie said yesterday he was confident that Havant's engineering expertise and manufacturing prowess were a sufficient counter to Asia's lower manufacturing costs. Computer makers, he said, were increasingly looking for European sources of key components.</p>

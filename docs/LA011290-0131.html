			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Geffen Balks at Sale: David Geffen disavowed a published report that he was  "entertaining" bids as high as $800 million from Paramount Communications and  other potential buyers for his Geffen Records music label.  </P> <P> "Many people have tried to get me to sell, and I've not said yes," Geffen said.  He added: "I don't know that I will now or in the future. Nobody has made me an  offer I couldn't refuse." A Paramount spokesman declined to comment on the  report. Geffen distributes its records through Time Warner Inc. under a deal  that is set to expire in the next year.  </P></p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / EC given food for thought over allocating plum jobs: National quotas or merit? David Gardner looks at how posts in Brussels are filled THE EUROPEAN Court has just blown the gaff on the common practice at the European Commission of recruiting into its top echelons by national quotas, rather than on merit, as EC rules formally require. The landmark ruling has been widely interpreted as a political blow to the Commission, but it has got some senior Brussels officials rubbing their hands with glee. Far from damaging the Commission, the judgment has provided it with a weapon to resist member states that insist on slotting candidates they choose into plum Brussels jobs whether or not they are suitable. The Luxembourg court has overruled appointment of an Italian and a Spaniard to senior posts in the fisheries directorate of the Commission, finding that they had been named to nail down slots previously held by compatriots. Two applicants with better credentials brought the complaint, and the Court found the appointments were made before the selection process had concluded. The only shock in this was the sloppiness of the senior Spaniards and Italians in the Commission, and of Madrid and Rome, who had left lots of fingerprints of their premature decision-making. Lobbying for senior Commission posts is the norm. There is no formal national quota system as in other international organisations such as the UN. Indeed, the EC rules state that 'no posts shall be reserved for nationals of any specific member state'. But the rules also require all EC institutions to recruit 'on the broadest possible geographical basis' to maintain a more or less even share-out between the 12. These rules are 'mutually contradictory,' says a senior official who deals with personnel policy. 'We do our best to navigate between them,' welcoming the Court's decision as 'a useful judgment' to help the Commission do so. But another official who has served in several top political jobs in the Commission is more caustic. 'We appoint the wrong people, to the wrong jobs, for the wrong reasons.' Political appointments are accepted and above board in the cabinets of the Commissioners, and at the two highest levels of the A-grade policy-making staff of the Commission. It is also acknowledged practice, though not licit under the rules, that control of the 23 Brussels directorates-general is partly shared out on an informal 'national flag' basis. France has had a lockhold on the agriculture directorate since the Common Agricultural Policy was set up 30 years ago; financial services and transport have been British stamping grounds; and Germany has had a long succession of director generals for competition policy. In apportioning the rest of the DGs, a lot of log-rolling goes on to give member states roughly the right number and influence, in proportion to their size. Thus it was known in February 1991 that a Spaniard would take over the social policy directorate in October 1992 because Spain was one down on its quota, having made way for the UK at the transport DG. Belgium, by contrast, was temporarily one up on its quota; the key to the reshuffle was that there was a Belgian director general at social affairs who was due to retire. But this sort of musical chairs has spread further down Commission ranks, spreading demoralisation along the way. One reason, made plain in a Commission working document on recruitment of last November, is that 'geographical imbalances among applicants are persisting or getting worse'. The Commission chooses from a far smaller pool than national bureaucracies, and in the past five years there has been a sharp rise in applicants from Belgium and Italy and a steep fall in British and German candidates. Among the large member states, the UK has always been under-represented: whereas France, Italy and Germany all have more than 600 A-grade functionaries, Britain has fewer than 500. As a latecomer this is partly understandable, and it is also to be expected that a certain amount of manoeuvring goes on to try to redress this and other imbalances - particularly given what one official calls the 'clientilist' practices of such member states as Greece and Italy. The underlying problem is a hopeless imbalance in supply. Of the 93,691 applicants for the 3,459 A-grade posts advertised by competition in 1986-91, the Commission report shows, the UK fielded only 4,983, Denmark only 1,574, against 24,734 from host country Belgium, 18,529 from Italy and 10,333 from France. The semi-detached Danes and British, though least interested in applying, have the best pass rates (5.8 and 3.7 per cent respectively, against, say, 2.8 and 1.6 per cent of successful applicants from Belgium and Italy). Nevertheless, by sheer weight of numbers, Belgium and Italy get between three and six times more people into the top of the Commission than Britain and Denmark. Part of the reason is that Brussels goes after too many specialists, who face exams that a French-style elite school provides better preparation for than more generalist training common in such countries as the UK. Officials say a more rounded approach is now being discussed: to recruit more generalists; give them a broader grounding by passing them through several departments before allocating fixed jobs; and relying more on temporary secondment from national administrations. This last is partly to circumvent tight restrictions on hiring. The Commission is kept small, in relative terms, numbering 14,533 officials at the end of last year, or about the size of the UK agriculture ministry. The EC countries average 322 civil servants per 10,000 inhabitants, against only 0.8 per 10,000 for all EC institutions together. Widening the recruitment pool, plus the precedent set by the Court, should help the Commission to resist nationalist lobbying, but officials warn that pressures for a carve-up will remain. 'Yes, it will help to resist these pressures,' says one senior official. 'But to go from there to saying we're going to be recruiting entirely on merit is unrealistic.'</p>

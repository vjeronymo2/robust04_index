			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Fujitsu revises forecast down FUJITSU, the Japanese computer and telecommunications group which controls the UK-based ICL, revised its forecast downwards for consolidated results in year to March. The company, which had hoped to break even at the net level, now expects to report a consolidated net loss. Fujitsu said that due to the delayed recovery of the Japanese economy, the rapid appreciation of the yen and the depressed state of the US mainframe market, it was revising its pre-tax forecast down from Y50bn (Dollars 31m) to Y35bn. Sales are now forecast to reach Y3,150bn rather than Y3,280bn as forecast in May. The company also expects to report a net loss of Y39bn rather than break-even. Fujitsu reported a consolidated pre-tax loss of Y24bn on sales of Y1,451 for the first half. It managed, nevertheless to report a consolidated net profit of Y44bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Referring to the economic  talks with the Palestinians in Paris, Finance Minister Avraham  Shohat said they have run into real difficulties owing to the  fact that the PLO delegates presented new positions which are  incompatible with the understandings reached in the previous  rounds of negotiations. In his meeting with Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad  Quray'] tomorrow, Shohat said, he will seek to clarify whether  the PLO officially changed its positions.    Minister Shohat believes a change of policy may be needed,  and instead of open economies, a decision will be made to close  the economies of Israel and the autonomy to each other.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Constantine today, Salim Saadi, minister of  interior and local authorities, presided over the proceedings of  a regional meeting which brought together, alongside the  ministerial delegation, 15 governors of eastern Algeria and a  number of local officials representing various social and  professional sectors. During this meeting, which was held in the  Mohamed Laid al-Khalifa Cultural Center, the interior minister  delivered an address devoted to security issues and the means  and facilities the state has made available and continues to  provide in order to eliminate the phenomenon of armed violence  aimed at the citizens, security men, and state institutions.  Abdelwahab Zeid, from the Constantine radio station, gives us  the most important points of the interior minister's address:    [Zeid] Mr. Saadi stressed the fresh measures taken at all  levels and designed to ensure that we stand as one, facing up  with determination and firmness to all maneuvers aimed at  Algeria, its people, and its government. He underlined the need  for citizens to mobilize, each in his own position, to defend  the gains of the liberation revolution [of 1954] and the state  institutions which belong to the people, and the future of its  sons and coming generations.    [Begin Saadi recording] From the experiences of the last  year or two in fighting this disaster we have drawn lessons on  the need to review the fight against this phenomenon, either by  way of renewing our methods of fighting or changing our ways of  using these methods. Such a review makes us aware that we will  be entering a new era of mobilizing more material and human  resources and improving the methods of our fight to make them  more effective. We have started this process, and you are going  to see it on the ground in the future. However, the problems of  security and the fight against terrorism should not remain  solely the task of the security men. The security men are now  in the service of the people, and the people should therefore  increase their participation in helping the security men.    We know that there are conditions that must be available,  for  example, (?legal) conditions. We are going to make these  conditions available, because we are going to ensure the  presence of the minimum necessary force in every municipality,  everywhere, to secure a general cover [applause interrupting].    Let us now speak about another subject, through which we are  going to give our reply to those in charge of public  enterprises. We have taken measures to ensure that these  enterprises, which belong to the people, are protected by their  own workers. This means people will be appointed to assume this  task. If we are sometimes unable to find people with the  necessary qualities from within the enterprises, then people  will be recruited from outside the enterprise to provide the  necessary protection for the enterprise and its assets. But we  cannot leave these enterprises open to sabotage. [end recording]</p>

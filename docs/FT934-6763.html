			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Ruling on Paramount takeover deferred A Delaware judge yesterday delayed until at least Wednesday an important court ruling in the Dollars 10bn takeover battle for entertainment group Paramount Communications. Judge Jack Jacobs, of the Delaware chancery court, told companies involved in the case that he needed more time to consider last-minute information, including some provided by Paramount directors. The case involves a challenge by QVC Network, the television shopping company headed by Mr Barry Diller, to the terms of a Dollars 9.4bn friendly merger agreement between Paramount and cable television group Viacom. QVC has made a hostile Dollars 10.7bn offer for Paramount, and has asked the court to lift poison pill provisions of the merger deal which would require it, in the event of a successful takeover, to pay Viacom some Dollars 600m. Viacom's tender offer for 51 per cent of Paramount's shares had been due to expire at midnight last night, with QVC's offer closing on Friday night. Viacom's offer has now been extended to midnight on November 24, and QVC's to December 1. Yesterday's action preserved, at least for now, the time advantage enjoyed by Viacom's tender offer, though this could change if the judge were to find in QVC's favour. Fund American Enterprises Holdings is in preliminary talks on the purchase of part or all of Xerox's Talegen Holdings insurance unit, Reuters reports from Chicago. Talegen, formerly Crum and Forster, is a property-casualty insurer. 'The talks are in the early stages,' said Fund American.</p>

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Goldman faces Maxwell action TRUSTEES of two pension schemes formerly controlled by Robert Maxwell are considering filing legal claims against Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, for up to Pounds 56m in connection with transactions it handled on behalf of the schemes, the Commons social security committee was told yesterday. The funds are the proceeds of 25,000 shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation purchased from the Mirror Group Newspapers scheme and the Maxwell Communication Corporation works scheme by Goldman Sachs on the instructions of Mr Kevin Maxwell on May 29 1991. The shares were later re-purchased from Goldman by two Liechtenstein-based trusts controlled by Maxwell family interests. Goldman Sachs has said it was acting on Mr Kevin Maxwell's instructions when it paid the proceeds not to the pension schemes but to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, which Mr Kevin Maxwell described as a nominee company for the pension-fund manager. Separately, Mr Brian Tatch, chairman of the board of trustees to the MCC works scheme, told the committee that he had met early yesterday with the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, regarding possible help in compelling Goldman Sachs to return the assets. Mr Tatch said SIB informed the trustees that it is unlikely to have any jurisdiction since the transaction appeared to have been booked in New York. Mr Shaw has asked if the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US watchdog, is investigating the transactions. The pension funds have argued that Mr Kevin Maxwell did not have legal authority to order specific transactions on behalf of the schemes, and that Goldman Sachs should have taken more care to determine whether his instructions were proper. Goldman Sachs said yesterday: 'Detailed information about the trades has been provided to all regulatory authorities which have asked about them. We would expect to do the same if any additional inquiries are made. We believe we acted properly in connection with these transactions.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by station editor Huang Keren: "From Which </F> Direction Does the Threat to Taiwan Come?"; from the "News and  Current Events" program]    [Text] Not long ago, the state security organ cracked a  case of spy sent by Taiwan's Kuomintang [KMT]. Liu Hui, who was  sent by Taiwan's KMT military intelligence bureau to sneak into  the mainland to conduct espionage activities, was arrested  according to law. This was another indication of the persistent  hostility cherished by the Taiwan authorities.    A very large problem exists in the development of  cross-strait relations: namely, the persistent hostility on the  part of the Taiwan authorities toward the mainland. The Taiwan  authorities treat the mainland as a powerful foe posing a threat  to the security of Taiwan. On 27 September last year, the  Taiwan authorities held an army-navy-air force joint military  exercise, comprised mainly of landing, anti-landing, airborne,  and anti-airborne operations, in Penghu [Pescadores] area,  targeting the mainland as the imaginary enemy. This was a  military exercise of a comparatively large scale in recent  years. In February this year, Taiwan's marines conducted a  military exercise code-named (?Lien-ching 68), comprised mainly  of offensive surprise landing operations from the sea, in waters  off the coast of southwestern Taiwan. Meanwhile, the motorized  units of Taiwan's army will conduct north-south joint war games  soon. All of these military exercises are directed against the  mainland. The scale of these exercises was rarely seen in those  conducted in previous years. In addition, the Taiwan  authorities' national policy center sponsored a seminar on the  management of national defense to specially study the issue of  Taiwan's security, treating the mainland as the main foe that  poses a threat to Taiwan's security. Such practices on the part  of the Taiwan authorities not only cause cross-strait relations  deteriorate and spoil the peaceful and propitious atmosphere  across the Taiwan Strait, but will make our own people sad and  the enemy glad.    For a considerably long period of time to come, the mainland  will dedicate its efforts to reform, opening up, and economic  construction, and will strive for fulfillment of the grand  objectives of promoting economic development and building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. Therefore, it needs an  international and domestic environment of long-term stability to  achieve this end. It is entirely groundless to say that the  mainland poses a threat to Taiwan's security. Just the  opposite, the mainland has taken a number of initiatives, such  as dissolving the Fuzhou Military Region, reducing the number of  army units stationed in Fujian Province, and making some ports,  wharves, and military installations available for civilian use,  to resolve the cross-strait hostility and to bring about a  change in the situation of confrontation, thereby making  important contributions to the improvement and development of  cross-strait relations.    The threat to Taiwan's security does not come from the  mainland. Instead, it comes from the Taiwan independence  movement that has been bent on disrupting Taiwan's stability and  has been trying hard to split the motherland. The mainland has  played an important role in checking the Taiwan independence  movement. It is an important force that maintains Taiwan's  stability and protects Taiwan's security.</p>

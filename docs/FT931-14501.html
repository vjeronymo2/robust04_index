			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Cross Border M&amp;A Deals MUCH OF last week's international corporate activity involved strategic acquisitions of businesses or stakes in them, writes Brian Bollen. Wolters Kluwer, the Dutch publisher, made its first purchase in Scandinavia, buying Liber of Sweden, giving it a springboard for further purchases in the region. Hanson's proposed swap of its US gold mining operations for the coal business of Santa Fe Pacific will reinforce its position as the world's second biggest private sector coal producer, if it goes ahead. News that Tabacalera, Spain's state-controlled tobacco company, is negotiating the sale of its Royal Brands food business to RJR Nabisco, prompted United Biscuits to declare its interest in the company's biscuit brands. Miller Brewing of the US bought a 20 per cent stake in Molson Breweries of Canada as part of a wider international alliance with Molson and Foster's Brewing of Australia. Polygram, the Netherlands-owned music and entertainment company, expanded its interests in Japan by increasing its stakes in Nippon Phonogram and Polydor KK. In telecommunications, Swiss PTT Telecom joined Uniforce, the joint venture between PTT Telecom of the Netherlands and Sweden's Televerket, which provides data transmission services to European-based multinational companies. Sweden's Spectra-Physics agreed to sell one of its US subsidiaries to Massachusetts-based Thermo Instrument Systems to help reduce group borrowings and focus on core business. Campbell Soup of the US said its increased offer for Arnotts, the Australian biscuit maker, was final.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         CROSS BORDER M&amp;A DEALS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BIDDER/INVESTOR     TARGET       SECTOR      VALUE         COMMENT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Campbell Soup (US)  Arnotts      Food        Pounds 381m   Increased                     (Australia)                            offer  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hanson (UK)/        Asset swap   Mining      est           Coal for gold Santa Fe Pacific                             Pounds 324m   proposal (US)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- British Aerospace   Joint        Aircraft    Pounds 240m   Deal nearing (UK)/Taiwan         venture      manufacture               finalisation Aerospace (Taiwan)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Miller Brewing (US) Molson       Brewing     Pounds 177m   Taking 20%                     Breweries                              stake                     (Canada)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RJR Nabisco (US)    Royal Brands Food        Pounds 95m    RJR offer for                     (Spain)                                half  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Thermo Instrument   Unit of      Lab         Pounds 45m    Non-core Systems (US)        Spectra      instruments               disposal                     Physics                     (Sweden)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hanwha Group        Bank of      Banking     Pounds 22m    Privatisation (Korea)             Athens                                 sale                     (Greece)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Polygram            Nippon       Music       Pounds 15m    Consolidating (Netherlands)       Phonogram                              Japanese                     (Japan)                                business                     Polydor KK                     (japan)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Renault (France)    Karosa       Bus         Pounds 5.4m   34% stake                     (Czech)      manufacture               planned  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Wolters Kluwer      Liber        Publishing  n/a           Scandinavian (Netherlands)       (Sweden)                               springboard  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

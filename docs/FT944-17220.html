			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Industry may be forced to fund recycling of packaging Consumer goods manufacturers and big retailers could face a levy to fund the recovery and recycling of waste packaging, as the government considers introducing legislation on the issue in the next session of parliament. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, has decided after consulting with packaging companies, retailers and manufacturers that plans for a voluntary system to recover value from about 58 per cent of domestic packaging waste by the year 2000 need to be underpinned by legislation. It is thought that plans for legislation may be included in the Queen's Speech next month, but this is likely to depend on whether other bills, such as Post Office privatisation, go ahead. Mr Gummer has indicated that he favours making one section of the packaging chain - so-called brand owners, or consumer goods manufacturers and retailers selling own-label goods - responsible for en-suring recovery targets are met. In July last year the environment secretary called on industry and retailers to devise a voluntary system to increase the volume of packaging waste recovered to between 50 per cent and 75 per cent, in line with EU targets. In response, 28 companies formed the Producer Responsibility Group, which in February unveiled plans for an industry organisation, called Valpak, to recover 58 per cent of packaging waste annually by 2000. The group appointed Sir Sydney Lipworth, former chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, to investigate ways of meeting the estimated Pounds 100m cost of the scheme. In July Sir Sidney proposed a complex levy paid by packaging manufacturers and users, but passed on to consumers - who would pay about 1p for every Pounds 10 of purchases. Packaging companies have been lobbying Mr Gummer against the scheme, claiming the bulk of the costs would ultimately be passed back to them, seriously damaging profitability. At the same time the group's members warned the environment secretary that they felt legislation was needed to ensure that the system worked properly. At a meeting with the group on September 28 Mr Gummer and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, accepted the need for legislation, but felt that the Lipworth levy was too complex to enforce. The Department of the Environment favours a simpler approach, targeting brand owners, which are seen as having the greatest influence on packaging used for their products. Brand owners would have to pay for their own recovery schemes or contribute to funding Valpak. The Producer Responsibility Group has appointed Mr Christopher Stewart-Smith, outgoing president of the British Chambers of Commerce, as chairman, to devise a structure for Valpak. It is due to present a report at the end of this month, and then disband, to be replaced by a wider body.</p>

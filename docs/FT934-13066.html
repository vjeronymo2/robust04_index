			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Fairness ruling sought on Scots property solicitors SIR BRYAN CARSBERG, director-general of fair trading, has referred the solicitors' property centre which handles 90 per cent of house sales in Aberdeen to the restrictive practices court, seeking a declaration that it operates a rule that works against the public interest. Sir Bryan is also considering taking action against the solicitors' property centre in Edinburgh, which handles 80 per cent of house sales in the city. He is concerned about a rule which forbids solicitors who are members of the Aberdeen centre from submitting particulars of homes if an estate agent is advertising them elsewhere. He says this restricts competition and consumer choice. In many Scottish towns people sell their houses through a solicitor rather than an estate agent. In Edinburgh, Aberdeen and elsewhere, solicitors have set up solicitors' property centres in a main street where all properties for sale are advertised. The complaint against the Aberdeen and Edinburgh centres was made by made by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. If the restrictive practices court makes a declaration that the restriction is against the public interest it will then decide whether to make an order prohibiting it. Mr George Clark, chairman of the Edinburgh Solicitors' Property Centre, said the centres were very much in the public interest and that without them Scot-land would be dominated by half-a-dozen estate agents. The 200 firms of soli-citors which own the Edinburgh centre are in active competition with each other.</p>

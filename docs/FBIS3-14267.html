He said his party does not wish to exploit the current  differences between the two parties to obtain seats of power in  the country.    In an interview with AL-AHRAM held at his residence in  Sanaa,  Shaykh al-Zanadani said that the YSP wants to internationalize  the Yemeni crisis and move it from the House of Representatives  to the international community. He clarified that the YAR, the  third member of the coalition in the government, wants to keep  the Yemeni issue in the hands of its sons. It does not want the  dispute to go outside Arab circles for a solution.    The Presidential Council member noted that his party insists  on telling the truth, a step that does not satisfy either of the  sides to the dispute. We demand that the people's will be  respected in accordance with the Pledge and Accord Document. We  call for presenting all our issues before the House of  Representatives to discuss them and pass the resolutions that  bind all sides.    On the conflict between the GPC and the YSP regarding how to  implement the document, in which the YSP is demanding that those  charged in the assassinations be arrested first, he said that  his party supports the GPC on the need to merge the state  institutions before arresting the defendants, especially since  the government is a coalition between three parties.    Responding to a question on the role the YAR could play in  arresting the suspects in the assassinations, he said we always  stand by the truth and do not accuse anyone. We demand a fair  trial and the elimination of political influences on decisions.  He affirmed that the road to power can only be through the  ballot box.    Regarding the various accusations that the YAR practices  terrorism, he said: I am one of those who experienced an  assassination attempt and acts of terrorism before the  parliamentary elections. However, the current conflict prompted  some sides, especially the YSP, to exploit the issue of  terrorism, in particular with some Arab countries that do not  know the facts behind the conflict in Yemen. The truth is that  there are political and tribal conflicts and that a state of  vengeance exists between the YSP in the south and a number of  citizens whose sons, brothers, and family members were killed.  Therefore, the problem of revenge will continue to be a time  bomb in Yemen if it is not wisely handled.    He noted that the YAR presented a proposal for resolving the  problem of vengeance in Yemen. The proposal includes signing an  agreement and issuing a decision on stopping Yemeni bloodshed  and then setting a date for a general pardon of past incidents.  All the chapters of vengeful acts before this date will be  closed and the national interests of Yemen will be promoted  henceforth.    All murders and acts of revenge that take place after that  date will fall under Islamic laws and punishments.    Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zanadani denied accusations that he  harbors terrorism and heads the military wing of the YAR. He  said that there were some youths who were very religious and  found out that some people in Aden were behaving in an  un-Islamic manner. They found out, for example, that there is an  alcoholic beverage plant in Aden and that the police killed  demonstrators in the al-Rahman mosque in Aden. As a result,  some of these youths adopted violence as a course. Moreover,  the YAR advised them to follow peaceful means to find out the  truth and handle the situation. Some of them heeded our call  and returned to the path of righteousness.    He said that Usamah Bin-Ladin [prominent Saudi businessman]  has a group who follow him and carry out some terrorist acts.  But some of them regained their senses and backed out of the  acts they were supposed to commit.    He clarified that the Islamic nation is torn between two  cultures. The first is the culture of decline, which has  distorted Islam. The second is the culture of colonialism,  which casts doubts over Islam. This is why we all have to work  on protecting the fierce onslaught against Islam.    The member of the Presidential Council affirmed the absence  of an armed wing in the YAR. He said the Yemeni people are  armed anyway. However, we do not call for reform through weapons  and killing, but through wisdom and sound advice.    On acts of terrorism in Egypt and accusations that he  supports them and harbors some of the Egyptian terrorist groups  in Yemen, Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zanadani said: I love Egypt  and lived there for quite some time. This is why I cannot carry  out terrorist acts against it. What harms our Egypt, harms us  also. We wish it all the best. We are ready to fully cooperate  with it to annihilate terrorism, which is hiding behind the veil  of the true Islamic religion.    He said that Yemen is too small to be a source for exporting  terrorism to fraternal Egypt.    Regarding the presence of a terrorist camp that he allegedly  patronizes in the region of Sa'dah in the north supervised by  Shaykh Muqbil, the Presidential Council member said that he does  not order people to carry weapons; he fights violence and  terrorism. We have recorded tapes of Shaykh Muqbil in which he  condemns terrorism. He added: I informed Ambassador 'Ata'  Harun, the ambassador from Egypt to Yemen, that we are ready to  welcome the visit by any Egyptian official to the headquarters  of Shaykh Muqbil in Sa'dah to learn about his school that  teaches the Koran and the true religion and whose students are  from various nationalities who wish to learn about Islam. It is  not a camp for exporting terrorism.    Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zanadani concluded his speech: We do  not approve the principle of change through force and the use of  violence and terrorism. At the same time, we cannot allow Yemen  to be a country from which Egypt is harmed.</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Momentum of recovery still in doubt: The strength of upturn from economic recession in the US FEW US forecasters envisage a repeat of last year, when a promising economic recovery unexpectedly ground to a halt late in the summer. That said, this week's report of a 17 per cent fall in housing starts in the single month of April is not the kind of statistic destined to bolster confidence in the economy's underlying momentum. The drop in starts was partly a reaction to strong advances in preceding months. But it was much more severe than expected, and by no means the only discouraging news. Consumer confidence and car sales are still depressed; claims for state unemployment insurance remain stubbornly high. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, is again embarrassed by sluggish monetary growth, a problem that has plagued it for two years. M2, the main measure of broad money, is only just above the lower limit of its 2.5-6.5 per cent growth target. The signs of continuing fragility are offset by positive indicators, such as last week's report of a solid rise in industrial production in April, the third consecutive monthly gain. Employment and retail sales have also risen substantially since the year began. Few economists are thus inclined to revise their forecasts, which mostly point to growth of about 3 per cent at an annual rate in the second half of the year. But the negative indicators are fuelling demands that the Fed buy a little extra insurance by nudging the federal funds rate (the cost of money in the interbank market) a quarter-point lower, to 3.5 per cent. A move in the next few weeks would exploit fully the scope for lower short-term rates created last December when the Fed cut the discount rate a full percentage point to 3.5 per cent. The discount rate is the rate at which the Fed lends to banks, but it is of largely symbolic significance because banks rarely borrow from the central bank. Analysts believe another small cut in the federal funds rate would be helpful because it would probably trigger a half-point cut in banks' prime lending rates to 6.0 per cent. This would reduce the cost of a range of consumer and business loans. Encouraging recent figures for inflation are seen as enhancing the Fed's room to manoeuvre. The core consumer price index (food and energy excluded) is still rising at an annual rate of nearly 4 per cent, but other measures, including the gross domestic product deflator and an index of employment costs, point to an underlying inflation rate of perhaps only 3 per cent. The counter-argument is that short-term rates are already at their lowest level for a generation. The Fed regards the failure of long bond yields to decline significantly below 8 per cent as the more important brake on economic growth. The risk in cutting short-term rates further, with the recovery already under way, is that expectations of inflation will rise, putting upward pressure on bond yields. The Fed's failure to move yesterday probably indicates that it believes further easing would be counter-productive in the absence of more conclusive evidence of economic weakness. In the short run, growth estimates are likely to be revised up. Last week's report of a sharp rebuilding of corporate inventories in March is expected to prompt an upward revision of GDP in the first quarter, to show growth at an annual rate of 3 per cent rather than 2 per cent. This would be by far the best performance since President George Bush took office early in 1989. Some bulls, such as Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities in New York, regard the first-quarter expansion as a launching pad for faster growth - perhaps 4-5 per cent at an annual rate later in the year. But others are more cautious. The fact that inventories have already rebounded, say economists at JP Morgan, the New York bank, undercuts a potential prop for growth in the second quarter. Trade figures released yesterday were a warning that higher imports may siphon off some of the stimulus from rising domestic demand. The trade deficit widened to Dollars 5.8bn in March from Dollars 3.3bn, largely because of a 4.5 per cent increase in imports. Residential housing was the one sector of the economy to stage a 'normal' recovery in the past year. Rapid growth of personal consumption spending - another strong motor in the first quarter - reflected special factors such as tax rebates and an unsustainable fall in personal saving. The consumer is likely to remain inhibited by historically high ratios of debt to income. The biggest difference between this year and last is the substantially lower level of short-term interest rates and a significant strengthening of corporate balance sheets. This greatly reduces the risk of a 'triple dip' into recession. But the Fed and other policy-makers would be unwise to take the health of this erratic recovery for granted.</p>

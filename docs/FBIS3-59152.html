			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Silvio Berlusconi has announced his candidacy on  air. He has just announced his entry into politics. He will  stand for Forza Italia at the forthcoming elections because, he  said, he no longer wants to live in a country governed by  immature forces, and desires to fight on the side of freedom as  an alternative to the left. Berlusconi sent a video recording  to public and private sector news bulletins. Here is the  passage concerning his candidacy:    [Begin Berlusconi recording] I have decided to enter the  fray  and to concern myself with public affairs because I do not want  to live in a country which is not liberal and is governed by  immature forces and by men tied twice over to past political and  economic failure. In order to live the new life I have chosen,  today I tendered my resignation from all company positions in  the group that I founded. I am therefore giving up my role as  editor and businessman to put my experience and all my efforts  at the disposal of a battle in which I believe with the utmost  conviction and with the utmost strength.

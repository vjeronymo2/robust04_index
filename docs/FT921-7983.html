			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Contracted Business Services (4): New laws mean new business - Impact of Legislation OVER THE next decade, contracted business services in the broadest sense are destined to grow, partly because of the raft of legislation on environmental and safety standards in Britain and the European Community. An early impetus for the growth of contracted services came in 1983 when compulsory competitive tendering was introduced in the national health service. The 1988 Local Government Act extended competitive tendering to many local government services. The government's current white paper, called 'Competing for Quality', envisages the compulsory extension of contracting out to other local authority services provided by lawyers, architects and other professionals. However, the legislation is making a tortuous path through parliament. But if and when a new local government act covering competitive tendering for professional services is enacted, this will further expand the scope of the contracted business services industry. Some idea of the size of the industry can be obtained by looking at the Cleaning and Support Services Association. The CSSA's 180 members employ 250,000 people. Some members do go in for catering, but not many. Few of the CSSA members are involved in building maintenance or what is increasingly being called buildings health. Nor are many involved in professional services. Cleaning and support services are a small part of a large and growing industry. It is an industry which has been relatively unhurt by the recession. Mr John Hall, director-general of the CSSA, says: 'In a perverse way, we have benefited. Companies are concentrating on their core businesses and contracting out marginal services to cut down on staff and costs.' After the recession, further growth can be expected because of legislation on environmental standards, which grew out of heightened public awareness of environmental issues and concern about food safety. Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (Coshh) regulations came into effect in 1989. The Food Safety Act took effect in 1990 as did the Environmental Protection Act. Earlier this year the new Code of Practice for the Prevention and Control of Legionella in Water Systems came into operation. Mr David Pearce, an industrial relations officer at the CSSA, says: 'The new laws about environmental standards have meant more business for our members. The larger companies are now offering complete packages covering not just cleaning but also health and safety standards.' Mr Hall says: 'There is no question that the laws on environmental protection and safety standards have meant increased business for the more enterprising contracting companies. An important part of our role is to make sure that our members know the latest state of play on standards. Not many of them belong to trade associations any more, so they rely on us to keep up to date. They now have to be up to date on the law if they want the business and generally speaking they are.' Rentokil is an example of a company which has flourished by being aware of the fast-moving legislative background to contracting out services. It was once best known as a company specialising in dry rot in houses and domestic pest control, but these now account for only 7 per cent of the company's turnover. It has branched out into industrial cleaning in a big way. It offers a service which will clean walls, floors, girders, fittings and cable conduits, to a standard consistent with hygiene regulations. It also offers risk assessment for buildings, covering chemical emissions, subsidence and water control. Mr Peter Bateman, of Rentokil, says: 'The tightening of standards has generally meant more business for our company. Look at air conditioning, water towers, water supplies, industrial safety - areas which we would not have been involved in a few years ago.' Rentokil's sales have been growing at a rate of 20 per cent for the past five years. Its turnover in 1990 was Pounds 305m, half of which was in Britain. At the other end of the scale in terms of turnover is Environmental Monitoring Services (EMS). This company, which employs 22 people and has a turnover of Pounds 1m after six years in business, specialises in monitoring the health of buildings. Mr Rex Barnes, a managing partner of EMS, says: 'There is a still a considerable lack of knowledge as to the legal responsibilities for building environment.' His company is involved in all aspects of buildings including the exteriors and the working conditions within. 'There has only recently come an awareness that standards within buildings are important. The legislation is responsible for that.' The rules and regulations will go on being tightened. In addition to the British laws, the EC is considering a number of directives under the general rubric of the 1992 legislation to form an internal market. These will deal specifically with the co-ordination of procedures on the award of public service contracts. Few British contracting companies have a large involvement in Europe at present, but this should grow in line with the legislation.</p>

How did the talks with Under Secretary Peter Egardt go,  with the Finance Committee, with Lars Tobisson? What will happen  to the gasoline tax, child care subsidy, unemployment insurance,  and direct write-offs?    No information on Wednesday, and the krona makes a jump. But  the currency traders deny any New Democratic impact on the  exchange rate. Perhaps they have tired of their premature joys  and disappointments. Perhaps they have drawn conclusions from  the way it has ended up so far. After putting up a lot of fuss  New Democracy [NYD] supports the government's policy, satisfied  with victories such as lower value-added tax [VAT] for tourists  and higher tax for incomes over 16,560 kronor a month.    New Democracy itself regards the reduced VAT on hotels,  restaurants, and public transportation last summer as its  greatest direct victory in the Riksdag.    "We succeeded, by acting very educational, in making the  others understand how large and important the tourist industry  is, that a German who stays four nights in Sweden gives us as  much new money as an exported Volvo," says party secretary  Marianne Ostlund, who also stresses the founding of Next Stop  Sweden.    The cut in the VAT is also pointed out in New Democracy's  own  summary of the second year in the Riksdag. It was not mentioned,  however, that the party pushed for elimination of the basic  deduction for state income tax in 1994 and 1995.    On the other hand, the Conservatives are quick to point out  that effort. That New Democracy has arranged for a tax increase  for half of Sweden's full-time employees is an argument that  could entice renegade Conservative voters back home to the fold.    When New Democracy made its comet-like career in the  political sky, the Conservatives primarily assumed the role of  observer. The Liberal Party and the Social Democrats were those  who went to battle against what they categorized as opposition  to refugees and populism. Now, apart from the refugee issue in  which Bengt Westerberg and Ingvar Carlsson are setting the tone,  it is the Conservatives who complain the loudest.    Prime Minister Carl Bildt was not kind in his comments after  the carnival Wednesday last March, when New Democracy voted  against abolishing partial pensions for the second time,  although the proposal was a copy of New Democracy's own, and,  further, sent back the guidelines for the economic policy to be  reworked.    Before the vote of confidence for the Bildt government the  following week, Education Minister Per Unckel, Lars Tobisson,  and party secretary Gunnar Hokmark took New Democracy to task  for unreliability and lack of consistency. Now it is time again.  Hokmark calls Ian Wachtmeister the "knight of the unions" in a  press announcement.    "New Democracy acts counterproductively all the time. They  say that they want to reduce the power of the unions but oppose  the proposal for general unemployment insurance, which in  practice means cementing the power of the unions.    "If they had been reliable, so that we could have made  crisis  agreements with them, the small businessmen's tax situation  would have improved sooner, as well as the labor legislation.  Which is what they say they want. With its behavior New  Democracy has come to legitimize agreements across the  boundaries, and those are damaging," Hokmark reasons.    His colleague in New Democracy, Marianne Ostlund, scoffs at  the Conservative attacks. "Since the election we have lost 40  percent of our voters and gotten 40 percent new ones. The new  ones are coming from the Conservatives; we are a threat to them.    "Moreover, the other parties choose to avoid us, not the  opposite. They do not want to see us housebroken. Like when we  and the Social Democrats on the Housing Committee had agreed on  an ROT [construction materials for Repair, Renovation and  Addition] package, the Social Democratic leadership said no for  that reason."    But the Conservatives and New Democracy do not disagree on  everything. The Conservatives, who before the election hoped to  use New Democracy as support for more radical change in the  public sector, regards New Democracy as a centrist party. Ian  Wachtmeister does, too; he often calls New Democracy an extreme  center party.    This is the reason for the perplexing lack of consistency by  New Democracy. On the one hand, on the SAF [Swedish Employers'  Federation] and small-businessman side, the party wants to  reduce compensation and subsidies levels considerably. On the  other hand, the popular leftist side, it is wrong to take money  from ordinary people when they have a hard time anyway.    The first time this duality became evident was in December  1991. The government proposed freezing child subsidies, and New  Democracy threatened to vote with the Social Democrats for  raising them by 85 kronor a month at a total cost of 2 billion.  This, although the party had already said that it was willing to  reduce government spending on family policy and later specified  it at minus 22 billion kronor.    The Finnish contagion was the primary reason, but New  Democracy's threat to oppose contributed to the outflow of  currency, which caused the head of the National Bank, Bengt  Dennis--since then Wachtmeister's favorite object of hate--to  "shoot" the marginal interest rate to 17.5 percent. Wachtmeister  bowed to the interest pressure at that time. And later.    This Janus face was clearly shown last spring as well, on  the  issue of lower unemployment compensation. New Democracy's own  line is that the compensation should be 70 percent of the wage.  But when the government proposed cutting back from 90 to 80  percent, New Democracy imposed new conditions on voting with the  government: The VAT must be lowered. Interest rates rose, the  krona dropped, and New Democracy gave way once again. But with  the promise of later negotiations, which gave us lower VAT for  tourists and elimination of the basic state deduction.    Naturally, the government is satisfied with the fact that  New  Democracy is working according to the proverb about empty  barrels. But the capriciousness is nerve-racking; here you have  a party that talks about deregulation and competition, and then  it gets involved in the Telecommunications Agency's rate  increases and is prepared to halt the incorporation of the Post  Office for raising the postage by 70 ore, yes, even by a 30-ore  increase after the Post Office's newly invented discount stamps.  Most nerve-racking of all, however, is the way the party acts  outside the walls of the Riksdag building.    It is a glorious July evening in Almedalen in Visby. A  couple  of thousand suntanned vacationers. Ice cream, beer, candy, hot  dogs.    "Come on, come on. You are coming along? Here come we who  hate all authority," there booms from the loudspeakers. Ian  Wachtmeister is singing along. And Bert Karlsson. But most  sparkling of all is Vivianne Franzen's singing. Her passion is  contagious. The audience claps in unison. She has it under  control.    "Soon it will only be a question of time before our  schoolchildren must turn to Mecca when praying."    "The mathematics are simple. In 60 years the Swedes will be  a  minority in Sweden. Unless we do something," chairman Ian  Wachtmeister fills in.    The audience in Almedalen does not protest. But for the  politicians of the other parties these statements become another  two heavy stones in the mental wall which prevents agreement on  issues other than refugee policy. On refugee issues no one makes  agreements with New Democracy. But the party's indirect effect  is obvious.    For example, the government wants to limit the opportunity  for reconsidering asylum cases. The Social Democrats want to  send asylum-seekers home while their appeals of expulsion  decisions are being processed. Kosovo Albanians and Bosnians  must have visas.    "When extremists get a foothold the point of compromise is  shifted to others in their direction," is the summing up of  Ingvar Svensson, a Christian Democratic Coalition Riksdag  member, who believes that New Democracy has also affected the  foreign aid policy, where 1.5 billion of the annual  appropriation disappeared in the crisis package.    But what happens next? When other parties under the pressure  of the Yugoslav tragedy and New Democracy's agitation have  placed limits on the asylum opportunities, how should  Wachtmeister then proceed in a matter on which the party has  leaned so heavily?    And how should the party act during the spring Riksdag in  order to maintain its antiestablishment image, without for that  reason appearing irresponsible?    It would be natural to limit the Riksdag squabbles to two  issues. Making the child care subsidy conditional on a taxable  child support compensation, or cutting back on the parental  insurance and fighting for ROT incentives, for example. In the  election movement this could be supplemented by lower VAT on  services that provide jobs and make small businessmen happy. And  refugee policy of course.    "I don't know. We are not that strategic, we do not maximize  our votes in such clever ways as others. I think there will be  more issues--right now there are about eight--since our Riksdag  members are involved to such a degree that they cannot be  stopped," says party secretary Ostlund, who himself would like  to become a member of the Riksdag and anticipates considerable  turnover in his own group, since it has to live up to the thesis  that long-term representation is bad.    Great uncertainty reigns in all parties as to how New  Democracy will act when the election approaches. For the Social  Democrats it does not matter as long as New Democracy does not  submit totally Social Democratic-adapted proposals, which it  could be embarrassing to oppose. The ideal for the Social  Democrats is for New Democracy to have to leave the Riksdag with  3.9 percent.    That figure is nightmarish for the nonsocialist parties.  Best  of all, of course, they would like for New Democracy to break up  chaotically during the spring and be punished with some  ridiculous percentage point in the election, while the voters  vote for the government to stay. But the next best thing is to  continue to govern with the support of New Democracy. In spite  of all.  <H5>  New Democracy's Contributions in the Riksdag </H5>    -  Obligatory price labeling in stores remains.    -  The venture  capital companies Atle and Bure.    -  The Telecommunications Agency  was prevented from raising rates for private persons in  1992.    -  The National Tourist Council replaced the Board for  Swedish Image which gives the branch company Next Stop Sweden  100 million kronor. The government wanted to scrap it  altogether.    -  Partial pensions remain.    -  The retirement age was not  raised to 66 years.    -  The Research Council Board remains.    -  The  cutback in legal aid was prevented.    -  Stockholm's Teachers'  College will be moved to Sodertalje. "All of Greater Stockholm  cheered," writes New Democracy in its summary of Year One in the  Riksdag. In Year Two, it is assumed, the Sodertalje residents  cried, since New Democracy made a 180-degree turnaround and  saved the school for Stockholm.    -  The free radio became freer.  More frequencies.    -  VAT on hotels, restaurants, and public  transportation lowered from 21 to 12 percent.    -  No basic deduction  for state income tax in 1994 and 1995.</p>

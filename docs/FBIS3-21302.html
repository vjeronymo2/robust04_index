			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ashraf al-Faqi in Surt: "Al-Qadhdhafi: `We Have </F> Arrested Spies Working for U.S. Intelligence'"]    [Excerpts] Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi has  announced the arrest of spies in the pay of U.S. intelligence.  AL-HAYAH has also learned that the Libyan General People's  Conference has conducted a limited cabinet reshuffle.    The Libyan media yesterday reported al-Qadhdhafi's remarks  in  Banghazi, in which he said that Libya had arrested "spies"  working for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, among them  hardline Muslims, and threatened that the Libyan people would  tear any "traitor" to pieces.    Al-Qadhdhafi gave no details about the identity or number of  the alleged spies, but he said that they had spread false rumors  to the advantage of U.S. intelligence.    "The traitors are not only the spies we seized the day  before  yesterday," he said, "nor only stray dogs [dissidents], but also  those who had joined the Muslim Brotherhood organization."    He added that the spies were acting as part of a plan to  weaken the morale of the Libyan people in facing the sanctions  imposed by the United Nations, to force Libya to hand over those  accused of blowing up the Pan American plane over Lockerbie.    "They [the spies] are responsible for many of the rumors we  heard in the streets, on the orders of U.S. intelligence," he  continued. "The rumors were fabricated and concocted for them by  U.S. intelligence, who asked them to spread them among Libyan  citizens to hamper the spirit of our people, and make Libyans  have doubts about their revolution, to weaken them before  America, Britain, and France, and make them hand over their  sons. The Libyan people will chop them into pieces." [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: Toyoda machinery sales surge TOYODA Automatic Loom Works, a leading member of the Toyota Motor group, reported an 11.1 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Y30.2bn (Dollars 218.84m) for the year to end-March, as sales of automobile assembly equipment rose with the expansion of vehicle production at Toyota. The company, the first founded of the Toyota group, reported an 18.8 per cent increase in sales to Y583.69bn, with a 33.5 per cent surge in textile machinery sales, a 28.2 per cent rise in automobile assembly equipment, and an 8.8 per cent improvement in industrial vehicles. Company officials said personnel expenses rose during the year because of Japan's labour shortage, and earnings were affected by the increase in the country's interest rates, but they added that the advance in sales more than compensated for those costs. However, Japan's vehicle market has softened and export markets are also troubled, so sales for this year are expected to rise only 4.5 per cent to Y610bn, while pre-tax profit is predicted to fall 2.3 per cent to Y29.5bn, the first fall in five years. Toyota Tsusho, a trading arm of the Toyota group, reported a 10.8 per cent lift in sales to Y2,163bn, while pre-tax profit increased 4.5 per cent to Y16.16bn. Domestic sales advanced 10.4 per cent, while foreign trade increased 11.6 per cent, with exports up 19 per cent, imports down 0.5 per cent, and trade between third world countries up 16.4 per cent. The company expects a 6.2 per cent increase in sales to Y2,300bn this year and an 11.4 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Y18bn, despite higher labour costs and a heavier interest payment burden. Another Toyota affiliate, Aisin Seiki, is expecting a decline in recurring profit from the Y20.2bn in the year to end-March, up 1.1 per cent on 1989, to around Y17bn for the present year. The company announced yesterday that sales for the year to end-March rose 14.5 per cent to Y525bn, with those of automobile parts up 14.8 per cent to Y495.7bn and household machinery rising 10.1 per cent to Y29.2bn. Sales for the current year are expected to increase 4.7 per cent to Y550bn, but the expected downturn in profits is attributed to the sluggish car market, and increased depreciation and personnel expenses.</p>

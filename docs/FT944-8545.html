			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Lilley hints at benefits boost for low-paid workers The government yesterday indicated that improvement of in-work benefits for the low paid would be the first priority for future reforms of the social security system. Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, said the dispersion of earnings power in the past two decades was the most significant social problem facing western governments. In what may foreshadow further measures in this month's Budget to make it easier for the unemployed to take low-paid jobs, Mr Lilley said: 'Creating and maintaining incentives to work has been at the centre of my review of social security. They will remain there.' In a lecture prepared for the Conservative Political Centre in Northern Ireland, he said the widening of pay differentials between the skilled and the unskilled was not only a main cause of unemployment. In a marked shift in government rhetoric, he said the squeeze on earnings power at the bottom end of the income scale had become intertwined with many of Britain's social problems. He said: 'It may play a major part in the break-up of families, the growth of lone parenthood and a growing welfare dependency. It may even play a part in explaining delinquency and crime.' Mr Lilley stressed the widening earnings power of the skilled and unskilled was an international phenomenon. In countries with flexible labour markets such as the US and, more recently, Britain, the impact had been to increase income disparities among those in work. In other, less flexible economies, the biggest effect had been felt in higher unemployment rates among unskilled workers. Rejecting 'artificial' mechanisms to push up low pay - trade barriers against developing countries, a national minimum wage or restrictions on new technology - Mr Lilley said the long-term solution lay in improving the education, training and skills of the workforce. State intervention to make employers pay more would simply result in higher unemployment. But better trained and more highly skilled workers would command higher wages. Mr Lilley said the immediate priority was to ensure that the interaction of the labour market and the benefits system did not discourage the unskilled from taking work. Employment provided a basis for the low-paid to improve their marketable skills.</p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICKING FIRST DOESN'T MEAN PICKING BEST;  </P> <P> NBA DRAFT: SOME OF WEST'S GAMBLES (GREEN, DIVAC) HAVE PAID OFF. SOME OF  CLIPPERS' SURE THINGS (WILLIAMS, FERRY) HAVEN'T.  </P> <P> It's draft time in the NBA, when the losers become winners and the winners  become gamblers.  </P> <P> Nowhere is that more evident than locally, where the city's two teams briefly  trade places.  </P> <P> For one day at least, the Clippers, seemingly permanent contestants in the NBA  lottery, grab the local spotlight and headlines with a pick at or near the top.  </P> <P> For the Lakers, on the other hand, Showtime becomes low time.  </P> <P> Success has its price and, for the Lakers, victory over a decade of domination  has meant picking at or near the bottom in one draft after another.  </P> <P> It's no different this time. The Clippers draft eighth with their own pick and  13th with a choice they got from the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Ron Harper  trade.  </P> <P> The Lakers, thanks to a league-high 63 victories, pick last, getting the 27th  choice.  </P> <P> Actually, because of expansion, it keeps getting worse for the Lakers. Until  several years ago, even the last choice was the 23rd. But with four new teams  -- Charlotte, Miami, Orlando and Minnesota -- the top clubs keep moving farther  to the rear.  </P> <P> Even so, Laker General Manager Jerry West says he hasn't lost his optimism.  </P> <P> "You have to have a different attitude where we pick," West said. "If you don't  think you can get anyone, it would be pretty depressing to draft there every  year. You have to get a player. Otherwise, you've just wasted a year. You have  to stay optimistic."  </P> <P> Even if your phone rarely rings.  </P> <P> "Nobody is calling you to trade for your pick," he said. "Where we are, all  people want to know is if we want to move up to the spot above."  </P> <P> But a lack of opportunity to draft a blue chipper doesn't keep West and his  staff from spending long hours trying to find a hidden gem.  </P> <P> Knowing the players with the flashy numbers will be long gone when the Lakers'  name is called, what does West look for in a prospect?  </P> <P> "We want to know, how does he play the game?" West said. "Does he know how to  play the game? Does he have the ability to not be selfish? Players picked down  there have to work harder."  </P> <P> West estimates that the two Laker scouts, Ronnie Lester and Gene Tormohlen, see  100 college games a year. West himself sees about 60, and, when home, watches  two a night on television.  </P> <P> It's a challenge that West, despite the odds, has met more than once. Over the  last five years, the Lakers have had four first-round picks, all near the  bottom. Two of those, A.C. Green in 1985 and Vlade Divac last year, have been  successful enough to cause some hand-wringing for those who passed on them  earlier.  </P> <P> Although he was the Pacific 10 Conference player of the year as a junior at  Oregon State, Green was still available when the Lakers selected 23rd. Green  averaged just 14.7 points and 7.7 rebounds a game in four seasons as a Beaver.  </P> <P> "Oregon State didn't shoot much," West said. "But you had to be impressed with  (Green's) work ethic."  </P> <P> With that work ethic, Green eventually elbowed Kurt Rambis out of the starting  power forward's job.  </P> <P> Last year, with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar leaving and the Lakers stuck in the 26th  slot of the draft without much realistic hope of getting a bona fide center,  West held his breath as the player he wanted kept going unclaimed.  </P> <P> When the Lakers' turn came and Divac, a 7-1 raw talent from Yugoslavia with  intriguing potential, was still there, West couldn't say his name fast enough.  </P> <P> "I think he slid down there because some people might have been afraid of the  political problems in getting him, or adjustments he was going to have to make  here in this country," West said. "We got lucky because people would rather  take an American."  </P> <P> The Lakers' other top picks of the last five years didn't work out quite so  well. With the 23rd choice in the 1986 draft, they selected Ken Barlow of Notre  Dame, then immediately traded him, along with Mike McGee, to the Atlanta Hawks  for Billy Thompson and Ron Kellogg, neither of whom stuck.  </P> <P> In 1987, the Lakers didn't have a first-round pick, having given it to the San  Antonio Spurs in the deal for Mychal Thompson. With their first selection in  the third round, the Lakers picked the forgettable Willie Glass of St. John's.  </P> <P> In 1988, they had the 25th selection, using it to take David Rivers of Notre  Dame, another soon-to-disappear Laker.  </P> <P> The Clippers' problem has never been getting top picks, just keeping them. Over  the last five years, the club has had eight first-round selections, seven in  the last three seasons.  </P> <P> Their biggest disappointments have been their first pick each time. Over the  last five seasons, the Clippers have selected one who played only when he  wanted to, one who didn't want to play at all, one who wanted to play but  couldn't and two who wanted to play but weren't good enough.  </P> <P> The record:  </P> <P>  -- 1985: The Clippers use the third pick of the draft to take Creighton center  Benoit Benjamin. What follows is five years of frustration and anger as  Benjamin battles his critics, management, fans and even fellow players because  of an attitude he later admits was immature. He is often out of shape and out  of touch. Only recently has he begun to realize some of the potential the  Clippers saw half a decade ago.  </P> <P>  -- 1986: Without a draft choice in the first two rounds, the Clippers select  Dwayne Polee of Pepperdine in the third round. He plays one game for the  Clippers.  </P> <P>  -- 1987: With the fourth pick overall, the Clippers select swing man Reggie  Williams of Georgetown. After 2 1/2 years of ineffectiveness, he is shipped to  Cleveland in the Ron Harper deal.  </P> <P>  -- 1988: With the first pick in the draft, the Clippers figure they can't go  wrong with forward Danny Manning, the player of the year the previous season  after leading Kansas to the NCAA championship. But, the hex of the Clippers  catches up to him midway through his first season. A knee injury knocks him out  for nearly 11 months.  </P> <P>  -- 1989: The Clippers have the second pick overall. When the Sacramento Kings  use the first choice to take Pervis Ellison, it appears the Clippers' luck has  finally changed. With the second pick, they can have the first choice of most  draft observers, forward Danny Ferry of Duke. The Clippers select him but Ferry  plays in Italy rather than join this hapless club.  </P> <P> Two of the other first-round Clipper picks over the last five years -- forward  Charles Smith and guard Gary Grant -- came to the club in a 1988 draft-day,  three-team deal involving the Philadelphia 76ers and Seattle Supersonics. Smith  has become the Clippers' most consistent player, averaging 21.1 points and 6.7  rebounds last season. Grant was averaging double figures in both points, 13.1,  and assists, 10, when an ankle injury ended his season in February.  </P> <P> After selecting Williams in 1987, the Clippers took Joe Wolf with the 13th pick  and Ken Norman with the 19th. Norman averaged 16.1 points last season, mostly  at small forward. Wolf, also a forward, averaged 17.2 minutes, 4.8 points, and  3.0 rebounds.  </P></p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Councils warn PM over police role A RARE meeting between Mr John Major and leaders of local authority associations ended with a familiar public difference of view between central and local government yesterday. The local leaders warned that they would resist any moves to reduce their role on regional police authorities. Councillors fear that in the review of the police service being carried out by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, they will lose their majority position on police authorities outside London. In spite of this difference, both sides described the meeting as friendly and constructive. Downing Street said that it had gone so well that Mr Major had agreed to meet local authority representatives again next year. The meeting, planned for some time, comes shortly after Mr Major's call for both sides to 'stop batting one another round the head'. For several years councillors of all political parties have felt bruised by the government's grip on - and changes to - local government finance, as well as the diminishing role councils have been given. The local authority associations welcome talk of partnership and are hopeful that Mr Major's 'listening mode' will mean that once the council tax has settled down then ministers will relax the tight arrangements for limiting local spending that they have insisted on for its intro-duction. There was also an assurance that the government would accept its Commons defeat on the European committee of the regions on Monday. The local authority associations were behind the amendment on which the government was defeated.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Gunnar Magnus report: "Jagland: EU `Yes' Even Without </F> Sweden"]    [Text] "We have won respect for what are peculiarly  Norwegian characteristics and conditions," Prime Minister Gro  Harlem Brundtland said of Norway's EU [European Union]  membership agreement in the Antennetimen program yesterday.    Well-known arguments raged back and forth across the table  in  the first -- and very heated -- EU duel between the leading  figures on the yes and no sides: Prime Minister Gro Harlem  Brundtland and Center Party leader Anne Enger Lahnstein. They  were assisted by Labor Party leader Thorbjorn Jagland and Center  Party parliamentary leader John J. Jakobsen.    The Center Party leaders completely disagreed with  Brundtland: They argued that Norway would lose its national  identity as an EU member. "It will be impossible to be an  independent nation," Lahnstein said. While Jakobsen claimed  that we are now seeing the formation of a new state, and that  German Chancellor Kohl has the goal of a United States of Europe.    The prime minister took Jakobsen to mean that borders will  be  scrapped -- and argued strongly against such a view.    Lahnstein said that we have lost our right of control over  fish resources in the north, while the prime minister found it  impossible to believe that the fisheries minister had been  tricked.    Gro Harlem Brundtland had dressed in green for the occasion,  while Anne Enger Lahnstein was all in red. "We go better  together now than we did at the party leader debate," the prime  minister said, recalling that on that occasion they both turned  up is shades of red -- and sat side by side. Yesterday they  were placed at opposite ends of the table, but were quickly  involved in hand-to-hand fighting.    Thorbjorn Jagland did not seem particularly interested in  answering the question of whether he would recommend a no if a  majority in Sweden said no to the EU. The program chairman  pointed to earlier statements that the Nordic area should stand  united. Jagland said that the people must decide, but said  finally that the Labor Party will maintain its position -- that  is, that the party will recommend a yes to membership,  regardless of the Swedes' choice.    Both Jagland and Brundtland made it clear that they want a  referendum in Norway after the referendums in Sweden and  Finland. The Labor Party leaders asked whether the Center Party  is unable to see what is democratic -- and hinted that what is  democratic would be to satisfy the wishes of those who want to  see what choices Norway's neighbors reach before casting their  own votes.    Center Party parliamentary leader Johan J. Jakobsen said  that  he does not attach any great importance to the timing of a  referendum -- he expects a clear no regardless. But he would  prefer coordination with Sweden and Finland. Jagland for his  part claimed that he does not think that there is a greater  chance of a yes if the Norwegians vote after the Swedes.</p>

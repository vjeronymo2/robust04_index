If Sulzer has (1) not divested the Amdry 2010 Information within six (6) months of the date this Order becomes final, or (2) not submitted affidavits as required by Paragraph II.C. of this Order, within nine (9) months of the date the Commission approves the divestiture of the Amdry 2010 Information, then the Commission may appoint a trustee to divest both the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information only to an acquirer that receives the prior approval of the Commission, and only in a manner that receives the prior approval of the Commission. The purpose of the divestiture of the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information is to enable the acquirer to become a viable competitor in the aluminum polyester powder market, and to remedy the lessening of competition resulting from the Acquisition as alleged in the Commission's complaint.

Neither the appointment of a trustee nor a decision not to appoint a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude the Commission or the Attorney General from seeking civil penalties or any other relief available to it, including a court-appointed trustee, pursuant to Section 5 ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> l <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or any other statute enforced by the Commission, for any failure by respondent to comply with this Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.

Subject to the prior approval of the Commission, the trustee shall have the exclusive power and authority to divest both the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information and to take all such steps as may be feasible and necessary to assist the acquirer of the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information to receive all product approvals from the original equipment manufacturers necessary for the purchase of an Amdry 2010 Equivalent or a Metco 601 Equivalent by such manufacturer or by any other person pursuant to standards and qualifications established by such manufacturer. Such assistance shall include but not be limited to the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.

Requiring respondent to provide any training relevant to the production of an Amdry 2010 Equivalent or a Metco 601 Equivalent to the acquirer; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Requiring respondent to offer any technical assistance necessary to assist the acquirer in its development of an Amdry 2010 Equivalent or a Metco 601 Equivalent; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Requiring respondent to provide any additional information or know-how reasonably necessary to the acquirer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.

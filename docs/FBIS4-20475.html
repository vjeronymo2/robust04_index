			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Feng Jing: ``Rewards Honor Excellent Young </F> Scientists'']    [Text] In December 1993, 40 out of 140 candidates were  given awards at the Third Prize Ceremony of Young Scientists of  the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Among them, 10 were first  prize winners, and another 30 ranked second. The youngest was 26  years old, and the average age was 32. They were all selected  from research institutes under CAS. Among them, 34 were Ph.Ds.,  with 31 having earned their doctorates at home. Altogether, they  had published 1,159 academic papers in Chinese and foreign  academic periodicals. The scientific research projects which  they presided over or participated in as key members had won six  prizes of state-level scientific and technological achievements  and 22 awards from CAS, provinces and ministries. Their  achievements have been prominent in scientific and technological  fields.    Research fellow Zhang Zhile, aged 30, was the youngest among  the first prize winners. Zhang received his doctorate from  Shenyang Metal Research Institute. He has obtained outstanding  research results in the fields of magnetics, magnetic materials  and applied magnetics, with publication of 57 academic papers in  foreign and domestic periodicals. A research group led by him  succeeded in developing a new permanent magnetic material of  world advanced level. He and his colleagues have advanced a new  theory of magnetic colloidal effects through analysing  phenomenon associated with handling of permanent magnetic  material, thus solving a knotty problem of several decades at  global level. Many specialists praised his efforts as an  absolutely first-class job. Wider dissemination of magnetic  technology, a project in which he was involved, has brought over  100 million yuan to oilfields. Due to his stirring efforts, he  was granted the title of Liaoning Provincial Outstanding Young  Scientific and Technical Worker, awarded at the Third Prize  Ceremony of the China Association for Science and Technology.    Wang Xiaofang, born in 1967, was the youngest prize winner.  A  Ph.D. of the Shanghai Optical Machinery Research Institute, he  is known for his creative accomplishments in the study of laser  plasma X-ray spectrum and X-ray lasers. Wang has published more  than 20 academic papers in influential local and overseas  journals. He was the key member of the first research project to  set up a soft X-ray spectrometer with penetrating strap raster.  Other national firsts by Wang and his colleagues have included  the systematic study of the equilibrium of linear focus X-rays,  the course of their evolution and the space-time character of  composite X-ray lasers. In addition, Wang has designed a new way  to drive lasers and a new laser target. As a key member, he  participated in research for the state-designated ``863''  high-tech project, as well as a key project designated by CAS  and another by the State Natural Sciences Fund. In 1992, he was  given first prize for Natural Sciences by CAS, and his treatise  was chosen in 1993 as an excellent one for the National Young  Scientists' Academic Paper Exchange Meeting on Laser Science.    Qi Zhixue was the only woman among winners. Shortly after  she  finished her master's degree at the Electronic Industry Research  Institute in 1988, she was assigned a job in the institute. In  1992, Qi went to Canada for one year of further studies. At the  end of this, she was advised her excellent marks warranted her  staying on to continue toward a doctorate. However, feeling she  was badly needed at home, Qi politely declined the Canadian  offer. After returning to China, she participated in the study  and manufacture of line-cutting machine tools. She was in charge  of software programming which solved technical problems in  handling of non-circular curves. This feat won the second prize  for Beijing Scientific and Technical Progress. The  program-control system for the new machine tools which involved  Qi's major efforts took the third prize for scientific and  technical progress of CAS in 1991. The same year, she was  conferred the title of ``Outstanding Contributor With Chinese  Masters'' by the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council.    Other winners included Li Jinghai, Yuan Yexiang, Chen  Zhaoxiong and Wang Zhixin, whose research projects all earned  prizes for scientific and technical achievements from the state  or CAS.    The young scientist awards are presented biennially in a bid  to discover and encourage talented young scientists. In 1989,  there were 21 winners. In 1991, the number increased to 25.  Recipients gain not only awards but also special housing,  promotions and professional study opportunities.    Zhou Guangzhao, president of CAS, said, ``Our academy is  passing through a crucial stage. The burden of work is shifting  to fledgling scientists. Having the young replace their elders  is one of the three important tasks we face in the 90s.''    CAS is honored as a state team. Under its umbrella are some  150 research institutes, with 60,000 scientific workers. Among  them, there are 30,000 young scientific workers under the age of  40, accounting for half its total employment.</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Middle-class crisis identified Government mistakes and the 'feel-flat recovery' are breeding a dangerous cynicism among the middle-classes, says a paper by the Social Market Foundation. The paper by Mr Matthew Symonds, a former Independent journalist, says that the government's unpopularity can be traced to a growing 'culture of anxiety' among middle-income voters. This, he argues, explains the lack of a 'feelgood' factor in the recovery to date. 'For 'feelgood', read 'feel flat',' he says. Mr Symonds adds: 'The middle classes feel a powerful sense of betrayal. They feel that they have done all of the things they were asked to, and given dutiful support to the orthodoxies of the 1980s and yet things have not turned out well.' The Middle Class Crisis, Social Market Foundation, 20 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9AA.</p>

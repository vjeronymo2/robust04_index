These two  officials are also due to report to the king on the latest  developments in the royal government's activities.    The two officials are Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut,  deputy  prime minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation,  and Sam Rangsi, minister of economy and finance. The prince  deputy prime minister and the minister left Phnom Penh on 22  March.    It is worth noting that the trip to Beijing by Prince  Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut and Sam Rangsi was made hot on the  heels of the 22 March visit to the king by Samdech Hun Sen,  second prime minister, and the return from Beijing of Samdech  Chea Sim on 21 March. All these visits were not announced  officially. It is not known what the issue is that the  officials referred to as a "serious matter." However, analysts  have focused on an important issue, namely the alliance between  the two big parties, the Cambodian People's Party and FUNCINPEC  [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful,  and Cooperative Cambodia].    There is happy news, that is, the king has been discharged  from Beijing hospital. His spokesman told the REUTER Beijing  correspondent that "the treatment was successful; the king can  walk and do other things." Western diplomats in Beijing said  that after his cancer treatment the king has lost his hair but  put on weight.    The king plans to travel to Pyongyang at the end of March  and  then to Cambodia on 8 April.</p>

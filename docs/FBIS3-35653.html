			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baku, January 28 (AZERTAC)--Though the Azeri  National Army has succeeded in the war within last weeks,  Azerbaijan more often turns to possibility of continuation of  talks on resolution of the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. This  paradoxical aspiration has a logic of its own: the faster the  conflict will be settled the fewer people will die. Besides,  the Republic will be able to reform the economy and solve the  basic social problems.    The Republic authorities policy is based on these factors.?  President Aliyev has emphasized the main direction of it at his  recent meeting with one of the units of the National Army.  According to him, peace could be achieved on condition that  Armenian troops withdraw immediately from occupied Azeri  territory. This will create a basis for thorough negotiations  on resolution of the conflict. The president is sure that  cessation of hostilities as well as restoration of relationships  between Azerbaijan and Armenia are to be discussed at the talks  in order to prevent possibility of a new conflict between the  two neighbors in the future.    Meanwhile, Azeri analysts take guesses at reasons for  postponement of Moscow negotiations between Azerbaijani and  Armenian high officials, which was expected to be held with  participation of the Russian president. According to them, a  coordinated Russian and Armenian plan on resolution of the  problem will be proposed to Azerbaijan. The plan in particular  specifies that the Armenian party will withdraw its troops from  territory seized beyond Nagorno-Karabakh provided Azerbaijan  allows Russian peace-keeping ?roops to be stationed in the war  zone. The Minsk Conference of t?e CSCE is charged to determine  exactly the status of Nagorno-Karabakh.    Though authorities of Azerbaijan have not yet expressed  their  attitude to this matter, Azerbaijan can hardly accept this plan  if Armenians and Russians should propose it. Azerbaijan has  repeatedly stated that Armenian Armed Forces must be withdrawn  without any preliminary terms in accordance with the UN Security  Council's resolutions. In this context, the Azerbaijani party  considers recent military success of the National Army a  guarantee of a beginning of Armenian troops withdrawal. As for  the status of the conflict region, the Azerbaijani party is  ready to discuss this matter within frames of an international  organization but considers that the last word must belong to  Azerbaijan.    According to another version, spread by some local  newspapers  with reference to word of Ramiz Rizayev, the plenipotentiary of  Azerbaijan in Russia, the Moscow meeting is postponed because a  document on complete and unconditional withdrawal of all the  Armenian Armed Forces from territory of Azerbaijan has not yet  been prepared. The Azeri party will come to the negotiating  table as soon as this agreement is signed, the plenipotentiary  said. According to his intensive consultations in order to work  out this agreement are going on. It is expected that, Foreign  Minister Gasan Gasanov will soon visit the Russian capital by  this reason.    Meanwhile, many analysts stress that the Azerbaijani  leadership will ask Russia to mediate between the two sides.    An appeal to ask for mediating effort of only one state may  result in serious problem in future, says the opposition, mainly  the Popular [People's] Front, meaning that Russia could  strengthen its control over the Transcaucasian region.  According to them, the political resolution of the conflict  must be carried out with assistance of international  organization.</p>

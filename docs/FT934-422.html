			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Markets: So you want to get rich quick . . . - Frivolous Money The time has arrived to give the fragile economic recovery a kick-start by displaying the entrepreneurship on which the health of 1990s' Britain depends. After studying personal finance developments of the past year, I am setting up a subsidiary, Coggo Enterprises, to offer new products exclusively to FT readers. The attractive range includes: The Emerging Planets fund China, Vietnam, and Tajikistan are old hat already. Serious growth investors are looking beyond the emerging markets and towards the solar system. Think of the tourist possibilities of Mercury, the sunshine planet. Calculate the mineral deposits on Mars, the gas reserves of Jupiter and the refrigeration facilities available on Pluto. Serious profits will be made only by those who invest early. Send a cheque now and we guarantee your money will be invested in the first interplanetary stock market companies to be quoted. In the short term, of course, opportunities will be limited, so no dividends will be paid. The cut-price, fixed-rate mortgage Just 1.99 per cent*. No, you are not dreaming. The lowest mortgage rate since Ethelred the Unready defaulted on his castle repayment plan - and it is fixed for a whole year. Conditional only on clients taking out an endowment policy, personal pension policy, home contents and building insurance, washing my car every Thursday and letting the firm's employees use your house at weekends. *APR 49.6 per cent. The surefire personal pension Why depend on your employer, or the stock market, for your pension? Simply go out and sell personal pensions to other people and invest the healthy commission income in your own pension plan. It is so easy that you can look forward from the start to retiring in Barbados. We send you the whole package, including completed fact-finds to save your clients all that unnecessary paperwork. Simply get them to fill out a direct debit and, to keep the regulators happy, ask them to complete the following sentence in less than 12 words: 'I would like to opt out of my government-guaranteed, index-linked pension which has full death benefits because . . .' The very, very high income fund Dissatisfied with single-digit income plans? Not tempted by a measly 10 per cent or so? The very, very high income fund guarantees to pay you an income of 20 per cent a year over five years. Yes, that's right. Your capital is returned in full and tax-free over the five years. At the end of the period you might also, in certain circumstances*, receive a lump sum equal to your original investment. Minimum: Pounds 10,000 or the equivalent in any other currency. (At Coggo Enterprises, we are not fussy). *Only if England win the World Cup in 1998 and Arthur Scargill becomes prime minister. The warrants warrant fund. Namby-pamby financial services groups have simply failed to provide investors with products which have the right kind of risk-reward profiles for today's go-go stock markets. The warrants warrant fund fills a niche. It buys warrants, which entitle the holder to buy warrants, which in turn entitle the holder to buy the capital shares of highly-geared split capital investment trusts. If the stock market grows at a modest 25 per cent a year until 2000, investors who put Pounds 1,000 in the fund will have a holding equivalent to the GNP of Canada. To protect investors against the down-side, we supply a ready-made writ so you can sue the Bank of England for allowing the fund to exist when, as is 99.99 per cent certain, you lose the lot. The Rockall umbrella fund. The ultimate offshore product, which is out of reach of all the world's tax authorities*. The Rockall umbrella fund has more than 400 sub-funds (everything from Algerian bonds to Zambian smaller companies). You are allowed as many switches between funds as you like in a calendar year. Indeed, the more the better, since we get 2 per cent every time you make a change. *And of you, when you want your money back. Critical reports insurance Fed up with all those critical reports from regulatory bodies? Worried how you are going to pay the fines? For a modest premium, our policy will guarantee to pay off the fine and meet the regulator's costs. We will also issue a standard press release saying: 'These problems are all in the past. The people concerned have been dismissed. We are confident in the ability of our staff to serve the public and in the attractions of our endowment/personal pension/single premium policy' (delete where applicable). (Select your policy from SIB, Lautro, SFA, Imro and Fimbra varieties. When it comes to Consumers' Association reports and quotes from Jean Eaglesham, you are on your own.) If you wish to take up any of these policies, please send all cheques to the Old Hacks Retirement Fund, The Big Yacht, Somewhere in the Caribbean Hiding from the UK Regulatory Authorities. Merry Christmas.</p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metals prices 'still have some way to fall' BASE METALS prices still have some way to fall before they stage a cyclical recovery, according to SG Warburg Securities, the financial services group. It is cautious because world-wide base metals stocks 'look horrific'. Only copper stocks are at present substantially lower than they were, compared with annual consumption, in the depths of the recession in the mid-1980s, points out Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team. Warburg calculates that western world aluminium stocks are equivalent to 23.7 per cent of annual consumption compared with the peak level of 24.1 per cent; copper stocks represent 16.9 per cent of annual consumption (23.5 per cent at the previous peak); lead 15.3 per cent (13.6 per cent); nickel 32.8 per cent (32.3 per cent) and zinc 23.9 per cent (13.8 per cent.) Mr Worthington suggests stocks will continue to grow because even next year metal production, together with imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States, will exceed western world demand. Aluminium, copper, nickel and zinc prices could show further falls in the coming six months as market speculators unwind bullish positions, he suggests in the latest edition of Warburg's International Mining Outlook. 'The copper price looks particularly vulnerable as the squeeze for September-October delivery is unwound. 'Investors in base metal shares should not be fooled, the current period still holds the potential for further downside in base metal prices and consequently pain for their producers.' Mr Worthington says prices have failed to recover as some expected, partly because world economic growth has remained out of synchronisation and partly because of a continuing high level of exports from the CIS and because of the failure of western metal producers to make adequate output cuts.</p>

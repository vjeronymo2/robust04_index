			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan yesterday  said the cancellation of the planned trip by Cambodian Co-Prime  Minister Hun Sen had nothing to do with strained relations  between the two countries.    Surin said the cancellation was not motivated by repeated  Phnom Penh charges that Thailand was still supporting the Khmer  Rouge.    Surin also denied that the cancellation partly stemmed from  a  fact that Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri had strongly  critcized Cambodian leaders who publicly charged that Thailand  provided safe haven for the Khmer Rouge fleeing Pailin after the  defeat.    Cambodia's Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, during  a recent visit to Malaysia, charged that Thailand was not  sincere in solving the Cambodian internal conflict by still  supporting the Khmer Rouge.    Prasong said that the Cambodian leader broke a promise which  that the two countries would not accuse each other in public.  [sentence as published] He also said that Cambodian government  failed to produce evidence on the charges.    Hun Sen had previously said that he would visit Thailand  after April 1 but later cancelled the trip, citing inconvenience.    Coinciding with Hun Sen's cancellation Supreme Commander ACM  Woranat Aphichari's planned trip to Cambodia next week has also  been called off.    However, there is no report to confirm that the two  cancelled  trips are related.    Hun Sen and Thai leaders were expected to discuss border  security problems. His planned trip came after the Phnom Penh  troops seized the Communist faction's major stronghold of Pailin  early last month.    Surin said the Thai government leaders were now preparing a  trip of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai to Malaysia. Therefore it  would be inconvenient for Hun Sen to visit Bangkok.    Surin stressed that Thailand still wanted to foster good  relation between the two countries.    "We don't want to see fighting and violence in Cambodia. We  want to see peace," he said.    He also said that he did not want to let the allegations  affect future cooperation between Thailand and Cambodia, citing  a discovery of natural gas in the Gulf of Thailand off Cambodia  in disputed territory.</p>

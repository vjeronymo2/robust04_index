			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MELVIN DURSLAG: CALCULATING THE HIGH PRICE OF FRIENDSHIP AT SUPER BOWL TIME  </P> <P> Fastidious in their bookkeeping, the Denver Broncos offer a ticket breakdown  for the upcoming Super Bowl, that monument to national lunacy, announcing they  are receiving 13,000 of the 72,104 seats available in the Superdome.  </P> <P> The San Francisco 49ers will receive the same number.  </P> <P> As host team, the New Orleans Saints are tendered 6,100 seats, and 18,850 are  spread among the other 25 brothers in the National League, amounting to 754  each.  </P> <P> Next, the league office is accommodated with 13,500, a figure to be explored  shortly, and the remainder is allocated the luxury suite holders in the home  stadium.  </P> <P> It has been asked what the league office does with 13,500 tickets, and the  answer never has been clear, no more than it is clear what anyone who gets  tickets does with them.  </P> <P> The league contends it takes care of friends, such as television networks and  their sponsors. It also has a lot of friends in Washington and in industries  dispensing products related to the league.  </P> <P> Each of the 28 teams has friends, as well as the luxury suite holders.  </P> <P> We have, at Super Bowl time, a display of friendship warming the heart of the  republic.  </P> <P> It is the sheerest coincidence that seats earmarked for friends should wind up  selling for $500 and more -- much more in some instances.  </P> <P> Before it entered into rest, the Herald-Examiner was planning a Super Bowl  contest which would reward the winner with a trip, and two tickets, to the  game. In order to obtain the tickets, it made an inquiry of a Los Angeles  broker, obviously one with friends.  </P> <P> Indeed, the broker could provide the tickets -- at $1,250 each.  </P> <P> If there was any redemptive feature to the shutdown, it was only that the Super  Bowl tickets weren't needed.  </P> <P> But the point is, how has this monster evolved, this blatant scalping of a  commodity reserved mostly for friends?  </P> <P> The security force at 410 Park Avenue, residence of the National Football  League, is massive. It levels a watchful eye on drugs. Its surveillance of  gambling is close. It studies the personal habits of coaches, general managers  and players.  </P> <P> It isn't disclosed, but it is generally understood, that it keeps a dossier on  each owner, too, tracing his everyday functions.  </P> <P> Its ramparts of decency guarded with such impeccability, how does the league  become a part of this heist, the shameful hawking of tickets to its biggest  promotion at up to 10 times or more their value?  </P> <P> Are those handling the tickets throughout the league being made accountable  enough for their distribution?  </P> <P> During his incumbency as commissioner, Pete Rozelle always worried about Super  Bowl ticket scams, his worst fears realized when the fiance (later to become  the husband) of the Los Angeles Rams owner got his hands on a large parcel of  her tickets, scalped them and went to jail for failing to report the profits.  </P> <P> "We try very hard to keep control of the tickets," said Rozelle, "but find it  impossible to track down where they go after they leave the hands of those  originally receiving them."  </P> <P> If a Denver or San Francisco fan, for instance, latches on to a pair, the  league can't account for what he does with them.  </P> <P> Scalping, though, is so wide-scale that suspicion must focus on areas outside  the fandom of the participating teams.  </P> <P> Openly, for example, certain clubs over the years have gone into the travel  business, selling Super Bowl packages at less than bargain prices.  </P> <P> The trick to selling a Super Bowl package is to produce a Super Bowl ticket,  around which can be wrapped air fare, hotel rooms, airport transfers and meals.  </P> <P> Purchaser of the foregoing may be rewarded, at the packager's expense, with a  welcome mai tai.  </P> <P> Super Bowl tickets, believed supplied by owners, have served as a carrot at  political fund-raisers, at which coaches have been enlisted to analyze the game  for education-hungry contributors.  </P> <P> One surveying the scene is willing to allow for normal larceny on the part of  street guys turning a Super Bowl buck, but the league must labor to convince  one it is doing enough to keep Super Bowl ticket distribution sanitary.  </P> <P> In this Great American Scalp, too many seats are winding up in strange hands,  dealing them off at strange prices.  </P> <P> New Orleans has no law against scalping. All it does is prohibit this practice  on the Superdome grounds. The scene, it feels, shouldn't be polluted by  villainy and rascality.  </P> <P> As it happens in Louisiana politics, enough explanations were required to  justify the cost of the Superdome itself, running at the time $175 million, or  roughly $100 million over budget.  </P> <P> Their fears misplaced, the villagers in 1975 got a bargain, considering a  stadium today costs $150 million with no roof.  </P> <P> But the revelry has begun in New Orleans, where, as it usually happens in every  town hosting a big event, the police have declared a crackdown on prostitution,  promising a wholesome environment for visitors.  </P> <P> At the Derby each year, Louisville police crack down on prostitution, anxious  to purify the scene for Derby entrants, who are only 3.  </P> <P> If a horse makes a private deal through a bellhop, however, that's his own  business.  </P></p>

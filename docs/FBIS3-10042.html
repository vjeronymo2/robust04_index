			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ernesto Castillo: "Who Is Accelerating the </F> Deterioration of the FSLN?"]    [Text] Is it possible that for some Sandinists the loss of  power means the loss of values? When one reviews the attitude of  devotion, sacrifice, and rectitude of many comrades, it is very  difficult for us to understand their egotism. It translates into  a desperation to retain the leading role and preserve privileges  on the part of the very persons who, by virtue of the very  responsibilities they exercise within the party, should be an  example for those who still believe that the FSLN is the last  hope for achieving a more just society.    The FSLN of today cannot be the same as it was in past  decades. Trying to turn it into a docile, blind instrument  prevents its adaptation to the dynamic times in which we are  living. To cling to positions of power and use improper methods  of struggle, methods at odds with honesty, is not proper  revolutionary practice.    From 1990 on, we have sadly observed an accelerated process  of deterioration within our ranks. Sound debate of ideological  principles and methods of struggle has been replaced by  irrational, willful imposition. We have been incapable of giving  its rightful place to a Sandinist Assembly that must be provided  with the proper instruments rather than strengthened as the  maximum authority between congresses.    Nor is it the right, the social democrats, radicals, or  moderates who must take the blame for the moral deterioration of  the party. Rather, it is the elements that stand in the way of  the search for solutions, believing that the party serves them,  who are responsible.    The method chosen in the attempt to discredit Sergio or any  other Sandinist is sad and condemnable. Nor must one be deceived  by the argument that (given his personality) one is merely  dealing with an outburst by Carlos Guadamuz. With his  personality and the radio, Guadamuz responds to partisan  interests rather than the interests of the FSLN. These methods  of struggle do more harm to those who promote them than to the  individual they target.    It is not by submissively and unthinkingly adhering to the  will of a leader, whoever he may be, that we shall help maintain  unity and define a political program that will bind us together  and move us forward.    To my way of thinking, Sergio made a terrible mistake by  accepting the post in the the National Leadership. At that first  Congress, he should have realized that the ticket would be  imposed and that as a result, the decision of majority of the  members of the National Leadership to cling to posts and  positions would drag him into an internal struggle (new for him)  rather than participation in a collective leadership. I also  believe it was a mistake to respond to the radio attacks. The  language, content, and their authors discredit them and render  them unworthy of any response.</p>

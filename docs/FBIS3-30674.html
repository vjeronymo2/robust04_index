The Czech Government approved the completion of Temelin, one  of the two Czech nuclear power stations, in March last year.  Two blocks with a total output of 2,000 megawatts are to be  added, and the power station is to start operating in 1996 or  1997, in order to obtain permission to operate in accordance  with Western European and U.S. norms.    Former Czech Premier Petr Pithart wrote to American  congressman Barney Frank in January saying that the government  had not taken into account the opinions of the inhabitants of  the area around Temelin and had not put the question of the  completion of Temelin for discussion in parliament. The present  government had also ignored the fact that no report had been  drawn up looking at the potential influence of Temelin on the  environment, Pithart added.    The first reactor of the other Czech nuclear power station  in  Dukovany, whose construction cost 25 billion Czech korunas Kc,  started operating in 1985. On the basis of the results of a  Czech and international technical audit, the operation of  Dukovany will probably be extended from the originally planned  20 years to 35 or 40, the usual period abroad. The Czech Energy  Works (CEZ) has a long-term investment programme costing Kc20  billion ($600,000,000) for the modernization of Dukovany and  further necessary additions.    One of the arguments of environmental initiatives against  nuclear power stations is the threat of accidents. Weight is  lent to the fears of environmentalists by the fact that there  have been three fires at Dukovany between 1991 and 1994.    The last of these incidents occurred on Thursday, when  trouble in the BT-02 branch transformer in the third block  caused a fire in the transformer shortly after seven in the  morning. By 9 o' clock [0800 GMT] the fire had been completely  put out. About 20 cubic meters of oil escaped from the  transformer, but did not manage to get outside the power  station. Preliminary estimates put the direct damages at Kc15  million ($500,000).    Another problem for nuclear power stations is the storage of  nuclear waste. By 1993 there will be 288 tonnes of spent  radioactive fuel stored in the Czech Republic, in the reactor  rooms of the Dukovany nuclear power station.    From when the first block of Dukovany went into operation in  1985 until the end of 1993 369 tonnes of highly radioactive  waste were produced. Of this, 141 tonnes are stored at the  Jaslovske Bohunice power station in Slovakia, but in 1995 it has  to start being brought back to the Czech Republic. The  remainder was in the past taken to the former Soviet Union.    The capacity of the tanks in Dukovany is 335 tonnes, and at  the end of 1995 they will be full. Therefore by the end of the  year the construction of intermediate storage facilities has to  be finished, to which spent fuel can be transferred from the  tanks.    Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy says that when  deciding on the location of the intermediate storage facilities,  it is important to provide both the public and the local  authorities with exhaustive information and technical details,  which is one way from emotions to an objective solution of this  sensitive problem.    The inhabitants of villages such as Horni Cerekev near  Pelhrimov in south Moravia, which lie in the vicinity of places  tipped for the possible construction of intermediate storage  facilities have, however, signed a petition expressing their  disagreement with the construction. The mayors and local  counselors of Pelhrimov, Jihlava, Zdar nad Sazavou, Kostelec u  Jihlavy, Kamenice nad Lipou and other communities have also  publicly disagreed with the construction.</p>

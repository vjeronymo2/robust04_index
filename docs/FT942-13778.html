			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Credit Agricole static at FFr5.3bn Credit Agricole, the French banking group, yesterday confirmed it had maintained net profits at FFr5.34bn (Dollars 905m) in 1993 against FFr5.23bn in 1992 in spite of the pressures on the banking industry. Mr Lucien Douroux, chairman, had previously indicated that the bank would make static profits for 1993. He said the group hoped this year to maintain its position and to be able to reduce the level of write-downs on its non-performing loans. Credit Agricole saw net banking income rise by 6.2 per cent to FFr69bn last year from FFr64.9bn in 1992. It succeeded in freezing operating costs at FFr37.1bn and increased operating profits by 14 per cent to FFr28.5bn from FFr25bn over the same period.</p>

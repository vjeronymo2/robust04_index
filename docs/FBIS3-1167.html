			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Inkatha Freedom Party national spokesman Ziba </F> Jiyane on the "Opinion" page]    [Text] Manufacturing the Bophuthatswana crisis was manna  from heaven for those believing the best means of dealing with  political opposition is to crush it. And target number 1 is, of  course, the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and kwaZulu government.  That this deluded thinking is on the agenda is evident from the  statement by Congress of South African Trade Unions [COSATU]  vice-president George Nkadimeng over the weekend. Speaking in  Durban, he said that if Bophuthatswana could overthrow Mangope:  "why can't we do it here?"    His rhetorical question should not be misunderstood -- ANC  [African National Congress] hardliners have always displayed a  callous disregard for the Queensbury rules of politics, and we  have no doubt there are plenty of likeminded militants in  kwaZulu/Natal who would welcome the opportunity to "concretise  their revolutionary fervor" through a repeat of Bophuthatswana.    The simple answer to Nkadimeng's question, however, is  "because it won't work" -- and this is not for want of trying.  Despite approximately 350 IFP office bearers having been  assassinated by the ANC, SACP [South African Communist Party]  and MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation, ANC military  wing] since they brought violence to the kwaZulu/Natal region;  despite the ready availability of arms and ammunition stockpiled  in caches around the region; despite safe havens in and  logistical support from the Transkei; despite roving MK hit  squads intimidating communities; despite the training of  thousands and thousands of cadres -- despite all these, kwaZulu  and the IFP are still here.    One should recall the attempt by the tripartite alliance in  1990 to have kwaZulu "disbanded." This tragic decision,  condemned by the Pan Africanist Congress, AZAPO [Azanian  People's Organization] and others, inevitably resulted in a  terrible bloodbath from which South Africa has never recovered.  Since disbanding kwaZulu "was somehow equated with destroying  the IFP countrywide, the campaign was initiated by calls to "the  people" to wipe the IFP off the face of the Reef.    That the East Rand is what it is today is directly  attributable to this savage display of intolerance and hunger  for power through the barrel of the gun. But kwaZulu and the  IFP are still here.    One should recall the alliance again reverting to its old  tricks, when, having failed to get its way at Codesa [Convention  for a Democratic South Africa], it embarked upon "mass action"  from June 1993 to force the government's compliance with the  ANC's negotiating demands.    The euphemism "mass action" included calls to overthrow a  number of administrations perceived as hostile --  Bophuthatswana, Ciskei and kwaZulu in particular. We all know  what happened at Bisho, but strangely enough, despite repeated  statements by the kwaZulu/Natal ANC leadership that the campaign  was still on in this region, in fact it never occurred. The  reason is that it was never possible, and the ANC was very aware  of the likely results of attempting it.    Where does that leave us now? Despite trying every trick in  the book to secure a weak and compliant IFP, the ANC is faced  with a powerful IFP and kwaZulu government sticking resolutely  to their principles -- which at present include the fact that we  will not be participating in elections unless certain  fundamental problems we have with the constitution are addressed.    But this presents a problem to the ANC and government which,  while stating publicly that our participation is essential,  privately believe there is no need to take our concerns  seriously enough to facilitate this through amending the  constitution.    Fearing the results of our possible non-participation  however, they are therefore seeking a means of securing their  interests while denying us ours by "levelling the playing field"  in the region in anticipation of our non-participation.    Earlier ANC suggestions -- such as that kwaZulu's budget be  unilaterally suspended -- to force our compliance are now being  replaced with the notion of TEC [Transitional Executive Council]  intervention and the deployment of a massive security force  presence to "minimise violence," despite the IFP having decided  that non-participation would be strictly peaceful and legal. In  terms of this scenario, following April 27, the kwaZulu  government will be replaced and the IFP will quietly get lost in  the political wilderness while Jacob Zuma and his merry band  take over.    The big question, of course, is whether this scenario is  realistic. Notwithstanding the avalanche mentality of the  deal-makers (nothing can stop the inevitable), there are good  grounds for believing that things will not be quite as simple as  this, and there would without doubt be a host of difficulties  associated with the imposition of a constitution and of a  government elected under it, neither of which reflect the  region's popular will.    It is this central fact that will frustrate any attempted  repeat of Bophuthatswana here, just as it has frustrated the ANC  in the past. That is why the overthrow of Ulundi is no more  than a pipe dream. Not only that, attempts to implement such a  policy would merely strengthen, rather than weaken the IFP's  hand, as the anti-democrats will be perceived for what they  really are -- political bullies of the nastiest type.    Our advertisement in last week's Sunday newspapers urged  people to "vote IFP when the time comes": We hope this is soon,  and if those parties comprising the Transitional Executive  Council were to devote more time to finding solutions to the  crisis rather than trying to ignore them or trying to create a  new crisis of vast proportions, then we could get on with the  task at hand -- holding elections for a non-racial and  democratic South Africa.    Bophuthatswana? Let me assure you, it will not happen in  kwaZulu/Natal.</p>

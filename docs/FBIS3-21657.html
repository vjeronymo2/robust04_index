Yahya, 37 years old and who had worked for the FELDA office  in Lok Heng Timur in the State of Johor, was sentenced to death  under Section 39B of the Dangerous Substances Act of 1952, as  amended in 1983.    He was arrested by police in possession of the marijuana,  which was discovered in a car in Kampung Tok Kamis, District of  Pasir Puteh [State of Kelantan], 40 kilometers from Kota Bharu  at about 1150 on 25 December 1989.    During the hearing of the case Yahya was represented by  Attorney Lua Kok Hiyong, and the prosecution was conducted by  Amiruddin Abdul Rahman, deputy public prosecutor (DPP).    When Ariffin Zakaria, the judge in the case, announced his  decision on the matter, he said: "The accused is found guilty as  charged and as proved, and the punishment for you is death."    Ariffin also ordered that the marijuana involved in this  case  should be destroyed.    When the sentence was handed down, Za'bah Hussein, Yahya's  33-year-old wife who was in the court at the time, screamed  continuously. When Yahya was led away from the bench of the  accused, Za'bah rushed forward and threw her arms around her  husband's neck, while continuing to sob. However, Yahya, the  father of three children, appeared calm. He only looked downcast  after he was led out of the courtroom when he saw one of his  children sitting on a bench outside.</p>

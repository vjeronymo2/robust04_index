			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> AF PILOT GETS JAIL FOR BIGAMY  </P> <P> An Air Force officer panel in San Francisco sentenced a veteran pilot to three  months in a military jail and dismissal from the service for his conviction on  bigamy charges. The panel ruled that Capt. Neil Clark must also give up three  months' pay, amounting to $8,600. In addition, because his dismissal will come  nine months shy of 20 years' service, Clark will lose his retirement benefits  and pension. Clark's attorneys contend that he was so driven by lust that he  entered into a bigamous marriage with an English woman in order to have sex  with her. Testimony indicated that the woman wanted to marry a U.S. citizen to  remain in this country.  </P></p>

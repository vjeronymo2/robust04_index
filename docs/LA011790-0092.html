			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. 'COUNTDOWN' RADIO TO DEBUT BACK IN THE U.S.S.R.  </P> <P> Soviet rock fans will soon be hearing more from the likes of Billy Joel, Phil  Collins, Janet Jackson and other American favorites. The producers of two pop  music "countdown" radio programs that compete in the United States said Tuesday  that they will begin broadcasting shows in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "USA Top 20," produced and distributed by Westwood One, will debut Feb. 9 and  air twice a month. It will be hosted by Stuart Detmer, a 26-year-old Chicago  native who lives in Moscow and speaks Russian fluently, said Norman J. Pattiz,  Westwood One chairman.  </P> <P> The program will be produced in Los Angeles then delivered to the Soviet Union  for translation and airing over government-owned Gosteleradio. Commercial  sponsorship will also be available on the show, with foreign companies running  ads during the 90-minute program, Pattiz said. Westwood One will produce two  other music programs, "America on Record" and "American Musical Classics," to  air in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "American Top 40," produced by ABC Radio and hosted by radio and television  personality Shadoe Stevens, will also be heard on Gosteleradio. The debut date  is not yet set but will be sometime before April 1, according to Tom Rounds,  president of Radio Express, which handles the program's international  distribution.  </P> <P> The program has been in continuous weekly production since 1970 in the United  States and is currently heard in 70 countries, Rounds said. No further details  about the Soviet version were available.  </P></p>

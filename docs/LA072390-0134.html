			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> STALLONE WANTS MORE DIALOGUE  </P> <P> Actor Sylvester Stallone says he will flex his brain more than his biceps in  films.  </P> <P> Stallone, 44, who rose to prominence with the original "Rocky" film about an  underdog fighter, said in this week's People magazine that audiences cannot  identify with the kind of super-hero he portrayed in "Rambo III."  </P> <P> "I recently saw 'Rambo III' again and recoiled at a scene where, strong and  invulnerable, I stood up there. I mean, I was so invincible, I had veins in my  hair. There I was, superhuman, with my gun obliterating everyone crossing my  path," Stallone said.  </P> <P> He said filmmakers need to place more emphasis on developing characters.  </P> <P> "Right now, we don't care about dialogue. We know it's just a boring interlude  before the action starts."  </P></p>

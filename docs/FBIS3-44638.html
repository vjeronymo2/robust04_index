What is the main topic of conversation in  today's China? Economics.    China's economy has been developing by leaps and bounds  since  late 1978 when the government decided to shift the focus of its  work on to economic construction. Today, as the situation  develops and the world changes, new content has been added to  the old topic. What exactly is the new content?    Firstly, following 15 years of practice and exploration,  China's economic structural reform is finally proceeding under a  clear objective model -- the socialist market economic  structure. The recent decision of the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China  outlines a blueprint for the new structure. The basic framework  of the blueprint consists of the following five links:    -- A modern enterprise system based mainly on public  ownership, and which allows the common development of diverse  economic sectors and complies with the requirements of a market  economy;    -- A unified national market system which is linked to the  international market and which allows free exchange of various  factors such as commodities and productive forces;    -- A macro-economic control system centered on economic and  legal means and necessary administrative measures;    -- An income distribution system based mainly on the  principle of "to each according to his work", and which gives  priority to efficiency while taking fairness into account; and    -- A multi-tiered social security system under which  essential daily necessities are provided to both urban and rural  residents.    This year, efforts will be made to increase the dynamics of  reform in these areas, press ahead with overall reform and  record breakthroughs in key areas. If certain factors in past  reforms were as analogically unclear, as if we were "groping  forward by feeling for stones to cross a river", then today we  have a clear view of the "opposite bank" and, indeed, have  already boarded a "ferry boat".    Secondly, further invigorating enterprises, controlling the  balance between aggregate supply and demand and implementing  industrial policies have brought about even brighter prospects  for us to launch the national economy into an orbit of  sustained, rapid and healthy development.    The fact that reform is also revolutionary and capable of  liberating productive forces has long been borne out in  practice. However, during the many years of economic  development, we have frequently faced threats and interference  from various factors such as "overheating", imbalance,  inflation, chaos and major fluctuations.    In 1993, China was once again subjected to such threats as  its economy entered a second year of rapid growth. Fortunately,  a series of banking control measures resolutely adopted by the  government almost immediately proved effective. Only then did  we appropriately cool the overheated economy, overcome chaotic  phenomenon and steadily bring about a second consecutive year  with a 13 percent rise in economic growth. The total volume of  imports and exports and the amount of introduced foreign capital  continued to increase by a large margin. These experiences  alone prove that so long as correct macro-control measures are  adopted to constantly maintain a balance, it is possible to  avoid major fluctuations and wide-ranging readjustments that  given situations demand. Experts predict that in order to  ensure favorable conditions for the adoption of many important  reform measures, it is appropriate to fix the economic growth  rate at around 9 percent.    Thirdly, since the end of the world pattern characterized by  bipolar political and military confrontation, the economy has  played an increasingly remarkable role in international  relationships. Although hegemonism and power politics continue  to exist, a multi- polar pattern taken shape against a  background of a contest of economic strength is developing, and  the principle of placing priority on the economy has become a  inevitable development trend in international exchanges. At a  time when many parts of the world are in the grips of economic  recession, a dynamic Asia, especially a China developing at the  fastest pace, has attracted extensive attention from the  international community, and has become the target in the shift  in the strategic focus of international economics. Numerous  countries have expressed great interest in China's vast market  and attractive investment environment, and one after another  have readjusted their policies toward China. A new "China  craze" has emerged.    The recent Sino-US Summit held during the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation Conference in Seattle reaffirmed the  importance of developing bilateral relations [on] the basis of  the three joint communiques, and the necessity to take the lead  in restoring high- level contacts, as a welcoming move. The  summit is expected to improve the cool Sino-US relationship, and  proceed to bring about a turn in world peace development.  Developing economic exchanges is essential for both sides, and  is in no way dependent upon only one side. Such exchanges  should be based on equality and mutual benefit, and not  considered as a favor from one side to the other. The foundation  for exchanges and cooperation is common interest, not identical  ideological and social systems. Therefore, seeking common  ground while reserving differences, and guaranteeing equality  and mutual benefit and non-interference in each other's internal  affairs are vitally important to improving the relationship.    We wish that friendship and cooperation between China and  various countries around the world will develop smoothly and  with greater results on the basis of the Five Principles of  Peaceful Coexistence in the coming new year.</p>

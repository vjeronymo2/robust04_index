			<p>BFN     [Text] In Granma Province, Politburo member Carlos Lage  stated that the country's efforts to find a solution to every  problem deriving from the collapse of the Socialist Bloc are  beginning to have results and to be reflected in some of the  branches of our economy. As an example of this, Lage mentioned  the tourism and oil extraction industries, which are going to  continue to grow. He went on to say that tobacco production must  be elevated starting with the current harvest and that  transformations are being made in citrus, cement, and shrimp  production.    Lage warned that the current year will be a difficult one  due  to the fact that the production level of the current sugar  harvest remains low and that the rest of the areas of income do  not compensate for this drop. He pointed out that such results  in the main industry are due to the lack of resources to secure  it. Lage went on to say that the functioning of the economy and  the life of the population will improve as we see a recovery in  production.    Lage underscored the importance of stopping the decline in  production and of producing more than in the past harvest, since  in the past years each harvest has been smaller. He underscored  that such an accomplishment would mark a turning point in the  economy.    Regarding the upcoming session of the National Assembly of  the People's Government [ANPP], Lage stated that specific  measures will not come out of those debates because to adopt  such measures requires a high level of instrumentation and  precision, which cannot be achieved in such a broad forum.    [Begin Lage recording] I would say that the assembly has  great importance because of the significance of the issue that  will be analyzed: the economy, something that is very important  and that at the moment is of great interest.    As everyone knows, we have an excess of currency which is  the  result of the (?decline) in production. This situation must be  rectified. We must balance the money that is circulating among  the population, and the money that is printed periodically, with  the offer of goods to the population.    This problem was originated by a policy of justice that the  revolution adopted in face of the situation that was created  with the collapse of the Socialist Bloc. In an attempt to level  the prices, so that people with higher incomes would not be the  only ones with access to goods, the revolution tried to  establish a more equitable distribution of goods. This  distribution was even more rationed than before, so that  everyone could have access to those goods. Now we hope to  rectify gradually the imbalance which has been created, as we  gradually recover our levels of production and the situation is  normalized.    To a certain extent, this assembly will also summarize the  process of the workers parliaments, the assemblies which  gathered all those opinions, and the meeting by the plenum of  the national committee of the Cuban Workers Federation. I would  say that the assembly will summarize that whole process.    Specific measures will not come out of that assembly. Those  measures require a level of instrumentation and precision that  cannot be obtained in a discussion among 500 people. Those  decisions must be taken by the leadership of the government. The  assembly should make recommendations. It should instruct the  government and make recommendations and explanations as to what  direction the government should take in making those decisions  so that in the following weeks we can begin to see the  progressive application of the measures that are finally adopted.    Therefore, I believe that the assembly that will be held on  1  May, will be very important and will be given extensive  coverage. [end recording]</p>

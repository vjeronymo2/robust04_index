			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Observer: Career paths If Marcus Davison, a 42-year-old banker, had hung around at National Westminster Bank as long as young Derek Wanless did, then he too might have stood a chance of being group chief executive of Britain's second biggest bank. However, Davison, like most of the more ambitious young graduates entering British banking in the early 1970s, was bitten by the international banking bug and therein lies a tale. Whereas Wanless, a contemporary of Davison's at NatWest, has risen farther and faster than anyone imagined, equally ambitious bankers such as Davison have kept on losing their commands. Davison's first port of call after NatWest was dear old Western American Bank, a casualty of the recession before last. He left before the ship went down but was less lucky last week when he lost his finance director's job after the the plug was pulled on DG Investment Bank. Can any reader beat Davison's unfortunate career record? All of the six banks he has worked for are now but a memory in the headhunters' files. The name plates of Davison's old employers such as European Asian Bank, European Banking Company, and Philadelphia National Limited, have long since disappeared. Indeed, Davison now wonders whether he should write to prospective employers asking them to make him a modest subscription in return for his promise never to darken their doors as an employee. With this sort of capital he should be able to start his own bank.</p>

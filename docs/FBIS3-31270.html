			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on a news conference by Slovak President Michal </F> Kovac at the Borik Hotel in Bratislava on 15 February by  correspondents Magda Pospisilova and Zuzana Stukovska; passages  within quotation marks recorded]    [Excerpts] [Announcer] Today, 365 days have passed since  the National Council [of the Slovak Republic--the Slovak  Parliament] elected the first president of the independent  Slovak Republic. On this occasion, Michal Kovac met journalists  at the Borik Hotel in Bratislava. Our editors Magda Pospisilova  and Zuzana Stukovska were at the news conference.    [Stukovska] As expected, the majority of questions asked by  journalists concerned Slovakia's internal political crisis.  Commenting on the current situation, the president said that it  might bring about a certain denouement, or at least a temporary  one. He expects that an agreement to call early parliamentary  elections will be reached. This might, according to Kovac, calm  our society to a certain extent. [passage omitted]    Because the 26th session of the National Council is to  resume  tomorrow [16 February], our colleague Magda Pospisilova asked  the following question:    [Pospisilova] Mr. President, if parliament passes a vote of  no-confidence in the coalition government and the HZDS [Movement  for a Democratic Slovakia] parliamentary group goes into  opposition, what conditions will you set for agreeing to lead  the Cabinet, or what are your criteria for selecting someone to  whom you would ask to form an interim government?    [Kovac] "There is no way I intend to lead the government.  This is out of question. As far as these criteria are  concerned, I want to hold talks with all representatives, above  all with HZDS representatives, to ask them to remain in  government and to propose somebody else [for the post of prime  minister]. I will concentrate my attention on this.    "If we fail to convince the HZDS representatives, following  an agreement with other representatives of parliamentary  political parties and movements, I will look for someone  prepared to be asked to form a government."    [Pospisilova] Journalists went on to ask: The foreign  minister, whose current position is extraordinary, is supposed  to accompany you on the planned visit to Austria. Do you think  the complications are accidental?    [Kovac] "I think that these things are not connected. I  firmly believe that, at the time when the visit is to take  place, the foreign minister will be able to accompany me."    [Pospisilova] Two early elections dates have been mentioned:  June and November 1994. Which of them is favored by the  president, and what sort of government should be ruling Slovakia  before the elections?    [Kovac] "With regard to the debate, I think that the  majority  of the parties favor November. I do not want to get involved in  this because this is really the business of the political  entities, but, on the basis of what I was able to find out so  far, I think that this [November] would be the optimal choice.  If a vote of no-confidence in the government was passed before  November, it would certainly be most suitable to have a broad  coalition government of all parliamentary parties and movements.  This government should prepare a number of bills that need to  be passed by the government." [passage omitted]    [Pospisilova] The next question is from Radiozurnal. Mr.  President, it is known that relations between Prime Minister  Klaus and President Havel are not ideal, but no one says that  their relationship could damage the state's interests. This  cannot be said about Slovakia. Do you think that relations will  be the same between Neuwirth and Carnogursky [both of the  Christian Democratic Party] or Weiss and Ftacnik [of the  Movement for a Democratic Left]?    [Kovac] "I do not know whether it will be, but, in any case,  it is a pity because the lack of proper relations between the  president and the prime minister can be negatively reflected in  internal policy and also in foreign policy. This depends on  personalities. To speak for myself, I have no pangs of  conscience. I feel no share of guilt for the state of this  relationship, and I do not know what I can do to improve it. I  do not seek controversy, I am not conceited, I am cooperative  and ready to cooperate. I am really vexed with this situation.  I do not know what I can do apart from resigning."    [Pospisilova] Have you received such an offer in the  interests of improving relations? President Kovac's reply to  this question was the last at this news conference.    [Kovac] "No, I have not, and I do not intend to resign  either. I was only mentioning it as a theoretical possibility,  but I do not think the situation requires it. I see it as my  duty to stay until the end, as long as my health allows me to do  so, because I am becoming convinced that it is necessary to have  patience, not to give up, to bring integrating and unifying  elements into our society. As long as I am even slightly  successful in this, it is my duty to continue in this policy."</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Senate, heeding pleas to give El Salvador's new president, Alfredo  Cristiani, "a chance to succeed," voted to boost aid to that country to $90  million for the coming year and remove restrictions on the money. Initially, on  a 67-33 vote, the lawmakers stripped from a $14.4-billion foreign aid bill a  Democratic-sponsored provision that would have cut the aid into three slices to  be sent at four-month intervals and would have given Congress what amounted to  veto power over the final installment. The Senate then approved, by an 82-12  vote, a substitute measure to increase the military aid from $85 million to $90  million. The Senate still has to complete work on the overall aid measure and  work out differences with the House before sending the bill on to President  Bush.  </P></p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Corporate sector deals another blow to bourses MORE bad news from the corporate sector dealt a fresh blow to bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT ended at its lowest level in five weeks, depressed by the Bundesbank's decision on Thursday not to lower interest rates and by yesterday's news that the steel group Klockner-Werke was seeking court protection from its creditors. The DAX index fell to a day's low of 1,462 but recovered slightly in late trading to finish down 18.47 at 1,476.01, a 3 per cent decline on the week. Turnover rose to DM4.9bn from DM4.2bn. There was no trading in Klockner-Werke shares which were suspended at DM58.50. Dr Glen Liddy, a German analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said the news highlighted the structural problems in the European steel industry  - overcapacity and depressed prices for products. The German steel makers, in particular, faced additional problems, he said, because they tended to be skewed towards supplying the domestic auto industry, which was also in difficulty. Other steel makers fell on the announcement: Thyssen dropped DM5.70 to DM149.60 and Preussag slipped DM6 to DM341.50. Deutsche Bank, which has already suffered this week from poor 10-month figures, shed a further DM14 to DM627.50 on the fact that it is the steel group's house bank. Viag, which has an indirect holding in Klockner, dipped DM14.50 to DM319.50. Daimler was supported by late news on Thursday that the European Fighter Aircraft project, in which the group has a 33 per cent stake, had been resuscitated. The stock closed DM5.20 lower at DM509.20, off the day's low of DM500.60. PARIS showed signs of year-end fatigue, as more players took up the view that the market was going nowhere in the short term. Pressure on the franc despite central bank intervention also worried the market. The CAC-40 index ended 10.78 lower at 1,758.70, down 1.3 per cent on the week, in turnover of FFr2bn. The day's losers included Elf, which fell another FFr10.30 to FFr329.20 and Saint-Gobain, which lost FFr13 to FFr503. Peugeot surprised with a FFr10 rise to FFr552. AMSTERDAM featured DSM and Akzo, while Hoogovens slipped Fl 2.40 to Fl 22.80 on news of Klockner-Werke's financial problems. The CBS Tendency index dropped 0.6 to 104.7, down 0.8 per cent on the week. DSM lost Fl 5.20 or 6.5 per cent to Fl 74.80 as foreign institutions switched into Akzo, up Fl 1.50 at Fl 136.50, on news that it had gained US approval for the sale there of its oral contraceptive. STOCKHOLM fell across the board as declines in Trelleborg and S-E Banken led the market slide. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 18.0 or 2 per cent to 883.1, but was up 2.2 per cent on the week, in turnover of SKr604m after SKr734m. Both stocks responded to news released after the close on Thursday that Trelleborg expected a pre-tax loss of SKr1.5bn in 1992 and S-E Banken needed a capital infusion in the near future. Trelleborg B shares fell SKr8.50 or 13 per cent to SKr57 and S-E Banken C unrestricted shares slipped SKr2 or 13 per cent to SKr13. S-E Banken restricted A shares dropped SKr3.50 or 26 per cent to SKr10. OSLO tumbled 3.4 per cent as profit-taking eroded almost half of Thursday's gains inspired by Norway's decision to float the crown. The all-share index fell 13.46 to 385.92, up 2.6 per cent on the week, in active turnover worth NKr764.5m. MILAN ended mixed as dealers squared positions ahead of the close of the final trading account of the year. The Comit index fell 2.67 to 422.81, hardly changed on the week, in turnover estimated at around Thursday's L148.3bn. Fiat recovered L16 to L3,946 after its recent weakness while Olivetti gained L20 to L1,750. The banking and insurance sector was weak, as San Paolo fell L130 to L10,400 and Mediobanca lost L120 to L12,310. ZURICH was supported by a decline in interest rates and a strong bond market. The Swiss Market Index rose 5.0 to 1,993.6, up 3 per cent on the week. Swiss Re advanced SFr40 to SFr2,610. The insurer announced that it had placed 16,000 new bearer shares and 125,000 participation certificates at current market prices following its capital increase. MADRID recovered from a weak opening on news of the Bank of Spain's cut in the reserve requirement for banks. The general index closed 0.12 higher at 212.33, up 0.3 per cent on the week, in low turnover of Pta12.9bn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- December 11                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open      10.30       11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1041.05    1040.89     1041.16    1042.75 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1114.77    1114.57     1112.97    1116.35  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00      14.00       15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1043.34    1043.23     1045.31    1044.03 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1118.52    1118.79     1119.61    1117.72  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Dec 10     Dec 9     Dec 8     Dec 7     Dec 4 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1049.63   1054.06   1051.12   1056.02   1052.78 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1123.58   1133.46   1135.64   1137.52   1133.53  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1045.58 ; 200 - 1120.06 Low/day: 100 - 1040.01  200 - 1112.96  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

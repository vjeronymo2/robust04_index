			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by All India Radio special correspondent B.I. </F> Saini]    [Text] The United States pushing for India signing the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] on agreeing to a regional  variant has for long been an irritant in the growth of relations  between the two countries. [sentence as heard] The American  attitude has been that full scope safeguards in the subcontinent  are necessary to ensure that tensions between India and Pakistan  do not erupt into war with the possibility of a nuclear  exchange. The American policy failed to recognize three vital  elements of the situation in South Asia.    If India had wanted to develop nuclear weapons capability,  it  would have done so right after the peaceful test at Pokhran in  1974. Secondly, Pakistan has been clandestinely developing  nuclear weapons capability even when claiming that it does not  have any nuclear bombs. Another crucial aspect ignored or not  given due weight by the American policymakers was that India's  security concerns were not confined to the threat from Pakistan  alone.    The Clinton Administration's latest report to the U.S.  Congress on progress toward regional nonproliferation in South  Asia, which came just on the eve of the prime minister's visit,  is in a way a step forward from earlier reports. It recognizes  that while dealing with weapons proliferation in South Asia, the  United States and others have to take into account regional  security threat perceptions, including those extending beyond  India and Pakistan. The report indicates adoption of a more  realistic attitude by the United States toward the objectives of  stopping the proliferation of nuclear and other mass destruction  weapons in South Asia. But, so far as the question of supply of  more weapons and equipment like F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan is  concerned, the United States is still sticking to its earlier  plan to give these aircraft to Islamabad in return for capping  of Pakistan's nuclear program. It fails to recognize that  supply of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan is only going to trigger off  an arms race in the subcontinent. So far as India is concerned,  it has made abundantly clear in the past that it will not sign  the NPT, as it is discriminatory. It seeks to divide the world  into nuclear haves and have-nots. The Clinton Administration  report indicates that there is scope for India and the United  States discussing the NPT issue further so that differences in  their perceptions can be narrowed down. In any case, the  Narasimaha Rao-Clinton talks on Thursday will enable the two  leaders to see each other's viewpoint more clearly.</p>

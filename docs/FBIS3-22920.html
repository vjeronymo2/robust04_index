He said that "the West should take this threat seriously"  and  that the SRP would carry out its threats regardless of the  Serbian Interior Ministry's reaction.    Vucinic stressed that SRP members in Frankfurt were ready to  "launch terrorist attacks on the German people" if air strikes  were launched against Bosnian Serb positions.

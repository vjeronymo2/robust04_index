			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Letter: EMS requires change - but not burial Sir, I wholeheartedly agree with almost all of what the 'MIT Six' say in their article, 'Why the EMS deserves an early burial' (Personal View, July 29). However, I don't believe that it is necessary to scrap completely the exchange rate mechanism. In the June issue of Lloyds Bank Economic Bulletin, I set out a proposal for ERM reform, which would change the system into a much more flexible one, based on central rates which are reassessed regularly, perhaps by the new European Monetary Institution, to ensure that they have not moved out of line with economic fundamentals. Theory suggests, for instance, that German reunification required an appreciation of the D-Mark. The Bundesbank apparently pushed for this as early as 1989, but it was resisted by other ERM members. In the absence of a D-Mark realignment, the relative price shift required for a real appreciation could only be achieved by prices in Germany rising faster than those elsewhere. Because the Bundesbank was, perhaps understandably, not willing to allow a surge in German inflation, the result has been disinflation elsewhere. In a system where central rates were determined by reference to what was required for economic equilibrium, such deflationary pressure would not arise; the D-Mark would have been realigned to take account of the effect of reunification. It is only by reform that the ERM will survive. Furthermore, I would argue that reform is essential to allow progress towards a single currency. We see in the latest German interest rate move confirmation that the Bundesbank continues to put domestic considerations first. While understandable, it makes it even less likely that the ERM will survive in its current form. But that would be a good thing.

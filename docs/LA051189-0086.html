			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-'TODAY' PRODUCER QUITS TINKER'S FIRM  </P> <P> Steve Friedman, the brash "Today" show producer whom Grant Tinker lured from  NBC in 1987 to create the TV version of the USA Today newspaper, said Wednesday  he's quitting Tinker's company on May 29.  </P> <P> While the announcement was a surprise -- Friedman's contract runs through  September, 1990 -- both he and Tinker, the former chairman of NBC, emphasized  in interviews that the parting is amicable. They said it was prompted by the  desire of Friedman, 42, to produce shows, but not to have to sell them to  sponsors and networks.  </P> <P> Friedman has been president of GTG East, the New York branch of the Culver  City-based GTG Entertainment production company that Tinker founded with media  giant Gannett Co. after leaving NBC. Tinker said no decision has been made on  Friedman's successor.  </P> <P> Responsible at GTG for creating what are known in the TV industry as  "reality-based" programs, Friedman was the first executive producer of what now  is "USA Today on TV." The show was critically drubbed when it premiered last  September after $40 million in start-up costs.  </P> <P> The syndicated series has been revamped several times and is on its third  executive producer. It has been renewed for a second season.  </P> <P> There has been speculation that Friedman might return to NBC, where for seven  years he was executive producer of the "Today" show and engineered its rise  from second to first in the network morning-show ratings. But he said he has  had no talks with officials of NBC or any other network and has no immediate  plans. JAY SHARBUTT  </P></p>

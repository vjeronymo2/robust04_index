			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: NOVELIST SPREADS HIS WORD VIA THE SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS  </P> <P> Michael Marx says he takes inspiration from Thomas Paine and Ayn Rand. Also,  Fuller Brush and the Avon Lady.  </P> <P> Marx, 38, is selling novels door-to-door. His own, self-published novels: "A  War Ends" and "Eric Greenfield -- Middle American."  </P> <P> He spends the early mornings writing in his sunny condominium in Cardiff,  overlooking San Elijo Lagoon. Then he hits the streets in search of sales.  </P> <P> It's his way of avoiding the runaround of agents, editors and publishers. The  do-it-yourself mode also fits his views on liberty and individualism.  </P> <P> "Eric Greenfield" is filled with characters like Bella Absurd, George  MustGovern, Shirley Mindslame, Eldridge Believer and Gov. Jerry Zen (Hash)  Brownie. One of Marx's unpublished novels is titled "The Individualist."  </P> <P> He knocked on my door in Encinitas on a cold call. In early 1978, when he was  living in Los Angeles, he went unknowingly to the home of a Times feature  writer.  </P> <P> The Times did a story ("A Novelist for Whom the Doorbells Toll") and then so  did the Associated Press, CBS, NBC, National Public Radio and assorted  newspapers and radio stations.  </P> <P> In 1980, he moved to New York. He drove a cab to earn money to publish "Eric  Greenfield." He sold books to people in his cab and was featured on CNN.  </P> <P> Two years ago, he decided to move to San Diego County and, sight unseen, picked  Cardiff as his destination.  </P> <P> "I just loved the sound of it: Michael Marx, novelist, Cardiff-by-the-Sea," he  said.  </P> <P> He has asked Donald Trump, William F. Buckley, H. Ross Perot and Ted Turner for  help in publishing "The Individualist." No takers, yet.  </P> <P> He is divorced and lives frugally with his 2-year-old Samoyed named Gus. Marx  reads Nietzsche. He says he makes enough money to pay his rent.  </P> <P> His novels sell for $13.95 each, $25 a pair. He says that's a bargain.  </P> <P> "How often can you a buy a signed first-edition from a novelist who comes to  your door?"  </P> <P> On Top of Things  </P> <P> It says here.  </P> <P> * Working in the rain.  </P> <P> When prisoners on the 6th floor of the county building in El Cajon stop up the  toilets, it sprinkles in the 5th floor offices of the Probation Department.  Happens all the time.  </P> <P> County building inspectors say it can't be fixed.  </P> <P> * Contractions are the latest in San Diego surfer lingo.  </P> <P> As in, "That wave is to-nar." Totally gnarly. And, "Man was that a cho-nus  ride." Choice &amp; bonus.  </P> <P> There's more but it's off-color.  </P> <P> * The Post Office delivered an envelope to San Diego City Hall for "Ms. Dianne  Feinstein, Mayor's Office, San Diego."  </P> <P> Inside was a letter addressed to Atty. Gen. John Van De Kamp blasting him for  favoring the abortion pill RU486. Sent from Pasadena's Committee for Christian  Action.  </P> <P> Go figure.  </P> <P> * Ads for the May 20 benefit run/walk for the San Diego Council on Literacy ask  if anyone is interested in becoming a "literarcy volunteer."  </P> <P> Putting the Lid on a Bargain  </P> <P> It didn't rank with the art theft of Boston.  </P> <P> But the recent heist of outdoor decorations at a senior-citizens' apartment  building in Alpine left residents plenty miffed.  </P> <P> And demanding maximum prosecution.  </P> <P> Swiped were: two ceramic deers, four ceramic ducks, a wooden goose, a clay pot  that looks like an owl, a ceramic sea gull, a welcome sign, a wooden mobile, a  watering can, wind chimes, a miniature house and assorted plaques.  </P> <P> The stuff has now been found: In a car driven by 28-year-old San Diego man.  </P> <P> He was stopped in "downtown" Alpine about 2 a.m. and arrested for possession of  methamphetamine. The lawn loot was spotted and six petty theft charges are  pending.  </P> <P> Sheriff's detectives say the stuff was bound for swap meets in San Diego, where  bargain-hunters are always looking for a good pink flamingo, no questions  asked.  </P></p>

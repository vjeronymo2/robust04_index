			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Gilts sale confounds pessimists THE government raised Pounds 3.25bn at its latest gilts auction yesterday, as conviction that interest rates need to fall further and inflation will remain low attracted strong demand. The amount raised, through offering 7 per cent stock maturing in 2001, matched the record sum achieved only four weeks ago and takes the government halfway through its borrowing programme only four months into the financial year. The cover - the ratio of bids to offers - at the Bank of England's auction was 2.29, confounding pessimists who had expected a cover between only one and two times. More significantly, bidding was so tight that there was no difference between the average accepted price of 97.06, giving a yield of 7.46 per cent, and the lowest accepted bid price. Mr Roger Bootle, economist with Midland Global Markets, said: 'The auction went incredibly well. There was a worry that it could be a flop because the maturity was a bit odd but the CBI survey and the news from Europe could not have come at a better time.' Underlying gilt prices jumped sharply, with stock comparable to the auction issue rising  3/4 point. In the more liquid futures market, the 10-year contract for September delivery shot up more than a percentage point before investors started profit-taking. Market analysts initially were worried about demand because of the seemingly strange choice of maturity. Stock expiring in eight years does not have a natural investor target as UK banks and building societies prefer gilts expiring in three years, while overseas buyers favour 10-year maturities which fit well with their own 10-year benchmark bonds. UK pension funds favour very long-dated maturities, such as the 2017 stock, to match their liabilities. The CBI quarterly regional survey, published on Tuesday, called for a further cut in base rates to kick-start an economy which is still bumping along the bottom. Its appeal received further impetus from the recent turmoil within the European exchange rate mechanism, which has prompted growing conviction that continental rates have to fall further if the ERM is to survive and are bound to be cut if the ERM crumbles. The gilts auction was also helped by news that the Bundesbank eased its repurchase agreement rate, paving the way for a probable cut in its official discount rate today. Capital markets, Page 26</p>

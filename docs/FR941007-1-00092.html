These institutions serve solely as correspondent banks,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or as trust companies, or as clearing agents, and they do not extend credit to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the public for their own account. The OCC concludes that the CRA is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to cover these institutions. It is the purpose of the CRA to require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OCC to encourage banks to meet the credit needs of their local communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To this end, the OCC must assess banks' records of performance and take those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records into account in acting on certain applications affecting the banks. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OCC believes that these provisions were intended to cover all banks that are in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the business of extending credit to the public, including both wholesale and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retail banks. The lending activities of these banks affect the economic health of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the communities in which they are chartered. However, the OCC believes it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be pointless to encourage or to assess the credit granting record of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions that are not organized to grant credit to the public in the ordinary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> course of business, other than as an incident to their specialized operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the term national bank as used in this part does not include banks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that engage solely in correspondent banking business, trust company business,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or acting as a clearing agent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

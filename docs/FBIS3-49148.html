Under the draft budget, the amount allocated for subsidies to  agricultural credits is to be increased by nearly 70 percent as  compared with 1993. Cheap credits are to be granted to farmers  for the purchase of fertilizers, pesticides, seeds and for other  expenses facilitating the reconstruction of agricultural  production.    The upgrading of farms and the food processing sector is to  be supported by the agency for the restructuring and  modernization of agriculture in line with a law adopted by the  Sejm. Funds at the agency's disposal are to come from budget  subsidies, interests on bank reserves and repayments of credits  granted by the agency's predecessor -- the fund for agricultural  restructuring and debt-rescheduling. Some 1.2 trillion zlotys  (47 million USd) from a World Bank loan are to be earmarked for  the development of countryside infrastructure.</p>

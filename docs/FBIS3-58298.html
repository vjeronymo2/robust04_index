			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In the view of Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto, the  possible acceptance of NATO's Partnership for Peace offer does  not mean entering into a military alliance, nor does it affect  Finland's neutrality. Haavisto said in Kuopio today, that the  matter is not yet connected to neutrality, and the treaty will  not endanger Finland's neutrality. Haavisto thinks that the  Partnership for Peace idea is a positive solution because it  strengthens security in Europe, and in that sense it is in line  with Finland's basic aims. According to Haavisto, it is then a  different matter whether the treaty in general is a sensible  thing for Finland.    This afternoon it will be reported in Finland what timetable  will be adhered to when the decision on the offer is to be made.  According to Haavisto, the Foreign Affairs Committee will  discuss the Partnership for Peace for the first time this week.</p>

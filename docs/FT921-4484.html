			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / World Trade News: US chipmakers fear failure for pact with Japan - Executives' frustration is growing at lack of progress in market opening THE US-Japanese semiconductor trade agreement, signed last June, 'is on the threshold of failure,' says a US semiconductor industry report to be presented to President Bush this week. The report, Heading Toward Crisis, reflects the frustration among executives at the lack of progress in opening the Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.3bn) Japanese chip market to foreign suppliers. Weary of a decade-long trade battle, US chip makers are gathering in Washington this week to press the Bush administration to take a tougher stand. The 1991 US-Japan accord, the second semiconductor trade pact between the two countries, specified a 20 per cent foreign market share be established in Japan by the end of this year. But for the past two years, the foreign share of the Japanese market has remained virtually stagnant at about 14 per cent, the US chipmakers say. 'To avoid the increased trade friction that will inevitably result from failure to achieve the semiconductor agreement's objectives, the industries and governments must take immediate and decisive action,' the report states. 'The US government should (also) begin considering what additional actions are appropriate if foreign market share does not substantially increase.' What those actions should be 'is up to the government,' say the executives. While they stop short of urging economic sanctions, there is no doubt these would be sought if rapid improvement fails to occur in market access. US industry anger over the Japanese chip trade imbalance has been worsened recently by concerns that Japanese semiconductor producers may again be dumping memory chips at below-cost prices in the US and third-country markets. Dumping was the issue that ignited the US-Japanese 'chip wars' in the early 1980s. US semiconductor makers are now alarmed by a sharp fall in the prices of memory chips produced in Japan and Korea. Several US companies are gathering data, ahead of a possible dumping suit. The row is coming to a head when the Japanese chip market is in a decline. Sales of semiconductor devices in Japan fell 6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1991. Japanese officials say the recent dip in chip imports reflects market conditions. But they have said in the past that fast growth in the Japanese market explained small rises in foreign market share. 'If foreign share cannot increase in fast growth times, and cannot increase in slow growth times, when can it improve?' the US industry asks. 'The American industry has heard ample excuses. What Japan and America need now is results.' The US chipmakers expect a mixed reception in Washington this week. While they have support in Congress, the industry is becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the Bush administration. They are critical of Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, who, some charge, is 'more interested in potato chips than semiconductor chips'. The US industry is set to make its battle an issue in the presidential election campaign and has sponsored a national poll on trade and competitiveness issues. The results, to be announced this week, suggest heavy support for stronger government action on behalf of US high-technology industries. Asked if penalties were justified against countries agreeing to open their markets to US products, then failing to, 73 per cent said 'Yes'. Support for economic sanctions stayed firm (67 per cent), even if that meant paying higher prices for some consumer products. Some 73 per cent were dissatisfied with Japan's response to trade issues raised by the US. By stressing their role in the US electronics industry, the US's biggest industrial employer, chipmakers aim to raise support to pave the way for possible sanctions against Japan.</p>

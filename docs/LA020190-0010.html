			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> IS BEGGING PROTECTED SPEECH OR A BLIGHT ON PUBLIC SPACE?  </P> <P> Just when you think no new folly can make city life more menacing, some moral  exhibitionist, wielding judicial power and reeking of liberal self-approval,  makes matters worse. Meet Judge Leonard Sand.  </P> <P> He recently ruled that the ban on panhandling in New York City's subway  stations violates the First Amendment because begging is "informative and  persuasive speech." This latest trauma to the First Amendment suggests that any  peaceful (although intrusive, annoying and even coercive) conduct that is  accompanied by speech is constitutionally protected. This is especially so,  says Sand with a flourish of sentimentality, if the speaker is among the  unwashed.  </P> <P> First Amendment rights do not vary inversely with the affluence of individuals.  There is nothing novel about "time, place and manner" restrictions on speech  (e.g., no sound trucks near hospitals). Yet the city's attempt to limit one of  the unpleasant, even alarming, experiences of subway travel is deemed  unconstitutional.  </P> <P> The question of what society owes in compassionate help to street people is,  surely, severable from the question of what right the community has to protect  a minimally civilized ambience in public spaces. However, that second question  is rarely even reached because all today's controversies are cast as conflicts  between individual rights and a cold, alien government.  </P> <P> The community, dismissed as a fiction without standing, deteriorates through  the "broken window" dynamic. James Q. Wilson of UCLA says that if a broken  window in a building goes unrepaired, the remaining windows will be broken,  because an unrepaired window sends a message that no one cares. Disorder and  crime are linked in a developmental sequence. Disorder atomizes communities,  dissolving the sense of mutual regard and obligations of civility.  </P> <P> Beggars -- many of them deranged by alcohol or other drugs or mental illness,  and dangerous in fact or appearance -- are human "broken windows." But in the  social analysis spawned by liberalism, the individual is the only reality and  the community is an abstraction without claims. Judges like Sand are dangerous  -- physically dangerous -- because their actions feed the anarchic impulse  toward violent self-help. Harried, frightened citizens have begun assaulting,  in one instance killing, beggars who, in an atmosphere of pervasive menace,  are, or appear to nervous people as, dangerous.  </P></p>

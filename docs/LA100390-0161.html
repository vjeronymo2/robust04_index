			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN DOING WORK ON DISNEYLAND RIDE IS CRITICALLY INJURED IN FALL  </P> <P> A 40-year-old La Habra man doing repair work on Disneyland's Pirates of the  Caribbean ride Tuesday morning was critically injured when he fell 40 feet from  a scaffold onto a concrete floor.  </P> <P> Jesse Brooks was in critical condition in the intensive-care unit at UCI  Medical Center in Orange with fractured ribs and internal injuries, hospital  spokeswoman Fran Tardiff said.  </P> <P> Brooks, an employee of Western Air and Refrigeration, was working on the  air-conditioning system for the ride when the accident occurred shortly after  8:30 a.m., Disneyland spokesman John McClintock said.  </P> <P> Brooks "was spanning the rafters (scaffolding), jumping across from one to the  other, and he didn't make it," said Anaheim Fire Capt. Craig Watson, who  treated Brooks at the scene.  </P> <P> Watson said Brooks was installing a new air-conditioning and ventilation system  in an area behind a colorful stage front that portrays a battle between two  pirate ships and a scene of pirates raiding a village.  </P> <P> "He was able to break his fall somewhat and escape a serious head injury,"  Watson said. "There were piles of scenery and supports below, so he was able to  grab, slip, grab, slip . . . before he landed on his side."  </P> <P> The popular ride was shut down about a month ago for annual maintenance and  will remain closed for several more weeks as work continues, McClintock said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Pauley's Exit at 'Today': Jane Pauley's last day as co-host on "Today" will be  Friday, Dec. 29. The early-morning show is planning an on-air tribute to  Pauley, but details still need to be worked out. Deborah Norville takes over in  the job Jan. 8, and, for the interim week, NBC is bringing on several former  "Today" hosts to share the couch with Bryant Gumbel. Tom Brokaw, who was host  of "Today" when Pauley joined the show in 1976, will join Hugh Downs and  sportscaster Joe Garagiola as fill-in co-hosts. Shauna Snow  </P></p>

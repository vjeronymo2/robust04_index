			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Smoking Verdict Upheld: A Mississippi judge affirmed the controversial verdict  in Horton vs.  </P> <P> American Tobacco, a key smoker death case. Jurors last month found American  liable for the lung cancer death of Nathan Horton, but awarded zero damages to  his family. Tobacco lawyers asked Mississippi Circuit Judge Eugene Bogen to  rule that American wasn't liable; plaintiff attorneys asked him to award  damages or set a new trial on damages alone. Bogen refused to alter the result.  </P></p>

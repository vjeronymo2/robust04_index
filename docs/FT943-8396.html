			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Norcen to buy rest of oil offshoot Norcen Energy Resources, a Canadian oil and gas group, said it would bid CDollars 13.25 per share for the 47.6 per cent stake in North Canadian Oils that it does not already own, Reuter reports from Calgary. The total purchase price would be CDollars 233.83m (USDollars 169m). Norcen now owns about 19.42m shares of North Canadian, or 52.4 per cent of the company's outstanding shares. The bid is conditional on Norcen receiving at least 90 per cent of the North Canadian shares it does not already own, the company said. Trading in North Canadian shares was halted yesterday with the price standing at CDollars 10.75. The purchase of the remaining shares would be financed by a line of credit arranged with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and existing credit lines, Norcen said. The debt incurred in the purchase is intended to be retired during the next 12 months from proceeds of sales of non-core assets which are planned or under way, the company said. 'The offer will provide a significant premium over recent North Canadian market prices and, we believe, fairly reflects underlying asset values,' said Mr Edward Battle, Norcen chairman. The company said that it has retained the services of RBC Dominion Securities for advice and to form a group to solicit acceptances of the offer. Norcen purchased its 52.4 per cent stake in North Canadian in 1993, and has amalgamated the oil and natural gas pro-ducing operations of North Canadian into its own operations.</p>

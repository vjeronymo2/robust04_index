			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Qu Zhihong (2575 1807 4767)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- On the 52nd anniversary  of the delivery of "Mao Zedong's talks at the Yanan Forum on  Literature and Art," the Press and Publication Administration  invited some Beijing writers, scholars, and personages from the  publication sector to a discussion centered around the theme of  "Inspiring People With Works of Excellence." Participants  reviewed the spirit of Mao Zedong's "talks," and explored ways  in which to carry out the task of "inspiring people with works  of excellence," which was proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin. They  also suggested ways and means for improving publication-related  work.    Yu Youxian, director of the Press and Publication  Administration, said at the meeting: Although different eras  have different requirements on the contents of works of  excellence, the orientation of "serving the people and  socialism" pointed out to literary and art workers by Comrade  Mao Zedong more than half a century ago, and the principle of  "letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of  thought contend" later proposed by him, still form the basic  demand we set on the production of intellectual products today,  as well as an important guarantee for promoting a flourishing  publication industry. Yu Youxian said: Large numbers of good,  widely-circulated books were produced during each of the  historical periods following the founding of New China. These  works played a huge and irreplaceable role in elevating the  masses' realm of thought, in inspiring the masses to unite and  struggle, in promoting social progress, and in promoting reform  and opening up. Yu Youxian said: As a publication  administration organ, we consider it our main task to vigorously  organize the publication, promotion, and distribution of  excellent books.    Participants of the meeting stated their views on the  current  book markets, which face many problems. Dong Xiuyu [5516 4423  3768], editor-in-chief of the Joint Publishing Company, said: I  often came across things which were in a mess but still put on  display in public when I browsed in bookstores on the streets.  As a member of the publication work force, I feel very uneasy  about this. We should produce more and better works of  excellence to corner markets and to satisfy the needs of the  broad masses of people. These are the responsibility and duty we  must face.    Ren Jiyu, curator of the National Library, believed that we  should pay special attention to young people in our creative  undertakings and publications. Nowadays, young students know  very little about the cultural and historical figures of their  country, but the future of our country and people rests on them.  We will face very serious consequences if we fail to solve this  problem.</p>

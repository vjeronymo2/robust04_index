Statistics of the Epidemiology Division,  Ministry of Public Health, show that as of 31 August 1993, there  were 3,000 people with full-blown cases of AIDS and 2,623 with  AIDS-related symptoms. A total of 510 people have died. Of those  with AIDS, 259 are children in the 0 to 14 age group. Most of  these contracted the virus from their mother. [passage omitted]    Some people have predicted that by the year 2000,  approximately 80,000 children will have AIDS. As of today, there  is no cure for this disease. Thus, prevention is at the heart of  controlling the spread of this disease. [passage omitted]    Dr. Wimon Siriwathin, an obstetrician at the Ratchawithi  Hospital, said that a report from Mahidol University predicts  that this year, there will be 136,532 cases of AIDS in women  between the ages of 15 and 49. And from monitoring the incidence  of AIDS in pregnant women, the Epidemiology Division has found  that three northern provinces have the highest number of  pregnant women with AIDS. The Ratchawithi Hospital, which has  one of the largest obstetrics departments in Bangkok, has found  that the number of pregnant women with AIDS is increasing  rapidly. During the first 6 months of this year, 145 pregnant  women, or 1.52 percent of the 9,644 women who gave birth, were  found to have the AIDS virus. Most of these women were between  the ages of 17 and 31.    Besides this, Dr. Usa Thitsayakon, a pediatrician at the  Chulalongkorn Hospital, said that studies conducted at the  Chulalongkorn Hospital have shown that most of the children with  AIDS contracted the disease from their mother. And most of the  women contracted the disease from their husbands, who used the  services of prostitutes. The study also showed that the rate of  infection from mother to child is 33.3 percent.</p>

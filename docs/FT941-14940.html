			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / People: Forte Forte has appointed Patrick Copeland as group director of its hotels. Copeland, 49, begins work immediately, but his first task will be to help his new employers buy additional hotels rather than run the ones they have. Forte is in the midst of an attempt to acquire the right to manage the Italian-based Ciga group of luxury hotels. The negotiations are at a delicate stage; Forte has teamed up with George Soros's Quantum Fund in an attempt to conclude the deal. Copeland's position does not give him a seat on the main board. He joins an operational committee, the hotels and restaurants board, on which Rocco Forte, the group chairman, also sits. Before joining Forte, Copeland was president of Cinema International Corporation, the international film distribution and marketing joint venture owned by MCA/Universal and Paramount Studios. He spent much of his career with Grand Metropolitan, including a spell as chief executive of Intercontinental Hotels Worldwide, and replaces Alan Hearn, who becomes group director, operations.</p>

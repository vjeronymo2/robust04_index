			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Hungary risks sell-off fury The Hungarian government's credibility with foreign investors was on the line last night as reformers and foreign advisers sought to persuade socialist ministers to complete plans to sell the last state-owned hotel chain to foreign investors. Senior ministers in the socialist-liberal coalition government have been pressing for the state to ignore an international tender for the 15 properties owned by HungarHotels and transfer the assets to the cash-strapped state social security fund. Mr Ferenc Bartha, the privatisation commissioner, told an FT investment conference here that he hoped for a 'positive' decision at a meeting on the sale today which would allow one of the three shortlisted foreign bidders to continue purchase negotiations. The top contenders for the group which owns some of the country's prime tourist hotels are American General Hospitality, a privately owned US group, and Intercontinental, the Japanese owned international hotel chain.</p>

This amendment modifies the minimum mesh-size requirement, the schedule for establishing the annual recreational fishery management measures, and the dimensions of the fish box or tote; provides for an experimental fishery; and prohibits the use of twisted mesh and interference with observers and sea samplers. The intended effects are to minimize the effects of regulatory restrictions on industry, and to use the best available data to assess the fishery, without compromising the FMP objective to rebuild the stocks of summer flounder.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Sections 625.8(a)(6) and (a)(7), the removal of paragraph (c) of &sect;625.24, the redesignation of paragraphs (d) and (e) of &sect;625.24 as paragraphs (c) and (d), &sect;625.24(f), and &sect;625.25(d) are effective May 31, 1994.

A proposed rule to implement the amendment was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 23, 1994 (59 FR 8592). Copies of the amendment are available from the Council upon request (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The amendment revises management of the summer flounder ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Paralichthys dentatus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) fishery pursuant to the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, as amended (Magnuson Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background concerning the development of the management measures contained in Amendment 6 and the reasons they were adopted by the Council were provided in the preamble of the proposed rule and are not repeated here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS approved Amendment 6, which allows vessel operators to: (1) Carry nets with different size mesh on board their vessels; and (2) exceed the minimum-mesh seasonal summer flounder threshold amounts, as long as all nets that do not meet the minimum-mesh requirement are appropriately stowed once the threshold amounts of summer flounder are retained. Once stowed, these nets cannot be used for the remainder of the fishing trip.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS is also implementing a regulation that allows the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), to authorize an experimental fishery to collect management information in certain circumstances to give effect to section 9.4.2 of the FMP regarding information and data needs. The Council is particularly interested in having additional mesh studies conducted to augment the results of the mesh studies done in New York and New Jersey. However, the Council was firm in its intent that no experimental fishery should result in a quota being exceeded. This restriction maintains the integrity of the mortality reduction schedule for summer flounder, the main objective of Amendment 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule also implements a prohibition on the use of twisted mesh. Nets constructed of twisted mesh, when towed, do not conform to the minimum-mesh requirement and violate the prohibition found at &sect;625.8(a)(6). The addition of this prohibition conforms the summer flounder regulations with the Northeast multispecies regulations found at 50 CFR part 651. Such conformity is desirable since multispecies and summer flounder can be caught on the same fishing trip. The Council adopted another provision that is also implemented in this final rule which modifies the dimensions of the fish box or tote, referred to in &sect;625.25(d), to conform to those used in the Northeast multispecies regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule revises the prohibition found at &sect;625.8(c)(9) to prohibit interference with a sea sampler or observer on board a vessel for any purpose, and not just for the activities under &sect;&sect;625.26 and 625.27, as currently expressed in this prohibition. Observers placed on board a vessel engaged in an experimental fishery should have the same protection afforded to other observers and sea samplers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS is also modifying the annual fishing measures schedule found at &sect;625.20(c). The date on which recreational fishing measures are to be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is changed to February 15 to allow recreational fishery data from the previous year to be included in the assessment and monitoring process. The total allowable removals from the stock, which are translated into a coastwide commercial quota and a recreational harvest limit, as well as additional measures for the commercial fishery, must be published on or before October 15 of each year. This is the latest date that these measures can be announced in the form of a proposed rule or a proposed specification and still allow the states an opportunity to implement them on January 1 of each year. Marine recreational survey data, which allow the recreational harvest limit to be converted into a possession limit and a recreational fishing season, are not available until late each calendar year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

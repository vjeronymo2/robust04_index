			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> TOWNHOUSE LOTTERY DELAYED  </P> <P> Citing failure to run a required legal notice, Rancho Palos Verdes and E. S.  Development postponed for two weeks a lottery for 10 so-called affordable  townhouses in the 49-unit Villa Capri development.  </P> <P> The drawing, originally scheduled for last Monday, will be held Jan. 30 at 6  p.m. at Hesse Park, 29301 Hawthorne Blvd.  </P> <P> The deadline for applying for the units -- with more than 2,100 people already  in the running -- has been extended through Wednesday. Lottery numbers already  assigned to contenders remain the same, according to the city. Applicants need  not be present at the drawing. Priority is being given to Rancho Palos Verdes  residents with annual incomes of about $60,000.  </P> <P> The "affordable" units sell for $140,000, while the remaining units are going  for more than $400,000.  </P> <P> Katie Pitcher, city public information officer, said the lottery was postponed  by the developer after it was discovered that the required legal notice of the  affordable housing agreement with the city had not been published. She said the  notice is necessary to protect the city and developer from a legal challenge to  the affordable housing program, which the city required when it approved the  development more than two years ago.  </P></p>

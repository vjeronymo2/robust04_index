			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President  Jiang Zemin and visiting Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal  Cavaco Silva said today that they were confident of the  development of bilateral ties and the smooth implementation of  the Sino-Portuguese declaration on the question of Macao.    During their meeting here today, Jiang praised Silva's  efforts for the development of friendly cooperation between the  two countries.    He said that although the two countries were far from each  other geographically, and had different social systems, they had  common interests in safeguarding the peace and stability of the  world, and in developing bilateral ties.    The president said that he was convinced that the  Sino-Portuguese ties will develop smoothly as long as the  principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit were  adhered to.    On the issue of Macao, he said that during Silva's visit to  China in 1987, the two governments signed the joint declaration  on the question of Macao, which was of great significance.    Since the declaration became effective, Jiang said, the two  countries had seriously abided by it.    He added that it has been proved that the joint declaration  had laid down a sound foundation for the stable development of  Macao, and the friendly cooperation between the two sides on the  issue, as well as set a good example for peaceful solution of  the historic problems between different countries.    Since there were only just over five years left for the  transition period of Macao, Jiang said, and lots of work had to  be done by the two countries, many problems had to be solved as  soon as possible.    He pointed out that as long as the two countries  strengthened  consultation and cooperation, various problems in the transition  period would be solved properly.    Silva said that since the signing of the joint declaration  seven years ago, the two countries had been cooperative not only  in carrying it out, but in other aspects.    He said that the two countries shared views on many  international issues, faced similar tasks of developing the  national economy and improving people's livelihood, and had  common interests in solving the problem of Macao.    "I hope," he said, "the current visit will further the  bilateral cooperation in fields of politics, economy and  science."    Jiang asked Silva to convey his regards to Portuguese  President Mario Soares.    Among those at the meeting were Peng Qingyuan, vice-chairman  of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the  Chinese Kuomintang, Liu Xiliang, chairman of the Chinese  Government Reception Committee and Vice-Minister of Radio, Film  and Television, and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu.</p>

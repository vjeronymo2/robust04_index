			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Observer: Rocking the boat If you come from the Rock of Gibraltar you learn how to take life's knocks. Take Joe Bossano, chief minister of Gibraltar, who has been doing the rounds  -or at least trying to - at the IMF/World Bank meetings in Madrid this week. Bossano, who is about as welcome to the Spanish government as a banderilla is to a bull, hitched himself up at the last minute to the British delegation. As a Crown colony, Gibraltar is one of the very few remaining blobs of pink on the global map so he can't be refused. However, Her Majesty's man in Madrid knows how to put people down and Bossano was not invited to Monday night's bash in honour of Kenneth Clarke, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer. Yesterday Spain's prime minister Felipe Gonzalez snubbed Bossano again by refusing him an invite to the champagne and tapas junket marking the formal opening. Much more of this and Bossano will be declaring independence.</p>

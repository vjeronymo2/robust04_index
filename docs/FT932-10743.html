			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Management: The subtle art of learning A LITTLE learning is a dangerous thing in every walk of business life, but nowhere more than in 'strategic alliances'. Collaboration with friends and foes alike is now a key part of almost every company's competitive strategy. Hence the emergence of the ghastly term 'virtual corporation' to describe shifting networks of companies which share costs and skills. For each enterprise involved, the ability to extract knowledge and capabilities from its partner is becoming vital to survival. Yet, with honourable exceptions such as Rover in cars and Motorola in electronics, few western companies are anything like as adept at such learning as the Japanese groups with which they so often ally. This is not just because the Japanese are inveterate learners, but because the rest of us are either blind or inept. Consider the case of 40 hard-pressed American car component makers which set up joint ventures with Japanese partners in the late 1980s to improve their languishing profitability and to gain business from Japanese 'transplant' factories in the US. For all but eight of the companies, 'learning from our partner' was an explicit objective. Yet after five years half of them complained that they were learning next to nothing. In almost all cases the reason was not that the Japanese had erected any particular barrier, but simply that the Americans were incapable of learning - whether as individuals, organisations, or both. The reasons for this are illuminating. They get to the heart not only of alliance relationships, but also of the equally pressing question for any kind of change management, even within single companies: why 'organisational learning', though fashionable, is such a tricky process. Enlightenment on both issues comes courtesy of a joint study venture between a Canadian professor who specialises in the fast-growing field of organisational learning, Mary Crossan of Western Business School, Ontario, and an American strategy researcher, Andrew Inkpen of Temple University in Philadelphia. In a working paper with the intriguing title of Believing is Seeing - as opposed to the often mistaken convention that 'seeing is believing' - Crossan and Inkpen say that deep-seated managerial beliefs can obscure even the most visible lessons about one's partner's way of doing things. But they also argue that many Japanese skills are far from immediately visible to the average western eye. Whereas most previous research into learning from alliances has been done at the level of the company, Crossan and Inkpen probe at three levels: individual learning; sharing it with colleagues and the parent company's managers; and the transformation of such 'group learning' into fully-fledged learning across the whole organisation. Most of the individual US managers set out expecting to find easily observable chunks of 'what' the Japanese knew. But instead, most of it was embedded in their ways of organising and competing. To take two trite examples, practices such as paying on time and 'shipping 7,200 parts, not 7,201' meant far less on their own than they did as part of the Japanese partner's overall approach to 'doing everything right'. The Americans also failed to appreciate that much of what they saw, though apparently insignificant, had a considerable cumulative effect thanks to continuous improvement. Instead, they looked in vain for 'home runs'. Where things really got tough was when it came to turning individual learning into the shared variety and then exploiting it. For a start, all the companies suffered from the 'Chinese whispers' syndrome: the way that, in all but the best-managed organisation, individual learning is dissipated as it winds its way up the organisation. At every level, pieces of knowledge and information get distorted or disappear. Matters were made far worse by the fact that few of the parent companies in the study had any real mechanism for feeding information, or the people who carried it, back to them. 'Many companies were unwilling to incur the minimal expense of setting up learning arrangements such as sending key parent managers to the joint venture regularly to get first-hand experience,' say the researchers. In some cases this may have been because, regardless of their organisation's stated objective, managers in the parent company tended to see the joint venture as a way of filling a skills gap, not as a bridge to learning new ones. So long as the joint venture remained unprofitable - which was often quite a while - most of the parent company managers also refused to commit themselves to any lessons from it, or even to try them out. In typically short-termist American fashion, they measured the venture's performance only by its profitability, whereas the Japanese partner focused on non-financial measures such as rising product quality and customer satisfaction. Even when there was clear evidence to the contrary, the parent company's managers were loath even to consider the possibility that 'the child could outperform its parent'. They felt threatened by the learning and blocked it. You might think that this bunch of executives was unusually blind or stupid. Yet their sort of behaviour is all too typical of the 'defensive routines' - conscious and unconscious - identified in all kinds of companies by other learning specailists. As has been demonstrated time and time again, people find it far harder to learn and therefore to change, than they either realise or admit. The car component managers are not complete dunces, but extreme versions of ourselves.</p>

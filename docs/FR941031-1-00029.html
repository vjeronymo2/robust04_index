			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Category II cracks found scenario: These are spanwise cracks that are outboard of the 10th rivet and within the limits of paragraph (b) of the service bulletin: Under the provisions of AD 73&hyph;05&hyph;03, an owner/operator who found cracks under this scenario would have to repetitively inspect every 13 weeks. This would result in present value compliance costs of $27,625. The proposed AD would require repetitive inspections every 600 hours TIS until replacement of the top flange of the wing rear spar attachment caps at 2,400 hours TIS as terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This would result in present value compliance costs of $9,700. Immediate replacement of the top flange would be more economical; present value costs would be $8,355. The present value cost savings for this scenario would be $19,272 per airplane in scheduled service and $19,269 per general aviation airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Category III cracks found scenario: These are spanwise cracks that are outboard of the 10th rivet and within the limits of paragraph (c) of the service bulletin: Under the provisions of AD 73&hyph;05&hyph;03, an owner/operator who found cracks under this scenario would have to repetitively inspect every 2 weeks. This would result in present value compliance costs of $175,000. The proposed AD would require repetitive inspections every 100 hours TIS until replacement of the top flange of the wing rear spar attachment caps at 2,400 hours TIS as terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This would result in present value compliance costs of $13,965. Immediate replacement of the top flange would be more economical; present value costs would be $8,355. The present value cost savings for this scenario would be $166,075 per airplane in scheduled service and $166,784 per general aviation airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Category IV cracks found scenario: These are spanwise cracks that are outboard of the 10th rivet and exceed the limits of paragraph (b) or (c) of the service bulletin. Also included are cracks in the splice plates of the vertical and horizontal legs of the rear spar or elongated rivet holes: Under the provisions of AD 73&hyph;05&hyph;03, an owner/operator who found cracks under this scenario would have to immediately repair any crack and then repetitively inspect every 26 weeks. This would result in present value costs of $14,500. The proposed AD would require immediate crack repair, an inspection at 1,200 hours TIS, and replacement of the top flange of the wing rear spar attachment caps at 2,400 hours TIS as terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This would result in present value compliance costs of $8,929. Immediate replacement of the top flange would be more economical; present value costs would be $8,355. The present value cost savings for this scenario would be $6,040 per airplane in scheduled service and $6,430 per general aviation airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Category V cracks found scenario: These are spanwise cracks that are between the third and tenth rivet: Under the provisions of AD 73&hyph;05&hyph;03, an owner/operator who found cracks under this scenario would have to immediately repair any crack, repetitively inspect every 2 weeks, replace the top flange of the wing rear spar attachment caps, and repetitively inspect every 26 weeks. This would result in present value compliance costs of about $30,000. The proposed AD would require immediate crack repair, repetitive inspections every 50 hours TIS, and replacement of the top flange of the wing rear spar attachment caps at 2,400 hours TIS as terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This would result in present value compliance costs of $38,988. Immediate replacement of the top flange would be more economical; present value costs would be $8,355. The present value cost savings for this scenario would be $19,356 per airplane in scheduled service and $26,367 per general aviation airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Category VI cracks found scenario: These are spanwise cracks that have a total length exceeding 30 inches but not exceeding 50 inches: Under the provisions of AD 73&hyph;05&hyph;03, an owner/operator who found cracks under this scenario would have to immediately repair any crack, replace the top flange of the wing rear spar attachment caps at 26 weeks, and repetitively inspect thereafter every 26 weeks. This results in present value compliance costs of about $21,200. The proposed AD would require immediate crack repair, repetitive inspections every 600 hours TIS, and replacement of the top flange of the wing rear spar attachment caps at 2,400 hours TIS as terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This would result in present value compliance costs of $10,289. Immediate replacement of the top flange would be more economical; present value costs would be $8,355. The present value cost savings for this scenario would be $12,707 per airplane in scheduled service and $13,028 per general aviation airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily or disproportionally burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires government agencies to determine whether rules would have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' and, in cases where they would, conduct a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in which alternatives to the rule are considered. FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, outlines FAA procedures and criteria for complying with the RFA. Small entities are defined as small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated or airports operated by small governmental jurisdictions. A ``substantial number'' is defined as a number that is not less than 11 and that is more than one-third of the small entities subject to a proposed rule, or any number of small entities judged to be substantial by the rulemaking official. A ``significant economic impact'' is defined by an annualized net compliance cost, adjusted for inflation, which is greater than a threshold cost level for defined entity types. FAA Order 2100.14A sets the size threshold for small entities operating aircraft for hire at 9 aircraft owned and the annualized cost thresholds, adjusted to 1994 dollars, at $69,000 for scheduled operators and $4,850 for unscheduled operators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the 82 U.S.-registered airplanes affected by the proposed AD, three airplanes are owned by the federal government. Of the other 79, one business owns 24 airplanes, one business owns 7 airplanes, one business owns 6 airplanes, one business owns 3 airplanes, 6 businesses own 2 airplanes each, and twenty-seven businesses own 1 airplane each.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As presented in the crack scenario discussion, replacing the top flange of the wing rear spar attachment caps immediately or within 2,400 hours TIS is more economical in all scenarios than continuing to repetitively inspect the part for the life of the airplane. Therefore, the proposed AD would not have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

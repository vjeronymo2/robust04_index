			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drug stocks hit Some hefty falls in the prices of US pharmaceuticals stocks on Wall Street on Thursday evening, and renewed weakness in US markets when they opened yesterday, brought keen downside pressure in London on the big UK drug stocks. The US drug sector, along with international drug stocks, fell back as investors reacted to renewed fears that the Clinton administration may instigate a series of reforms in the US healthcare system, including a closer scrutiny of profit margins in the drugs industry. Wellcome, particularly, suffered badly, closing a net 23 off at 721p, only marginally above the day's low point. Glaxo fell away to 604p but later rallied to end a busy session only 3 off at 609p, after good turnover of 3.7m. BOC was another stock to come under fire after the latest bout of nervousness triggered by the US worries, the shares slipping 9 to 658p. Pharmaceuticals specialists said the big underperformance of UK drug stocks so far this year - the FT-SE Actuaries Health and Household sub-sector has fallen about 17 per cent while the FT-SE 100 is marginally higher - was triggered by worries about the Clinton approach to the healthcare business.</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Abbey improves to IPounds 1.5m ABBEY, the Dublin-based housebuilding and plant hire group, achieved a significant improvement in pre-tax profits from IPounds 354,000 to IPounds 1.55m (Pounds 1.46m) in the year to April 30 and is resuming a dividend payment. However, at the operating level profits fell to IPounds 215,000 (IPounds 1.57m) and the pre-tax result was after interest received of IPounds 1.33m (IPounds 1.22m charged). Abbey's housebuilding activity is based almost entirely in the south-east of England and the company said that, despite the continuing deterioration within the residential sector, Abbey Developments achieved an operating profit of IPounds 890,000 and completed 408 sales at an average price of Pounds 73,000 sterling. The plant hire division was suffering one of the most difficult trading periods in recent years and M&amp;J Engineers reported an operating loss of IPounds 370,000. At present the group had a strong balance sheet and nil gearing. Turnover declined to IPounds 42.4m (IPounds 59m). Earnings per share worked through at 2.7p (0.61p) and the proposed dividend is 1p.</p>

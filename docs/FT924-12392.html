			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / De Klerk blocked on pardons bill A MULTI-PARTY committee of the South African parliament yesterday rejected a controversial draft law that would allow President F W de Klerk to extend secret pardons to state officials for apartheid crimes. If the bill is defeated in the full parliament, which is due to sit today, it would prove a serious embarrassment to Mr de Klerk, who has come under increasing criticism recently both from within and outside his ruling National Party. The African National Congress (ANC) said yesterday it would nullify the amnesty bill, if it came to power. The bill was opposed in committee by every parliamentary grouping except the National Party. Party officials were last night working to persuade opposition MPs to support the bill, though its chance of being approved appeared slim. Mr de Klerk could still force the bill through with the approval of the multi-party President's Council, which is dominated by the National Party and thus gives the ruling party final say over all legislation, whether or not it has gained parliamentary approval. But he has never yet used this controversial mechanism to force through legislation against the will of the parliament. He may choose to delay further consideration of the bill until the next full session of parliament, which begins early next year, or let it lapse. However he is under pressure from the security forces to provide amnesties for crimes committed under apartheid policies. The ANC yesterday criticised the bill because amnesties would be granted by a government-appointed board sitting in secret and crimes committed would be kept secret.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from "NHK News 7" program] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa has said that as a  prerequisite to North Korea resuming negotiations with the  United States, North Korea should first guarantee it will accept  international nuclear inspections. Kakizawa spoke at the upper  house Budget Committee session on 10 June in reference to North  Korea's position that, if U.S.-North Korea talks on the issue of  suspected nuclear development programs are resumed, it is  willing to accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA).    Questioning Kakizawa during the session, Keiji Kajiwara of  the Social Democratic Party of Japan noted North Korean Foreign  Minister Kim Yong-nam has said his country is willing to accept  nuclear inspections if U.S-North Korean negotiations resume.  And, Kajiwara asked how the Japanese Government views this.    Kakizawa said there exist differences of view between the  United States and North Korea over the questions of resuming  U.S.-DRPK talks and the timing of IAEA inspections. He said the  matter should be settled in a way to guarantee nuclear  inspections by the IAEA.    Kakizawa thus said that as far as Japan is concerned,  nuclear  inspections must come first before North Korea and the United  States resume their talks.</p>

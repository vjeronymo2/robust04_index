The move will free mainland investors to buy and sell both  foreign and local-invested unit trusts and mutual funds for the  first time and allow domestic companies to offer their own funds  to mainland buyers.    As a result of market liberalisation, Chinese fund  management  companies will also be permitted to list on the country's two  stock markets, in Shanghai and Shenzhen, according to Chinese  sources.    The People's Bank of China has approved the listing of six  newly established fund-management companies and endorsed more to  be traded over the counter throughout the country.    "As a reform package was recently approved by the central  authorities, China is set to introduce an institutional  investment system," a Chinese economist said on Saturday.    "And through the introduction of Western-style instruments,  along with the existing reforms in banking, fiscal and  securities regulations, China is expected to fully embrace a  capitalist-style financial market in the next few years."    The companies so far approved to list in Shanghai and  Shenzhen are Shanghai Jianye Fund Management, Baoding Fund  Management, Jinlong Fund Management, Shenzhen Lantian Fund  Management, Tianji Fund Management and Yangguang Fund Management.    However, Beijing was not in haste to lure foreign funds  until  it had initiated related regulations, the source said.    He said regulations on Administration of Investment Funds  were now under deliberation by the central bank, a cabinet-level  State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, and the Finance  Ministry.    The regulations will then be submitted to the State Council  for final endorsement.    Chinese sources said Executive Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji was  an  enthusiastic supporter of the reforms.    Zhu, China's financial troubleshooter, was quoted as saying  that it was healthier to introduce an institutional investment  system than to encourage individual investors.    Paul Pong Po-lam, managing director of Pegasus Fund  Management, said approval for investment funds to list on the  mainland's stock exchange will encourage the industry's  development in the country.    He said that China was now in need of cash for its huge  infrastructural developments throughout the country.    "Raising money by funds is the most convenient form of  financing," Pong said.    As a result of 14 years of economic reforms, disposable  incomes have increased and people are now looking for  alternative investment opportunities.    Tim Greaton of Credit Lyonnais said the present environment  in China was qualified for investment funds as economic reforms  had pushed the country towards a more Western-style market  economy.    However, he doubted if the listing of investment funds in  China would really be noticed overseas.    "I don't think that foreign funds are really conscious of  the  development of China local funds or the recent approval for  their listing," he said.</p>

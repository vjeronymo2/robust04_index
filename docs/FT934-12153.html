			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Clinton delivers healthcare reform plan to Congress PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday finally delivered to Congress the 1,300-page legislative text for his much-postponed healthcare reform plan. The bill, if passed next year, would be phased in to guarantee universal healthcare coverage by the start of 1998, a year later than the administration had once hoped. 'I have one simple request. I ask that before Congress finishes its work next year you pass and I sign a bill that will actually guarantee health security to every American,' Mr Clinton told congressional leaders in the marble hall of the Capitol yesterday. This universal coverage would be achieved by requiring all employers to offer health insurance to their employees and to pay for much of the cost, with government subsidies to ease the sting for smaller businesses as well as poorer families. All but the very largest businesses would be grouped into regional alliances which would function as purchasing pools, with the aim of driving down insurance premiums. These alliances would offer a variety of health plans. The choice between these would lie with the individual, but the portion of the premium paid by his or her employer would stay at 80 per cent of the average premium offered by the alliance. The percentage paid by the individual would vary, depending on which plan he or she chose. Among the most important modifications to the original draft of the plan is a provision for capping the overall amount of subsidies provided by the government to businesses and lower-income families. If the cap is exceeded, the president would have to go to Congress with proposals for dealing with the overrun. Senior administration officials insisted this did not involve any repudiation of the guarantee of universal coverage, but said it was important not to create another entitlement programme that could continue on autopilot. In other changes, the administration now proposes expanding the subsidies provided to small businesses by including companies with up to 75 employees, instead of 50 as originally planned. Every plan - including those of health maintenance organisations which normally limit members to a small pool of doctors and hospitals - would be required to offer the option of visiting an outside doctor, for an additional premium. The administration's budget specialists have reworked their numbers, and now estimate the plan will cut a net Dollars 58bn (Pounds 38.4bn) from the projected budget deficit over the six years from 1995 to 2000. The cost to the federal government of extending coverage to 37m people currently uninsured, including subsidies to small businesses, would be Dollars 116bn over the 1995-2000 period. The cost of adding prescription drugs to the existing Medicare programme for the elderly would be Dollars 66bn, while long-term nursing care - a benefit which will not be fully phased in until 2002 - would cost Dollars 65bn in 1995-2000. Mr Leon Panetta, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said his office had used the most conservative assumptions - including an inflation rate of 3.5 per cent, higher than in the original draft - and added a 15 per cent cushion for unforeseen contingencies. Offsetting this, the administration expects to raise Dollars 65bn from a 75 cents-a-packet tax on cigarettes, and Dollars 24bn from a levy on big companies which opt not to join the regional alliances. Another Dollars 189bn is expected to be saved on the federal Medicare and Medicaid programmes. Mr Panetta insisted the numbers had been carefully analysed and were credible. However, in the first document the White House issued its mathematicians concluded there were only five years in the 1995-2000 period, necessitating an embarrassing amplification.</p>

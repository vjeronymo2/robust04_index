			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> Not since the 1954 World Series had I looked forward to watching an  Indian-Giant game as much as the one Monday afternoon in Scottsdale, Ariz. . .  .  </P> <P> There may not have been anything to match Willie Mays' over-the-shoulder catch  at the Polo Grounds, but the delayed start of ESPN's major league baseball  telecasts was worth the wait. . . .  </P> <P> Rick Reuschel, at about 250 pounds, looked to be in midseason shape. It was  strange seeing Dave Anderson bleed Giant orange. In the third inning, somebody  yelled, "Bear 0down!" In his second at-bat as a Giant, Gary Carter got the  game-winning hit. And analyst Norm Hitzges revealed that Cleveland newcomer  Dion James didn't change underwear during a 15-game hitting streak with Atlanta  last year. How great to have the national pastime back. . . .  </P> <P> ESPN's announcers are the only people I've ever seen wearing coats and ties at  a spring training game in Arizona. . . .  </P> <P> The new short men in baseball are the starters. . . .  </P> <P> I hope Dodger outfielder John Shelby hasn't already used up his year's supply  of RBIs. . . .  </P> <P> Did it ever occur to the Coliseum Commission to agree to lease the stadium to  MCA/Spectacor before, not after, Oakland made a commitment to bring the Raiders  back? . . .  </P> <P> You won't be able to get a legal bet down on the NCAA semifinal game between  Nevada Las Vegas and Georgia Tech because Nevada law prohibits wagering on  athletic events involving in-state schools. But the sports books will have  saved themselves big money if UNLV wins the tournament. The Runnin' Rebels  would have been prohibitive favorites in their hometown. . . . Best player in  the Final Four whom nobody knows is Arkansas forward Lenzie Howell. . . .  </P> <P> Bruce Parkhill of Penn State, Mike Montgomery of Stanford and Pete Gillen of  Xavier are the finalists to succeed Terry Holland as basketball coach at  Virginia. . . .  </P> <P> What Larry Johnson has accomplished in the tournament thus far will count in  the voting for the John Wooden Award. Include the Regionals, and I think you've  got to rank the Nevada Las Vegas forward over La Salle's Lionel Simmons and  Oregon State's Gary Payton. . . .  </P> <P> A new basketball power is the Southwest Conference, and it will stay that way  if Texas keeps Coach Tom Penders. . . .  </P> <P> New York Knick Coach Stu Jackson is really in trouble now that General Manager  Al Bianchi has given him a vote of confidence. . . .  </P> <P> Carl Scheer -- formerly Continental Basketball Assn. commissioner and an  executive with the Carolina Cougars, Denver Nuggets, Clippers and Charlotte  Hornets and now back with the Nuggets -- changes jobs as often as his good  friend, Larry Brown. . . .  </P> <P> Magic Johnson and actor Michael Douglas will be working for scale after the  Laker-Clipper game tonight at the Sports Arena when they tape a segment of "The  Earth Day Special," to be shown on ABC April 22. . . .  </P> <P> Look-alikes: Helmut Kohl and Pete Axthelm. . . .  </P> <P> Bob Arum is promoting a rare doubleheader at Caesars Tahoe Sunday featuring  unbeaten junior flyweight Michael Carbajal at 10:30 a.m. on NBC and unbeaten  light heavyweight Andrew Maynard at 6 p.m. on ESPN. . . .  </P> <P> Look for Santa Anita and Hollywood Park to stage a bidding war for Trevor  Denman's services when the track announcer's contract with Santa Anita runs out  late next year. Denman is to horse racing in Southern California what Vin  Scully is to baseball and Chick Hearn is to basketball. . . .  </P> <P> The Kings will go the John Thompson route for the first round of the NHL  playoffs, headquartering in Banff for games that will be played a two-hour  drive away in Calgary. . . . Billy Crystal, the laugh riot of the Academy  Awards show, is no joke as a shortstop in celebrity games. . . .  </P> <P> The field for the Volvo tennis tournament July 28-Aug. 5 at UCLA already is  stacking up better than those in most of L.A.'s tournaments in recent years.  Stefan Edberg is the latest entrant. . . .  </P> <P> Best wishes for a speedy recovery to Jaime Jarrin, the Dodgers'  Spanish-speaking broadcaster who was injured in an auto accident in Vero Beach,  Fla. . . .  </P> <P> Cornerback Calvin Holmes and wide receiver Travis Hannah will participate in  the scrimmage that closes spring practice for USC Friday, and then fly to Palo  Alto to run on the Trojans' mile relay team in an invitational Saturday. . . .  </P> <P> Tailback Ricky Ervins will be featured on the Trojans' 1990 football posters  and pocket schedules. . . .  </P> <P> The hiring of George Allen already is paying off for Cal State Long Beach,  which expects to raise $100,000 for its football program with a "Long Beach  Welcomes George Allen" dinner May 23 at the Spruce Goose. . . .  </P> <P> Is the extra revenue that Jerry Buss will reap from additional Forum senate  seats worth all the ill will the move has created?  </P></p>

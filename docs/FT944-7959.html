			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Harborne Tenants fights Bradford takeover Harborne Tenants, the property investment company, has again urged its shareholders to reject approaches from Bradford Property Trust. In a letter sent to shareholders yesterday, the board says it is prepared to consider a 'fair offer' for Harborne, but considers that BPT is trying to acquire the company at an undervaluation. It believes that the net asset value of the ordinary shares in the company is properly stated at 345p per share. BPT has offered first 230p and then 260p, and Harborne finds it 'surprising' that BPT feels the need to 'cast aspersions' upon the valuation. Harborne also warns shareholders that BPT is focusing on the full potential taxation liability on properties that is not expected to arise unless it is BPT's intention to dispose of the properties. BPT had yesterday received valid acceptances for 4.76 per cent of the Harborne ordinary shares and 6.33 per cent of the preference shares. Incomplete acceptances had been received for a further 3.54 per cent and 3.64 per cent respectively. When the offer was announced, BPT held 28.1 per cent of the ordinary and 23.7 per cent of the preference.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 3 SAPA -- The Azanian Peoples  Organisation [AZAPO] on Tuesday [3 May] congratulated African  National Congress President Nelson Mandela on his party's  election victory and pledged to be supportive, but critical, of  an ANC-led government of national unity.    However, AZAPO President Itumeleng Mosala warned that the  government of national unity was incapable of meeting the  political and economic aspirations of the black majority. "Our  people did not choose a government. They merely endorsed a  settlement," he said of last week's elections.    Prof Mosala said at a press conference in Cape Town the  interim constitution compromised the demands of the black  majority on land and the transfer of power. A coalition  government could not deliver desperately-needed socio-economic  transformation. "The poverty and alienation of our people is so  desperate that you need an effective government to deal with  these issues. This settlement has failed to bring about a  transfer of power to an effective government and has betrayed  the interests of our people."    Prof Mosala said he had noted Mr Mandela's offer to  accommodate leaders of the Pan-Africanist Congress and AZAPO in  his cabinet, but no formal offer had yet been made. "AZAPO will  receive whatever gesture is made in the spirit in which it is  made. Our central committee will consider the matter and  respond."    He said AZAPO would not "act as spoilers" to frustrate the  implementation of the ANC's Reconstruction and Development  Programme, but would seek support for alternative development  programmes.    Prof Mosala predicted AZAPO would become "the political home  of millions" as the masses became disillusioned with a new  government's failure to deliver socio-economic change. "We will  fight the elections next time round and we will win those  elections. AZAPO also intends winning the Western Cape when the  time comes." He said the ANC failed to win the Western Cape  because it "failed to take seriously" the needs and fears of the  coloured community.</p>

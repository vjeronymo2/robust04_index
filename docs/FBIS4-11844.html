			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 31 Mar (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  has welcomed the agreement reached today between the  Palestinians and the Israelis, which protects the Palestinians  in Hebron in the occupied West Bank.    In statements upon his arrival from New Delhi, where he took  part in the summit meeting of the Group of 15 that convened in  India recently, Musa said that Egypt approves of this agreement  if the Palestinians approve of it.    On developments in Burundi, Musa described the situation  there as regrettable and said that Egypt tried to contain it.  President Husni Mubarak sent an envoy there at the beginning of  the crisis. The OAU secretary general also tried to send an  African force to Burundi but officials there hesitated in  accepting this force.    'Amr Musa noted that this evening he will contact the OAU  secretary general to discuss steps that need to be taken to stop  acts of violence in Burundi.    He added that he will submit a report on the situation in  Burundi to President Husni Mubarak in his capacity as current  OAU chairman.    Answering a question on the situation in South Africa, he  said that recent developments there, such as clashes and  bloodshed, are painful and will affect the elections. The  objective of these elections is to establish democracy.    'Amr Musa said that Egypt is very upset by current  developments in South Africa. He pointed out that a message  will be sent from Egypt to Nelson Mandela, leader of the African  National Congress, on this matter.    He added that an understanding will be reached with the OAU  secretary general in light of the resolutions that were taken at  the recent summit in Harare to find out what can be done to stop  the deteriorating situation in South Africa.    On the meetings of the Group of 15, Musa said that Egypt  submitted two projects to bolster cooperation among the  countries of the group. He pointed out that the ministers of  economy and trade will hold a meeting in Marrakech on 15 April  before the GATT meeting to define the developing countries'  stand on this agreement.</p>

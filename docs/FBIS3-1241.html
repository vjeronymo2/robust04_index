The TEC said the constitution stipulated that the  chief justice is required to convene the first meeting of the  National Assembly within 10 days of the election. The president  would be elected at that meeting. The TEC proposal suggested  the formal inauguration and swearing in of the president be held  on 10 May at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. The TEC said the  first meeting of each provincial legislature would be held on,  or before 5 May this year.</p>

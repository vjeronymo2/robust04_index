			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Sport: Lord's be praised - Cricket For once at a Lord's Test, the focus is on the cricket rather than the salmon en croute. South Africa are playing there for the first time in a generation and thousands of pairs of eyes have been locked on the drama unfolding on the field. Sometimes, people forget that Lord's is more than five acres of manicured turf and a sloping pitch that baffles inexperienced bowlers. It is also a living, working monument to cricket. I am not referring to the Jingdezen punch bowl circa 1786 exhibited in the pavilion - a unique piece of Chinese porcelain - or to the oil paintings, the miniature urn containing the original Ashes or the stuffed sparrow which was struck by a delivery one day in July 1936. (Both the sparrow and the ball were pronounced dead.) The pavilion is just one facet of a great ground. But there are other nooks and crannies from where you can actually see something alive and kicking. Take the new Mound Stand, for instance. At the top is the debenture area where the wealthy and privileged enjoy the best view there is. Lolling under the swirling roof feels a bit like watching the game from a marquee with the flaps up - far better than the cramped breeze-block hospitality boxes directly below. Within, there is an audible buzz as people who have stumped up a cool Pounds 3,000 interest-free mingle at the bar or loiter on the precipitous stairs. 'Do they still have sixes in cricket?' asks a man with a fat cigar who looks about to keel over. Most people are in blazers and slacks but down below, in the public seating, there are panamas and large men with bare torsos ignoring the advice from the public address that in this heat, sunburn occurs in 35 minutes. They will have paid Pounds 38 for a seat, something of a hike from the equivalent of 75p it would have cost a spectator the last time South Africa were at Lord's. The upper reaches of the Mound Stand are presided over by Eric, a jovial Jamaican, who has stewarded at the ground since 1957. He issues passes and greets regulars with a broad grin. He is the antithesis of the dreaded Lord's gatemen. VIPs and hangers-on are ferried between levels by a small lift manned by an elderly attendant who has not seen a ball bowled all day. Directly opposite, across the field, is the Grand Stand, crowned by Old Father Time, the weather-vane. Because of the prevailing wind, Father Time usually has his back to the cricket. Beneath are the scorers in their cluttered perch, putting dots in books - quite a lot while Kepler Wessels was batting - or fiddling with computers. A woman sits in the corner programming the electronic scoreboard. At ground level, with barely a glimpse of the cricket, Vince and Charlie hand-set the old Heidelberg printing press because there is an urgent demand for more score-cards: 'We've sold 9,000 already today,' Vince says proudly. The room has a curious aroma of inky mustiness and is a museum in its own right, with score-cards dating back to the 1924 South African Test, old signed bats and letters from Harold Larwood. Thursday's card was updated at the close of play, and later a queue developed for souvenirs. Meanwhile, Wessels, the South African captain, was chiselling runs in his awkward, crabby way, oblivious to the masses desperate for excitement. MCC members removed their jackets and loosened their ties and the deep purpleness of their faces seemed ever so slightly to subside. When the lunchers returned to their seats at about 4pm, the score had hardly changed. 'Bit slow,' people muttered, 'but it's understandable, it's their first match back.' Which is not quite true, of course. This Test is actually the South Africans' 15th since re-admission to world cricket 2 1/2 years ago, and they have become a tough, resilient unit, if not a devastating one. Their cricket has been full of great commitment and passion, with just one ironic twist. The South African team is still all-white; their most talented black player, Jacob Mulao, a Sowetan left-arm spinner seconded to the MCC this summer, was in a small booth selling score-cards.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Demirel fuels reports of split over tax policy MR Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, left for the US yesterday leaving behind Mrs Tansu Ciller, his chief economics minister, fuelling further speculation of a government split over economic policy, writes John Murray Brown in Ankara. Mrs Ciller last week denied rumours she is to tender her resignation, but her position looks increasingly precarious following the announcement in January of an 11 per cent rise in inflation. There is also growing opposition within the government to her plans for tax reform and privatisation. These are seen as essential to tackle the budget deficit, running at more than 11 per cent of GNP. Mrs Ciller, a 45-year-old Istanbul academic, has proposed reforms centring on an amnesty for tax offenders, increased collection and changes in tax treatment of government bonds.</p>

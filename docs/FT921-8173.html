			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Letter: Questions of pensions security Sir, In your leader of February 7 on Maxwell's pensions you say that 'the pensions lobby' would argue against the principle of pension rights ranking as secured creditors when the sponsoring business fails, because it does not regard final salary pensions as deferred pay. This assertion confuses two issues. Few people would argue with the principle that the value of accrued pension rights - the members' stake in the fund as you put it - could be described as deferred remuneration, but that does not in itself resolve the complex question of the ownership of surplus assets in balance of cost schemes. As far as the ranking of pension rights in a liquidation or receivership is concerned, even fewer would argue against the case for further enhancing the overall security of members' retirement provision in occupational pension schemes. In fact it is to be hoped that such a change in legislation may be one positive development which may emerge from the disastrous consequences of the Maxwell case.

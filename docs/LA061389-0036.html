			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH INSPECTS FIRE AREA AT YELLOWSTONE  </P> <P> After unveiling his clean air plan in Washington, President Bush flew here to  tour the site of naturally sparked forest fires that charred nearly a million  acres of parkland last summer.  </P> <P> Bush arrived in Wyoming in mid-afternoon and took a 20-minute helicopter ride  over some of the area scarred by the fires. On the ground, the President toured  the Fountain Flats burn area and inspected charred tree trunks and tiny green  pine sprouts growing in the rubble.  </P> <P> When asked about the possibility of recovery from the fires, Bush told  reporters: "We've got a very, very impressive group of men and women working on  it. . . . They've given a very optimistic assessment."  </P> <P> Wearing a leather jacket, forest-green slacks and a blue baseball cap, Bush was  the picture of a chief executive on holiday, ending his afternoon with a  fishing trip on Jackson Lake in the shadow of the snow-capped Grand Tetons.  </P></p>

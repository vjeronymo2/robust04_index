			<p>BFN     [Text] Parliament April 25 SAPA -- The African National  Congress seemed amenable to a general amnesty for all people  guilty of, or associated with, political crimes, the state  president, Mr F W de Klerk, said on Monday [25 April]. Speaking  in debate on constitutional amendments, he said important  breakthroughs had been achieved on the issue following  negotiations with the ANC, among others. The government had  noticed a fundamental shift in the ANC's attitude as a result of  talks, with that organisation realising there would not be a new  police or defence force after the elections.    The amnesty deadline had been set at October 8, 1990, but it  could be revised in the course of negotiations on further  constitutional amendments. "The government has a firm  commitment to October 8, but in interaction with all parties  there can be shifts within the framework of the constitution."</p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey case may go to Lords INDEPENDENT INSURANCE, an insurer that provides professional indemnity cover, may petition the House of Lords after losing a landmark court case over the supervision required for trainee surveyors. The Court of Appeal last week overturned a ruling that an unqualified surveyor always needed on-site supervision from a professional to validate the terms of the surveyor's professional indemnity cover. Independent had won a judgment in June last year under Judge Fox Andrews in the official Referee Users Court, which is widely used by the construction industry, against Congrave Horner, a firm of chartered surveyors. The case arose after a trainee surveyor with Congrave Horner failed to discover the extent of dry rot in a house. The firm paid more than Pounds 100,000 in compensation to the house owners, but Independent, its insurer, refused to pay up on its policy. Judge Fox Andrews backed Independent, ruling that attendance by a qualified surveyor was required at each of four stages of the survey: preparation, visual inspection, evaluation, and the final report. The trainee had been supervised only at the final stage. The Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Congrave Horner, arguing that the level of supervision required would vary according to how skilled and near to qualification the trainee was. It also said that the terms of supervision were very vaguely drawn up. Mr Keith Rutter, Independent's assistant general manager, said: 'Our view is that we have a valid case. We maintain that view. We may well seek a petition for leave to appeal.' He added: 'I've been doing this too long to get disappointed about losing court cases.'</p>

According to French Foreign Ministry Spokesman Richard  Duque,  Kozyrev told Juppe that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's  special envoy Vitaliy Churkin had persuaded the Serbs to do so.    Duque said that France welcomes Russia's efforts, stressing  that France has all along stood for "more Russian participation  in the diplomatic activities to solve the Bosnia crisis."    He added that "we are waiting for this news to be confirmed  and to be translated into actions on the ground."    Juppe today talked over telephone with U.N. Secretary  General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali and senior officials of Western allies and  Russia, said Duque.    Duque quoted Juppe as reiterating France's "determination to  implement NATO ultimatum" and its willingness to "work for a  political solution through joint efforts by the European Union,  U.S. and Russia."    He said that the NATO demands must be met and that France is  looking forward to "an unambiguous application, within the  deadline, of the decisions taken by NATO."    NATO has threatened to bomb Serbs' mortar positions around  Sarajevo if the Serbs fail to withdraw their heavy weapons or  put them under U.N. control by midnight GMT on Sunday [20  February].    Russia also announced that it agreed to move to Sarajevo  part  of its peacekeeping forces now in Croatia.</p>

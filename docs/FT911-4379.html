			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of Business Parks (3): Buyer's market for tenants - Reasons for relocation ACCORDING to a study by the London Chamber of Commerce, published last month, more companies than ever before are planning to relocate some of their activities away from central London. Of 150 companies polled, more than 40 per cent claimed to be considering a move and most are preparing to quit the south-east, with the south-west, the Midlands and the north being the main destinations. If the results of the chamber's survey do not square with the findings of property professionals who continue to report that three-quarters of all moves are to nearby locations, they do confirm relocation activity has eased up. John Heawood of Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, which regularly monitors company moves, confirms that 'it is no longer just high-tech companies which see the possibilities of operating outside an urban environment. More and more traditional in-town businesses are also considering a move.' The key word for the present, however, may be 'considering'. All-in costs of moving add up to Pounds 10,000 per employee, according to the CBI (not to mention the disruption and nervous wear and tear on employees and directors). So, many recession-hit businesses are proceeding with caution. Tenants are also aware that they are in a buyer's market. Every sector of the property market is oversupplied - none more so than the business parks which became so fashionable in the late 80s as planning restrictions on user classes were eased. Statistics produced by APR, the property monitoring group, suggest that as much as 190m sq ft of B1 space in business parks may be in the planning pipeline. Fortunately for the stability of the market, little more than a fraction of this will be built. Buying an option on a piece of farmland is the easy part; paying for the infrastructure and facilities to transform that into the makings of a true business park is quite a different matter, especially now that tenants are no longer satisfied with what amount to no more than 'industrial estates with trees'. Already that message is being heard. There have been few business park developments started in the past quarter and the emphasis is distinctly on quality with top drawer trading groups such as Arlington, Trafalgar House and Speyhawk offering high levels of specification and maximum flexibility. For the competition is certainly keen, not just from other business park developers but from hard-pressed inner-city schemes as well. Business park developers will not soon forget the recent relocation decision by Texaco which had outgrown its Knightsbridge headquarters. Having looked at Bristol, Swindon and then Reading as possible alternatives, Texaco was eventually wooed by the low rents and sophisticated services at Canary Wharf. Texaco's decision lifts the veil on the true priorities of companies which need to move during a recession. A green environment may be desirable, but a commercially suitable location offering cost savings will win hands down. This principle applies even where the chosen site does qualify as an eco-sensitive business park, such as the one at Crewe developed by the district and county authorities. Last autumn the Milk Marketing Board chose to relocate its animal breeding and farm management subsidiary, Genus, from London to Crewe in Derbyshire. Six months later Genus managing director, John Craven, is pretty satisfied with the outcome. But although the 87-acre park has received much media praise for its landscaping and environment-friendly design, these factors are not the source of Mr Craven's contentment. Genus looked at 30 different sites in the west of the country between Bristol and Manchester and close to the M5 or M6 for access to the main dairy farming areas. Crewe won primarily because of its pool of skilled but cheap administrative labour. Crewe's superb access to transport - not just rail, but motorway and airport links are close by - was also a prime factor. But with only three occupiers on the site so far, Mr Craven admits to feeling 'fairly isolated'. Matters improved when Barclays opened a cashpoint and a Holiday Inn will increase facilities further. 'The landscaping is nice to have,' he says, 'but it is really just a bonus.' Ambience in a broader sense does count, however, in the choice of location. Crewe and Nantwich council is adamant that a true business park must be large enough to generate its own sense of place - a minimum of 50 acres. It is certainly true that this feeling is sadly lacking from the proliferation of developments around Heathrow (and consequently cheek by jowl to the M25's traffic nightmare). Brian McCombie, managing director of Trafalgar House's business parks subsidiary, dismisses these as 'suburban industrial estates'. And they are certainly failing to attract tenants, whereas THBP's redevelopment of Brooklands adding offices, a Tesco super store and an hotel to its historical attractions, looks a winner. Mr McCombie, whose next application will be for a business park at Waltham Abbey, is aware that even a 'Brooklands' ambience is not enough. 'There must be good facilities for staff either on-site or within lunchtime striking distance and flexibility over leases and provision of buildings.'</p>

A similar agreement, but only verbally, was reached at  Ukraine's Ministry of Power Engineering and Electrification.  Proposals were received on cooperation with the Ukrainian State  Committee on Nuclear and Radiation Safety.    "This is the first attempt by Ukrainian and Israeli power  engineers to establish relations between both countries' power  engineers," said Amnon Ainav [name as received] scientific  director of Israel's Ministry of Power Engineering, in an  interview with a UNIAN correspondent. A meeting at the level of  experts is planned for the end of March, where cooperation for  using solar energy and other nontraditional forms of energy will  be agreed.</p>

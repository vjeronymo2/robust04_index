			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Merrill plans commodities index warrants Amid growing investor interest in commodities, Merrill Lynch is to issue 5m call warrants this week on its new Energy and Metals Index, which it launched in late July. The pricing for the European-style warrants will be decided on Thursday, but under current conditions the strike price would be Dollars 83.60, the index's spot value yesterday, with an issue price of Dollars 5.62 per warrant. The warrants are targeted at both fixed-income and equity fund managers seeking a diversification tool or a way to hedge their real rate of returns, said Merrill Lynch.</p>

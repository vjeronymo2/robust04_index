			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Reservations on travel package: The doubts about moves to protect tourists IF Mr Michael Heseltine, the new trade and industry secretary, wants an early opportunity to justify his interventionist reputation, Britain's package tour operators are eager to help. Mr Peter Lilley, Mr Heseltine's predecessor, proposed new regulations to help holidaymakers stranded abroad when their tour company collapsed. They are needed by the end of the year to act on a European Community directive on package holidays that requires buyers of package holidays, whether domestic or foreign, to be protected against corporate collapse. Holiday companies say the Department of Trade and Industry's proposals would hugely increase costs and would, in some cases, offer travellers a lower level of protection than they enjoy now. Mr Lilley had proposed that travel companies make their own arrangements to protect customers. They could either arrange a bonding or insurance scheme to cover all money they received as pre-payment from holidaymakers, or place all that money in a designated account. The money could be withdrawn only when the service to which it related had been performed. A travel organiser who failed to have adequate cover would have committed a criminal offence, the department said, 'and this would be apparent if he became insolvent'. The travel industry's derision was uncontained. Holidaymakers who had lost their money or were stranded abroad would have to console themselves with the thought that at least their travel organiser would be prosecuted. In addition, leaving pre-payments in a designated account was impractical. Tour operators needed the money to make advance payments for travel and accommodation. Since the general election, the travel trade has been asking the department to think again. It wants a licensing system that covers all package tourists booking foreign holidays. sea. Mr John Dunscombe, president of the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta), said: 'We are an industry that depends on the total confidence of the public.' Customer protection is a travel industry obsession. Travel company failures, such as the collapse of Mr Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group (ILG) last year, are the tabloid reporter's dream. Poolside scenes of holidaymakers facing the prospect of staying in Majorca forever are the travel industry's nightmare. The number of foreign holidays taken by British residents has increased from 8m in 1975 to 20m last year, of which 11m were charter airline package holidays. The travel industry fears that a succession of company failures would slow that growth. The reality, Abta says, is that over the past 20 years no British tourist has lost money on a foreign package holiday. The industry's accumulated experience since the collapse of Court Line and its Horizon and Clarkson Holidays subsidiaries in 1974 has led to the establishment of a system of consumer protection which, Abta says, is the most advanced in the European Community. Providers of charter-based package holidays have to have an Air Transport Organiser's Licence (Atol) from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). They are required to have a bond, usually equivalent to between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of turnover, to ensure that pre-payments are returned and holidaymakers repatriated if the company collapses. That is backed up by the Air Travel Trust Fund. Many ferry-based holidays, but not all, are also well protected. Companies selling ferry-based holidays often have a bond arranged by Abta or another trade body. If the bond is insufficient to cover the consequences of a company collapse, Abta's insurance makes up the shortfall. If that is exhausted, Abta members dig into their own pockets, as they did in last year's school-tour operator failures. Mr Dunscombe says, however, that an unknown number of ferry-based holiday companies are selling unprotected holidays. Mr Richard Atkinson, managing director of Eurocamp, which sells camping and mobile-home holidays, says the level of his company's bond under the DTI proposals would be between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of turnover. 'We could do it, although it would be difficult for us. But it would drive others out of business.' The travel industry believes that the best way to implement the EC directive is to require every company taking travellers abroad to be licensed, under the control of a new independent authority set up to complement the existing Atol system. The consumer would be protected and the industry would be happy. The DTI's new management should find the argument irresistible.</p>

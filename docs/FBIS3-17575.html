Golembiovskiy: "Boris Yeltsin: Passions Must Not Be Further  Intensified. Russian President Speaks on Telephone With  IZVESTIYA Chief Editor"]    [Text] On the morning of 25 March the editorial office  telephoned Sochi, where the Russian president is completing his  brief vacation. The transcript of Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin's  conversation with Igor Golembiovskiy follows.    [Golembiovskiy] Boris Nikolayevich, hello. Pardon me for  calling you so early, but we were afraid it would be harder to  talk to you later. The first question I would like to ask you  is extremely trivial, but it has political undertones today:  How is your health?    [Yeltsin] First, I must tell you that I am, regrettably,  beginning to get accustomed to speculation about my health  starting up as soon as I go on vacation. I feel normal  [chuvstvuyu sebya normalno]. I have not been seeing my doctors,  I have not been going to Matsesta.... I have been working -- I  have a lot of mail, a lot of documents, I have been reading,  writing, and meeting people. But I have, of course, also been  relaxing. I have been swimming and going for walks: There has  not been much tennis, the weather has been disappointing, the  court was wet, but over the last few days it has dried out and I  have played. In a word, there are no signs of illness. Talk of  illness is just another provocation.    [Golembiovskiy] I cannot fail to ask how you regard the  appearance of the so-called "Scenario No. 1" document, if I can  use the old terminology. All the mass media are writing and  talking about it, and "Scenario No. 2" has appeared. Is  political life in the country reaching a new acute pitch? It is  strange that the security services are still unable to say  anything intelligible either about the authors or the sources of  this material.    [Yeltsin] First, this smacks of provocation. Second, you  are right, unfortunately. The relevant services have proved  powerless, although they were given instructions straightaway;  however, I still do not have any precise information today.    [Golembiovskiy] Of late you have noticeably distanced  yourself from the democrats and radical reformers as if you were  choosing a new role for yourself as the voice of the interests  of all strata of society, not just the political forces whose  objectives and convictions you hold dear. Are you not afraid  that the upshot will be that, on the one hand, you will not win  supporters among the opposition and, on the other, you will lose  support among the democratic strata? Lastly, won't there be too  high a price to pay for concessions to conservative forces,  namely the abandonment of the reforms?    [Yeltsin] First of all I cannot agree with what you call my  "distancing myself" from anyone whatsoever. I prefer another,  more precise definition -- broadening the spectrum of  cooperation. The complex, crisis situation in Russia and the  events of the last few months have revealed two trends in our  political life. On the one hand, once again we have the clear  polarization of the political forces. The voices of those  people who are calling for us to leap backward or forward in a  single bound ring loudly in the ears. On the other hand, there  is more and more understanding and a desire to organize  cooperation and build bridges. These sentiments are being  reinforced among political movements and parties of the most  diverse orientations. As president I have no right to ignore  and disregard this. Following the period of confrontation there  is finally a chance of making the mood of cooperation and accord  the determining factor. Precise, thorough, patient work is  essential here. Passions must not be further intensified.    At the same time I share your disquiet regarding the price  of compromise. Can it be achieved, can cooperation be  established and the course of reform preserved at the same time?  It was this question that was one of the main ones when work on  the presidential message was under way. And I believe that an  answer has been found. The main idea of the message --  strengthening the state on the basis of the Constitution -- is  cherished by everyone whose common sense has not failed them,  everyone who has a sincere interest in Russia's well-being.  This is also a platform for cooperation and for deepening  reform, and not for turning back the clock. My position is as  follows: If you share the spirit of the message, we will find a  common language; if not, don't resort to demagoguery, don't  divert Russia's citizens from the course toward accord.    [Golembiovskiy] Many political observers are extremely  skeptical about the prospects for the rapid signing of an accord  document -- the opposing sides' interests are too polarized. Do  you believe that political reconciliation is indeed feasible?  How will events develop, how will you, the president, act if  that does not happen and disputes over the document do not  defuse but, on the contrary, aggravate the situation?    [Yeltsin] Needless to say, the agreement on civil peace is  not a panacea. I have been around a long time and I am not so  naive as to expect the agreement to resolve all the problems.  But I am convinced that it can be a step toward this.  Especially since the range of political forces which have  voiced a desire to work on the agreement is quite broad.    The question is: How far will we be able to go down this  road, will we stop at formulating a declaration of good  intentions or will we be able to take another important step and  determine the fundamental bases of accord, the forms of  cooperation, and, most important, the mechanisms of our  responsibility to society. I hope we will be able to achieve  that. If we do not, I will suggest other options. I will not  lose heart. I feel that the main demand now being voiced by  people and by all strata of society is that stability is  strengthened and our life rendered more peaceful.    [Golembiovskiy] How would you define the essential nature of  the present stage in the economic reform? Which way is the  Russian economy heading? Both under Gaydar and under  Chernomyrdin we seem to be managing the economy as though blind,  and there is still the feeling that we do not have a reform  program and have not defined the priorities, hence the  inconsistency and mutually exclusive measures. This could all  end badly, and it is no wonder that people are forecasting a  "spring offensive of the working people" when the country will  be living not "from one wage packet to the next" but "from one  strike to the next." What are your views on that?    [Yeltsin] It has to be acknowledged that the pace of real  reform has clearly slowed down and the state's role in deepening  the reform is negligible. You can damp down the crisis by means  of flexible measures, even timely measures, of course. But you  cannot overcome it and transform the economic mechanism that  way. As for whether it is a government of reform or not -- you  can only judge that from whether the reform itself is working  and what its results are. That being so, the government still  has considerable reserves and is obliged to use them  energetically, just as it is obliged to ensure control of the  situation and, above all, extricate the economy from the crisis  of nonpayments.    As for living "from one strike to the next," all that can be  avoided if we learn how to properly elaborate economic policy,  anticipate its social consequences, including the negative  consequences, and ease the burden of the reform. To be blunt,  that is a complex task but not an impossible one.    [Golembiovskiy] Recently politicians and state figures of  various persuasions in Russia have been increasingly  persistently talking about the need to create some kind of new  union on the territory of the CIS. Some see this as a  manifestation of Russia's imperial ambitions, others as economic  expediency (which is also being disputed), while yet others  predict new cataclysms across the whole territory of the former  USSR. Is a new unification possible in principle? And who  will make the final decisions -- presidents, parliaments, or  peoples?    [Yeltsin] I would like to rephrase your question -- is a  complete disunification in the area of the former USSR possible  in principle? I believe that life itself has answered that  question. It is impossible because it would lead to a sharp  lowering of the survivability threshold of each of our  countries. It is impossible because it is contrary to the  interests of the peoples and their ideas about a normal life.  And if that is so, it changes the question -- it is necessary  to find the optimum, the most painless, and least conflictual  form of cohabitation. And, of course, avoid all adventures.    No matter what people now say about the former Union, I  cannot call it the most successful form of the existence of our  states and peoples. After all, it was sustained primarily by  Russia's potential and resources. It is already being  forgotten that for a long time today's independent states were  called nothing less than "backward boondocks." We even took  pride in the fact that they almost overtook Russia in a very  short time. Admittedly, as a rule it was not the done thing to  consider at what expense this was achieved.    Russia's position was extremely unsatisfactory. It did not  have its own aspect or statehood. It seemed to have blended in  with the background as it supported the former Union at the cost  of its own prosperity, with the result that its own problems  were the last to be resolved. I am convinced that this model of  life is completely outmoded now. Today there can be no going  back to that.    As for the rapprochement of the states, that has to happen  on  the basis of a mutual consideration of interests in which  Russia's interests are paramount for us. It is hardly possible  today to plan in detail how each step in that rapprochement will  be formulated politically and legally. But I am bound to agree  that Russia's position on this question must be more active,  purposeful, progressive, and, if you will, passionate.  Especially when we are talking about the fate of our fellow  countrymen.    [Golembiovskiy] At the meeting with chief editors you said  that, aside from everything else, you wanted to devote the  period before the 1996 elections to preparing a worthy successor  to yourself. I realise that today is not the time to mention a  specific name, but do you know of such a person? This question  is relevant today because several people, Rutskoy among them,  have already announced their claims to the post of future  president of Russia.    [Yeltsin] First of all I am deeply convinced that the  Russian presidential elections must be a truly nationwide event  [vsenarodnyye]. There can be no deviations from this  fundamental principle of Russian democracy. Attempts are being  made to deprive the country's citizens of this right. This is a  mine of tremendous destructive power laid under Russian  statehood.    Second, I am well aware of the desire of certain political  circles to artificially destabilize the situation. To call a  spade a spade, what they want is to overthrow the president at  any price. Such adventures are founded on a thick tissue of  lies, baseness, and greed. I want to warn everyone, and  journalists first of all -- do not believe the rumors that are  being circulated, do not succumb to provocation.    I can disabuse these people -- all their schemes will be  exposed in the early stages and we have sufficient forces to  take appropriate measures to preserve and strengthen stability  in Russia.    As for the presidential elections, I am working on the  assumption that they are to take place in 1996. I am now  closely monitoring the activity of potential candidates for the  supreme state post. There have been some disappointments and,  as they say, some pleasant surprises, too. The parliamentary  elections taught us all something. I can now say with a great  degree of confidence that if in the 1996 elections the people  show their inherent wisdom and perspicacity, then a truly worthy  individual and state figure will be elected to the post of  president.    [Golembiovskiy] One final question. Boris Nikolayevich,  what are your immediate plans on your return to Moscow?    [Yeltsin] I am returning Sunday, and Monday I shall resume  my duties in full. On 28 March I am meeting with Nursultan  Abishevich Nazarbayev, this is an important meeting for both  states. But as for the immediate period ahead, I have three  major issues in addition to my current work. They are -- work  on the mechanism and levers for implementing the presidential  Message. Second -- the problem of the budget. I had a meeting  here in Sochi with Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, we examined  my observations and corrected certain positions, although  questions remained. The budget, as you know, has been sent to  the Duma, and we will work on it further. The third issue is the  document on civil accord -- for me this is a most important  matter which, in my view, will determine the political health of  society.    [Golembiovskiy] Thank you, Boris Nikolayevich, and I wish  you a happy return.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TARK WORRIES WHILE UNLV SINKS PACIFIC BY 40 POINTS  </P> <P> No lead is a safe lead if you're a worrier like Nevada Las Vegas Coach Jerry  Tarkanian.  </P> <P> After watching University of the Pacific trim his ninth-ranked Running Rebels'  lead to 18 at halftime Thursday night, Tarkanian reinserted his starters to  help widen the margin.  </P> <P> UNLV responded with the first 10 points of the half and raced to a 116-76 Big  West Conference victory.  </P> <P> Reserve Barry Young scored a season-high 20 points to lead five UNLV players in  double figures.  </P> <P> All 12 Rebel players scored as Tarkanian substituted freely after his team  opened a 25-point lead halfway through the first half.  </P> <P> "I really wanted to rest the first group tonight, but a lot of times that  backfires," Tarkanian said. "But I like to reward the second group in a  situation like that."  </P> <P> UNLV led by as many as 44 in the second half in improving to 18-4 overall, 11-1  in the Big West. Pacific fell to 12-9, 5-7.  </P> <P> The defeat was the worst suffered by the Tigers in conference play since they  were beaten by 40 points by UNLV in 1984.  </P></p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares slide as sales news disappoints UNFAVOURABLE news from the UK consumer sector, together with receding hopes of lower interest rates, cut into share prices in London yesterday, taking the Footsie Index down towards the 2,800 mark. Trading volume increased again, but once again the second line stocks outperformed the blue chips. Denmark's voting approval for the Maastricht treaty had little effect. Share prices opened lower and an attempted rally was quickly extinguished. The late recovery on Wall Street overnight did little to lift London's doubts on the outlook for the New York market. UK stocks began to slide at mid-morning as sentiment was upset first on the domestic and then on the international front. Disclosure of a sharp rise in German money supply in April and the absence of any rate change at the Bundesbank meeting put UK interest rate hopes back on to the sidelines. News that UK retail sales had fallen by 0.3 per cent last month served to increase the City's distaste for the interim results from Bass, one of the leading UK brewers, which shook the sector by indicating a continued decline in beer sales and profits. The slide in the market quickened as London traders backed away ahead of the opening of the new Wall Street session. In the event the Dow Industrial Average was down only 7 points in UK hours, but London stocks remained around their day's lows, with the Footsie nearly 30 points off at 2,817.7 at worst. The final reading of 2,819.7 gave a loss on the day of 27.6 points. Even those traders who had warned that the stock market was merely moving within an established trading range of 2,787 to 2,890 sounded surprised at the speed of its reaction over the past two days. One reason is the return of the rights issue flow, although this is at reduced pressure for the moment. Three issues were brought forward yesterday for a total of more than Pounds 350m, suggesting that the rights issue queue is being speeded up because of the weight of issues in the pipeline. Yesterday's cash calls included the Pounds 200m convertible rights from Allied-Lyons, which had been widely expected on Monday, and two smaller equity calls from Compass Securities and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. Some relief came from the satisfactory reception for the next Pounds 3bn auction of government bonds. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index again outperformed the Footsie, losing only 2.2 points to 3,149 and remaining within a few points of its all-time high. However, turnover in non-Footsie stocks remained relatively low at only about 59 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 647.5m shares, compared with 633.4m in the previous session. The official total of customer business, which tends to disclose the strength of institutional business, increased on Tuesday to return a worth of Pounds 1.25bn. Some strategists perceive selling pressure from the big institutions, which are believed to be short of cash and fearful that equity rights calls and gilt-edged funding demands could catch them out over the next month. The latest reports from UK industry have done little to sustain faith in an early recovery in business activity and this, coupled with inflationary signs in the US and in Europe, have discouraged fund managers in London.</p>

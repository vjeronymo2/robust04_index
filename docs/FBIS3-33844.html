			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Islamabad, 29 Jan (MENA)--The Indian Government  today accused Pakistan of training over 10,000 Afghan mojahedin  prior to sending them to the Indian state of Kashmir to escalate  acts of violence and extremism in the state. [passage omitted]    Reports coming into Islamabad today indicated that three  senior Indian security officials died and a number of others  were wounded in clashes in Srinagar Province.    Responding to the Indian charges, knowledgeable sources in  Islamabad said today that the Indian threats to launch "a  limited war" along the line of control on Kashmir will not force  Pakistan to abandon its stand on the Kashmir issue.    The Pakistani sources told MENA that if India truly fears  that "a limited war" will break out and affirms that there is  shooting on the line, it has not informed Pakistan of this  officially through the hot line between the directors of  military operations in the two countries. The sources stressed  that Indian allegations about the Afghan mojahedin infiltrating  Kashmir are baseless. They said Indian patrols roam about the  entire line and that they mined and erected barbed wire along  it.    The Pakistani sources explained that the mountainous  passages, the only way in for infiltrators all along the line,  have been completely blocked by snow and that it is impossible  to pass through them.    As regards shooting along the line of control, the Pakistani  sources said the Indian forces over the past four years have  been firing provocatively all along the line in the state of  Jammu and Kashmir.    The sources added that it is estimated that India killed  over  600 civilians on the Pakistani side of the border recently,  while Pakistan avoids shooting at civilian targets.    The sources accused India of waging a war against unarmed  civilians in Kashmir and called on India to stop this war  immediately.    These sources affirmed that Islamabad has no intention of  using force and noted that Pakistan does not interfere in  Kashmir but supports the just aspirations of the Kashmiri people  who are struggling for their right to self-determination.</p>

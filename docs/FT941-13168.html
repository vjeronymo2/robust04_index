			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / World Trade News: US and Japan persevere in trade talks - Search for pre-summit deal US and Japanese officials resumed technical discussions yesterday on improving access to key sectors of the Japanese market, after failing to make progress in higher-level talks that broke up on Tuesday night. Senior US officials said there were still 'substantial stumbling blocks' in the way of reaching a satisfactory agreement in time for the summit meeting of President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, in Washington on February 11. The Clinton administration is seeking expanded US exports to Japan under a framework agreement negotiated last year, and is targeting Japanese barriers to sales of cars and automotive parts, insurance, and government procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment. However, a US official said talks in the automotive sector were 'at a complete impasse', while progress so far on insurance and government procurement was marginal. US officials said there were still major problems both over the goals they would like to set for increased market penetration, and over the objective criteria they insist on setting to measure progress. 'If there are no objective criteria, there are no agreements - period,' said a senior negotiator. Other officials reiterated the US position that they would rather have no agreements than sign something that failed to achieve their market access goals, but they said that it was too early to write off the possibility of reaching a satisfactory deal. 'The rhythm of these things has always been that there's an awfully slow run-up,' one senior offical said. Under the framework agreement, the US committed itself to reduce its budget deficit and increase its national savings and competitiveness, while Japan promised to achieve a highly significant reduction in its trade surplus with the US, as well as a significant increase in import penetration. In Tokyo, Mr Andrew Card, president of the American Automobile Manufacturers' Association, has called on Japan to create a market environment that would assure US carmakers sales in Japan of 100,000 vehicles a year in three years' time. This would be used as a benchmark figure to measure US access to the Japanese car market. Mr Card, who served as transportation secretary under President George Bush, indicated that such a benchmark would help US carmakers justify making the necessary effort to penetrate further the Japanese market by ensuring that their work would be rewarded. Last year, US carmakers exported about 14,000 cars to Japan. His remarks reflect the continuing insistence on the US part on the use of quantitative targets in opening Japan's markets to foreign goods despite repeated Japanese resistance to such targets on the grounds that these would lead to managed trade. Continuing failure to break the deadlock in the bilateral trade talks, despite several sessions, has led to growing friction and distrust between negotiators on each side. While each side insists that the Clinton-Hosokawa summit is still scheduled to go ahead, in spite of the current political turmoil in Japan and the receding possibility that concrete US-Japanese agreements can be hammered out in time, there are also growing signs that the US is reviewing its options in case the summit is postponed or turns out to be unsatisfactory. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, said in Tokyo this week that the US might have to review the basis of its trade talks with Japan if the framework negotiations on trade and economic matters were to prove unsatisfactory.</p>

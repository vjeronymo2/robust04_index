			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Office Automation (21): Who said the paperless office was just a dream? / Goodbye to secretaries There are two-dozen professional staff at IQ Software in the UK, but no secretaries - and the company dreams of becoming paperless, too, reports John Kavanagh. IQ, which develops and sells information access software aimed especially at managers and senior executives, bases the entire way it operates on computer systems. 'We think in terms of automation and productivity, rather than administration and secretaries,' says UK general manager Mr Geof Gibbons. 'If someone finds they've done the same admin job three times in the last week, we start thinking of ways to automate it.' The main office in Winchester and smaller operations in Manchester and Colchester are supported by two main software packages, supplied through the parent IQ Software company in the US to all its European subsidiaries. These are Futurus Team Combo, an office automation product from Futurus, and Sales Control from Sales and Marketing. The UK company also has Sunaccounts from Systems Union, Microsoft Word for word processing, Lotus 1-2-3 for spreadsheets and its own products for management information access. The systems run on a Novell office network supporting relatively cheap IBM-type personal computers, generally chosen on price. 'We have an almost paperless office,' Geof Gibbons says. 'We run sales control like a groupware system for everyone in the company. The marketing people enter details of sales leads and allocate them to salesmen. 'A salesman phones and then gets the system to produce a standard follow-up letter. The system records that the letter has been sent. The salesman can ask the system to remind him to chase up the lead so many days later. He might arrange a demonstration and generate another letter. The system again records this fact but we don't keep paper copies in a file or anything silly like that. 'The salesman will use the Futurus Team electronic mail system to get the support people to check that product trials are going well. The support people log their activity in the system. When the lead turns into a customer, the accounts people are notified through the system and create accounts records in Sunaccounts.' The result is that all activities relating to a customer are logged paperless on the system. In addition, all activities use - or are sparked off by - information which is handled and recorded once only, he says. 'Sales people know which information and prices they've given. The support team know of any problems and what was done about them. Marketing can check the progress of a prospect. Training consultants know the amount of training to be done. 'We also key-in summaries of any correspondence from customers, so that's available on the system, too.' The Futurus Team electronic mail facility is a natural part of every-day life at IQ Software and is regarded as more productive than the telephone. While we speak, Mr Gibbons keys in a question he cannot answer and sends it to a technical specialist; the answer comes back towards the end of our conversation. 'E-mail is the simplest way of communicating between people here in Winchester, in the remote offices and at the US head office,' he says. 'You don't tie-up valuable time in phone calls. Written messages tend to be more succinct and thoughtful, because you've got to key them in. And you can add to them and send them to any number of appropriate people at the same time. We don't use a discussion database like Lotus Notes: instead we build a dialogue from an initial e-mail message. 'For example, I might broadcast a question about a customer, a salesman might add a comment about what he has done and say he's waiting for the support team to do something and then the support person might add his comment. This also gives us a log of the entire conversation. 'We do e-mail to some customers, via the public Compuserve network service. This hasn't been taken up as much as we'd like by customers. There still seems to be a lot of psychological barriers: even people who are well used to using PCs prefer to talk on the phone. Even in our company, with all our office automation, there's one guy who sends little paper notes in response to e-mail messages. Fortunately, he's the only one.' A separate simple electronic mail system in Futurus Team is used to pass on telephone messages. Anyone answering the telephone for someone who is out types a message into this system, so there are no scribbled notes on people's desks. Geof Gibbons says this does not put staff off taking other people's calls: in this company, communications and information technology are a natural part of the way everyone works. IQ Software has looked at voicemail systems, which record spoken messages, but feels they are still too expensive for its needs. Another electronic mail system enables people to communicate directly and immediately on urgent matters. A user can send a message through a PC to a colleague, who is notified by an audible beep and can key in a reply. IQ Software finds this especially useful if someone takes a query on the telephone and the person who knows the answer is also engaged: the two colleagues can hold a conversation through their PCs while talking to outsiders on the telephone. Futurus Team's bulletin board facility is used by the US headquarters to send product and other information over night. At the US end, the system checks for any product documents which have been changed since the previous day's connection and sends those across. In Winchester, this facility is also used to keep track of training course bookings and to maintain certain other information such as staff names and addresses. A diary system is also part of Futurus Team and is used to arrange meetings and book resources such as a meeting room and a projector. If one person arranges a meeting, the system notifies the others via electronic mail. IQ Software has taken various measures to ensure that while information technol ogy is fundamental to the way the company works it is not also an Achilles' heel. 'All the discs are mirrored, so all data is written to two disc drives at the same time,' says the company's support manager, Mr Neil Hutton, who also looks after the internal systems. 'Everything is archived to tape every night. We have uninterruptible power supplies in case of mains electricity problems. 'One benefit of using a Novell network is that any machine attached to it can be the file server, so if the usual file processor goes down, we can move the discs to another machine. 'We use standard 486 PCs, not quite the state of the art but perfectly adequate for our needs.' Geof Gibbons underlines the importance of having the systems constantly available - 'we've been fully automated from day one and never had a secretary. We started on a single machine and when there were two of us, we bought another and got a network. 'The systems have absolutely proved themselves in terms of the productivity of our people,' he concludes. 'We just couldn't work without our systems now. It's as simple as that.'

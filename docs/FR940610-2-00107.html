The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically the Order to Show Cause alleged that: Respondent's pharmacy license as well as the pharmacist's license of Bernard P. Kastigar (Mr. Kastigar), the owner/operator of Respondent, were suspended for thirty days and placed on three years probation in 1985 by the Board of Pharmacy, Department of Consumer Affairs, State of California (Pharmacy Board); in 1988, based upon violations of the Pharmacy Board's probation order, Mr. Kastigar's pharmacist license was again suspended for thirty days and placed on probation for an additional three years; between 1991 and 1993, Mr. Kastigar dispensed Percodan, a Schedule II controlled substance, and anabolic steroids, Schedule III controlled substances, to several individuals without a valid physician's authorization; on October 21, 1993, Mr. Kastigar pled guilty to and was convicted of one count of unlawfully furnishing a controlled substance, in the Municipal Court for the South Bay Judicial District, County of Los Angeles, State of California; and Mr. Kastigar materially falsified an application for a DEA Certificate of Registration, submitted on June 4, 1993, by indicating on such application that he had never surrendered a DEA Certificate of Registration, when in fact Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration had been surrendered on April 27, 1993, and by also indicating on the application that he had never had a state license suspended or placed on probation, when in fact his pharmacist's license as well as Respondent's license had been suspended and placed on probation by the Pharmacy Board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Order to Show Cause was sent to Respondent by registered mail. More than thirty days have passed since the Order to Show Cause was received by Respondent and the DEA has received no response thereto. Pursuant to 21 CFR 11301. 54(d) and 1301.54(e), Respondent is deemed to have waived his opportunity for a hearing. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator now enters his final order in this matter without a hearing and based upon the investigative file. 21 CFR 1301.57. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1983, the Pharmacy Board filed an accusation against Respondent pharmacy and Mr. Kastigar alleging,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , that an audit revealed significant shortages for a number of controlled substances and that Mr. Kastigar filled numerous controlled substance prescriptions issued under circumstances in which he knew or should have known that such prescriptions were not issued for a legitimate medical reason. Based upon a consent decree, Respondent and Mr. Kastigar admitted the allegations. Both agreed to a thirty day suspension and a three year probationary term, effective June 28, 1985. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 20, 1987, the Pharmacy Board issued another accusation against Mr. Kastigar based upon allegations that he dispensed propoxyphene, a Schedule IV controlled substance, to an individual without a valid physician's authorization. Mr. Kastigar entered into a second consent decree with the Pharmacy Board. Again, he admitted to the accusations and his pharmacist's license was suspended for another thirty days and placed on probation for another three years, effective June 24, 1988. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequent investigation by the California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement revealed that Mr. Kastigar dispensed Percodan, a Schedule II controlled substance, and anabolic steroids, a Schedule III controlled substance, to several individuals without a physician's authorization between January 1991 and April 1993. A search warrant was served on Respondent pharmacy on March 25, 1993. Mr. Kastigar was interviewed at that time and admitted some of the allegations concerning the unlawful dispensing of the Percodan and anabolic steroids. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 26, 1993, Mr. Kastigar was charged in the Municipal Court for the South Bay Judicial District, County of Los Angeles, State of California, with eleven counts of the unlawful furnishing of controlled substances and two counts of dispensing controlled substances without a medical purpose. On September 23, 1993, Mr. Kastigar entered into a plea agreement whereby he agreed to plea no contest to one felony count of the unlawful furnishing of a controlled substance and agreed to a sentence of three years probation. The conditions of the probation included,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 250 hours of community service, a $15,000 fine, the surrender of his pharmacist's license and surrender of medicare and medicaid privileges. On October 21, 1993, Mr. Kastigar entered the plea pursuant to the agreement and was convicted and sentenced pursuant to the plea agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Kastigar voluntarily surrendered Respondent pharmacy's previous DEA Certificate of Registration, AK2083119, on April 27, 1993. On June 4, 1993, Mr. Kastigar submitted an application to obtain a new DEA Certificate of Registration for Respondent pharmacy. On this application, he indicated that he had never surrendered a DEA Certificate of Registration. He also indicated on this application that he never had a state professional license suspended or placed on probation, notwithstanding that the California Pharmacy Board had taken action against both Respondent and its owner in 1985 and 1988, as noted above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In evaluating whether Respondent's registration by the Drug Enforcement Administration would be inconsistent with the public interest, the Deputy Administrator considers the factors enumerated in 21 U.S.C. 823(f). They are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

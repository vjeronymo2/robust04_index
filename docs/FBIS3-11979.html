Paz Zamora admitted making mistakes but  not commiting crimes during his government.    The news hit Movement of the Revolutionary Left [MIR]  followers the hardest. They took the news in silence. The  possibility of a meeting of party leaders to analyze the issue  here has not been ruled out. The population, meanwhile,  compares Jaime Paz Zamora with a captain who abandoned ship  without clarifying the accusations against his party.    Chuquisaca Peasant Leader Octavio Flores said he was  surprised because politicians involved in trafficking are not  tried based on Law 1008. Bolivian jails contain many peasants  who were involved in drug production out of need and now are  serving sentences of up to 15 years. On the other hand, the  trafficking kingpins have laws of repentance or are able to hide  behind political activities. [passage omitted]</p>

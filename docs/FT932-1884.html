			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): The banks' side of the argument - In a Nutshell The banks have been heavily criticised over the past two years for their frequently inconsiderate treatment of small businesses. But the banks are businesses too and the failings have not been only on one side. Understanding Your Bank Manager might be the sub-title of Banking on the 1990s*, a guide from accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn. This is not so much a 'how to' guide on negotiating an overdraft but more an explanation of why the banks act as they do. Once business owners understand how banks work they should be better able to deal with the bank manager and present their case for funding. *Special Briefing No 83. Publications Department, BDO Binder Hamlyn, 20 Old Bailey, London EC4M 7BH. 11 pages. Free.</p>

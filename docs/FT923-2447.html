			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / R-R aerospace offshoot offers 4.25% pay rise ROLLS-ROYCE'S aerospace division is offering many employees pay rises of 4.25 per cent in a move that will end a nine-month pay freeze and further ameliorate some of the damage caused by the way the freeze was implemented. Although the company does not conduct national pay negotiations, employees at various plants around the country have been presented with identical offers. Mr Tony McCandless, convener for the AEU engineering union at Derby, where the company has its largest plant, said: 'This looks like a corporate offer.' He said manual workers at Derby and employees at two Scottish plants had been offered 4.25 per cent and that white-collar workers at Derby and Bristol had accepted the same. 'After nine months without a rise, we are slightly disappointed - but at Derby we are likely to put it to the workforce.' With the offer nearly 0.5 percentage points above inflation, the likelihood is that the workforce will approve a deal. Rolls-Royce's aerospace division caused widespread anger among its 34,000 employees last year when it announced a six-month pay freeze and said it was terminating current contracts and replacing them with new ones so that it could implement the freeze. Some workers interpreted the move as meaning they would be dismissed unless they signed new contracts. The company's action was widely viewed as heavy-handed and notices about the contract changes were withdrawn. The pay freeze was extended in subsequent negotiations. The 4.25 per cent offer, which will cover nine months at Derby, is about the average in current pay settlements. An example of a higher offer was provided by British Sugar this week. It agreed to raise the pay of 1,200 workers by 5 per cent and decrease the working week from 39 hours to 37.</p>

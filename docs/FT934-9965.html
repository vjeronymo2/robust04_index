			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Securitised Endowment Contracts for USM SECURITISED Endowment Contracts, a company which buys and sells second hand with profits insurance policies, is to join the Unlisted Securities Market via a placing. SEC, which only started trading in August 1991, says it has already become the second largest trader in endowment policies, with an 11 per cent market share. People who have taken out with profits endowment policies usually find it more profitable to sell them to a market maker than to surrender them to the insurance company. Market makers then sell them to other investors who are attracted by the relative security of endowment policies and by the prospect of capital gain, which can be attractive for tax planning purposes. SEC was founded by three men; Mr Max Rosen, a former director of independent financial advisers Investors Planning Associates, who is managing director; Mr Jeffrey Pinnick, a chartered accountant who is finance director; and Mr Bernard Klug, who is the executive director with responsibility for corporate planning and development. Mr Klug was formerly a non-executive director of a third market company called Honorbilt which went into administrative receivership in 1990. Pre-tax profits at SEC rose from Pounds 176,000 to Pounds 745,000 in the year to September 30, 1993. Turnover in the two years was Pounds 4.15m and Pounds 10.85m respectively. The company is the second endowment policy market-maker to float this year after Policy Portfolio, shares of which fell back on Friday night to the issue price of 130p. SEC is expected to have a market capitalisation of between Pounds 10 and Pounds 11m, and will raise about Pounds 5m. Some Pounds 3.5m of this will be new money and will be used to pay off bank debt and expand the capital base of the company, allowing it to hold more policies in stock.</p>

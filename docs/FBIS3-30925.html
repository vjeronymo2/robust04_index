Bosnian Serb and Moslem military officials agreed in  principle Wednesday on a Sarajevo ceasefire, due to come into  effect at midday Thursday (1100 GMT), and pledged to remove  their heavy weapons from around the beseiged capital, UN local  commander General Michael Rose said. [passage omitted]    The head of the self-declared Bosnian Serb parliament,  Momcilo Krajisnik, meanwhile cast immediate doubts on ceasefire  deal, worked out at Sarajevo airport.    He said the Serbs would announce the conditions under which  they would withdraw their heavy artillery at Thursday's talks  here. [passage omitted]    The agreement was given a cautious welcome by EC mediator  Lord Owen, who said: "People sign things and don't always live  up to them."    But he added: "Frankly I think (the agreement) will prove to  be a lot more productive (than NATO air strikes)."    Rose had announced after the airport meeting that he had  reached the agreement "with full consent of their political and  military authorities."    But confusion arose when Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic  reported that the truce airport agreement included a five-day  deadline for implementation.    That was immediately denied by the UN Protection Forces, and  a spokesman, who asked to remain anonymous stressed: "Mr.  Izetbegovic's version is very different. And since no document  was signed, for the moment this is only a verbal agreement."    The second-in-command of the mainly-Moslem Bosnian Army  Jovan  Divjak, who was also present at the three-hour airport meeting,  said he had no faith in the accord.    "It's a game by the Serbs to get out of the bind they are in  after the massacre they carried out the other day." [passage  omitted]</p>

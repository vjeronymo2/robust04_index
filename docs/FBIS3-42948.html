			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mike Davidow: "Selfish Hypocrisy: Why the U.S. </F> Government Supports the Pseudo-Reforms in Russia"]    [Text] My last trip to the United States put me in the  position of the sole American correspondent in Moscow who had  been in the House of Soviets (the Russian "White House") during  the assault on it on the orders of Boris Yeltsin. When I and my  wife Lena made our way out of the charred and blackened "White  House," which had been shot up, I was greeted by a television  cameraman of the ABC company.    "Hey, Mike," he shouted. "What was it like inside?"    I angrily told him. Never previously when I had returned  home  had the chief of ABC's Moscow bureau requested an on-the-spot  interview. But that evening, as several days later also,  millions of Americans saw the first witness to describe his  vision from inside the House of Soviets building of the crime of  the century blessed by our American president.    When I arrived in New York, therefore, there was already  considerable interest in the true picture of what had happened  in Moscow those tragic October days. And this was in direct  contrast to what had been portrayed by the pro-Yeltsin news  media on the payroll of American big business.    In San Francisco I saw full coverage of these events, some  of  which had been shown on Russian television also. President  Yeltsin's shooting up of parliament with tank guns was presented  to the American people as a forced response to the rebellion of  "renegade legislators"!    Never prior to that particular time when I arrived in New  York had WBAI Radio, which is popular in the United States,  sought an interview with me. On this occasion the interest in me  was enormous, and I was invited to take part in a 90-minute  interview. More precisely, this was my dialogue with this  station's Moscow stringer.    In San Francisco I was interviewed by the correspondent of  another popular radio station--KPFA. And this interview also  aroused great interest. Maria Glardin from the Media Center,  which serves 40 radio stations of the United States, Canada, and  New Zealand, conducted a two-hour interview with me. Thus,  thanks to these television and radio appearances of mine, at  least the Americans (not, alas, Russian people, who are informed  by television and radio which is controlled by Yeltsin's team)  were able to learn the truth about the bloody carnage in Moscow.    I spoke, in addition, at meetings in New York, Chicago, Gary  (the center of the steel industry), San Francisco, and Los  Angeles. And everywhere people were moved to the bottom of their  hearts. And it was by no means a question of my eloquence.  People were affected by the greatest tragedy of the 20th  century, which Russia is experiencing, itself! Many of those in  my audience had been to the Soviet Union. They had seen this  country's sole privileged class--children. They had visited the  practically free kindergarten and summer pioneer camps. They had  made the acquaintance of students, who had not only acquired a  free higher education but who were, in addition, being paid  grants not devoured by hyperinflation. They had experienced such  a blessing as the possibility of strolling the streets of Moscow  at night without fear or risk. Some of them had been members of  a delegation of working America at the May celebrations in Red  Square. And now, not far from Red Square, officers and soldiers  of the Soviet Army, which had been the admiration of the world  and which had saved mankind from fascism, were participating in  the slaughter of their own people! One elderly woman from San  Francisco uttered words that are etched in my memory forever.  She said:    "I saw on television how thousands of Muscovites looked on  calmly as tanks shot up the parliament building. What has  happened to Soviet people?"    This question awaits an answer from Russians themselves and  other peoples of the former Soviet Union. And I believe that  this answer will be forthcoming. I have attempted in my book  "Perestroyka: Its Rise and Fall," which has just been published  in the United States (the title of its Russian edition is "Quo  Vadis, Rus?"), to provide an explanation for this. And we  Americans also are required, in turn, to answer the just as  painful question:    "How was it that the progressive community of the United  States failed to raise its voice in protest against the evil  deed perpetrated in Russia?"    And I have to emphasize particularly in answering these and  similar questions that I have the most profound respect for the  courageous defenders of the Russian parliament and Constitution.  And I know that the majority even of those who avail themselves  of information from the biased pro-Yeltsin publications feel  that the whole truth concerning these events has far from been  spoken as yet. Was this not why Yeltsin's supporters suffered a  crushing defeat at the 12 December elections? And is this not a  sign that the mass of the Russian people disagree with both the  capitalization and the Americanization of their country? This  was understood even by Senator Sam Nunn, the head of the  influential Senate Armed Services Committee. He was very candid  in his comments on what happened in Russia:    "The experience of the Russian people's familiarization with  capitalism has convinced them that it is like the law of the  jungle."    And the leading American weekly THE NATION was even more  candid and curt: "Capitalism is returning to Russia up to its  knees in blood" (25 October 1993). "Results of the elections in  Russia: New image smashed to smithereens"--this was the heading  that THE NEW YORK TIMES gave a report from Moscow on 15 December  1993.    From all that I saw, I concluded that the Clinton  administration will do everything in its power to impose  capitalism on Russia. It has a dual purpose here: first, to  strengthen capitalism in Russia, which means the complete  eradication of socialism; second, to guarantee that Russia not  surmount the disintegration imposed on it by the  Yeltsin-Kravchuk-Shushkevich conspiracy. And this means  primarily that the restoration of a renewed USSR will be  prevented. With Yeltsin or without him (and U.S. imperialism  recognizes that it will never have another chance), this is its  main goal.    I believe that the Clinton administration understands the  need for greater flexibility in its relations with the political  forces in Russia. But it would be a serious delusion to confuse  this flexibility with the main aim: the spread of the laws of  the capitalist jungle to Russia and other former republics of  the USSR. The Clinton administration has latched onto the  impressive victory of Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party at  the recent elections to start howling about the fascist threat  in Russia. The hypocrisy of such a campaign is obvious. Where  there were, indeed, real fascist-type threats expressed not in  inflammatory words but in deeds--Yeltsin's violation of the  effective Constitution, his dissolution of the Supreme Soviet  and the Congress of People's Deputies, the shooting up of the  House of Soviets, which cost the lives of at least 1,000  persons--where were the U.S. statesmen then? Where was our  American parliament when the Russian parliament was calling on  it to speak out in defense of the rights of parliament and the  Constitution?    As I can see, the ultranationalist and provocative rhetoric  of Zhirinovskiy is playing into the hands of U.S. imperialism,  providing cover for its aggressive policy. In actual fact, it is  concerned by no means by the ultranationalism of Zhirinovskiy.  It is intimidated by the growing patriotic movement against the  collapse of the millennial Russian state, against the selling  off of Russia bit by bit to the United States and Western  capital. It is declaring a "threat" the legitimate aspiration to  the restoration of a renewed USSR and to the defense of Russian  national interests and the human rights of the 25 million  Russian people who have become stateless persons. They [as  published] are beating the drum, trumpeting the fascist threat  in Russia to justify their high-handed interference in Russia's  affairs (which, in turn, is fostering ultranationalism!). They  are focusing attention on Zhirinovskiy in order that, in  comparison with him, Yeltsin might look "good."    But it would be a mistake to underestimate both the danger  of  ultranationalism in Russia and the capacity of U.S. imperialism  for using the provocative rhetoric of Zhirinovskiy to galvanize  the myth of the "Russian threat." It should be remembered in  this connection that the American people were fed the tale of  the "Russian threat" for seven decades.    Finally, my trip to the United States enabled me to take  part  in the work of the National Leadership of the Communist Party of  the United States when the international solidarity of the world  communist movement was being debated. An appeal signed by Gus  Hall, a veteran of the Communist Party and its leader, was  adopted. It said, in particular: "We are well aware that our own  imperialism creates a threat to peace, social progress, and  national independence throughout the world....and their appetite  has grown considerably in connection with the disintegration of  the Soviet Union." Hall welcomed the recent regional meetings  and the international symposium, but observed that it was not  the high level of communist unity at which world realities had  to be met. The question of the nature and causes of the  opportunism that has eaten away at certain socialist societies  also is on the agenda at these meetings. There was also an  appeal for the discussion at the international level of the  events occurring in Russia. As it said, "We are convinced of the  durability and revival of the parties that the bourgeoisie has  pronounced dead."</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Technology: To spray or not to spray - Should chemical dispersants be used to clean up the Shetland oil spill? Clive Cookson examines the debate As the storm around Shetland begins to abate, arguments are raging about the wisdom of using chemicals and biological agents to clean up the 85,000 tonnes of crude oil spewing out of the stricken tanker Braer. On the one hand are environmental groups and local fishermen who argue that the best policy is to let nature take its course, however slowly, because materials introduced to break up the oil more quickly may do more harm than the spill itself. On the other hand, government agencies and the oil industry feel that public opinion requires them to take action - a policy of doing as little as possible would not be acceptable. They are encouraged by companies promoting products and services designed to clean up pollution. Official UK policy is to rely on chemical dispersants as a first line of attack on spills, with mechanical methods of oil recovery playing a secondary role. As the US congressional Office of Technology Assessment pointed out in a recent report on oil spill policies, the British approach contrasts with many other countries that rely primarily on mechanical equipment. This includes floating booms to contain the slick, skimmers which remove the oil from the sea surface and pumps to suck it back into clean-up vessels. But the Department of Transport's Marine Pollution Control Unit argues that the rough seas and stormy weather typical of the British Isles make it difficult to use mechanical methods. And recent advances in dispersants have made them less toxic than 10 or 20 years ago, when such chemicals were much more poisonous than the oil they were meant to break up. Yesterday the MPCU's six Dakota aircraft sprayed the slick around Braer with 120 tonnes of dispersants - chemicals related to the surfactants incorporated in domestic detergents and washing-up liquids. Andrew Lees, Friends of the Earth campaigns director, condemned the spraying as likely to aggravate the disaster. It would cause oil droplets to agglomerate in the top few metres of the sea, where they could poison organisms that would not be affected by an untreated slick. 'The glamour factor shouldn't be overlooked - television pictures of the minister standing on the cliff and Dakotas coming in to save the day,' he said. Dispersants need to be sprayed within two or three days of a spillage if they are to work effectively, because the oil becomes more viscous and therefore less susceptible to chemical attack as its more volatile components evaporate. When it comes to the longer term strategy for cleaning thick black gunge off Shetland's coastline, the main controversy is likely to involve bioremediation - using micro-organisms to devour pollutants. The technology has been developed over the last five years or so. It takes advantage of the fact that some bacteria have evolved to convert the hydrocarbons in oil into carbon dioxide and water (the microbes normally live off the seepages of oil and tar which occur quite widely in nature). Bioremediation was first applied on a large oil spill after the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, when a 70-mile stretch of Alaskan shoreline was sprayed with fertilisers containing phosphorous and nitrogen compounds in an attempt to provide more nutrients for the natural oil-eating bacteria. The US Environmental Protection Agency said last year that the exercise had successfully speeded up the oil's disappearance without harmful side-effects but it admitted there was no scientific proof that it had made any difference. Much of the Alaskan clean-up was accomplished by mechanical and manual methods; teams of volunteers and paid workers removed tonnes of contaminated sand and scrubbed thousands of rocks by hand. Then in 1990 bioremediation was used to combat the spillage of 5.1m gallons of crude oil from the Mega Borg into the Gulf of Mexico. The clean-up team sprayed a mixture of oil-consuming bacteria and nutrients directly on to the slick in the open sea. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Texas Water Commission said in a report two months ago that the spill's environmental impact had been minimal but again there was no clear evidence about the effect of bioremediation. International Bioremediation Services, a UK company based in the West Midlands, wants to use its cocktail of nine bacterial strains - shown in laboratory tests at the University of Wolverhampton to have a voracious appetite for Norwegian crude oil - on the Shetland coast. Artur Haslimann, IBS chairman, says the product has successfully tackled oil spillages of up to 65,000 gallons on land, lakes and rivers. It could clean up beaches contaminated by the Braer 'within months' even if the oil had sunk deep into the ground, he says. 'When their food source has gone, the bacteria die and there is no further problem with them.' However, environmentalists are not convinced that the benefits of bioremediation outweigh its risks. They are concerned about the ecological effect not only of increased microbial levels but also of the nutrients applied with them, which could stimulate the growth of unwanted organisms such as slimy green algae. 'We're wary too of the 'magic bullet' philosophy, according to which it doesn't really matter what gets spilled because designer bugs can always come in and sort it out for you.' Lees says. 'Far better to put more effort into preventing the disaster happening in the first place.'</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (1): The wealth creators - Keynote / Andrew Baxter says that a shift in official attitudes has been matched by the perception that companies can do more for themselves WHAT MAKES a successful engineering company? And why are their successes important, not just to their workers and shareholders, but to the health and prosperity of national economies and individuals? For a UK economy emerging tentatively from recession these are vital questions, which are now demanding answers after a decade in which they were often barely asked. For European economies heading the other way, the confidence that they found the answers long ago is being shaken by a downturn of unprecedented severity. The past year has seen a dramatic shift in official attitudes towards engineering and manufacturing in the UK. The mid-1980s philosophy of reliance on service industries for economic growth is now almost universally discredited, and in combination with two severe recessions has produced a depleted and often demoralised manufacturing sector. As fears grow that the 'critical mass' of the UK's manufacturing industry - and its engineering sector in particular - is not big enough to sustain a recovery, the lobbying for a new attitude from the government towards industry, for enhancing the status of engineers, and for improving education and training has been given fresh impetus. This pressure is important, and is clearly being received and understood - at the Department of Trade and Industry if not the Treasury. But engineering companies are waking up to the fact that the future lies in their hands too, with new products, manufacturing techniques and organisation, and better marketing. Mr Frank Turner, managing director of Lucas Industries' aerospace business and former director of the Rolls-Royce civil engines business, emphasised this point in last year's Sir Alfred Herbert lecture. Much has been written, he said, about the state of manufacturing industry in Britain, with the blame being placed on the government, managements, unions, the UK's culture and a variety of other factors. 'Few have addressed what we within manufacturing industry could do, should do and perhaps in some cases are already doing to ensure the future success of British manufacturing.' To make a 'real' contribution to the British economy, he said, profits must come from 'real' wealth creation. 'This is a role engineers can uniquely perform as compared to the many who concentrate on wealth manipulation.' Mr Turner saw two major options for UK engineering. It could achieve a higher profit through product differentiation, which comes from technical superiority, product integrity and short time to market, and/or through lower costs in manufacturing, sales and support. The message, therefore, is that however strong the case might be for a government role in industry - at the very least in helping to spread the message about 'world class' techniques and skills - there is so much that companies can do themselves to improve their performance at the grassroots. There is, after all, plenty of help available. The Confederation of British Industry's national manufacturing council is seen externally as being in the lobbying business, but internally sees its most important role as spreading the word about best practice throughout manufacturing industry. Apart from employer associations such as the CBI and the Engineering Employers Federation, there are the engineering professional institutions, manufacturing consultancies and the Engineering Council - which has made considerable headway in promoting engineering as an interesting and attractive career. All these have a role to play, directly or indirectly, in ensuring that engineering companies have the right inputs - people and ideas  -to be successful. Ultimately, however, engineering companies have a responsibility for ensuring that they give themselves the best possible chance to make a profit  -whatever the external business conditions. In this, the large UK companies which have taken on board all or most of the features of modern manufacturing - concurrent engineering, continuous product development, leaner production and more market-conscious management  -have a particular duty. These same features need to be instilled in subcontractors, and in their suppliers too, to ensure a much better spread of manufacturing excellence throughout the engineering industry. Mr Turner, likening the situation to a 'food chain', took the airline industry as an example: there are seven groups in the chain: the ultimate customer or fare-paying passenger, the airline, the aircraft manufacturer, the aero-engine manufacturer, the supplier, the forger or foundry, and the raw material supplier. 'The efficiency and profitability of any one of these seven groups will have an effect on, or depend on the profitability of, the others,' he says. The message about having the right ingredients to succeed goes well beyond the UK. In European countries, many engineering companies are not subjected to the same kind of rate-of-return constraints as in the UK, and operate in a different, largely more favourable, engineering culture. But now - and especially in Germany - they are missing one of the vital ingredients for making a profit, the ability to manage in a crisis. 'What we need is some of your UK managers, you have so much experience of this,' said a German engineering executive recently. Within Europe, therefore, different countries and cultures can learn from each other about how to engineer for profit. The aim must be to create a virtuous circle of innovation, profit and investment. 'There is a real need to generate more profit from manufacturing companies to sustain investment in new plant and new products on which all our future prospects depend,' said Mr Ron Garrick, Weir Group's chief executive, in last year's Engineering Manufacturing Forum lecture. Weir is one of a number of companies of differing sizes and nationalities featured in this survey which have learnt, often through adversity, how to use their ingenuity to engineer for a profit. For individual companies, innovation and fresh thinking bolster the bottom line, but are also important in a broader context: the success of engineering companies contributes to economic growth and prosperity, and emphasises a message that people in manufacturing should shout from the rooftops - engineering matters.</p>

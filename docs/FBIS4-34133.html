			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] President Guillermo Endara has  said that our country must be readmitted to the Rio Group, from  which it was expelled when the military dictatorship ruled  Panama.    [Begin Endara recording] I wish to bring to the attention of  the appropriate heads of state a topic that I believe is of  great importance and fairness for Panama and the Panamanian  people. I am referring to the readmission of Panama as a full  member of the permanent group for political dialogue and unity,  better known as the Rio Group.    In February 1988, when Dictator Noriega overthrew the  makeshift civilian president, right here in Cartagena, the Group  of Eight suspended Panama from the group disclosing before the  whole world the real anti-democratic form of government ruling  my country at that time. I am taking this opportunity, this  very important meeting, to express my wishes because it is my  most heartfelt desire to see my people completely incorporated  within Latin America before I leave office.    Today, having consolidated democracy, we have the moral  authority to request that we be rightfully readmitted to a group  that is very important. This will contribute to strengthening  our integrating capacity for South and Central America, this  latter region that, after many sacrifices, deserves the greatest  praise. [end recording]</p>

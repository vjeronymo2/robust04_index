			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Tokyo The reappearance of foreign demand, coupled with continued demand by domestic public funds, enabled the Nikkei 225 to regain the 19,000 level last week, although low trading volumes, down to 210m shares on Friday, raise questions about where the market is heading this week. The market will be awaiting Friday's publication of November's Tankan economic survey. James Capel expects the results to show continued improvement in business conditions. Both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing indices are expected to show clear improvement with companies more bullish about their sales and profits expectations. Capels adds that companies of all sizes will continue to report no difficulty in obtaining funds, laying to rest the suggestion that Japan may suffer from a credit crunch during the recovery phase.

			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD IRISH HOIST A TOAST TO GENE KELLY  </P> <P> "So this is what a gathering of the Hollywood-Irish clan looks like," Pierce  Brosnan said while performing emcee duties at Thursday night's American Ireland  Fund salute to Gene Kelly.  </P> <P> Yes, the gathering at the Regent Beverly Wilshire drew the Hollywood-Irish  contingent plus other ethnic combinations, including three or four generations  of stars -- from John Travolta ("My mom's Irish and I grew up in an Irish  neighborhood") to Charles Bronson ("Russian and Lithuanian") to Jimmy Stewart  and Ruby Keeler, as well as behind-the-scenes industry types such as Lili and  Richard Zanuck and Lew and Edie Wasserman.  </P> <P> Barbara and Marvin Davis, presumably having recuperated from their own recent  extravaganza/fund-raiser for diabetes, were back on the circuit again, although  Barbara vowed there would be no encore of the Carousel gala for a few years.  </P> <P> "Three-quarters Irish, one-quarter French," honorary chairman Donald O'Connor  said of his own heritage.  </P> <P> "Actually, take out the part that I'm French. Nobody here would ever speak to  me again."  </P> <P> Padraic MacKernan, Irish ambassador to the United States, allowed that "it's  amazing at a thing like this how many people have Irish connections, by family  or by affection."  </P> <P> The event, stressed everyone concerned, was apolitical. Three years ago, the  American Ireland Fund was established to support Irish cultural heritage and  philanthropic activities in Ireland and to encourage peace-seeking efforts.  </P> <P> After all kinds of entertainment, including the McGing Irish Dancers (actually  from Cincinnati) and the Young Dubliners rock group (Southern California),  Kelly received a pair of dancing shoes hand-cut by Galway Irish Crystal.  </P> <P> After the 3 1/2-hour dinner and program ended, restaurateur Jimmy Murphy  continued the celebration with an Irish "hooley" at Jimmy's where he was  serving plenty of Guinness.  </P></p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Co-op Bank pay offer rejected BIFU, the banking union, yesterday rejected an offer from the Co-operative Bank which it said would mean a pay freeze for nearly a third of staff. The union says the bank wants to freeze the pay of staff paid above 'market rates' in a switch to a system of performance-related pay. The union said it was also unhappy that the bank had refused to give 'cast iron' guarantees that there would be no compulsory redundancies. The bank said that more than 1,000 workers had taken voluntary redundancy over the past two years and that it intended to continue shedding jobs voluntarily.</p>

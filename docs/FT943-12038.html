			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Shandwick ahead by 42% to Pounds 2.47m Pre-tax profits at Shandwick, the public relations company, rose by 42 per cent from Pounds 1.73m to Pounds 2.47m in the six months to the end of April, despite a 2 per cent fall in turnover to Pounds 78.7m, against Pounds 80.2m. Mr Peter Gummer, chairman, said: 'The slow start in North America initially held back both operating income and profits, but towards the end of the half year there was a significant upturn in trading in the region.' North America accounts for more than half of Shandwick's worldwide business, and margins fell from 19.2 per cent to 18.9 per cent because of new business expenses. 'Ground lost in the early months in North America has been recovered and subsequent trading results are well ahead of the comparable period last year,' said Mr Gummer. New business levels were 'encouraging', he added. Shandwick, which raised Pounds 18.9m with a rights issue in March, said Pounds 16.9m of this would be used to reduce bank borrowings. Net debt stood at Pounds 69.2m at April 30, up Pounds 1.9m on the previous year. Earn-out payments, a hangover from a string of acquisitions in the late 1980s, are estimated at Pounds 2.1m for the year to end-October, of which Pounds 1.7m has been paid. Earn-out payments for the next two years are estimated at Pounds 5.5m and all earn-outs end in 1996. Earnings per share were maintained at 1.7p, and an interim dividend of 0.43p (nil) is declared.</p>

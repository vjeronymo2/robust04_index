			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of State Bernd Schmidbauer by Einar </F> Koch; place and date not given: "Bonn Intelligence Service  Minister: Why We Still Need Spies"]    [Text] [Koch] The Russians are claiming that they have  exposed a German spy. Is that correct?    [Schmidbauer] Moscow briefed us on the arrest of a Russian  citizen who is accused of having worked for the Federal  Intelligence Service [BND]. I cannot confirm that at all. I had  an exhaustive talk with Safanov, head of the counterintelligence  service. We decided that the Russian side will approach us as  soon as more detailed information is available. Moreover, I  asked BND President Porzner to keep me abreast of things. Mr.  Porzner will return prematurely from his visit to Moscow. The  next steps will then have to be considered very calmly. It is  now the turn of the Russian side. The FRG Government is  interested in avoiding political complications. In view of our  previous good cooperation with the Russian side, we are  confident that all irritations will be eliminated.    [Koch] Is this the Russians' revenge for KGB agent Ames in  Washington?    [Schmidbauer] I do not rule out that the Ames psychosis is  spreading among the Russians, since alleged members of other  Western services have also been arrested in Moscow.    [Koch] After the end of the East-West confrontation, do we  still have to spy on each other at all?    [Schmidbauer] In the world as it has developed, it is  indispensable that the governments procure information. We need  the intelligence services for it. The work of Western  intelligence services was and is not an aggressive activity. It  is legally controlled.</p>

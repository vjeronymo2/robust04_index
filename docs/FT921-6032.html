			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At A Glance): Eagle Star cuts bonuses Eagle Star Life has announced reduced reversionary and terminal bonuses on its endowment and pension policies. Using the standard industry assumptions that a policy was started by a 29-year-old man investing Pounds 30 per month, 10-year pay-outs dropped from Pounds 7,449 to Pounds 6,896, while 25-year maturity values fell from Pounds 62,785 to Pounds 61,910. This is in line with the industrial trend for 10-year policies to see a much sharper cut than 25-year contracts.</p>

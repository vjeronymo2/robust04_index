			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar suppliers seek CAP reform compensation CARIBBEAN countries that supply sugar to the European Community are asking the community to consider compensation for the lower prices they expect to result from agricultural policy reform. At their annual summit here, leaders of the Caribbean Economic Community (Caricom) said that, although proposals for the reform of the European Community's sugar regime had not yet been finalised, 'the principle of compensatory payments to EC farmers has already been agreed'. The Caricom leaders said the compensation should be paid to all members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group that supply sugar to the community. The ACP states supply 1.3m tonnes a year under quota. The price they receive has been determined traditionally by the price paid to the EC's domestic producers. 'The European Community has always maintained that ACP cane sugar should be treated on par with community sugar,' the heads of government said. They said the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations and the reform of the European Community's common agricultural policy 'could result in a dramatic reduction in the price of sugar, which would reduce the income earned by the industry'. Caribbean government officials have said that, if current proposals on sugar within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade were implemented, the ACP states could lose about 8 per cent of their earnings from the sales to the community. ACP producers receive an average price of Pounds 349 a tonne from the EC. The ACP producers are also hoping to increase the volume supplied to the community through increased access to Portugal. Representatives of the Sugar Association of the Caribbean, a federation of regional producers, said there has been 'little progress' in efforts to widen the Portuguese market. Since it joined the EC in 1986 Portugal has been allowed to import some of its sugar from the world market, and to buy some from some ACP producers, but at world market prices. ACP officials say the termination of this transitional arrangement at the end of this year will coincide with efforts by the group to have Portugal's purchases from the ACP at world market prices and the country's additional world market requirements both added to the ACP's quota.</p>

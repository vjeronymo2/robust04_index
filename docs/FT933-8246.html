			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Options rise can stabilise copper market Sir, Kenneth Gooding's article 'Copper market responds to 'rogue' element' (August 13) gives the impression that the massive increase in option activity in the copper market over the past few years has been disruptive and destabilising. However, I believe the opposite to be the case. Primary copper producers and others are developing a keen appetite for options. The granters and users of options are the new managers of risk and the principal providers of liquidity, and even of greater stability in the marketplace. They will help avert - or at least mitigate - critical times in the future. Gooding correctly paraphrases my remarks in Metals and Minerals Annual Review on the subject of London Metal Exchange warehouses in other key industrial areas. But I was deliberately non-specific about suitable new locations. I believe that LME warehouses in the US for copper (the LME has them for all other base metals) would seriously threaten the continued viability of the Comex copper market, which is the only base metal futures contract in the US. The arbitrage between the LME and the Comex copper contracts would be undermined and destroyed. Valuable liquidity would be lost to the LME and might not be adequately replaced, at least in the near term, by other business from the US. Finally, your leading article 'A scrap over aluminium' (August 13) addresses the European Community restrictions on aluminium imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States. The European aluminium producers who pressed for those restrictions clearly had their heads firmly in the sand while, Canute-like, they commanded the waters to recede. This attempt to gain EC protection demonstrates a lamentable lack of comprehension of how the market works. The aluminium market is international and the price will not be affected by the EC restrictions on imports of CIS material.

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Asylum plea for Haitians AMNESTY International, the British-based human rights group, urged the US yesterday to reconsider its policy towards Haitian asylum seekers, saying it was concerned over the fate of 500 Haitians who have been forcibly returned to the island, writes Stephen Fidler. It called on the US to make sure that the 7,000 Haitians who have sought refuge in the US get a fair asylum hearing. The US holds that Haitians - unlike Cubans - are economic refugees rather than political refugees, and therefore have no right of asylum. Amnesty said people attempting to leave the island had been severely beaten and arrested.</p>

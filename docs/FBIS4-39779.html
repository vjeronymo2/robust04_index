			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Leskov: "Amplification of Stories About </F> Those Responsible for Explosion at `LogoVAZ' Office"]    [Text] As everyone saw on "Ostankino," Boris Berezovskiy,  chairman of the "LogoVAZ" Board of Directors and general  director of the All-Russia Automobile Alliance, was wounded on  the evening of 7 June at the "LogoVAZ" company's reception  center as the result of a massive explosion. An explosive  device planted in an unoccupied car parked by the side of the  road detonated the moment the Mercedes-600 containing  Berezovskiy emerged though the gates of the reception center.  The driver of the Mercedes was killed on the spot by fragments  of the device, while Berezovskiy and his bodyguard, as well as  several passersby, were injured.    Late in the evening Berezovskiy, who received severe burns  to  the face and hands, was sent home from the hospital but is under  the constant observation of a doctor. The bodyguard is in a  very serious condition: He has lost his sight, and the lower  part of his face has been badly affected. It was only at midday  on 8 June that it became clear that his condition had, as the  doctors put it, "stabilized."    An official statement put out by the "LogoVAZ" board  describes the incident as a terrorist act aimed at killing  Berezovskiy. The version of events which maintains that this  was a chance occurrence, an attempt on the life of the owner of  the car containing the bomb, is being refuted. The grounds for  this are as follows. The explosive device was directional and  the mechanism itself was filled with many metal balls and  splinters which were spread over a distance of 150-200 meters.    It is most likely that the owner of the car which was blown  up, who was allegedly in the neighboring casino, does not exist.  Several witnesses claim that the car, which was completely  destroyed by the blast, had Lithuanian license plates.    The interpretation that it was linked to the allocation of  spheres of interest is denied in just as categorical a manner.  Indeed, "LogoVAZ" does not have any competitors in Russia in  terms of volumes of sales. However, last year a series of  explosions shook "LogoVAZ" parking lots in Moscow which the  company itself tried to investigate. As we were told in private  conversations, they succeeded in ascertaining who the terrorist  was. He turned out to be a half-crazy lone blackmailer  unconnected to any criminal groupings. Following the recent  incident, doubts about this verdict have only intensified.    At the same time, people at "LogoVAZ" maintain that neither  Berezovskiy nor "LogoVAZ" have recently been the victims of  intimidation. Unofficial sources assert that, considering the  realities of life in this country, the company could long ago  have reached a peace agreement with the capital's major mafia  structures. However, it is not really possible to monitor all  groups making money out of automobiles.    One interpretation of the attempt on Berezovskiy's life says  that recently this entrepreneur has significantly broadened his  range of activities and begun to pay greater attention to  politics. Berezovskiy, 47, is a corresponding member of the  Russian Academy of Sciences and the author of many scientific  works on the theory of management. It was he who was the  inspiration behind the first private industrial investment  project in Russia, "AVVA," to build a new giant automobile plant  in Tolyatti. That aside, Berezovskiy is the founder of  Russia's largest charitable foundation -- "Triumf."</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Bank is urged to shake up markets The Bank of England is likely to introduce changes in the sterling money market and government bond market after yesterday's release of two reports criticising some existing arrangements. The reports say the Bank must make changes to its sterling money market operations if London is to remain competitive as a financial centre and fight off rival claims from other European cities. In the reports, funded by the Corporation of London, Mr Norbert Schnadt, of the financial markets group at the London School of Economics, blames the Bank's mode of operation in the money market for recent volatility in the overnight interest rate - it has ranged from about 4.5 per cent to nearly 20 per cent. Mr Schnadt's main recommendations are: The Bank should replace outright bill purchases in its money-market operations with repurchase agreements (repos). The Bank would then lend cash against a wider set of eligible securities, including government bonds (gilts), as collateral. The Bank should extend the ability to borrow and lend gilts to a wider range of financial institutions, with the aim of establishing an 'open gilt repo system'. Treasury receipts should be paid into secured bank accounts rather than into the Exchequer accounts at the Bank, to reduce the size of the money-market shortage and make it more predictable. Britain should not introduce positive minimum reserve requirements. The result would be to allow a wider set of financial institutions and instruments to be involved in the Bank's operations, while making the money-market shortage more predictable and reducing the volatility of the overnight rate. The Bank says it is already working on some of the concerns expressed. It has already taken steps to reduce money-market shortages by introducing a fortnightly 'sale and repurchase', or gilt repo facility with effect from January 20. Mr Schnadt suggests the next logical step would be for the Bank to make more frequent use of the repo facility, which should make the idea of an open gilt repo more prominent and help establish a 'master' or standard repo agreement. The Bank seems unlikely to do this, and may instead move towards an open gilt repo system. There are concerns over whether banks and building societies are big enough holders of gilts for this step to be feasible, so the Bank might have to consider ways to improve the attractions of gilts for these holders, for example, by having more short-dated issues or by issuing floating rate gilts.

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen rises on official comments THE YEN enjoyed a strong rally against the dollar in early European trading yesterday after a Japanese government official suggested that exporters in his country would not feel constrained by the current exchange rate, writes James Blitz. The official, who was unnamed, said the pain threshold for Japanese exporters could be on the Y105 to Y95 range against the US dollar. Such comments have been made by officials before. But the US-Japanese trading relationship is an important issue at the G7 summit in Tokyo, and the market was sensitive to any news affecting the yen/dollar exchange rate. Another factor which pushed the yen higher was reported at the Tokyo summit on completing the Uruguay round of the Gatt. A move away from trade protectionism would initially give a strong boost to Japanese export penetration in western markets, improving their current account surplus. Both of these factors gave the yen a strong lift at the start of European trade. At 7 am London time the yen was at Y108.70 to the dollar, and had moved to a high for the day of Y106.77 within 3 hours. However, in the afternoon, the Japanese currency lost ground. Political turmoil in Japan remains a strong constraint on the yen's rise and there are fears of a hung parliament following elections this month. The yen closed in London at Y107.70 to the dollar, up Y0.50 on the day. It finished New York trading at Y107.55. The yen's strength came in spite of a firm performance by the dollar against the D-Mark. The US currency may have been boosted by the sharp rise in commodity prices in recent days, following continued flooding in the US Midwest. This has raised speculation of an upturn in US inflation, something that would have to be countered by a rise in short-term interest rates. The dollar ended at DM1.7075, up  3/4 pfennig on the day. The US currency also pushed the pound back through the Dollars 1.50 barrier to close in London at Dollars 1.4925, down 1 3/4 cents. In New York the dollar closed at DM1.7070 and Dollars 1.4935. Sterling's strong rise against the D-Mark in the past week was also checked. One dealer said yesterday that there had been strong selling of the pound in the US on Tuesday night after the UK currency hit DM2.57. After the powerful rise of recent days some profit-taking was to be expected. Another factor undermining sterling was the concern registered by EC officials over what was seen as the UK's huge structural budget deficit. The pound closed at DM2.5475, a fall of 2 pfennigs on the day. The French franc was a fraction weaker against the D-Mark, in spite of continuing speculation that the Bundesbank might cut its short-term interest rates again before its summer recess begins on July 29. The franc ended at FFr3.382 from a previous FFr3.381.</p>

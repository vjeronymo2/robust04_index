			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Josip Antic: "Good Vibrations"] </F>   [Text] Yes -- no -- yes! These binary oppositions with a  happy ending are one of the shortest ways of describing the  state-protocol battle of wits that the media promptly  communicated to the people of both states before the unofficial  visit of Milan Kucan, president of Slovenia, to Croatian  President Franjo Tudjman. In spite of the hesitations of the  important Slovene guest, the visit did take place as planned.  The Slovene side first did not understand the circumstances of  the presidential invitation, and then -- with the new summer  wave of tightening the interstate ropes -- whether 7 June was  the most suitable time for a one-day trip to Zagreb. Namely,  the short distance from the Slovene capital to the Croatian one  is still inversely proportionate to the great quantity of the  unresolved diplomatic luggage that the representatives of the  two states take out at the joint table. This should not be  surprising, since the Croatian and Slovene presidents last met  some 20 months ago -- although at that time they publicly stated  the willingness to meet at least once a year to develop good  neighborly relations.    At any rate, everything Franjo Tudjman took out of his  suitcase at Brdo near Kranj in 1992 to show Milan Kucan will now  be presented by Kucan to his host in Zagreb in a somewhat  different wrapping: the unresolved border issues, the untouched  legal infrastructure regarding the property issues, the  stagnation of the economic relations.... On the other hand, the  unresolved regime in the bay of Piran, the arguments with which  Croatia is building a border crossing at Plovanija, which  Slovenia disputes, the Slovene ownership of the company vacation  homes in Pineta, in which Croatia has accommodated refugees from  central Bosnia, the Ljubljanska Banka issue, and similar issues  will be discussed in a less abstract manner. Without the fear  of prejudicing matters, one thing that can be said before the  official announcements reach the media is that the two  presidents will find no concrete solutions.    One of the reasons is certainly the fact that the  competences  of the two state leaders, according to the constitutional  organization of their states, are not the same: The Croatian  president, who works within a semipresidential system, has more  authority than his Slovene counterpart. However, even if this  were not so, Croatian-Slovene relations have been so neglected  and negatively warmed-over -- which both sides are responsible  for -- that what is at the moment much more important for  unfreezing them is genuine relaxedness in issuing public  statements, rather than a false compromise that each of the  sides would soon interpret in their own way. This would mean  that the basic question -- if there is a joint willingness of  the two states to resolve the problems -- has been given a  positive answer, which would meet with quite a positive response  of the wider European circles. Good vibrations between Tudjman  and Kucan would also be an indicative message to the exponents  of the political tendencies that have been waiting at the  western side of the Adriatic for a chance to use the  disagreements between the "premature European babies" to their  own advantage. All in all, the greatest responsibility that  Tudjman and Kucan bear lies in creating a good atmosphere that  should soon prepare and prompt a new rythm at top-level  meetings: from those of Prime Ministers Drnovsek and Valentic  to those at the level of expert groups, which are dozing at the  moment. Everything else is a matter of interests. Whether they  will be coordinated or disunited depends on good will.</p>

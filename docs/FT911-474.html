			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Books: Bodily rituals IN PRAISE OF THE STEPMOTHER by Mario Vargas Llosa Faber Pounds 13.99, 149 pages THE PERUVIAN Mario Vargas Llosa's new novel is a book of intimacies and fantasies. Seldom have I encountered such a sensorily immediate piece of writing, one which better evokes bodily odours or summons up what might be called the body's organ music. Not since Joyce's Ulysses has the act of human excretion been so crisply and vividly rendered in prose. Daily ablutions, rituals of personal hygiene and far-flung exotica of the marriage-bed make up Llosa's chief subject-matter; though he also sustains a plot about the corruption by - rather than of - innocence, and builds a fancy novelistic structure whereby the chapters of the main narrative are interspersed with fantasy elaborations of (mostly) famous paintings, here reproduced on colour plates. The narrative concerns the second marriage of Don Rigoberto, cultivated manager of a Peruvian insurance company, and the complex reaction of his schoolboy son to the presence of his 40-year old stepmother Dona Lucrecia. The 'structure' focusses on the mythological prototypes, as represented in paintings, that lie behind the modern action and its psychology. Thus Don Rigoberto's delight in Dona Lucrecia's rump gives rise to Llosa's dramatisation of Jacob Jordaens's 1648 canvas, Candaules, King of Lydia, showing his wife to Prime Minister Gyges. Dona Lucrecia's feelings of attraction to her stepson are developed in a commentary on a Francois Boucher bower of bliss. A Francis Bacon elephant man becomes the mouthpiece for Don Rigoberto's feelings of monstrosity; and an abstract painting (1977) by one Fernando de Szyszlo is seen by young Alfonso as depicting his stepmother in all the fullness of her eroticism. The method, like Llosa's approach in general, may recall the work of Julian Barnes, whose History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters contains a fold-out colour reproduction of Gericault's Raft of the Medusa. Here it makes, not illogically, for an essentially decorative sort of novel. Serious themes, it is true, are adumbrated: for instance, Don Rigoberto's attention to the minutiae of lavation and love-making is repeatedly seen as his 'personal way of bringing about a utopia' and even an apotheosis; while Dona Lucrecia's sexual entanglement with a minor is a fairly momentous issue. But the tone is ultimately light and exquisite. The language (in what seems a brilliant translation by Helen Lane) is fastidious, graceful, and sprinkled with scent. It is an audacious caprice of a book, most memorable for the accuracy and humour of its corporeal descriptions. The chapter devoted to Don Rigoberto's cleaning of his ears is a writerly tour de force. (A collection of Vargas Llosa's early short fiction is published simultaneously: The Cubs and Other Stories, Faber paperback Pounds 4.99, 139 pages.)</p>

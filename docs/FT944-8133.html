			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Lisbon reveals sell-off plans Portugal plans to sell shares in three or four state companies direct to foreign investors in 1995, starting with a 20-25 per cent tranche of cement group Cimpor (Cimentos de Portugal), according to Mr Francisco Esteves de Carvalho, secretary of state for finance. He told the weekly newspaper Expresso that the Cimpor shares would be offered in packages aimed specifically at European, North American and Asian investors, probably during the first quarter. The government sold an initial 20 per cent tranche of Cimpor on the Lisbon stock exchange in July to mainly Portuguese investors for Es39.6bn Pounds 250m. He said the stage two sale would be followed by the more complicated privatisation of 20-30 per cent of the Portugal Telecom telephone company. 'The actual size of the operation will have a lot to do with the behaviour of the domestic market and its capacity to absorb the issue,' he said. About 70 per cent of the Portugal Telecom shares would be targeted at foreign investors, while the remainder would be offered simultaneously to Portuguese investors at the same price.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko met today at the  Meridien Hotel with provincial governors or their  representatives. Four items were on the agenda, including  security. Marie-Jose Niyonzima reports:    [Niyonzima] The security situation, refugee repatriation,  the  primary and secondary school situation, and the provincial  administration of security in Bujumbura -- where the civilian  population illegally possesses many weapons: These were the  topics that Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko and Interior  Minister Jean- Baptiste Manwangari based their speeches on.    They each recalled the government's position concerning  disarmament, a policy which will be pursued up to provincial  level. They also discussed the recently failed coup d'etat and  its continuing investigation. Burundi has a high number of  refugees who are called upon to live together with others, but  who are faced with the problems of food, shelter, and health.    The prime minister believes provincial governors with  territory bordering Rwanda must play a large role in  reestablishing trust among the people. The most important  recommendations for the governors are ending suspicion between  the security forces and the population, and placing themselves  above ethnic groupings and partisanship. Governors must head an  administration where all levels of the population are involved.  Since the nation must survive despite its current crisis, the  resumption of economic activity is imperative. The prime  minister suggested that schools which are still sheltering  displaced people release them, so as to allow the resumption of  classes. However, the problem is returning people to their  homes when their houses have been burned down or demolished.</p>

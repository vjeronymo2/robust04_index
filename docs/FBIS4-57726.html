			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Congressional" column: "Not in English"] </F>   [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 20 May (NA) -- An odd episode took  place at the meeting Radical Civic Union [UCR] deputies held  with U.S. Ambassador to Argentina James Cheek to discuss  Congress's deadline for passing the bill on invention patents.    The U.S. ambassador was received by the lawmakers at the  staircase leading to the Chamber of Deputies. UCR Deputy Elsa  Kelly extended Ambassador Cheek a welcome in English.    Without batting an eyelid, the U.S. ambassador replied in  correct Spanish, leaving Kelly in quite an awkward situation. It  seems the latter does not know that Cheek has not spoken his  native tongue since he arrived in our country to begin his tour  as ambassador.    Leaving aside this language issue, UCR Deputy Ernesto Algaba  described the meeting's outcome without resorting to euphemisms.  He said: "This is a carrot-and-stick policy, pure and simple."    Algaba emphasized: "When it suits them, we belong to the  First World and when it does not, we belong to the Third World.  On the one hand, they want us to enact legislation according to  that of an industrial country, and on the other hand they treat  us like an underdeveloped country in what pertains to trade  matters."

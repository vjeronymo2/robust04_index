			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At a recent meeting, a group of FUNCINPEC [National  United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and  Cooperative Cambodia] MP's reportedly asked: What is the  purpose of puppet Hun Sen's visit to the king on 15 March? Some  said as the Tokyo conference had already ended, Hun Sen will go  to ask the king to dismiss Sam Rangsi as finance minister and  replace him with puppet Cham Prasit [state secretary for  finance], who will heartlessly extort money from the people.  Moreover, with Cham Prasit as finance minister, Hun Sen can  spend financial aid at will.    Others said: Today, he asks the king to remove Sam Rangsi;  tomorrow, he will ask for the dismissal of others who have not  surrendered to him. In the end, he will control, then  completely eradicate FUNCINPEC. This shows that the only thing  Vietnamese communist Hun Sen understands is destruction, not  national reconciliation or national unification. He also  understands only the Vietnamese communists' dictatorship. As  for Prince Ranariddh, all he can do is bow and scrape before him.    The MP's further said that Prince Ranariddh was well aware  of  this move because he was colluding with Hun Sen to remove Sam  Rangsi. But he will not go to Beijing as he is afraid of being  seen as too obviously involved in the matter.    Some other MP's said Hun Sen's visit was to ask the king to  grant him the title of Samdech Krompreah. Prince Ranariddh is  afraid of him, so why should the prince have a higher title than  he? Moreover, he also wants to have a higher title than that of  puppet Chea Sim and puppet Heng Samrin. The MP's added that Hun  Sen will certainly boast that he had won this or that victory  and will threaten the king not to achieve national  reconciliation. Puppet Hun Sen is extremely insolent, so he  will resort to this method, no matter what. He knows nothing  about right and wrong since he totally obeys the orders of the  Vietnamese communists, his masters.    In sum, puppet Hun Sen's visit to the king is not to seek a  solution, but to create more problems for FUNCINPEC and our  nation and people. He never thinks about national  reconciliation or peace. He thinks only about reinforcing and  expanding his Vietnamese communist power and threatening the  king so he can eliminate resistance forces and other national  forces with the aim of doing away with the Cambodian nation and  race.    The nation and people are keeping an eye on the farce.</p>

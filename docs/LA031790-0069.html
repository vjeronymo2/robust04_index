			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROH REPLACES ECONOMICS MINISTER  </P> <P> President Roh Tae Woo today replaced his economics minister in a major Cabinet  reshuffle expected to herald a push to speed the growth of South Korea's  economy.  </P> <P> The reshuffle, affecting 15 of 22 posts, had been expected since last month's  merger of Roh's governing party with two centrist opposition groups.  </P> <P> The alliance resulted in a powerful conservative party giving the president a  comfortable parliamentary majority.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Kang Young Hoon and his entire 22-member Cabinet resigned Friday  to give Roh a free hand to reorganize the government. Kang was renamed prime  minister of the new Cabinet today.  </P> <P> However, Roh replaced most of the Cabinet's economics officials, including  Economic Planning Minister Cho Soon, who is a deputy prime minister.  </P> <P> Lee Seung Yun, 58, a former finance minister, succeeded Cho as the nation's top  economic planner.  </P> <P> His appointment is expected to bring a considerable change in South Korea's  economic policy, which has emphasized distribution rather than growth. Lee, a  respected economist, is known as an advocate of a growth-oriented policy.  </P> <P> The state television KBS said the new economic planning minister will push a  series of bold measures to encourage investment and stimulate exports.  </P> <P> Cho and his economic team have been criticized for a series of policy failures  that aggravated land speculation, increased inflation and slowed exports. South  Korean exports in the first two months of this year decreased 2.5% to $8.7  billion from a year ago.  </P> <P> Cho's successor declined to provide details on his plans.  </P> <P> The foreign and defense ministers kept their posts.  </P></p>

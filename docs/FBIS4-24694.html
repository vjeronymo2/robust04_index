			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Shi Hang (0670 5300) and Liu Yongquan (0491 </F> 8673 3123): "Changtu's Extraordinarily Serious `Grain Materials'  Hidden Case Exposed to the World"]    [Text] The details of the extraordinarily serious hidden  case of law breaches in the purchases of materials by the grain  departments of Changtu County, about which the people across the  province are deeply concerned, have been exposed and known to  all thanks to the six months of all-out efforts by the Tieling  city and Tieling County procuratorial organs to investigate the  case. It has been ascertained that the case had incurred an  economic loss of 68.22 million yuan to the state as calculated  by grain departments after making an inventory and check of  their stockpiles and capital. A total of 412 persons have been  punished according to party and administrative disciplinary  actions and criminal law or through economic sanctions; and 11  persons against whom lawsuits have been filed will be tried in  the near future.    Changtu County is a renowned grain producer in the country,  which purchases about 1 billion kg of grain every year. Dozens  of materials in large amounts, such as straw mats and stripes,  are needed in grain storage. Due to poor management, grain  departments of the county committed a large number of law  breaches during purchases of the materials since 1990.  Beginning September 1993, cadres and policemen of the Tieling  City Procuratorate and the Changtu County Procuratorate made  all-out efforts to investigate the case based on the reports by  the masses and the written instructions by the principal leading  comrades of the city party committee. In the process of  handling the case, the standing committee of the Tieling city  party committee heard reports on the progress on many occasions  and gave timely support and guidance. This case also drew the  extremely great attention of Supreme People's Procuratorate and  the provincial procuratorate. Zhao Dengju, deputy chief  procurator of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, came to  Changtu County to hear reports on the case, which signified a  great encouragement to the procuratorial cadres and policemen.  Neither moved by money nor interfered by personal relations,  the cadres and policemen surmounted numerous difficulties and  managed to expose the case which, centering on Gui Bingquan,  former director of the Changtu County Grain Bureau, involved  some leading cadres and personnel of party and government  organs, public security, procuratorial, and judicial  departments, law-enforcing administrative departments, and  economic management departments, who traded power for power,  money, personal favor, and sex and cheated the state of a  tremendous amount of money to line their pockets.    According to Wu Zhicheng, chief procurator of the Tieling  City People's Procuratorate, the city and the county  procuratorial organs have put on files for investigations 54  persons involving in serious and major offenses, such as  embezzlement, bribe-taking, speculation, profiteering,  dereliction of duty, extortion, misuse of public funds,  swindling, and tax evasion, and two of them are cadres at deputy  county level. Xu Lianzhong, former vice chairman of the county  committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference, Gui Bingquan, former director of the county grain  Bureau, and 12 others were arrested and brought to justice.  Eleven serious offenders at large were listed as wanted, and  some others were bailed out waiting for trials. As much as 32  million yuan of illicit money was seized.    Judging by the criminal facts exposed, the case was a  shocking one. The large number of departments and persons  involved, the great loss incurred to the state, and the evil  means adopted by the lawless elements made the case a rare one  in Liaoning in recent years. According to the investigations,  the overwhelming majority of the 36 grain depots violated laws  at varying degrees during the purchases of materials. Gui  Bingquan and others abused power to give written approvals  wantonly for some persons to sell materials regardless of the  needs of the grain depots, through which they took bribes or  enabled their relatives and friends to make huge profits.  Persons obtaining the approvals then forcibly sold materials to  grain depots to reap staggering profits. Some lawless persons  used the approvals to collude with relevant personnel of grain  depots in making false receipts and certificates of the storage  of the materials, cheating the grain depots out of money without  even selling the materials. Moreover, Gui Bingquan's written  approvals were directly sold. A written approval with some  dozen poorly written characters was sold at tens of thousands of  yuan at the lowest, the highest price being 135,000 yuan. A  relative of Gui Bingquan earned more than 200,000 yuan from  selling the approvals. Some women even sold their bodies in  exchange for the approvals.    This law-violating case brought a tremendous economic loss  to  the state. The price for materials the county's grain  departments bought were 16.9 million yuan in 1990, and it showed  a sharp increase to 90.86 million yuan in 1991, and was  increased again to 123.76 million yuan in 1992. Some grain  depots spent as much as over 11.7 million yuan to purchase the  materials, such as straw stripes, which could be used for 20  years, thermometers, which could be used for 40 years, and wire  rope, which would not be used up for 100 years, creating large  stockpiles. There were also a great amount of fake and inferior  goods among the materials. Some ratsbane was colored rice, some  thermometers were empty glass tubes, and some straw mats and  stripes were far below the standards to "look like cushions and  belts" as the masses put it. Even goods like this were  purchased at the prices several times, ten times, and even  dozens of times higher. Wire ropes that costed four to 10 yuan  per meter were purchased at the price ranging from 85 to 105  yuan, earning lawless elements enough money to buy a Santana car  after selling two bundles of wire ropes. Thermometers costed  0.45 yuan each in the market, but they were purchased at 1.50  yuan each. Ratsbane costing 10 yuan per 500 grams were purchased  at 470 yuan. A report on the inventory of the property and  capital of the grain departments of Changtu County showed that  the county lost 68.22 million yuan in three years due to  stockpiles of the materials, the high-priced low-quality  materials, and the speculation in the purchases. However, some  lawless elements earned their ill-gotten wealth totaling several  hundred thousand yuan and even more than 1 million yuan. While  they were spending freely the tremendous amount of money they  appropriated from the state, some staff members and workers of  grain depots faced the difficulty of overdue pay, and many  peasants got only IOUs after a whole year's hard work. In view  of this, many people reported the criminal activities of Gui  Bingquan and other people in the past few years.    After the case was exposed, the vast number of cadres and  the  masses clapped and cheered. They voluntarily helped  procuratorial organs investigate the case. There were a half  sack of letters reporting the crimes. Punishment of corruption  also rallied the efforts of the party and the people, making the  county enjoy social stability and economic development. While  investigating and handling the case, Tieling city party  committee and government also summarized lessons. They made  inventory of the property and capital of all the grain  departments of the city to avoid new losses to the state.    This newspaper will publish relevant reports after the  trials  of the criminals to fully expose the details of the case and the  process of cracking the case.</p>

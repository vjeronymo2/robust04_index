			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> KILLINGS REPORTED IN ROMANIA AS FORCES FIRE ON DEMONSTRATORS  </P> <P> Dozens of anti-government demonstrators may have been killed by security forces  in Romania, the first deaths in the wave of uprisings against Communist rule in  Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> A Yugoslav witness said today that security forces -- some firing rifles and  from helicopters -- crushed a protest by 10,000 people who took to the streets  Sunday shouting "Freedom!" and "Down with Ceausescu!"  </P> <P> "Hundreds of people were falling on the pavement in front of my eyes," Radislav  Dencic, a student at Timisoara, where the protest occurred, told reporters when  he returned to Yugoslavia from the Transylvanian city today.  </P> <P> Dencic estimated dozens were killed and said he personally saw three corpses,  including that of a little child wrapped in white linen, lying in the street.  </P> <P> He said smoke poured from the city's police headquarters, apparently after it  was attacked in the toughest protest in two years against the government of  President Nicolae Ceausescu.  </P> <P> First details filtering out in Yugoslav and Hungarian media of the protest in  one of Europe's most rigid Communist states spoke of many injuries and arrests.  </P> <P> Timisoara was sealed off by army tanks and other armored vehicles, the Yugoslav  news agency Tanjug said. Romania closed its borders with Bulgaria, Yugoslavia  and Hungary.  </P></p>

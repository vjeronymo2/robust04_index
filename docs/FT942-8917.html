			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Marley makes Pounds 20m sale Marley, one of Britain's biggest building materials companies, has sold Bisch Marley, its clay roof tile subsidiary in Alsace, France, for FFr170m (Pounds 19.8m) to Keramik Holdings of Switzerland. The sale for cash reflects Marley's policy of disposing of businesses where it does not command a large market share. The sale price includes the repayment of inter-company debt. Bisch, which had net assets of FFr108m at the end of December, reported operating profits of FFr11.8m last year. Marley said that Bisch was a leading supplier of roof tiles in eastern France but had been unable to translate this into a sufficiently large national position. The proceeds initially will be used to repay group borrowings.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (13): Substantial business benefits for BT - How software helps track complex projects and reduce operational costs / Large scale application IN a company the size of British Telecom, with annual capital investment of Pounds 2.5bn, an efficient project management system is vital. BT Worldwide Networks had long experience of various software packages for project management because efficiency in that area is so central to its business. (BT is famous for having 'one of everything' on the software market, to keep abreast of new technology). Nevertheless, BTWN wanted to simplify the situation and reduce operational costs by fixing on one package. It comes as a surprise that, when standardising on a country-wide system for its project management, BT picked a little-known system, Hornet. It comes from a small software house, Claremont Controls, based in Morpeth in the North East, (see details, page 14). When BT took delivery of Hornet XT last April, it became Claremont's premier customer, and something of a pioneer with the software. BT's entire business is dependent on technology (see company snapshot, facing page). It is constantly installing new exchanges and updating older equipment on a country-wide basis. As might be expected, there were a number of methods being used to keep track of projects, including paper and a variety of software tools. BT is constantly working on a large scale. Where there were 60 areas ten years ago (and relatively little PM computerisation), there are now eight zones, plus London. Any one zone might have 15,000 jobs running concurrently. The tendency to take a wider, 'macro level' view makes information flow vital to managers, according to Bob Martin Royle, who heads the Wasp/Hornet programme. 'The senior field planning managers need visibility across a wider and wider area, with efficient support tools to enable them to plan, monitor and control their capital works programmes. The whole point is to manage our capital investment programme more efficiently.' IN 30 years he has seen the evolution of paper-based systems and the rise of computer-based project management, and is familiar with products such as Artemis and SuperProject, which were already in use at BT. With 400 full-time project managers across the country, standardisation became important - 'there are significant business benefits in getting our own systems standardised,' explains BT implementation manager Martin Baker. 'Once we've chosen tools, we can work on standardising practives and procedures which improve control of the investment programme, to such a degree that clients will notice improved efficiency.' Although BT uses IBM mainframes to run its telephone exchange administration, it has an open systems development policy for in-house work, and runs a number of Unix-based minicomputers. There was not a wide selection of project management systems available under Unix, and a further requirement, that of interfacing with the Informix database, narrowed the field even further. The Informix integration was important because BT Worldwide Networks had already invested a great deal in building an Informix-based system, co-incidentally called Wasp - the Works And Stores Programme - which stores all the details of various jobs under way. The plan was to link Wasp and Hornet to BT's own standards. Choosing the Hornet system was only the start of the story. The introduction, user consultation, and user sampling of Hornet has itself been the subject of a large in-house project. To implement the system, BT Group Computing Services has had to design and provide a national data communications network to accommodate an additional 3,300 users. BTWN started its own training programme for an eventual 4,000 users. THE problem with which users have to deal on a day-to-day basis, as Martin-Royle points out, is that change is the only constant. However well-planned the existing timetable of works, there are always new and changing requirements, 'injected works' which alter the picture - 'we're in a competitive environment and have to respond to new needs, and with them the 'what if?' scenario, all the time.' He describes his role as very much the user's champion, and his working party, when defining its standard system, had well-defined wish list. They wanted a user friendly system, compatible with other BT systems, which would allow direct data transfer when ordering stores and allocating resources, with the ability to give a clear screen-based overview of the work programmes and how they impacted one another. Critical path analysis, 'what if' facilities, electronic mail and automatic report production were vital. Hornet, he believes, fitted the current 'best practice.' Martin-Royle, Martin Baker, and project manager Doug Turner are in clear agreement that at some point, requirements have to be 'frozen,' and the potential 'jam tomorrow' of newer, promised products abandoned in favour of something that works here and now. On the ground level, every job BT does has to be planned, and resources allocated in a strict order. Tactical planning is the term it uses for the process of identifying the requirements, and deciding on the best option, for example, installing additional exchange switching equipment. The next phase is the traditional 'works planning,' which provides a detailed forecast of the materials and resources necessary for each job. This might include a site survey, measurement of cable runs, breakdown of materials, and cost estimates. Hornet's role is to support the programme and project levels, producing a schedule of jobs. Wasp is used to track the actual execution of jobs against the scheduled dates. BT had evolved Wasp, its works database for all Worldwide Networks internal jobs, out of a previous Internal Works Info System, IWIS. Used together, the two allow for cradle-to-grave planning of activities, down to the level of individuals being allotted to specific tasks at given sites and times. Projects and injected work requests are logged on to Hornet at the tactical planning stage, and assessed for the timescale in which they can be achieved. Hornet helps plan and delivery, through gaining financial authority for the spend, down to detailed planning, cost estimation, and stores ordering. It also monitors the job progress, jeopardy, and completion. The 'jeopardy' part is one of the greatest benefits, as it allows managers to see much earlier when a job is in danger of running late, or going over budget. Another advantage is that it is much easier, with systematically stored information, to see what jobs have in common. 'One installation of an exchange will be very like another in certain respects,' explains Doug Turner. 'Process management enables us to define a 'template' of a particular sort of job.' He is rolling the project out in phases over a two-year period with 'facilitators' running workshops and spreading the word. Due to the careful selection process, in which he says everyone had a voice, there is quite a demand for the system - 'the problem is to stop people leaping ahead and asking for more before it's implemented,' he says. One development he has noted is that managers using the system have begun to discuss their jobs they with a peer group, and compare performance. It would be strange if BT, or all organisations, were not to realise the potential of electronic mail and 'automatic' communications, and this is integral in Hornet's works. 'If the date for something changes, the scheduling facility send automatic messages,' says Martin Baker. More than 10 per cent of the mail comes from outside BT, through 'closed user groups,' including suppliers. John Smith, based in Leeds, is one of the pilot users of Hornet/Wasp. He is the manager of field programme control for the north-east zone, stretching from the Pennines to the east coast, and from Lincolnshire up to the Scots border. 'We use the scheduling capabilities of Hornet all the time to tell us whether the work is achievable,' he says. Six people are constantly using the system, which, he says, improves all the time as they become familiar with it - 'it's telling us when deadlines aren't likely to be met. Now, we get the opportunity to be pro-active, rather than reactive.' ***** COMPANY SNAPSHOT British Telecom BT was for many years the UK's only supplier of telecommunications. Its capital investment of nearly Pounds 2.5bn in 1992 goes into the building and continual modernisation of its telecommunications network. BT's investment in network architecture and system design is 'invisible' compared to large construction projects such as Canary Wharf or Euro-Tunnel, but involves all the usual project management problems of realising projects within time, cost and quality parameters. These are increasingly important now that BT works in a competitive environment. Turnover: Pounds 13.3bn with Pounds 3bn pre-tax profit in 1992. Employees: 165,000. Key personnel involved with information technology: Bob Martin-Royle head of interconnect and emergency planning worldwide networks, Doug Turner, manager of WASP/Hornet project, Martin Baker implementation manager. ***** TECHNOLOGY FILE: Hardware: Network of eight Pyramid MIServer T series minicomputer.

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuadoreans spring banana surprise Contrary to widespread expectations, Ecuador - the world's largest exporter of bananas - has this year shipped more of the fruit than ever before. By the end of the first 10 months, exports had already reached about 2.69m tonnes, exceeding the 1991 full-year record of 2.65m tonnes. For the year as a whole, the country is expected to break the 3m tonne mark. Though first-half exports already indicated a recovery over last year's slump, the new figures come as a surprise, as EU restrictions on banana imports were expected to impact more heavily on Ecuadorean sales. Yet Ecuadorean banana exports to the EU actually rose by 35 per cent between January and October of 1994. Industry experts say that the EU restrictions even benefited Ecuadorean exporters. Following the July 1993 regulation, commercial licences have been conceded to European importers and distributors who can now choose freely among suppliers of the tropical fruit. Mr Jose Riofrio, head of marketing for bananas in the ministry of agriculture, says European importers chose Ecuadorean bananas because of their price advantage. While its Central American competitors sold bananas at Dollars 5.20 a box, Ecuador offered its product at Dollars 4.50. In addition, Ecuador's Noboa Group has an enormous advantage over its competitors, because for years it has been well established in Europe with its own distributors in key markets of the continent. Consolidating its position as Ecuador's leading banana exporter, Noboa now claims 41.5 per cent of the country's total market, with sales to the end of September reaching Dollars 217m. Ecuadorean bananas also penetrated the Spanish market for the first time in decades, ironically entering into competition with Spain's former colonies, which were to benefit by EU Regulation 404. However, aggressive marketing strategies outside of the EU were the main reason for record sales this year. Countries such as Lithuania, Bulgaria, the Ukraine, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria bought considerable amounts of Ecuadorean bananas. Despite significant growth, Ecuador has not managed to improve the efficiency of its production. A government programme offering Dollars 140 a hectare for conversion to other crops has eliminated some 15,000 ha. But according to Mr Riofrio, at least another 15,000 ha need to be phased out in order to boost the country's low efficiency rate.</p>

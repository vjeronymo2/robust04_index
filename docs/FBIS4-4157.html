			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Five Chinese companies  will be listed this year on the American stock market, making  the United States the second market after Hong Kong to accept  Chinese firms seeking direct overseas listings.    A memorandum of understanding [MOU] was signed here today by  Arthur Levitt, chairman of the United States Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC), and Liu Hongru, chairman of the China  Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), on behalf of the two  countries' securities authorities.    The five Chinese firms, selected from a group of 22  candidate  companies for overseas listings this year, include the China  Eastern Airline Company, China Southern Airline Company, Huaneng  International Power Company, Huaneng Dezhou Power Company and  Tianjin Steel Pipe Factory.    At a press conference after the signing ceremony of the MOU,  CSRC Chairman Liu Hongru said the five companies are in top gear  making preparations and have finalized agreements with law,  auditing and accounting firms to represent them as well as  investment banks.    Liu did not give the timetable for the listings and insisted  that CSRC will stick to the standards to ensure the success of  the listings, despite the eagerness of the companies.    He predicted that the earliest possible listing might be  made  after June.    According to Liu, the remaining 17 Chinese firms will all be  listed on the Hong Kong market, though a small proportion of the  shares might be listed in the U.S. after the global offering and  first trading in Hong Kong.    Stock exchanges of other countries, including Singapore,  Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have also expressed  hopes for Chinese listings, said Liu.    "Our market is young and we lack experience in direct  overseas listing," said Liu. "It (the overseas listing) is a  step-by-step process. At present, we are in no haste to go to  other foreign markets."    The Sino-U.S. memorandum of understanding also embraces the  SEC's technical assistance for its Chinese counterparts, which  features consultancy on a regulatory framework including  drafting laws and regulations, personnel training and internship  programs for CSRC staff at the SEC and with U.S. financial  institutions as well.</p>

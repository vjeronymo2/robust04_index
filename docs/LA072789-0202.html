			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ASSOCIATE OF BRADLEY FACES CHARGE  </P> <P> City Attorney James Hahn today filed a misdemeanor charge against a business  friend of Mayor Tom Bradley for failing to turn over her records in an  investigation into her finances and the mayor's.  </P> <P> City Controller Rick Tuttle early this month issued a subpoena to Juanita St.  John for her records as director of the Task Force for Africa-Los Angeles  relations.  </P> <P> Tuttle is investigating a possible conflict of interest between Bradley's role  in directing city funds to the task force and his private real estate  partnership with St. John.  </P> <P> St. John, 57, is scheduled for arraignment Aug. 17 in Los Angeles Municipal  Court on one misdemeanor charge of failing to comply with a subpoena.  </P> <P> Earlier today, a top-level city investment officer contradicted testimony given  by his superiors, suggesting that Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg and the other  key staff member participated in a cover-up of Bradley's role in the investment  of $2 million in a bank that paid him $18,000.  </P> <P> George Sehlmeyer, an official in the treasurer's office, said cash management  officer William T. Hoss used correction fluid to paint over a notation on a  competitive bid sheet that said a March 22 deposit of city funds at Far East  National Bank was "per the mayor."  </P> <P> He said the words were "whited out" after Rittenberg became concerned when a  news reporter called him about Bradley's relationship with the bank. Bradley  served as a paid consultant to that bank in 1988.  </P> <P> In a new disclosure, Sehlmeyer also told the City Council's Finance and Revenue  Committee that Rittenberg was upset with him for volunteering information about  the reference to city auditors conducting a review of the deposit.  </P> <P> "He didn't say, 'Why didn't you keep your mouth shut?' " Sehlmeyer said. "He  said, 'They didn't have anything, why did you tell them that?' " He said  Rittenberg accused him of being a "terrible poker player" who couldn't play out  a bluff.  </P> <P> Sehlmeyer also told the committee that the Far East competitive bid sheet may  also have been doctored about a week after the deposit by someone trying to  make it look as if he had used the correction fluid.  </P> <P> City Atty. James K. Hahn and several other city agencies and council committees  are investigating allegations of conflict of interest and other aspects of  Bradley's involvement with the bank.  </P></p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: C&amp;G's mortgage bait The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society is offering as much as Pounds 3,000 to those taking out a variable-rate mortgage before July 31, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Borrowers with a 20 per cent deposit will, on completion, receive 3 per cent of the amount they borrow, to a maximum of Pounds 3,000. Those with a 5 per cent deposit or more receive 2 per cent, capped at Pounds 2,000. The cash payment is being offered as an alternative to the one-year discount on the society's variable rate, now 7.64 per cent. The discount is 3 percentage points for borrowers with a 20 per cent deposit and 2 points for those with a 5 per cent deposit. If you borrow up to 80 per cent of the value of the property, the cash gift is worth Pounds 180 more than the discounted rate. Larger borrowers will be Pounds 120 better off with the cash gift. If you have a 20 per cent deposit, monthly repayments on a Pounds 60,000 interest-only mortgage at the discounted rate of 4.64 per cent would be Pounds 209. Alternatively, you can take the cash gift of Pounds 1,800 but pay Pounds 344 a month. If you redeem the mortgage within three years, however, you will have to pay back the cash gift - or, if you had opted for the discounted rate, pay three months' gross interest. New borrowers before C&amp;G's proposed merger with Lloyds Bank next spring also will get a one-off Pounds 500.</p>

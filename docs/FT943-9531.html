			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays stuns on upside Dealers in bank shares were stunned by the extent of the profits recovery at Barclays at the halfway stage. They responded by hoisting Barclays shares to 597p in unofficial pre-market trading, compared with the overnight level of 564p. After a bout of profit-taking, however, Barclays closed only a net 4 higher at 568p. Turnover in the shares reached 14m, the highest since March this year. The pace of recovery in provisions against bad debts was much quicker than analysts had expected and produced pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 1bn, against the most optimistic market estimates of around Pounds 770m. There was no real surprise in the 23 per cent increase in the interim dividend, which had been factored in by most leading analysts. 'These were super figures,' commented one leading analyst, 'much better than expected and almost entirely due to the figure for bad debts which was around 50 per cent better than expected.' The analyst pointed out that underlying operating profits at Barclays had come out better than those of National Westminster and that the market had focused on the lack of growth in costs at Barclays. Full-year estimates were lifted to around the Pounds 2bn mark, with dividend forecasts increased to around 22p.</p>

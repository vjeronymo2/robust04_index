			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Scholes advances 36% to Pounds 4.31m SCHOLES, the electrical installation materials group, lifted pre-tax profits by 36 per cent from Pounds 3.17m to Pounds 4.31m in the year to June 30 despite 'no overall growth' in the group's markets. Mr Bill Riches, executive chairman, said that, although there had been 'a marked reduction in costs', the main engine of profits growth had been increased productivity. But he acknowledged there was 'not a great deal more scope' for reducing costs and increasing efficiency - the workforce was cut by a further 5 per cent to 1,545 in the year - without paring the group too thin. Mr Alan Baxter, who has been chief executive for a little over a year, is to leave the group. Mr Riches said: 'It just didn't work out.' Turnover edged up Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 62.7m and operating profits advanced 27 per cent to Pounds 4.81m (Pounds 3.8m). Mr Riches said that, in spite of strong competition, margins in the core electrical equipment manufacturing activities rose from less than 8 to 9 per cent. Good quality products were part of the reason for this, he added. An important factor in this, and 'a crucial component of future strategy', was the alliance with Asea Brown Boveri, where ABB provides technology and components, especially to Wylex. Mr Riches said that all the technology on Wylex's miniature circuit breakers came from ABB and 40 per cent of Wylex's products overall. The turnover figure concealed a small domestic decline, though there was also a 30 per cent rise in exports to Pounds 8m, of which Pounds 5.6m (up 47 per cent) came from the Middle East. Mr Riches reckoned that sterling's devaluation accounted for about two-thirds of the increase in exports. Net interest charges fell to Pounds 654,000 (Pounds 834,000) as net borrowings fell to nil (Pounds 3m). Earnings grew to 7.7p (5.9p) and the final dividend is held at 3.4p for an unchanged total of 5p.</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STREET FOOD OF SINGAPORE -- AN OPEN-AIR BUFFET;  </P> <P> CUISINE: BESIDES THE TRADITIONAL SOUPS AND SATAYS, EACH HAWKER MAKES A FEW  REGIONAL SPECIALTIES.  </P> <P> Singapore is a foodie's dream. You can nibble and nosh. You can savor satays  and slurp soups. Any reticence to indulge in native foods can be abandoned, and  without hesitation one can lose his street-food innocence.  </P> <P> The street-food vendors are called hawkers, and rather than pushing their carts  along the narrow, uneven, cobblestone streets of Chinatown or the broad, modern  avenues of the financial district, they are now gathered into food centers,  each of which has its own character.  </P> <P> The center at Rasa Singapura, near the handicraft center on the outskirts of  the downtown Orchard Road shopping district, is like an outdoor food festival,  with open stalls set in a park. The Satay Club center, with vendors offering  grilled skewers of chicken or beef accompanied by fiery peanut sauces, is on a  river walk similar to the one in San Antonio. It is next to the statue of the  Merlion (the city's symbol, a fantasy creature with the head of a lion and the  body of a fish). And the center at Cuppage Road is above a fragrant and  colorful fruit and vegetable market.  </P> <P> While these are some of the more visually aesthetic centers visited as part of  a canvassing of the island's outdoor offerings, my mind drifts back to my first  hawker adventure at a typical city food center. This one is located on the  second and third levels of a parking garage behind the Funan Center near  Chinatown.  </P> <P> It was an eerie sight at 7 a.m., as workers filed in with their jackets over  their arms, since Singapore's climate year-round is like a Louisiana day in  August, with heat and concomitant humidity heavily blanketing the city.  </P> <P> In the glow of dawn, the food shops were emitting a blue cold light, like an  Edward Hopper painting. Each hawker stall is about five feet wide, crowned with  photos of its offerings on lighted boards advertising the local lager, Tiger  beer, the way our sandwich shops' menu boards tout Coca Cola. Beneath the signs  were pots of steaming broth and huge black iron woks in which food was being  quickly stir-fried with angular twists of the cook's wrist.  </P> <P> Graceful Arabic script was juxtaposed to vertical rows of Chinese characters,  interspersed with occasional Hindu lettering. Between the food vendors were  fruit stalls featuring spears of bright red papaya, wedges of odd-smelling  durian fruit with porcupine spikes covering the skin, or bags of sweet yet  refreshingly light-green sugar cane juice, pressed by rolling unwieldly stalks  through rollers like dough through a pasta machine.  </P> <P> In order to make the best choices, I thought of the food center as a huge  buffet table, and I followed my philosophy that the best strategy is to scout  the options before choosing, otherwise you risk filling your plate with salad  before sighting the smoked salmon.  </P> <P> In this case, while the dish of bee hoon (thin noodles with assorted stir-fried  vegetables and beef swimming in a rich aromatic broth), may be sensuously  delicious, it should be chosen only after you have considered the beef kway  teow, which are broad noodles like Italian pappardelle coated with a thick  brown sauce dotted with chopped green onions and punctuated with slices of  beef.  </P> <P> Each hawker makes a few specialties, with noodles the predominent offerings of  Chinese and Nonya cuisine (the amalgam of Chinese and Malay dishes native to  Singapore).  </P> <P> After much deliberation, I selected mee Siam, a Nonya specialty of silky rice  noodles similar to vermicelli with toothsome boiled egg, crunchy bean sprouts  and tender prawns in a sweet and sour broth scented with chiles. My host  decided on bakwan kepiting, another local specialty, which has pork and shrimp  balls floating in a rich broth and chili paste served on the side for the brave  of palate at that early hour.  </P> <P> Filling the space between the rows of stalls on the concrete floor, unadorned  except for the vendor's signs, were low, round plastic pedestal tables with  eight stools bolted around them like flower petals. We sat down, and the cook's  grandson brought an alcohol stove topped by a kettle of boiling water. On his  next trip a teapot, cups, chopsticks, soy sauce and tiny condiment cups  appeared.  </P> <P> My host filled the teapot and our cups with water, and after a moment poured  the still steaming liquid from the vessels into a tin bowl intended for that  purpose. He then placed tea in the pot and allowed it to seep for a few moments  before pouring it into our heated cups.  </P> <P> At that moment, our food arrived ceremoniously at the table and the same young  boy changed his demeanor from that of a frenzied busboy to an elegant French  captain.  </P> <P> The aroma filled my nose, and I started pulling bits of egg and prawn out with  my chopsticks. There was a panoply of taste and textures. Then I sipped the  satiny broth from the bowl.  </P> <P> Around me were old men arguing about stories in the newspaper, young couples  sharing a bowl of breakfast noodles, and teen-age girls dressed in the blue  jumpers and white blouses of school uniforms. For them, this was the Egg  McMuffin to fuel their bodies for the day.  </P> <P> PORK SATAY WITH PEANUT SAUCE  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons grated ginger root  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon minced garlic  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon curry powder  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons soy sauce  </P> <P> 1/4 cup whipping cream  </P> <P> 2 pounds pork tenderloin  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon oil  </P> <P> 1/4 cup finely chopped onion  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon minced garlic  </P> <P> 1/3 cup crunchy peanut butter  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon molasses  </P> <P> 1/4 cup water  </P> <P> 1/4 cup lime juice  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> Dash ground coriander, optional  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce  </P> <P> Combine ginger root, garlic, curry, 1 tablespoon soy sauce and cream in small  bowl.

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Nalgo to restrict outlay on strike pay NALGO, the local government union, is to restrict strike pay by sticking more strictly to its rules after emergency funds were depleted last year. Disputes in three London branches - Islington, Newham and Camden - cost Pounds 9.5m last year. The national strike fund is estimated to stand at Pounds 17m. The move is in anticipation of a flurry of industrial action this spring. The union's local government group meeting earlier this month pledged to oppose the government's 1.5 per cent pay ceiling and any compulsory redundancies. Branches are likely to ballot next month on whether to stage a one-day strike. The national emergency committee has told branches it will stick rigidly to its guidelines under which strikers can be paid the equivalent of their full take-home pay.</p>

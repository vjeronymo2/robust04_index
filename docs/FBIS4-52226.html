			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["One or More Technicians and Specialists Per 6 Heads of </F> Working Population" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- The number of  technicians and specialists is one or more per six heads of the  working population including workers, peasants, office employees  and soldiers in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    When Korea was liberated in 1945, an overwhelming majority  of  the adult population was illiterate. But Korea completely  eradicated illiteracy by the spring of 1949, taking a long  stride toward the civilized world.    The level of general knowledge of the working people went  beyond that of the graduates from the senior middle school in  the 1980s, taking the country as a whole.    The number of scientists and technicians is now 1.73 million  in Korea which had only 12 of them at the time of liberation.    Sounds of bells of Korean alhphabet and adult schools for  the  elimination of illiteracy could be heard in Korea 45 years ago.  But, today, the idea of lifting the level of cultural knowledge  of all the members of society to that of the university graduate  is near its goal.    The Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the DPRK  have always directed all-party, all-state efforts to the  educational work for the future of the country and the destiny  of the nation. Right after the liberation when the country was  in a difficult and complicated situation, Korea discussed pencil  production as the first agenda item of the North Korean  provisional people's committee.    During the fatherland liberation war (1950-1953), a measure  was taken to recall soldiers and send them back to universities.  Study-while-working universities made their appearance in 1951  when the war was at its height.    In 1956 when the country's economic situation was difficult,  the universal compulsory primary education system was enforced,  which was followed by the universal compulsory secondary  education system in 1958. In 1959, the most comprehensive and  complete free education system came into force for school  education, adult education and social education as a whole. The  universal compulsory 9-year technical education was enforced in  1967 and the world's first universal 11-year compulsory  education in 1972.    The state appropriations for education have increased by an  average of 5.7 percent annually in the 1990s in an acute  confrontation with the imperialist allied forces hell bent on  stifling Korean socialism.    The level of knowledge of the working people has  systematically risen under the socialist education system in  which the state takes charge of the education of the entire  people so that they can study free of charge all their life.  Now all of them have the basic knowledge needed for higher  education or the knowledge of the university graduate.</p>

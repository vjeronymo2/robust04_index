			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Bearings plant to extend holiday closure JAPANESE bearings manufac-turer NSK will extend the Christmas shutdown of its biggest UK plant for the second year running. Unlike many manufacturing companies, NSK has responded to the recession by lengthening holidays rather than cutting jobs. In the past 12 months it has extended the Christmas/new year, Easter and summer shutdowns at its bearings plant in Peterlee, County Durham, which employs 700 people, by a total of 20 days. This nearly doubles the number of days on which the plant has not been in production. The lengthened shutdowns are in response to an estimated 20 per cent drop in European market demand for bearings in the past two years. The steering column and ball plants at Peterlee, which employ 110 people, are not affected. NSK Bearings Europe, announcing the five-day extension to this year's Christmas shutdown of the plant and forge, yesterday indicated its opposition to permanent plant closures or large-scale redundancies. Mr David Smith, human resources manager at the Peterlee plant, said: 'We believe that our strategy is much more conducive to the immediate and long-term personal needs of our employees and we have achieved agreement with union representatives on this over the last year.' Like everyone else NSK was having to reduce expenditure, he said, but was trying to do so 'within agreed and acceptable margins'. Long-term developments and commitments, including secondment of staff to Japan to gain new skills, were continuing. 'In short, for the sake of everyone in the company, we are continuing to invest in the future,' he added. Employees can choose to take the five extra days as paid holiday from their entitlement for next year, which would not normally be available until May next year. The AEEU engineering and electrical union, the plant's recognised union said: 'We welcome employers doing this instead of throwing people on the scrapheap.'</p>

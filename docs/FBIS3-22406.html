			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Claudia Olguin; from the "Analysis" supplement] </F>   [Text] As a result of inspections at industries located  along the country's northern border, the Federal Attorney's  Office for Environmental Protection [Procuraduria Federal de  Proteccion al Ambiente] has temporarily or partially closed more  than 121 companies in the region, and it has permanently shut  down more than 22, according to official reports obtained by the  EL FINANCIERO Satellite News Service (Finsat).    Likewise, the latest report states 799 companies in the  northern region of the country were subject to fines or  penalties.    Studies conducted in this field indicate the effects of  industrial development encouraged for 10 years along Mexico's  border with the United States have resulted in severe basic  infrastructure and environmental protection problems.    International organizations, such as the World Bank, granted  several lines of credit for environmental projects in 1993. The  line of credit granted by the World Bank stipulates that one of  the two lines of credit granted $1.8 billion for regional  environmental projects.    The Mexican and U.S. Governments came to the conclusion,  however, the northern region needs $500 million to supply water,  $2.8 million to treat municipal and industrial waste, $235  million to treat solid waste, and $750 million to treat and  eliminate toxic waste.    Approximately $277 million were appropriated last year for  regional infrastructure projects. The amount is equivalent to a  60.11-percent annual growth if compared to the 1992 budget.    The government budgeted $173 million two years ago to build  facilities for the treatment of water, elimination of solid  waste, highways and transportation, settlements, and human  infrastructure.    In sum, the government spent $1.5 billion between 1991 and  1993 to finance solutions to environmental problems caused by  industrial development along the border.    The problems and backwardness in environmental technology,  equipment, and information sectors, particularly evident at the  country's northern border, are not new within an international  context.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lords force HK rethink THE GOVERNMENT was last night considering whether to increase from 50,000 to 57,000 the number of Hong Kong citizens who will be offered full British citizenship, after suffering an embarrassing defeat on the issue in the Lords. Peers voted by 60 to 48 to back a demand by Lord Bonham-Carter, a Liberal Democrat, calling for full British citizenship for Hong Kong's non-Chinese ethnic minorities in the run-up to the colony's handover to China in 1997. This group, who number about 7,000 and are mainly of Indian origin, are currently only eligible to apply for British Nationality (Overseas) passports which do not confer a right of residence in the UK. Under current proposals, about 3.3m Hong Kong citizens are eligible for the BNO passports, with full citizenship restricted to 50,000 public servants and entrepreneurs. Though last night's vote has no legal force, the Home Office said it intended to 'look at' the situation in the light of the Lords' opinion. Lord Bonham-Carter, a former chairman of the Race Relations Board, said the ethnic minorities covered by his demand would be rendered 'effectively stateless' by the government's plans and deserved protection. Lord Ferrers, Home Office minister, said the 50,000 limit on offers of full citizenship struck a balance between maintaining confidence in Hong Kong and limiting potential UK immigration. He said that only half of those eligible for BNO passports had applied. The government was setting cut-off dates for different age groups in a bid to avoid 'a last-minute rush'. He denied BNO passport holders would have an 'inferior status'.</p>

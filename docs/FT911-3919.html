			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (20): Makers plan more powerful machines - Workstations, market continues to grow COMPUTER workstations are 'not just for 'techies' anymore', Sun Microsystems, market leader, has declared. These high performance desktop computers have until recently been aimed primarily at engineering and scientific applications. Sun and others see a new market opportunity for workstations as high-powered business computers. 'The mass penetration of workstations into markets dominated by personal computers, minicomputers and mainframes isn't a future event - it has already happened,' Sun claims. The marriage of computer workstation performance with the vast software base of the PC is luring dozens of computer makers and software developers into this emerging market. PC companies such as Compaq Computer and Apple Computer are planning to build more powerful desktop machines based upon Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessors borrowed from the engineering workstation world. Workstation manufacturers such as Sun, Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard are targeting business users as well as their traditional engineering and scientific markets. The technical features and market characteristics that divide the PC and workstation markets are fast disappearing. Business applications are increasingly being ported to varieties of the Unix operating system which is widely used on engineering workstations. The raw data processing power of the PC vies with that of low end workstations. Distribution patterns are also overlapping. Traditionally, workstations have been sold primarily by direct sales forces or through value-added resellers who add specialised software. Increasingly, however, workstations are being offered by the computer dealers and retail outlets that dominate the PC market. However, as workstations enter the business market a conflict between PC and workstation software standards has arisen. While Microsoft's DOS operating system dominates the PC world, Unix - in various forms - is the operating system of choice for workstations. Backers of the Advanced Computindustry consortium of 21 companies, have declared their support for both a future unified version of Unix and a future version of Microsoft's OS/2 operating system. Members of the group acknowledge that they are hedging their bets, until it becomes clearer which way the business workstation market will move. The emergence of workstations as business computers has added to the fierce competition in all sectors of the Dollars 7.5bn workstation market. Sales of workstations are expected to total Dollars 9.2bn this year and reach over Dollars 12bn in 1992, according to Dataquest, the market research company. Sun Microsystems is the clear winner in workstations, with a dominant 32 per cent market share. Sun's combination of the Sparc Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessor and SunOS version of Unix has attracted several licensed cloners who offer Sun-compatible computers. Sun's strategy has been to establish Sparc as an industry standard and mostly through the success of its own products it is succeeding. Industry analysts predict that Sun will continue to lead the workstation market throughout the early 1990s although International Business Machines may aggressively challenge Sun. 'By 1992-93 Sun and IBM may tie for first place among workstation vendors,' predicts Ms Vicki Brown of International Data. IBM has made a remarkable resurgence in the workstation market since its introduction, a year ago, of a range of products based upon its own RISC design. The company sold Dollars 1bn-worth of its RS/6000 workstations in 1990 and gained a 6.6 per cent share in the market. Sales are expected to rise to Dollars 1.7bn-Dollars 2bn this year. Hewlett-Packard, the number two workstation vendor, lost market share in 1990 but is expected to make a strong recovery this year with the recent introduction of a new product range. Using an enhanced version of the Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture upon which its minicomputers are based, HP has taken a technological leapfrog to produce machines that greatly outperform comparably priced workstations from its main competitors. HP's new top of the range Series 700 Model 730 workstation is twice as fast as IBM's fastest workstation, and 3.5 times the performance of Sun Microsystems Sparcstation 3, HP claims. Digital Equipment saw its share of the workstation market reduced in 1990 to 17 per cent from 23 per cent in the previous year, according to IDC. Digital is aggressively supporting Ace, the Advanced Computing Environment initiative, and plans to upgrade its DEC station product line with new workstations based upon the powerful R4000 Mips computer RISC chip, when that device becomes available. 'Marketing prowess and execution - not pure technology - will ultimately determine the winners in the workstation market,' predicts Ms Brown of IDC. A challenge for all workstation participants will be to maintain profit margins as average workstation prices fall and to adjust to new distribution channels as the market for workstations expands.  ------------------------------------------------- Market share of workstation shipments worldwide  -------------------------------------------------                               %  ------------------------------------------------- Sun Microsystems            32.4 Hewlett-Packard             21.2 Digital Equipment           16.2 Intergraph                   7.0 IBM                          6.7 Silicon Graphics             5.9 Sony                         2.8 Next                         1.0 Others                       7.2  ------------------------------------------------- Source: International Data  -------------------------------------------------</p>

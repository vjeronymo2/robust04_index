			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / People: Bitter pill for Glaxo's Pappas Arthur Pappas, the Glaxo director responsible for Canada and Latin America, has resigned from the group board with immediate effect following what the company describes as 'differences of management approach and style'. The company says that territorial responsibility for Canada and Latin America in itself did not warrant a seat on the board and that Pappas would not be replaced as a director. Last year Pappas, 46, was given responsibility for examining Glaxo's options for entering the over-the-counter drugs market which led in July to its joint venture with Warner-Lambert. But a Glaxo spokesman says Pappas's departure is not the result of any disagreement about the over-the-counter strategy though such a clash is thought to have been behind the ousting of Glaxo's chief executive Ernest Mario last year. Glaxo also announced that Charles Sanders, 62, is to retire as chairman and chief executive officer of the group's American subsidiary at the end of the month. He will be succeeded as chief executive officer of Glaxo Inc by Robert Ingram, currently its president and chief operating officer. Sanders, who has headed Glaxo Inc since he joined from Squibb in 1987, will stay on as non-executive chairman of the subsidiary and as a non-executive director of the group. A spokesman says he will be able to spend more time on industry issues, particularly the US healthcare reforms. Ingram, 51, joined Glaxo in 1990 from Merck's Canadian subsidiary. In a third change to the group board Glaxo announced the retirement of John Hignett, 60, who was executive director in charge of the management and investment of corporate funds. His responsibilities will be assumed by the finance director, John Coombe.</p>

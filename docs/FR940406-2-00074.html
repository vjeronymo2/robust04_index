			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Program Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The program described in this announcement reflects a significant shift by the DCP from the direct provision of personal health services to a responsibility for leadership and coordination of overall efforts of the health system to reduce the burden of diabetes. Both a Core Capacity Program and an Enhanced Program are conceptualized by the four categories of program activity described under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> INTRODUCTION <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in this announcement. The central objective of a Core Capacity Program is to assist the State to establish the basic public health framework for leading and coordinating the efforts of the health care system and other public and private resources to reduce the burden of diabetes. A Core Capacity Program must address all four categories of program activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An established Core Capacity Program is the foundation on which an Enhanced Program is built. The central objective of an Enhanced Program is to move the State program vigorously into a position from which it can take the lead in ensuring that diabetes-specific, community preventive health services are an integral part of a reformed health system. An Enhanced Program must involve the addition of innovative approaches not employed in the Core Capacity Program to reduce the burden of diabetes. Simple expansion of Core Capacity Program activities does not constitute an Enhanced Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A recipient of an award for an Enhanced Program may choose to focus its initial enhancement efforts on fewer than all four of the basic categories of program activity. However, at a minimum, the recipient must indicate that activities will be undertaken in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the first budget year related to (1) defining the burden of diabetes and (2) coordinating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the overall effort to reduce the diabetes burden. It is expected that each Enhanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program will be fully operational, including all four categories, within four years of the State's initial Enhanced Program award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient shall be responsible for the activities described under A., below, and CDC shall be responsible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for carrying out the activities described under B., below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Recipient Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Define and monitor the burden of diabetes through the establishment and maintenance of a State-based surveillance system which focuses on diabetes as a public health problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Develop new approaches to reduce the burden of diabetes through the development or adaptation of specific interventions to be applied within the existing and evolving health care system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Implement specific measures to reduce the burden of diabetes by ensuring the widespread application of accepted standards, policies, and protocols developed for that purpose. These should include protocols designed to prevent or postpone the occurrence of the major complications of diabetes, as well as diabetes-related cardiovascular disease. In addition, they should include protocols to ensure that persons with diabetes improve their efforts to achieve levels of glycemic control consistent with the results of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Coordinate overall program efforts of the health system to reduce the burden of diabetes through the establishment of appropriate linkages with other governmental agencies; private health care providers; academic institutions; community-based organizations; voluntary agencies; health care reimbursement organizations; national organizations representing populations disproportionately burdened by diabetes, such as minorities and the elderly; and others.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. CDC Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Define and monitor the burden of diabetes by providing technical assistance in the development of surveillance and other data systems to measure and characterize the burden of diabetes and its complications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Develop new approaches for reducing the burden of diabetes through the provision of program guidelines for, and technical assistance in, the development or adaptation of specific interventions to be applied within the existing and evolving health care system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Implement specific measures to reduce the burden of diabetes through the provision of program guidelines for, and by collaborating in the implementation of, accepted standards, policies, and protocols within the existing and evolving health care system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Coordinate overall program efforts of the health care system to reduce the burden of diabetes through the provision of program guidelines, and by facilitating communication among DCPs and with other governmental agencies, private health care providers, academic institutions, community-based organizations, voluntary agencies, health care reimbursement organizations, and others, to assist them in ensuring optimal coordination among all components of the public health and health care systems to address the burden of diabetes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Evaluation Criteria  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Total 100 Points for Core Capacity Program and 100 Points for Enhanced Program)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications for Core Capacity Program support will be reviewed and evaluated according  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the following criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Background and Need for the Core Capacity Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The extent to which the need is demonstrated, including adequate documentation of the barriers to diabetes care and education and the degree of experience the applicant has in each of the four areas of program activity (Define, Develop, Implement, and Coordinate).

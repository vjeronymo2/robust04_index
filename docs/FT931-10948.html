			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / People: Guest appearance at enterprise agency federation It was the experience of handling a factory closure in the early 1980s which brought home to John Guest, then a long range planner with Cadbury Schweppes, the impact of change on local communities. It was this event which ultimately led to his appointment, earlier this week, as chief executive of the newly formed Federation of Enterprise Agencies. The agencies provide support and advice to would-be entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized businesses. Ever since Business in the Community, which co-ordinates the community activities of several hundred large companies, said in June that it was no longer prepared to act as 'umbrella' organisation, the agencies have been seeking to set up a national body. When Cadbury decided to shut down a factory at Frampton on Severn as part of a rationalisation programme, Guest was responsible for finding a developer to take over the site and develop an industrial estate. This enabled Cadbury to replace the jobs which had gone with the factory closure. This project led to contacts with Business in the Community and in 1983 Guest became a regional director, helping to set up several enterprise agencies in the Midlands. After two years he returned to Cadbury to combine planning with community affairs, becoming group community affairs manager in 1989. Apart from his secondment to BitC, this represents the 57-year-old Guest's first break in a Cadbury career spanning 37 years. He is taking on the job at a challenging time for the agencies. The government's plans for a nationwide network of one-stop shops are forcing all the participants, Training and Enterprise Councils, chambers of commerce and enterprise agencies, to reassess their roles. 'It will be a full-time job,' he says. Guest calculates that the federation at present only speaks for half of the country's 300 enterprise agencies though these account for 70 per cent of agency business. An early priority is to improve the quality of the service provided and member agencies will be expected to conform to the BS5750 quality standard or an equivalent within two years. If the going gets tough, Guest can always call upon his chairman at Cadbury for advice. Sir Graham Day has agreed to become founding president of the federation.</p>

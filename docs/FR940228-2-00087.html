Section 1377 requires this affirmative determination to be treated as an affirmative determination under section 304(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2414(a)(1)(A)). Accordingly, USTR will request the section 301 Committee to recommend what action, if any, should be taken under section 301 (19 U.S.C. 2411). USTR will publish notice of any proposed action and will provide an opportunity for interested persons to present views. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Questions concerning this affirmative determination should be directed to David Long, Office of Industry Affairs, (202) 395&hyph;6160, or Laura B. Sherman, Office of the General Counsel, (202) 395&hyph;3150, Office of the United States Trade Representative, 600 Seventh Street, NW., Washington, DC 20506. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This determination is the second affirmative determination under section 1377 on this issue. In the first determination, made on April 28, 1989 (54 FR 19624), USTR found that, for the reasons cited below, Japan was not in compliance with agreements on third party radio and cellular telecommunications equipment encompassed in a series of letters and joint communications between the United States and Japan pursuant to the ``MOSS'' (Market-Oriented Sector-Selective) discussions that took place between 1985 and 1987. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, USTR found that the Japanese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) had declined to license the operation in the Tokyo and Nagoya area of a cellular telephone system based on U.S. technology. This system was licensed in the rest of Japan, but subscribers to the system could not use their cellular telephones in the Tokyo-Nagoya area, i.e. they could not ``roam'' into Tokyo-Nagoya. Users of competing Japanese-technology cellular systems could ``roam'' throughout the country. USTR determined that the failure to approve operation of a U.S. technology-based system in the Tokyo-Nagoya area was inconsistent with the MOSS agreements, in which the Government of Japan committed to take measures with respect to roaming in Tokyo-Nagoya by users of the U.S. technology-based system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following that determination, consultations led to the June 28, 1989 third party radio and cellular agreement that is the subject of this determination. In the 1989 agreement, the Government of Japan committed to measures to enable users of the U.S. technology-based system to roam in the Tokyo-Nagoya region. In the agreement, Japan reaffirmed its commitment to the principle of ``comparable market access.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its review of the 1989 agreement, USTR found the following. To install the U.S. technology-based system in the Tokyo-Nagoya region, MPT selected, notwithstanding concerns expressed by USTR and U.S. industry, a company that operates a competing system in the Tokyo-Nagoya area using Japanese technology. This company has substantially delayed installing the U.S. technology-based system in Tokyo. Nearly five years after the 1989 agreement, and nine years after the MOSS discussions began, the new system covers only 40 percent of the Tokyo-Nagoya area. As a result, because users of the U.S. technology-based system still are unable to roam throughout Tokyo-Nagoya, the U.S. technology-based system does not have comparable market access with the Japanese systems, which offer full geographic coverage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USTR has consulted with other executive agencies and the private sector during this review, and has had discussions with the Japanese Government regarding this agreement on more than seven occasions between July, 1993 and February 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of this review, USTR has determined that MPT's failure to ensure full coverage for the U.S. technology-based system in the Tokyo-Nagoya area nearly five years after the 1989 third party radio and cellular agreement is inconsistent with the terms of that agreement, and denies, within the context of the terms of that agreement, mutually advantageous market opportunities in Japan for telecommunications products and services of the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Irving Williamson, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Chairman, Section 301 Committee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4612 Filed 2&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3190&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

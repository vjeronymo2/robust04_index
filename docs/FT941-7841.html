			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Telecoms are high in world ranking: BT charges most for domestic use, says DTI survey of advanced nations Britain's telecommunications rank a 'a good second' internationally, says a government study comparing telecoms in the UK with those in six other advanced countries. The study - comparing everything from prices to network modernisation - does not find the UK the most advanced in any sphere, though no one country was consistently better. The US scored higher on many counts. Britain was found to have the most expensive residential calls of any of the seven countries, however, with average charges almost twice those in Sweden and the Netherlands. The figures were based on British Telecommunications charges as at January 1992. Its prices are now undercut in parts of the residential market by Mercury and the cable companies. BT has cut residential prices sharply since 1992 - but so have companies in the other six countries. The study, part of the exercise in rating UK industrial sectors against those of other countries that was launched by the Department of Trade and Industry last year, was hailed by the government as support for its policy of liberalising telecommunications infrastructure and services faster than the rest of the EU. The UK will soon have three long-distance telecoms networks and cable companies - mainly US-owned - are investing nearly Pounds 5bn in building local TV and telephone networks in competition with BT. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said: 'Competition in telecoms infrastructure as well as services has played a large part in stimulating the adoption of leading-edge technology in UK networks.' The report, compiled by Mr Robert Harrison of PA Consulting Group, found Britain was fourth out of seven in deployment of fibre cable in the core network, the essential requirement for broadband services of the kind envisaged by proponents of a 'superhighway' that would offer advanced interactive services. Figures for investment in the network also provide an ambiguous picture. Britain is ranked behind Germany, Japan and the US in terms of investment per line, but comes out second behind the US when the figures are adjusted for price and specification of equipment. The UK scored highly in the provision of digital lines, enabling the provision of advanced network services, where it was ranked second behind France; and also in the take-up of cellular mobile services, where it is on a par with the US although still some way behind Sweden. The report noted a view 'held by some in the industry' that a 'clearer vision' was needed of national telecoms objectives. It also said an issue of concern was the poor regard in which telecoms services were widely held in the UK.</p>

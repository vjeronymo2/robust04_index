Chien was responding to reports from Geneva saying that the  CITES Standing Committee has yielded to Beijing's pressure and  decided to refer to Taiwan as "Taiwan, China" in its report on  wildlife conservation on the island.    "Such a decision is ridiculous," Chien said, stressing that  Taiwan is a separate political entity and has never been ruled  by Chinese Communist authorities.    Chien said Beijing's intention to downgrade the ROC in the  international arena by suggesting the use of such a designation  in the CITES report would only worsen relations across the  Taiwan Strait and would not alter the fact that Taiwan is a  separate political entity.    Beijing has consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and  sought to limit Taiwan's movements on the world stage.    The Council of Agriculture (COA), which is in charge of  wildlife conservation affairs, said it will protest the CITES  decision.    "If CITES does not use our formal national title in its  report, we hope it can at least refer to US as Chinese Taipei,"  COA Vice Chairman Lin [words indistinct] said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In an urgent communique following the attack against  Deputy Chinchilla Vega, Human Rights Ombudsman Jorge Mario  Garcia Laguardia reported the existence of an antidemocracy  conspiracy and asked the government to use the constitutional  mechanisms to stop the continuation of these events.    Upon condemning the attack against the deputy, Garcia said  this incident demonstrates an attempt is being made to end the  democratic system in the country. He added the attack represents  an unjustifiable action, just like the assassination of  Magistrate Epaminondas Gonzalez at a time when the government  and URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] signed a  global human rights accord.    The human rights ombudsman demanded the government of the  Republic end this series of events aimed at disrupting the  democratic regime. He asked the government to implement the  constitutional mechanisms; that is, to have security forces  comply with their duty.</p>

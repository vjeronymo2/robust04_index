			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE BEAT: 'DINNER' AT PACIFIC; 'STANDARD' AT ATTIC; 'GROUND LEVEL' AT  SHEPARD; 'STERLING' AT ACTORS ALLEY TOO; 'ATTRACTION' AT EBONY SHOWCASE ANNEX  </P> <P> The closest thing to a New England, Currier and Ives Christmas that you are  likely to find in L.A. is the Pacific Theatre Ensemble's production of Thornton  Wilder's "The Long Christmas Dinner."  </P> <P> The production is stark and lean, but the play's wistful resonances and  decorative ambiance make the experience a Christmas dessert.  </P> <P> You're greeted out front by carols sung by the cast, bundled up in their  Victorian coats and dresses. Once inside, seated in the wooden, church-like  pews, you warm to the treat of mulled wine and cider and more caroling, which  segues into the play itself.  </P> <P> As in Wilder's "Our Town," this play cleverly manipulates time. We watch  characters from one family, as in time-lapse photography, celebrating Christmas  dinner over the course of 90 years. Children become adults and then crones as  members of the seven-member cast materialize as animated figures in an album  with ensemble panache.  </P> <P> And all this happens in a one-act that runs only a little more than an hour.  The ensemble did the same show last year with some of the same cast, and  artistic director Stephanie Shroyer has reconstructed the evening from D. Paul  Yeuell's original staging.  </P> <P> That staging unfolds with pristine focus. Even the squabbles -- for this is a  real, not always cheery, family -- convey a poignancy. The production is  vintage Wilder, the ritual of Christmas dinner (the food imaginary) lovingly  recycled through an epoch of family births, deaths and rebirths.  </P> <P> Not much seems to happen, but that's a deceptive tribute to the discipline of  the cast (Sarah Hill, Vince Melocchi, Carla Obert, Sarah Zinsser, Michael  Tulin, Deborah Scott and James Schultz).  </P> <P>  At 705 1/2 Venice Blvd., Venice, Wednesday through Sunday, 8 p.m., through  Dec. 23; matinees Saturdays and this Sunday, 5 p.m. Tickets: $13 (a dollar off  with a canned food donation). (213) 660-3643.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Standard of Living'  </P> <P> When Keith Reddin's Cold-War comedy, "Highest Standard of Living," premiered  three years ago, the East-West paranoia in the play seemed timely enough. But  glasnost and other events have quaintly dated it.  </P> <P> Some of the characters are still funny, but the production at the Attic Theatre  is ragged and unpolished. The set design, for example, is basically a clutter  of furniture moved around between scenes. In Mitch Beer's staging, too many of  the characters and scenes play like schematic, isolated acts.  </P> <P> Kevin Joseph Klein is charming in the lead role of a graduate student in Russia  hurtled into paranoia when he's caught in KGB-CIA cross fire. He's strongly  supported by Eden Bodnar's Soviet defector who follows him back to the United  States (her Russian accent is perfectly pitched).  </P> <P> For bravado and as an actor to watch, Don Bernhardt is hilarious as a Moscow  street huckster in an aloha shirt, trying to hustle up a pair of jeans.  Bernhardt doubles as a slick CIA lackey trying to sell out our reluctant hero,  in the play's strongest scene. But Reddin's plot grows numbing and the second  act seems to run forever.  </P> <P>  At 6562 1/2 Santa Monica Blvd., tonight through Sunday, 8 p.m. Tickets: $12;  (213) 462-9720.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'At Ground Level'  </P> <P> The story of a spirited family in Costa Rica breaking through barriers of  poverty and illiteracy, "At Ground Level (Home Sweet Home in Costa Rica)" is  advocacy theater. But it's interesting for the historic and contemporary light  it sheds on Central America.  </P> <P> A grueling first act grinds the production down, but the thematic trajectory of  the second act redeems much of the play at the Richmond Shepard. The play's  85-year-old Costa Rican playwright, Luisa Gonzalez, dramatizes her own  real-life story as a young, naive woman radicalized while living in a San Jose  slum in the 1920s.  </P> <P> This KPFK-sponsored first English language production (translated by Regina  Pustan) features a rousing performance by BJ Theus as an ignorant shoemaker  uncle who teaches himself to read and becomes a Leninist. Kate Romero delivers  a modulated performance as his young niece, galvanized into fury when she loses  a teaching job for joining a demonstration.  </P> <P> Director Patric Z's seven-member cast is uneven (the mother wailing over an  ironing board is never convincing), and the show could use more Latino actors.  Quicker acceleration also would help. But the family's grit is enviable, and  Kathy Crawford's spitfire prostitute enlivens the action.  </P> <P>  At 6476 Santa Monica Blvd., tonight and Saturday, 8 p.m., ends Sunday, 7 p.m.  Tickets: $10; (213) 452-3950.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Purloined Sterling'  </P> <P> The re-creation of a 1940s radio mystery drama is the singular beguiling  element in Anita Merzell's spoof, "The Case of the Purloined Sterling," at  Actors Alley Too.  </P> <P> The radio program's sound effects, with droll Mark Chaet unfurling cheese  graters, garlic pressers and the like, is rich stuff. Playwright/director Anita  Merzell, doubling as a radio actress playing hard-boiled detective Shayna  Goldberg, is also fun -- for awhile.  </P> <P> But this show stays on the air way past its time. You tire of the convoluted  radio plot read into mikes by the actors (including Dana Kelly and the overripe  Gene Marks), because there's no reason to listen to it. The premise is cleverly  executed, but there's no characterization or plot development outside the  deliberately dumb show within the show.  </P> <P> Though the production can't sustain two acts, Chaet is terrific. And the creamy  '40s-styled radio vocalist (the delicious Lari Tucker) is almost worth the  admission.  </P> <P>  At 4334 Van Nuys Blvd., Sherman Oaks, reopening Jan. 8 and running Mondays  through Wednesdays, through Jan. 24. Free; donations. (818) 986-2278.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Attraction Fatal'  </P> <P> L.A. theater veterans Nick and Edna Stewart are a testament to endurance. They  opened their Ebony Showcase in 1950.  </P> <P> The Stewarts don't produce much anymore, and maybe they should. The rental  production in the Ebony Showcase Annex, writer-director Jerry Jones'  "Attraction Fatal," about a murdered rock star, is inept, to put it softly.  </P> <P> The show lurches between being a courtroom drama and a lounge act. The murder  plot stops for singer Harold Burr and comic Cliff Howard to perform their acts.  Talented as they are, their work belongs in a variety show.  </P> <P> The comedy-drama, though, has its share of smiles and laughs whenever the  zaftig and adventurous Vay Gainer takes the witness stand. The 13-member cast  deserves better.  </P> <P>  At 4708 Washington Blvd., Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 p.m.  indefinitely. Tickets: $15-$17.50; (213) 936-1107.  </P></p>

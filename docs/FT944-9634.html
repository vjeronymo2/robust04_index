			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: High risk of a poor financial product  -A legal challenge is likely to plans to compensate people badly advised on pensions Proposals published last month by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, for compensating people who took out a personal pension on poor advice were clearly designed to reduce the risk of court battles on the issue. For individual victims of poor advice, the SIB scheme may well have removed the need to sue. But several of the life companies and independent financial advisers, which must foot the compensation bill, are far from happy with the scheme and some have consulted lawyers about possibly mounting a court challenge. No life company has expressed qualms about compensating those wrongly advised by its direct sales force or by a 'tied agent' - a company which sells only the insurer's policies. They are less sanguine about liability for poor advice from independent financial advisers (IFAs) selling their products. Life companies also believe others have responsibilities to bear. First among them is the government, which promoted personal pensions with such enthusiasm. Second are the occupational pension schemes whose rules for calculating the value of a lump sum which could be transferred by someone moving to a personal plan is open to challenge. No legal actions have been launched yet by insurance companies challenging SIB's proposals. Mr Dominic Clarke, a partner of City solicitors Herbert Smith, says nobody wants to be the first to challenge the compensation scheme because of the bad publicity it may generate. But the potential for litigation is enormous. In theory the SIB proposals are directed at the front line regulators, such as the Personal Investment Authority, which are supposed to turn them into rules or guidance for the life companies which they could be penalised for not following. But it is clear that the very status of the proposals may be the subject of a legal challenge. The SIB plan urges occupational schemes to take back people who have opted out of an occupational pension scheme and to allow retrospective admission to those who decided on poor advice not to join a scheme in the first place. If scheme trustees do not want to take people back, the life company or IFA is supposed to 'top-up' the personal pension so that, at retirement, the benefits the occupational scheme would have offered can be matched. In the case of transferees - those people who have left a company and then transferred their occupational pension entitlement to a personal plan (where occupational schemes are likely to be less keen to have people back) - a top-up is also SIB's preferred method of compensation. Only where someone has already retired would compensation be an immediate cash sum. But, says Mr Clarke, if you take the case of a transferee who received poor advice from an IFA, his remedy in law would be an action for damages for negligence against the IFA - proceedings to which neither the trustees of an occupational scheme nor the life company would be party. The SIB scheme is proposing a form of remedy for the loss suffered by victims of poor advice which has no apparent basis in law. The principle of a non-cash based compensation scheme may be sound, he says, but there is some doubt as to whether it is enforceable in law. Mr Ian Gault, another Herbert Smith pensions partner, says it is not difficult to see the potential for conflict between occupational scheme trustees and life companies. The big questions are under what circumstances will trustees allow reinstatement of those who opted out, and on what terms? If schemes prove reluctant to have people back life companies and advisers are going to be left holding the baby. This could be particularly hard for mutuals, (building societies), which sold through IFAs who will be left with no alternative but to dip into reserves set aside for 'with-profits' policyholders to meet the costs of top-ups. In life companies, the burden of paying for top-ups will fall on shareholders. Neither group is likely to be happy with this prospect and both may decide to sue the company or its directors for negligence or for breach of fiduciary duty. That may force life companies into pre-emptive defensive legal action, not in the belief they can escape without contributing to compensation altogether, but to establish that the company had no option but to contribute, thus protecting it from challenge by its own policyholders or shareholders. But the most difficult and immediate questions relate to policies sold by IFAs. Here, says Mr Clarke, there is a potentional for dispute in almost all cases. The expectation is that where the business was sold through an IFA, the IFA will foot the bill because it gave the poor advice. The SIB scheme envisages IFAs relying on their professional indemnity insurance to meet compensation claims. But professional indemnity cover can often be lost if a firm makes a settlement or admits liability to a client without the agreement of its insurer. Or the IFA may have received misleading marketing information from the life company which it relied on in selling the personal pension. So there is significant potential for litigation between professional indemnity insurers, life companies and IFAs. The life companies' most aggressive noises, however, relate to the payment of compensation for wrongly-advised clients of independent advisers which have already gone out of business or which do so in the course of reviewing their potential liability for poor advice. This may end up being a relatively small part of the total compensation bill  -which some estimates put at about Pounds 2bn - but the very uncertainty increases the inclination to consider legal action. In the usual way, the bill for such compensation would be met by the Investors' Compensation Scheme, which is funded by the financial services industry. The retail financial services sector - where the personal investment authority is the main regulator - would be expected to foot the bill for compensating clients of companies which have gone out of business in its own sector, up to an annual limit of Pounds 100m. There is a formula for assessing how the ICS bill each year should be divided within the sector, but the SIB plan deliberately failed to provide a formula for dividing costs for personal pension claims after next spring. BAT Industries, which owns insurers Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, said this month it would consider legal action against the SIB if life companies which operate mainly through a direct sales force, as it does, were made to contribute towards compensating clients of former independent advisers. Another potential area of challenge would be if other businesses within the retail financial services sector - such as unit trust companies - found themselves drawn into the compensation arrangements through paying levies to the Investors' Compensation Scheme simply as a result of being in the same sector, even though they had not sold any pensions at all. Mr John Pearson, a pensions partner of City solicitors Lovell White Durrant, believes a note of realism needs to be struck, however. All the dire predictions about the total compensation bill assume that most investors will be able to establish liability by a life company or an IFA. But this may be harder than it looks, he says. For an investor to succeed in proving an entitlement to compensation, he or she will have to show: first, that the poor advice amounted to a material compliance fault under the regulations in force at the time; second, that the investor suffered actual or prospective loss; and third, that the loss was a result of the compliance default. The assumption, he says, is that if an investor can prove the first two elements the third will follow automatically. But in many cases that is not at all certain. Amid the talk about legal action, two points of realism are already coming through. The first is that the probability of a challenge to the SIB's proposals is directly related to the likely size of the compensation bill, and how quickly the amount is known. The bad publicity and costs of a legal action to resist contributing to compensation for pension victims are easier to justify the higher and more uncertain the potential payments involved. The second point is that even if the law is unclear now about the ability of life companies to contribute towards compensating the clients of others, the prospects of a successful and effective legal challenge by a life company may be slight. One life company chief executive explained why he put no faith in a legal action: 'If there is any doubt, the government will simply make sure that the law is clarified so that we can contribute,' he said. IFAs may have less qualms about litigating, however, particularly if the alternative is bankruptcy. Either way the lawyers are agreed: a legal challenge is inevitable.</p>

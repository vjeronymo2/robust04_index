			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BANGLADESH TIGERS KILL 7 WOODCUTTERS  </P> <P> Tigers killed seven woodcutters and attacked about 20 other people this month  in a mangrove forest in southern Bangladesh, officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Tigers have killed 70 people so far this year, according to official figures.  Villagers said the toll is probably higher because many poachers hunting tigers  haven't returned.  </P> <P> Poaching has increased despite a 1982 ban on hunting the 600 remaining Bengal  tigers and other rare animals.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza -- One of the leaders of the Islamic  Resistance Movement, Hamas, has affirmed that Hamas welcomes the  Palestinian Authority but will not participate in it. The  statement was made during a visit by Major General Nasr Yusuf,  commander of the Palestinian security forces in the Gaza Strip,  to a number of Islamic centers in the area and his meeting with  a number of Hamas officials. During this visit, Maj. Gen. Yusuf  expressed his readiness to cooperate on several issues with the  Palestinian Authority.    In this regard, Shaykh Ahmad Bahr, head of the Islamic  Society, clarified the Islamic Movement's position under the  Palestinian Authority, and dealt with the issue of the  collection of weapons from the members of the 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam Battalions. He said: Neither Hamas nor its military  wing will agree to surrender any of the weapons they collected  over a period of many years as long as arms-carrying settlers  remain inside the Gaza Strip. He also explained that the  self-rule agreement does not compel Hamas to respond to  everything contained in it, because Hamas does not accept  self-rule.    Referring to the issue of enlistment in the Palestinian  police force, Shaykh Bahr said Hamas has not directed its  members to enlist in the Palestinian police.</p>

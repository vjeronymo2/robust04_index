			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SMITH PLUS SMITH EQUAL BAD NEWS FOR UPSHAW  </P> <P> As the days and games continue, there is less and less doubt as to what the  Celtics will do when Michael Smith is deemed fit to play.  </P> <P> Against big odds, Charles Smith has survived. And Kelvin Upshaw, who provided  more than a few bright moments last season, has not.  </P> <P> Both players are safe now. Michael Smith practiced Thursday, but the No. 1  draft pick is not ready to return. Said Coach Jimmy Rodgers, "It is getting  close. We're trying to identify where he is and go from there."  </P> <P> Barring an injury or unforeseen development, Upshaw is the odd man out. Even  though his $150,000 contract is guaranteed, and Charles Smith's $110,000  minimum deal is not, to reach any other conclusion would be silly.  </P> <P> Smith is getting playing time. Upshaw is not. Smith is making the most of his  time on the floor. Upshaw cannot. Even the always cautious Jan Volk, the team's  general manager, didn't try to deny the obvious. Asked if the disparity in  playing time was a sign Charles Smith had made the team, Volk said, "I'll let  that speak for itself."  </P> <P> Charles Smith further heightened his already solid chances by his play  Wednesday. Twenty-five seconds after entering the game in the second quarter,  he stripped the Nets' Mookie Blaylock and went in for a three-point play.  </P> <P> Smith played 12 minutes and had five assists and three points. Upshaw got his  first playing time since the opener in the final 2 minutes, 27 seconds. That's  not particularly meaningful when your team wins by 34 points.  </P> <P> Through it all, Upshaw has tried to remain optimistic in the face of the  ongoing inauspicious developments. "I'm being patient," he said. "I feel good  about what I've done and I haven't lost any confidence. I'm not down and out.  Any athlete will tell you that not playing is disappointing, but that's all  part of basketball."  </P> <P> Upshaw joined the Celtics March 9 and who can forget his debut? Against the  Nuggets, he had eight points (4-for-4) and four assists in 13 minutes.  Afterwards, a mildly amused Doug Moe, the Denver coach, said Upshaw probably  wouldn't make another basket in the NBA.  </P> <P> Upshaw did tail off toward the end of the season and was not much of a factor  in the playoffs. Then again, who was? Still, he worked on his game all summer  in his native Chicago, showed up at rookie camp (where he accidentally undercut  Larry Bird, forcing the fall that broke two bones in Bird's back) and seemed to  have a spot clinched in the thin Boston backcourt.  </P> <P> Now, he's on the cusp again. He'd like to remain where he is, but he also knows  the situation.  </P> <P> "I'm just waiting for the opportunity," Upshaw said. "I know I can play and I'd  like to do it here. But things are out of my control so I can't worry about  them. I don't think about other things, I think about the job I have to do  here. I can live with whatever decision they make."  </P></p>

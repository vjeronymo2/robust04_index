			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Iryna Popova: "`I Am Shocked. Even in Somalia I </F> Did Not See Such Things,' Said Canadian Observer About  Elections in Crimea"]    [Text] More than 60 percent of the electors participated  in the Crimean elections. It was evident that the Russia bloc  would win and preliminary results confirm this. While  communists reportedly received 10 to 12 percent of the vote, the  Party of Economic Rebirth -- 7 to 8 percent, the Party of Social  Guarantees and the Union in Support of the Republic of Crimea  received 3 percent each, the Russia bloc is expected to hit the  mark of 65 to 70 percent. Although the 14 seats allocated for  parties will not determine the nature of the Crimean Supreme  Soviet, representatives of the bloc are the leaders in  single-seat districts, where elections will have to be repeated.  Names of winners have already been announced in 10 electoral  districts. The new professional legislature will be comprised  of an electrician from a grain elevator, a messenger from a  small company, a mechanic, and a deputy manager of a television  center. In two districts (Yalta and Yevpatoriya) the Crimean  Supreme Soviet elections did not take place at all. Elections  to the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet took place in all the districts,  although many electors responded to President Meshkov's  televised appeal and instead of dropping their ballots into  ballot boxes, took them home.    Pro-Ukrainian organizations, along with the Organization of  the National Movement of the Crimean Tatars, have issued a  declaration and held a news conference emphasizing that  representatives of the Russia bloc and members of electoral  committees themselves were campaigning right at the polling  stations, advising the electors what to do. Ihor Banakh, deputy  chairman of the committee "Crimea With Ukraine" cited a remark  by Canadian citizen Alexander Shelak, an observer from the  Ukrainian Congressional Union of America, who had said: "I am  shocked. Even in Somalia I did not see such things." At any  rate, after Meshkov, the top official of the Republic of Crimea,  advised on television to vote for the Russia bloc and ignore the  Ukrainian elections, after he termed the national quotas the  Supreme Soviet's mistake and a "departing legislature's deal,"  few things can be considered shocking.    Meshkov's concern over the national quotas is quite  understandable. The results of voting in the Crimean Tatar  constituency have demonstrated Kurultay's [Tatars' congress]  convincing victory. According to incomplete reports, some 88  percent voted for Kurultay candidates which amounts to the  political death of the Majlis [Tatar council] opponent, the  National Movement of Crimean Tatars. Kurultay's deputies in the  Crimean legislature are the only thing casting gloom over the  festive mood of pro-Russian forces. They will hardly put up  with this situation, all the more so since Yuriy Meshkov  outlined his stance in the following way: "There's God, there's  the nation, and there's the president. This is what determines  our strategy." That is why the results of the 27 March poll on  changing Crimea's status and granting more powers to the  president, not yet announced, will provide guidance for action.  The Crimean president solemnly promised this to the "Crimean  people."    It is worth pointing out that Yevgeniy Saburov, after  returning to the Crimea, immediately left for Kiev to meet with  Leonid Kravchuk. Under the current circumstances, the subject  of their talks seems very intriguing.</p>

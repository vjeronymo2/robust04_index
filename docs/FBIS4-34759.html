			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina by Pedro </F> Vinas Alfonso; place and date not given; first three paragraphs  are BOHEMIA introduction]    [Text] A few weeks after Roberto Robaina was named minister  of foreign relations, BOHEMIA's international department  requested an interview, which he felt was premature at that  time. We understood, and suggested that we wait for 12 months  and then conduct an extensive interview.    Now that a year has elapsed, we can offer our readers what  may be the most extensive interview the minister has given to  the Cuban press, in which he answers a variety of substantive  questions on Cuba and its place in a world that has changed  dramatically in the last five years.    Our readers will receive a report with a gestation period of  a year. To some extent, it is a report on the performance by the  head of Cuban diplomacy during this time.    [Vinas Alfonso] There has been persistent talk of a strong  diplomatic offensive since you became foreign minister. Is that  true?    [Robaina] People should instead talk of an ongoing offensive  by Cuban diplomacy in the last 35 years. A tremendous diplomatic  battle was waged by Roa in the United Nations in April 1961,  while in another -- though not precisely international -- arena  our forces repelled the mercenaries' attack at the Bay of Pigs.  That has been our style since 1959: exterior work based on what  we Cubans are doing inside our country. Our foreign minister's  diplomatic arguments were so solid because our people were at  that very time defending their destiny on the battlefield.    Now we have again come to a crucial moment in the history of  the revolution, when not only is the sovereignty of our nation  at stake, but also the very existence of the nation. Our  diplomacy must be capable of meeting the challenge of today's  circumstances, and that requires giving a new impetus to this  offensive. I do not believe it has so much to do with who is in  charge of this work, but instead with the pace that the new  times impose.    I maintain that those of us who have the duty of explaining  abroad what is happening in Cuba face a task that is  incomparably less difficult than the effort a housewife makes  every day in her kitchen, or a worker expends in reaching his  workplace early. At the same time, it is a tremendous challenge  to give the world a true image of Cuba, as we are surrounded by  a powerful information monopoly as unipolar as the world in  which we live.    That is what we are doing now, and we certainly talk of a  diplomatic offensive, which we need now: special diplomacy for a  special period.    [Vinas Alfonso] What are Cuba's foreign policy priorities  now?    [Robaina] Since last year we have established a minimal  number of priorities, so we will know exactly where to focus our  work.    In the very first place is our legitimate struggle against  the U.S. embargo, the growing effort by the international  community to condemn this embargo, and taking steps to  neutralize the negative effects of that policy of economic  isolation.    The dissemination of our real image around the world, with  strengths and weaknesses, but a real image as I have explained,  is another of our priorities. The great information  multinationals have for a long time distorted the Cuban reality,  which was been a way of justifying to international public  opinion specific political actions taken against Cuba. With our  modest resources we must, and we can, every day subvert this  situation. The famous human rights issue is one of the most  extensively manipulated enemy campaigns, and as we honor the  truth, we will not remain seated on the bench of the accused  when the greatest violator is trying to serve as our judge.    Other priorities are working to develop economic relations  abroad; working for the true democratization of the United  Nations and of international relations; our growing ties with  the countries of our continent, and specifically with the  Caribbean nations; and becoming more active in regional  organizations. Finally, we work constantly to strengthen the  solidarity movement with Cuba.    It is easy to realize that our goals are not so great as  everything we need to do to achieve them. Time will have the  last word.    [Vinas Alfonso] Does Cuba have a presence in Africa now?  What  are the prospects for our relationship with the "Dark Continent"?    [Robaina] I can categorically answer yes to that question;  we  do maintain a presence in Africa, and we could not do otherwise.  Cuba shares with the African countries, in addition to our  strong ties of blood and a similar culture and habits, the fact  that we belong to the underdeveloped world, so we need to work  together to emerge from underdevelopment; this is obviously  related to our combat against the present manifestations of  colonialism, neocolonialism, and racism.    Our presence in Africa is shown by our 16 embassies and  several hundred Cubans who work in various fields, primarily  health care, as well as in education, sports, and other areas of  economic, scientific, technical, and cultural activity. This is  all a consequence of the numerous bilateral accords we have  signed, and of our participation in multilateral cooperation  organizations.    In addition, despite the enormous limitations imposed by the  special period, Cuba continues to provide Africa with  extraordinary support, like the training we provide to mid- and  upper-level technicians and professionals in all fields, who  later will contribute to the development of their own countries.  Africans make up almost two-thirds of the foreign scholarship  students studying in our country.    In our relationship with Africa, we certainly intend to  continue developing these ties that which benefit us both  bilaterally, and the Third World as a whole.    [Vinas Alfonso] Can we now discuss the integration of our  country with the rest of the Caribbean nations, or is that an  objective?    [Robaina] I do not think we can talk about integration.  Integration as such has not been achieved in the region. Nor of  integration as an objective. Instead, I believe this is a  process that in recent years has taken on great momentum. Do not  forget that in the 1970's we began to develop cooperation plans  for sectors like health care and education with other Caribbean  countries.    During our trip to the seven English-speaking Caribbean  states with which we have diplomatic relations, one of the  constants was their governments' gratitude for the aid Cuba has  provided for years in education and health care. Just in  university education, during these years we have graduated over  600 students from that region. The contribution made by Cuban  medical brigades to Caribbean countries like Guyana and Belize  is widely recognized. And this is also part of the integration  process I was talking to you about.    One of the main steps taken recently is the creation of the  Joint Cuba-Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] Commission, which  should promote cooperation and relations with the 13  English-speaking Caribbean nations of the Caribbean Community,  in specific sectors such as biotechnology, fishing, agriculture,  culture, information, and other areas.    In this move toward regional integration, the projected  Association of Caribbean States should play a very important  role. This is expected to become a reality in 1994, and Cuba  should be a full member of this association.    As you see, this process is going at a good pace, and it  really does have great prospects.    [Vinas Alfonso] What might be the future of Latin America if  the FTA [Free Trade Association] were to be extended to the  entire continent? If that happened, what would happen to our  insistence on regional integration?    [Robaina] Free trade has become a trend of our times,  especially in our hemisphere, after the formation of large  economic blocs in Europe, Asia, and North America.    In addition to the recent FTA, there are in our continent  Mercosur [Common Market of the South], the Group of Three  (Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia), the Andean Pact, Caricom, and  SIECA [Secretariat of Central American Economic Integration],  all of which are moving toward establishing free trade systems  among our countries.    Brazil's government recently proposed creating a Free Trade  Zone for South America, and its intention to extend this to  other geographic areas of Latin America. Cuba is watching the  evolution and execution of all these mechanisms.    It would take a long time for the FTA (known by its English  acronym, NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement]) to be  extended all over the continent, and many difficulties would  need to be overcome. One difficulty is that the United States  would have to be really prepared to eliminate all impediments in  its trade with our region, and treat us as equals. This would  primarily mean that they would need to take into account the  differences existing between that country and our peoples.    Cuba also supports free trade. Because of our geographic  position and the development of our economy, we have always been  open to integration mechanisms.    However, the embargo the United States maintains against  Cuba  is an obstacle, and one of the contradictions of those who  proclaim free trade as a philosophy, while at the same time they  maintain this embargo, apply pressure, and prevent Cuba from  exercising this right.    If we now moved toward a "fast track" implementation of the  FTA on a hemispheric level, our Latin American countries would  have to negotiate separately in bilateral dealings with the  United States, which would obviously be a great advantage for  the United States.    At the next Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias,  one  issue on the agenda will be integration. Cuba will state its  position, which may be summarized like this: before reaching a  hemispheric Free Trade Agreement, we should go through a process  of strictly Latin American integration, which will enable us to  talk with the United States from stronger positions. There is  still a long road to travel before arriving at a continental FTA.    [Vinas Alfonso] Where are our relations with the European  Union?    [Robaina] At a point where we perceive new prospects for  cooperation.    Starting in 1993, a gradual and encouraging change has begun  in Cuban-European relations. An example of this is the aid sent  after the "hurricane of the century" and the neuropathy  epidemic, aid for which all our people are grateful. Another  example is the European Union's rejection of the  extraterritorial nature of the Torricelli Amendment and the  European Parliament's condemnation of the U.S. embargo against  Cuba.    The seminar held in Havana last December demonstrated that  it  is possible to talk in a climate of respect and that there is  consensus on continuing to develop bilateral relations.    I am sure we will move ahead in that direction.    [Vinas Alfonso] In Cuba's case, does Spain fully play its  historic role as the representative of Hispanic America in the  European Union?    [Robaina] I really think you should ask Spain that question.    That said, let me point out that, in fact, Spain has  historically served as the bridge between Latin America and the  European Economic Community (now the European Union), and it has  worked to defend the interests of the continent, which Cuba  looks upon with favor.    In the bilateral area, we have very extensive relations with  Spain in all sectors, and we would like them to continue and  expand. This is appropriate because of the strong solidarity,  affection, and shared identity between the peoples of Spain and  Cuba.    [Vinas Alfonso] What about our relations with the former  socialist nations?    [Robaina] After a period of adjustment and even a  considerable decline in ties of all sorts as a consequence of  the changes in the countries of East Europe, relations are  entering a new phase of normalization and a search for ties  which may be of mutual benefit for our peoples.    Of course, the economic ties have been considerably  affected,  not because of a political decision on either side, but rather  because of the lack of real possibilities for fluid trade.  Nevertheless, there are other channels for cooperation, and we  are working on that. The relations we have developed for over 30  years cannot and must not disappear overnight.    [Vinas Alfonso] Can you tell us about ties with the new  republics in the former USSR, especially with Russia and Ukraine?    [Robaina] Bilateral relations with those countries, which  after the dismembering of the USSR were at an impasse, have  begun to revive and we now see fluid exchanges in both  directions.    Cuba maintains relations with the majority of the states  that  were part of the former USSR. We have ambassadors accredited to  the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Latvia, and we also are  represented in Kazakhstan, Moldova, Belarus, and Estonia.    With the Russian Federation the most difficult moment in  bilateral relations is now behind us. People have become aware  of the potential that exists, and there is an obvious desire to  restore exchanges and active cooperation in various areas on  mutually advantageous terms.    With Ukraine relations are proceeding normally; we want to  renew the legal basis of these relations and begin a new phase  in trade. Recently the Embassy of Ukraine was officially opened  in Havana, and in general we maintain a fluid interchange in  political matters. The Ukrainian Government recently approved a  significant amount of humanitarian aid for Cuba, which we will  receive shortly.    In a general sense, our relations with these new states have  a tradition of over 30 years that unites us with their peoples.  Now we need to restructure our ties on new foundations, based on  the changing situation in today's world.    At the end of last year we were working on some new  agreements that have still not been fully executed, but we are  confident that the situation of relative stagnation that at one  moment threatened our fraternal trade ties has been overcome to  our mutual benefit.    [Vinas Alfonso] The "Nation and Emigration" conference will  soon take place. How might that help to promote a change in the  now old and stale hostility between Washington and Havana?    [Robaina] In the first place, let me make it clear that the  old conflict between Cuba and the United States is not on the  agenda of this conference. As it has been said, this is a  meeting of Cubans who live in over 50 countries all over the  world. The issues to be discussed concern only that  nation-emigres relationship.    Moreover, it is no secret to anyone that the largest number  of Cuban emigres live in the United States, as it is also no  secret to anyone that for 35 years that emigration has been used  by the aggressive policy of that country against Cuba. In the  same way, I am not saying anything new when I say that in recent  times a large part of that emigre community is changing in terms  of their relationship toward the island and their positions on  U.S. policy toward Cuba. Obviously, all this is the context of  Cuba's relations with the emigre community, and it would be  impossible to avoid touching on this situation during the  conference.    Cuba's relations with the United States will definitely not  be promoted at that conference. I will reaffirm once again our  readiness to discuss the issue directly with that government,  without intermediaries and at any time, but in a climate of  mutual respect, equality of conditions, and without any  preconditions or pressure.    [Vinas Alfonso] Will this meeting be the start of an ongoing  exchange? How does it benefit Cubans both here and abroad?    [Robaina] Contacts with our emigres throughout the world  have  always existed, with some more, with others less, but those  contacts have been maintained. Though to be honest, relations  with the Cuban community living in the United States have been,  as I explained, for a long time tainted by the conflict between  the two countries.    Working to normalize relations with the emigre community is  one of the fundamental objectives of the conference. It was  preceded by the dialogue in 1978, which was certainly an  important step taken by the Cuban Government, by means of which  effective answers were given to specific problems affecting  Cuban emigres.    The forthcoming conference in Havana will provide a followup  to that first meeting and solve new problems in the  emigre-nation relationship. Cubans on the island who have  relatives abroad and those in that emigre community who want to  maintain normal ties with Cuba and their families will both  benefit.    [Vinas Alfonso] In Miami some spokespersons on the far right  are saying that the conference is trying to divide the emigre  community. What do you think?    [Robaina] The fact that they are "spokespersons on the far  right" confirms what I already said, that every day that emigre  community is more divided about how to handle their relationship  with Cuba. So it cannot be an objective of the conference to  trigger a process that has already begun on its own.    Obviously, there are different ways of viewing that  emigration, and the presence at the conference of some people  for and others against will actually be the demonstration of a  fact, and not its cause.    [Vinas Alfonso] At all international forums, Cuba insists on  the need to end the embargo. Could there be a possibility of  that happening anytime soon? Might our problems then be  eliminated?    [Robaina] The first is another question that should be  addressed to the U.S. Congress or the White House. But we are  not going to give up our right to denounce the criminal,  antiquated, and ineffective embargo at any forum where a Cuban  representative is present.    And we are working every day to add new forces to the  already  overwhelming mass of countries, organizations, and public  figures all over the world, even in the United States, who speak  out against that brutal step that violates the principal human  right of an entire people, the right to life.    If one day reason triumphs and the embargo is lifted, I can  assure you that would eliminate one of our major problems and  many others that derive from it. But in no way would that be the  end of our difficulties, which have other well-known causes, and  against which we are also working every day.    [Vinas Alfonso] You have just returned from a trip to Asia.  What can you tell us about that region, which is both so remote  and so close?    [Robaina] Precisely that. It is worthwhile to travel that  far, if only to realize that we have very good friends in that  part of the world, some perhaps, our most loyal friends.    The trip included Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Myanmar,  Cambodia, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and had more or less the  same objectives as our former visits to other areas of the world.    As always, we brought the truth about Cuba and learned from  close at hand about others--experiences like those of Vietnam,  which in some aspects coincide with our own economic  transformations. There is much that we can, should, and are  going to apply here.    With the governments we talked about issues of mutual  interest: bilateral and multilateral relations, and the  Non-Aligned Movement, which is now being chaired by an Asian  nation, Indonesia.    We met with ministers, political leaders, and businessmen,  and saw the possibilities of exchanges in various areas,  including economics of course, and we discussed prospects for  joint investments.    Because of the distance separating us, we have to work  creatively to find the most viable mechanisms to increase our  exchanges.    Finally, I want to say that one of the interesting  experiences of my visit was seeing how our diplomatic missions  in those countries, while small and modest, honorably represent  Cuba and are a true example of how to make up with efficiency  and intelligence for the lack of personnel or greater resources.    [Vinas Alfonso] Your appointment a year ago aroused some  opposition. What is the situation now?    [Robaina] Once again, I am not the person who can best  answer  that. But I can tell you what I think now, a year after my  selection as foreign minister.    These have been 12 months filled with a great deal of work  and learning, of experiences of all types; a year in which I  have traveled to various parts of the world, to some 30  countries in all. I have taken part in numerous international  events and talks with personalities from all over the world. It  has been a year to adapt, while on the job, to new  responsibilities, a new workplace, new comrades. The year has  gone well, and I feel pleased about it, although as I am never  satisfied, I think a lot more could have been done, and in fact  that is now the challenge I face for the next 12 months. Let us  see what will happen then.</p>

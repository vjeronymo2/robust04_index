			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AF GENERAL DIDN'T REPORT STEALTH FAILURE;  </P> <P> PENTAGON: LACK OF INFORMATION LED CHENEY TO BRAG OF PLANES' ACCURACY DURING  PANAMA INVASION.  </P> <P> The chief of the Tactical Air Command failed to tell his superiors that Stealth  fighter-bombers missed their targets in the Panama invasion, it was reported  today.  </P> <P> The New York Times said the lack of information led Defense Secretary Dick  Cheney to brag about how accurate the bombing had been when bombs actually  missed by as much as 160 yards.  </P> <P> The newspaper also said a classified Air Force report concluded that there were  defects in planning the Panama operation, confusion over the mission of the  planes, poor coordination between the Army and the Air Force in picking targets  and inadequate pilot training for the weather conditions over the targets.  </P> <P> Gen. Robert D. Russ, whose Tactical Air Command controls the Air Force fighter  planes, issued a statement saying he had left it up to Army commanders to tell  the Pentagon how the invasion fared.  </P> <P> "There is always some confusion in the reporting of any military operation, and  I didn't want to add to it," Russ' statement said.  </P> <P> He added: "When I look back at what has transpired, it is evident that more  detail should have been forwarded."  </P> <P> The report on the performance of the F-117A, called Stealth for its ability to  avoid radar detection, was prepared by the Air Force inspector general, Lt.  Gen. Bradley C. Hosmer.  </P> <P> Cheney had demanded an explanation after reports that a bomb from one of the  two planes had actually hit a hillside some distance from the intended target.  </P> <P> After receiving the report, Cheney's spokesman said May 31 that Cheney was  satisfied that Air Force officials didn't try to mislead him. Spokesman Pete  Williams said the confusion was found to have taken place between those in the  Air Force's chain of command charged with administration of the aircraft and  those in the service's upper chain of command.  </P> <P> Air Force officials reported that both jets had accomplished their mission,  which was to stun and disorient the Panamanian troops, even though one of the  bombs hit a hillside.  </P></p>

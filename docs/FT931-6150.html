			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / NY bomb will cost Dollars 700m for first week NEW YORK last night put the economic dislocation costs of the bombing of the World Trade Centre, which killed five people, at nearly Dollars 700m (Pounds 493m) in the first week alone, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The figures, published by New York city comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, include Dollars 360m in immediate short-term costs of repairing the buildings and business losses. The cost of the first week is estimated at Dollars 332m, with a cost of Dollars 90m for Monday and declining by about 10 per cent each day as businesses find alternative means of operating. This would bring cumulative costs to Dollars 887m if the World Trade Centre towers reopen by March 15. Ms Holtzman said the biggest economic impact appears to be in terms of lost business. Companies may attempt to recoup losses by making claims against the New York Port Authority 'but to the extent that such payments reduced the Port Authority's ability to invest in the region's transportation infrastructure, that would hurt the region'.</p>

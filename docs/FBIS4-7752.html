			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The quiet political scene last weekend was  stirred a bit by the report that the Slovak National Party [SNS]  deputy chairman Juraj Molnar delivered a speech at the World  Congress of Slav Orthodox and Christian Nations in Moscow.  According to SNS chairman Jan Slota, Juraj Molnar left for  Moscow as an observer with the consent of the party leadership  but was not authorized to deliver any message. According to Jan  Slota, the SNS did not establish any contacts with the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia and does not intend to do so in the  future. Our correspondent Vladimir Lach tried to find out more  about the whole affair. Jan Slota, chairman of the SNS, told  him the following, among other things:    [Begin recording] [Slota] The leadership of the party did  not  know that a congress of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia  was being organized in Moscow, and, therefore, I will not  comment on this; for me, it is completely unfounded. I also  find the comments of Messrs. Bugar [Hungarian Christian  Democratic Party chairman], Hagyari [chairman of the Party of  Conservative Democrats], Duris [Republican Party chairman], and  Mrs. Borzova [deputy chairwoman of the Party of the Democratic  Left], for example, totally inappropriate and stupid because  they are not verified. For example, Mr. Bugar said that Juraj  Molnar delivered a speech at the congress of the Liberal  Democratic Party. The truth is that the deputy chairman was not  even there. So I suggest that, before making any comments,  people check whether the report is first true.    [Lach] Mr. Chairman, do you know the whole text of Mr.  Molnar's message of greetings to the world congress?    [Slota] Molnar said altogether five sentences at the  congress. He simply said that all of the Slav nations should  unite, and, in particular, the small Slav nations should be  protected by the Pan-Slavic group of nations. At the end, he  said, of course, that, without great Russia, the Slav nation as  such would not exist. I am convinced about this. [passage  omitted]    [Lach] In this connection, I cannot resist asking about your  opinion. It is known that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy should come for  a private visit to Slovakia on 16-19 April. We know that many  countries expelled him. What is your view about Mr.  Zhirinovskiy's visit because there is talk that the SNS--now I  will exaggerate--is responsible for it.    [Slota] All I can say about this is that it is just as new  for me as it is for you that Mr. Zhirinovskiy is supposed to be  here between 16 and 19 April. I can unequivocally say that  neither our deputy chairman nor the SNS has anything to do with  the visit. I do not know who invited him privately. I  personally think that, because we are such a democratic country,  as everyone keeps saying--at the moment we have the most  democratic government ever--I do not see any reason that we  should be taken aback by the fact that Mr. Zhirinovskiy will  come for a private visit to Slovakia. It can happen, for  instance, that, in democratic elections, Mr. Zhirinovskiy will  be elected president of Russia. I am not quite sure whether, if  the new president wanted to visit Slovakia, we would be taken  aback by that as well. I can only be surprised. [passage  omitted]</p>

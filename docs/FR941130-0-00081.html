In identifying community service opportunities, the Secretary expects institutions to consult with their students (page 32269).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with statutory changes, the Secretary proposed to amend several provisions governing use of FWS funds.

Third, the amount of an institution's allocation under the FWS programs that may be transferred to the FSEOG program would be increased from 10 percent to 25 percent. Fourth, an institution would have additional carry-back authority to pay students who work during the summer.

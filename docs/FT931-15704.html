			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / France tones down its Bosnia camps threat FRANCE yesterday moderated its threat to use force to liberate Bosnian prisoner camps single-handed, but reserved the right to do so as a last resort if the United Nations failed to sanction international action. Mr Bernard Kouchner, health and humanitarian affairs minister, will shortly lead a delegation to Bosnia-Hercegovina to examine the camps there, and report back to the UN to demand a mandate to use force, said an official of the Elysee Palace. He will also negotiate the liberation of prisoners where possible. The government fully accepted there is for the moment no UN mandate to use force to back up the French-inspired UN resolution voted last month  - number 798 - which demands the closure of the detention camps, said the official. The UN security council would have to vote a new resolution if force was to be used to free the prisoners. President Francois Mitterrand, who under the French constitution is head of the army, would prefer to act with a UN mandate, but did not exclude acting independently, she said. France was seeking a UN decision within days and felt the plight of prisoners was so serious that action should be taken independently of the deadlocked Geneva peace talks, said the official. The government's announcement is likely to worry some of its less military intervention-minded allies and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, who is keen to keep the peace talks going. However, the move is likely to go down well in France, just as the government is seeking ways of reducing the defeat it faces in the March parliamentary election. The civil war receives regular detailed coverage in the French media, for which human rights are a strong and constant theme, and the alleged rape of female prisoners by Serbian soldiers has provoked national outrage. A human rights group, International Action against Hunger, said Socialist Party chief, Mr Laurent Fabius, the former prime minister, Mr Michel Rocard, and other French politicians and intellectuals would hold a demonstration in Geneva on Thursday against 'ethnic cleansing' by Serbs. Both the left- and right-wing are broadly keen for western military intervention in Bosnia, though Mr Pierre Joxe, the defence minister was said to be angered at the threat to act alone. Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, former Socialist defence minister, added yesterday: 'One must not be in too much of a hurry to risk the lives of our soldiers.' Meanwhile, the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, yesterday denounced the proposal as an 'election stunt'. Mr Karadzic also criticised the role of the French commander of UN forces in Bosnia, Gen Philippe Morillon, who Mr Dumas said had briefed him on whether the military means existed for such a plan. The Bosnian government yesterday said it had requested the replacement of Gen Morillon, and the Sarajevo commander, Egyptian General Hussein Abdel Razek. Bosnia had previously said it had lost confidence in Gen Morillon and his staff, following last Friday's assassination of deputy prime minister Hakija Turajlic while under UN protection.</p>

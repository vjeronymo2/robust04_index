			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Manischewitz Extends Deadline: Manischewitz Co. said it agreed to extend until  Aug. 4 the deadline for completing a merger of the Jersey City, N.J.-based  kosher foods company with Levine, Tessler, Leichtman &amp; Co. of Beverly  Hills. Manischewitz said the date was extended beyond July 31 because more time  is needed to resolve issues necessary for the merger and to allow time for an  amendment to its proxy statement for a shareholders meeting on the merger  proposal.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- The government plans to  give the five North Korean loggers who arrived Wednesday the  opportunity to attend public vocational training centers here  according to their goals, aptitude and ability, a senior  government official said Thursday.    The loggers, the first allowed to resettle here through  consultations between South Korea and the Commonwealth of  Independent States, will receive social adaption education first  for one or two months before entering vocational training  institutes.    The government, however, is studying whether to place them  in  existing classes at the centers or educate them separately,  according to the official.    The five North Koreans, who escaped from Pyongyang-run  logging camps in Siberia, arrived here Wednesday afternoon via a  third country. It is the first time that the Seoul government  has allowed North Korean loggers to resettle here through lawful  means.    In preparation for the increase in those wanting to come  here  after escaping from the Siberian logging camps or North Korean  territory, the government is studying formation of a "special  training team" to deal exclusively with North Koreans.    But if they want to receive higher education, the government  will examine how to enable them to enter colleges or  universities, the official said.    The government has tentatively decided to help the North  Koreans find jobs after they finish vocational training, and  will give them 10 million won (about 12,407 U.S. dollars) each  in support for their resettlement.</p>

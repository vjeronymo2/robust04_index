			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Strong &amp; Fisher back in the black with Pounds 2.43m STRONG &amp; Fisher, the leather company rescued from the brink of insolvency by Hillsdown Holdings, is celebrating its return to the black last year by resuming ordinary dividend payments. The UK's leading sheepskin processor - 70 per cent owned by Hillsdown - is paying 1p to ordinary shareholders, their first dividend since the 2p interim in December 1989. The group, which has been reporting in three six-month tranches to bring it into line with Hillsdown, also unveiled a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.43m for the 18 months to December 31. In the final 12 months, Strong &amp; Fisher reported a profit of Pounds 9.9m. The last full accounting period covered the 12 months to June 29 1990 when the group incurred a loss of Pounds 17.52m. Mr Michel Buswell, chairman, said the group was now financially sound. All four divisions - hide and skin collecting and trading, fellmongery, tanning and rendering - had been profitable in the final 12 months. Strong had between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m cash in the bank and planned to make an acquisition within the next year to reduce its dependence on leather, Mr Buswell said. The purchase was likely to be in a manufacturing industry. The results were depressed by an exceptional write-down of stocks and current assets which, after profits on disposals, totalled Pounds 4.6m. Earnings per share for the 18 months worked through at 0.54p. That compared with losses of 100.6p for the previous 12-month period.</p>

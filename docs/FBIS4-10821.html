			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 14 Apr (PL) -- Argentine President  Carlos Menem welcomed Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina  here in the first activity of Robaina's official 48-hour visit,  which the two described as very positive.    Robaina, who met for nearly an hour yesterday with the  president at his "Olivos" residence on the outskirts of this  capital, said that the meeting was "useful, positive, and  friendly."    Acting Argentine Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella, who  also  attended the meeting, told PRENSA LATINA that the Cuban  minister's visit is "very significant, successful, and  important."    In statements to reporters, the Cuban foreign minister, who  also met with the Senate president and the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, pointed out that "there are many more  things that unite us than separate us."    Regardless of our differences, which stem from our different  political systems, the meeting with the president at all times  focused on the common ground in Cuban-Argentine relations, he  added.    During the meeting, the Cuban foreign minister explained to  the president the current situation in Cuba with emphasis on  economic aspects and informed him of how Cubans are tackling  their difficulties.    Robaina and Menem reportedly also discussed the  opportunities  for Cuba and Argentina to promote Latin American integration.    PRENSA LATINA learned that the president suggested further  exchanges between the two Foreign Ministries and proposed a trip  to the island by Argentine businessmen to survey current  conditions for investment and trade.    After meeting with Menem, the chief of Cuban diplomacy gave  a  lecture on Cuban foreign policy to a large group of Argentine  and foreign diplomats at the headquarters of the Advisory  Council on International Relations (CARI).    Robaina, who was declared an "illustrious visitor" by the  Buenos Aires Deliberative Council yesterday, later met with  partners of the Commodity Exchange in this capital, with members  of the Cuban community living here, and with leaders of the  Grand Front Leftist Coalition, among other activities.    The Cuban foreign minister arrived from Peru yesterday after  visiting Uruguay and will meet today with Deputy Economy  Minister Carlos Sanchez, businessmen of the Chamber of Commerce,  Industry, and Production, and with the Foreign Relations  Committee of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies.    He will also meet separately with former President Raul  Alfonsin, leader of the Radical Civic Union, and with the  Socialist Unity (US) leadership.    Robaina will head for Paraguay tomorrow. His visit will  conclude today with an activity organized by friendship and  solidarity groups, which are demanding an end to the U.S.  blockade against Cuba and respect for the country's  self-determination.</p>

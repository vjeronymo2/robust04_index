			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Expanding Appleyard up at Pounds 5m Appleyard Group, the North Yorkshire-based motor dealer, yesterday announced the acquisition of five passenger car dealerships from Whitworths Holdings, the private flour milling group, and at the same time unveiled a sharp increase in 1993 pre-tax profits from Pounds 223,000 to Pounds 5.12m. The acquisition is for Pounds 10.2m cash and will be funded from the Pounds 16.4m proceeds of last September's 3-for-10 rights issue. The mixed franchise dealerships being acquired showed a combined operating loss of Pounds 100,000 last year on turn-over of Pounds 44.6m and had estimated net assets of Pounds 8.9m including Pounds 5.9m of property assets. Mr Mike Williamson, chairman and chief executive, was confident the financial performance of the dealerships could be improved. He said the deal was a further step in the group's national growth strategy. The group's profit was achieved on turnover up 20 per cent to Pounds 366.9m (Pounds 305.5m). Operating profits were Pounds 5.9m (Pounds 1.94m). Mr Williamson said the passenger car business benefited from the stronger new car market while used car volumes and margins firmed as the year progressed. The group has continued its multi-franchising strategy and now has 15 sites with two or more franchises - two of the Whitworths' dealerships are also multi-franchise. As part of the plan to widen its commercial vehicles interests the group acquired WSM Motors, a Mercedes-Benz operation in Bristol and Yeovil in November. Trading profits from the group's associated contract hire and leasing business increased by 72 per cent to Pounds 1.5m. Net interest costs fell to Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 3.61m). Earnings per share increased from 0.8p to 6.8p and the final dividend is raised to 2.9p (2.6p) making a total of 5.5p (5.2p). COMMENT Appleyard continues to benefit from the effects of operational gearing following its cost reduction programme with incremental volume improvement producing disproportionate profit gains. In terms of the outlook profits from new and used car sales are continuing to improve and the after sales market is strong. The group's multi-franchising strategy makes sense and the acquisition - which looks sensibly priced  - will broaden its geographic reach. Further acquisitions are likely. Pre-tax profits should reach Pounds 8.5m this year producing earnings per share of 9.6p and a prospective p/e of 16.1.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Extravision" newscast] </F>   [Text] Army General Humberto Ortega Saavedra, commander in  chief of the Sandinist People's Army [EPS], on 23 May met with  Juan Diego Castro, Costa Rican government and public security  minister [title as heard], and with Deputy Ministers Laura  Chinchilla and Oscar Alban in San Jose. They discussed how  desirable it was to sign a general agreement similar to the one  signed on in Managua on 28 August 1992 between the Costa Rican  Government and Public Security Ministry and the EPS.    The new agreement will allow a more efficient coordination  of  all border issues to better fight smuggling, drug trafficking,  cattle rustling, illegal alien smuggling, and gunrunning, as  well as to coordinate maritime patrols. They also agreed to  increase and standardize coordination mechanisms to reinforce  the operations carried out by the civil defense of the two  countries, especially mutual aid and communications during  natural disasters and joint maneuvers to facilitate the  protection of the environment.    Relations of respect and understanding have existed between  the two institutions for a long time and were made evident once  more.</p>

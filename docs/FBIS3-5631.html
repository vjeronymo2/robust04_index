Speaking at a regular press meeting, Fujii backed off from  comments he made Sunday in an informal speech made in Tochigi  Prefecture, in which he indicated "as his personal view" that  the economy had hit bottom.    "This is an official press meeting," he said, brushing aside  further questions on his earlier remarks.    Fujii also repeated that he is "confident that steady  implementation of the latest 15.25 trillion stimulus package  will put the economy on a recovery track in fiscal 1994."    The finance minister declined to comment on a meeting of  cabinet ministers earlier on Wednesday to discuss Japan's  "voluntary" market-opening package to address the ongoing trade  dispute with the United States.    He described the meeting as "free talking," but declined to  comment further.    The reason for the hastily-arranged meeting was seen to  allow  discussion over Japan's stance before Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata meet U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher, who is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo  for an official visit Wednesday night.    Asked about the latest U.S. stance of not reopening trade  talks, Fujii said that Japan would "positively" take its  "voluntary measures" aside from negotiations.    Meanwhile, Fujii reiterated that the government is not  considering a plan to boost the 10-year public works program of  430 billion yen as part of the package.</p>

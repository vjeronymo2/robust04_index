			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (2): Vehicles to catch before it's too late - The Tax Deadline 1, Overview / A new taxation term is looming. So we start this Review with four pages of revision exercises for those who will soon face the Revenue's examiners THE NEW tax year starts in just over nine weeks time, on April 6. A year ago, taxpayers did not know whether there would be a Labour or a Conservative government, which made tax planning difficult. That uncertainty is removed this year but, given the size of the public sector borrowing requirement, chancellor Norman Lamont may make some tax changes in the Budget in March. The most widely expected are an above-inflation rise in excise duties, and an increase in the scope of value-added tax. There is nothing that tax planning can do to mitigate these measures. There is a risk, perhaps not in this Budget but later, that the government could increase direct taxation or reduce the scope or number of tax shelters. One, the Business Expansion Scheme (see page 8), is already to close at the end of the year. It is therefore time to take advantage of the still large number of tax-efficient vehicles available. You should also scrutinise your finances, perhaps with professional help, to see that they are being structured in the most tax-efficient way. Some of the products referred to in this article will be discussed further in the three pages that follow. JOINT FINANCES Once you receive your tax return form for 1992-93, at the end of April or the beginning of May, all the income earned and capital gains made during the year to 6 April will have to be recorded. To begin with, are you making use of the different tax bands? In his last Budget, Mr Lamont introduced a new band of 20 per cent, payable on the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. Basic rate tax at 25 per cent is payable on taxable income over this amount up to Pounds 23,700, when the higher rate of 40 per cent tax is levied. If your spouse is paying tax at a lower rate than you are, or is a non-taxpayer, you have considerable flexibility in rearranging your tax affairs, because of the introduction of independent taxation in 1990. This means that a husband and wife each have a personal allowance, which is Pounds 3,445 for the tax year 1992-93. Those aged over 64 have higher allowances. Income-producing investments and deposits, should be transferred to the lower-rate payer, to make use of their lower tax band. If, for example, you are paying tax at 40 per cent, transferring your investments to a non-earning spouse, means that there will be no tax to pay on the first Pounds 3,445 and that the excess will be taxed at 25 per cent. If the husband's income is less than total allowances, the married couple's allowance of Pounds 1,720 can be transferred to the wife. From April 6, 1993, married couples will be able to specify which of them should receive the allowance, or can elect to split it between them. You must do this before the tax year and should write to your tax office well before April 6, otherwise the allowance will be paid to the husband. PENSIONS Additional voluntary contributions to a pension are one of the most tax-efficient ways of increasing your pension benefits. Tax relief can be claimed on AVCs and also on premiums paid into a personal pension plan. The maximum contribution depends on your age. (See page 6). CAPITAL GAINS TAX You can make gains of Pounds 5,800 in the 1992-93 tax year, before having to pay tax (allowance is made for the effect of inflation on asset prices). Gains above Pounds 5,800 are charged at your highest rate of income tax. Many people do not use up their capital gains tax allowance, and end up with an unnecessarily large bill when they come to sell their investments. For shareholders, one way round this problem is to 'bed-and-breakfast' the shares by selling them on the market and repurchasing them to bring gains up to the tax-free allowance. Your taxable gain next time you sell will be reduced, because you will be starting from a higher base. Bed-and-breakfasting can also be used to establish losses in order to reduce the size of your capital gains. The annual CGT exemption cannot be carried forward (though losses can be carried forward to set against future gains); but if you have reached your CGT threshold and your spouse has not, you can transfer assets to them, so that they can use their Pounds 5,800 allowance. INHERITANCE TAX You can give Pounds 3,000 in any tax year to a beneficiary, without invoking any IHT liability. If you did not use last year's allowance, you can still do so by the end of this tax year, although you must have used up this year's Pounds 3,000 first. So a married couple can transfer Pounds 12,000 to their children if they did not use up last year's allowances. The allowance can only be carried forward by one year - it is lost thereafter. You can also give small gifts of Pounds 250 to as many people as you like, free of IHT, in any tax year. PERSONAL EQUITY PLANS You can top up your general Pep with the Pounds 6,000 allowable for the tax year. A further Pounds 3,000 can be placed in a single-company Pep (see the survey, starting on page 18). TESSAS Introduced in January 1991, a tax exempt special savings account pays tax-free interest on a maximum investment of Pounds 9,000 deposited over five years. (See page 7). DEPOSITS If you receive interest gross from a bank or building society account, Moira Elms, of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, suggests closing and then reopening a savings account as a means of paying less tax on the interest. This is because closing an account triggers a change in the way you are taxed. The Inland Revenue normally assesses your tax liability on the interest earned in the previous tax year, known as 'prior-year basis'. But if you close an account before the end of the tax year, the tax due will ordinarily be based on interest earned during the current year (current-year basis). Since interest rates on bank and building society deposits have been falling, it is to your advantage to get your liability assessed on a current-year basis. CHARITIES Gift Aid scheme will allow you to give Pounds 600 or more to charity tax-efficiently by the end of the tax year. COMPANY CARS Brooks Macdonald Gayer, financial advisers, remind employees to plan business journeys so that the lower mileage limit of 2,500 or the upper limit of 18,000 is exceeded by the end of the tax year. The standard scale charge of company cars is increased by 50 per cent for low business mileage, and reduced by 50 per cent on mileage exceeding the upper limit.</p>

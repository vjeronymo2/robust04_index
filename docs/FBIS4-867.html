			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 16 Apr (AFP) -- Four days before the  deadline expires to designate a transitional prime minister, the  Zairian opposition has accused President Mobutu's supporters of  preventing Etienne Tshisekedi from returning to power. The  opposition based its accusations on the fact that the  presidential camp "boycotted" the summit meeting of the two  political groups scheduled for yesterday at the Palais du Peuple  in Kinshasa.    A 24-hour deadline was given to the presidential camp by the  opposition "to give its views and considerations" after Mr.  Tshisekedi was chosen for the post of prime minister by the most  radical wing of the opposition, the Sacred Union of the Radical  Opposition [USOR].    Two political parties of the opposition, the Union of  Republic and Democracy and the Rally of the Forces of Democratic  Change [RFCD] did not participate in the meeting at which this  appointment took place. They had denounced the "irregularities"  and the "fait accompli" to which, according to them, the USOR  wanted to subject them.    The presidential camp believes that the consultations within  the opposition should be held with all its members as demanded  by the law. However, it is guarding itself from any  interference in its "internal affairs."    Furthermore, in a statement to the media, Joseph Nsinga,  chairman of the RFCD, an ally of the USOR, called on the Union  to agree to discuss "objectively" and "on an equal footing" with  all the members of the opposition concerning the appointment of  the prime minister. But this should be done in line with the  spirit of the transition Constitutional Act. For Mr. Nsinga, if  the entire opposition discusses "without dictate and spirit of  exclusion," a solution will be found quickly.    "With what is going on at Zaire's border, the country cannot  be left without a government," Mr. Nsinga stated, stressing that  the Zairian people do not need a civil war, but want to be  governed.</p>

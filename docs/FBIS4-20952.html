			<p>BFN     [Text] Coca producers from Cochabamba's tropical region  have suspended their peasant and self-defense patrols following  the signing of an agreement with the government. They will  maintain the alert, however, until the government fulfills its  promises. The report was provided by coca producers leader Evo  Morales to Fides News Agency.    Morales said they will fulfill their part of the agreement  with the government and will wait a prudent period of time to  see the results of the alternative development program.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Legal proceedings against the leader of Russia's  Democratic Choice, Yegor Gaydar, on charges of slander planned  for June 29 failed to take place because Gaydar's representative  failed to appear in court. The appeal was initiated by leader  of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy. Legal proceedings will be held on July 7, the  court decided.    Gaydar's representative, his lawyer Genri Reznik sent a  notification to the court saying that he was overloaded with  current affairs, that he had to go on a trip on business and  that he would go on holiday from July 26. Reznik asked to  postpone the proceedings and demanded that they be held not  earlier than September 10.    Zhirinovskiy initiated an appeal against Gaydar after Gaydar  published the article "A Stake on Villains" in the IZVESTIYA  newspaper. In the article Gaydar called Zhirinovskiy a "fascist  populist."</p>

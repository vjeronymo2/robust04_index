			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zan Fuxiang (2501 4395 4382); Part One of a </F> Series of Discussions on the New Tax System: "The New Features  of the New Industrial and Commercial Tax System"]    [Text] Editor's note: Since the new tax system went  into effect at the beginning of 1994, the JIDIAN RIBAO editorial  department has received many letters from our readers, reporting  a lack of understanding of the substance of this tax reform, and  hoping that we would fill them in on it. In response to these  requests, the editorial department has invited the Ministry of  Machine Building and Electronics' Economic Regulation and State  Assets Oversight departments to write a series of articles on  the new tax system, which we are carrying here successively for  reference by our large numbers of readers.    In the new tax system that went into effect at the beginning  of 1994, what actually are the new features? The new parts are  in contrast to the old system. Our former industrial and  commercial tax system was formed after the 1984 substitution of  taxes for profits and the overall reform of industrial and  commercial taxes and profits, being a multi-tax and -profit,  multi-link, and multi-level compound tax system with 32 tax  caegories, the major ones being the flow and income taxes,  complemented by related auxiliary tax categories. But it was  not adaptable to our socialist market economy development, being  hard to play the proper regulatory role in the area of dealing  with the distribution relations among the state, enterprises,  and individuals and between the center and localities, which was  adverse to the formation of China's large uniform market and the  implementation of our state industrial policy.    The new tax system reforms old-system defects, such as  nonuniform tax laws and tax administration, a too complicated  tax system, too many and indiscriminate tax preferences, and an  ever-growing gap between nominal tax rates and real tax burdens,  so will be bound to bring stability and prosperity to economic  activities, mainly as follows:    --It will contribute to fair tax burdens, promoting  equal competition. The former enterprise income tax  categories were set up with tax rates varying by respective  ownership systems, with large- and medium-sized state  enterprises subject to a 55-percent proportional [flat] tax  rate, private enterprises subject to a 35-percent flat tax rate,  and small state enterprises and collective enterprises subject  to an eight-grade progressive tax rate for excess income. The  new tax system sets the enterprise income tax rate at 33  percent, while giving the proper consideration to small  enterprises with smaller annual incomes by setting two  additional lower tax rates, to consolidate the tax laws and  regulations for domestic-invested enterprises [DIEs]. As  enterprises of all ownership systems use the same financial  accounting principles, when calculating income taxes, they all  adjust taxable income based on the provisions of the income tax  laws and regulations, with the tax provisions on reductions and  exemptions also becoming more consistent, thus consolidating  taxable income criteria. While the former flow tax system  included the three tax categories of value-added taxes, product  taxes, and business taxes, the new flow tax system uses a dual  regulatory system of general regulation through value added  taxes and special regulation through consumption taxes in  coordination with business taxes, overcoming the old tax  system's irrational phenomena, such as duplicate collections and  overlapping regulatory functions. As the new tax system  consolidates the internal and external flow tax system, as well  as gradually consolidating other internal and external tax  categories, it paves the way for the operation of a uniform and  equal tax policy in the same market climate for DIEs and FIEs of  all economic-ownership components.    -- It will help to rationalize the distribution  relations among the state, enterprises, and individuals.  Certain too high tax rates in the old tax system were hard for  enterprises to bear, with its host of preferential policies hard  for the revenue sector to deal with. Local governments and  responsible departments also used various pretexts to collect  sizeable amounts from enterprises through means, such as  management fees, various funds, and set-asides.  Contract-enterprise income taxes made enterprise income taxes  exist in name only, as well as making for a confusing dual  status for the state as both public manager and state-enterprise  assets owner. The new tax system eliminates income-tax  contracting, contributing to the conversion of both enterprise  operating forces and government functions. The new tax system  eliminates the "state enterprise regulatory tax" and the  collection from state enterprises of state transportation and  priority construction funds and state budget-regulation funds,  not only lightening enterprise burdens, but also changing this  nonstandard distribution form between the state and enterprises.  For instance, the state-enterprise income tax rate had reached  55 percent, with some having to pay profit-regulation taxes,  causing enterprise difficulties that forced the adoption of  tax-reduction and -exemption measures, causing a phenomenon of  high tax rates, many preferences, a narrow tax base, and low tax  burdens, and eroding the tax base to cause a large loss of  revenue. The new tax system will change this situation of  reductions by the state and enterprise insustainability. In the  old tax system, as to individual income taxes, foreigners were  subject to the "Individual Income Tax Law," Chinese citizens to  the "Interim Regulatons on Individual Income Regulation Taxes,"  and individual industrial and commercial household operations to  the "Intermim Regulations on Urban and Rural Individual  Industrial and Commercial Household Operation Income Taxes,"  with three taxes coexisting. This was hard to interpret in both  legislation and execution, as well as being out of line with  international practice. The new tax system provides for  individual income taxes to be collected mainly on higher  incomes, with lower or no taxes on middle and low incomes,  helping to regulate the personal income gap, as well as  alleviating the conflict of social distribution injustice.    --It will help to delimit central and local revenue and  tax management jurisdiction, to meet the needs of tax  sharing. As the market role in the disposition of resources  has expanded steadily, the flaws of the former revenue package  system have grown ever-more evident. The division of tax  categories in the new tax system considers not only income  distribution between the center and localities, but also the  regulatory impact of taxation on economic development and social  distribution. All legislative authority for central taxes,  jointly-shared taxes, and local taxes is concentrated in the  center, to ensure uniform central government decrees, and to  preserve a nationally uniform market and equal enterprise  competition. The taxation uses graded collection, with central  and shared taxes collected by the central tax agency, the local  share of shared taxes deposited directly into local treasuries  by the central tax agency, and local taxes collected by local  tax departments. This will help economically developed regions  to continue to maintain a faster growth momentum while, through  central-revenue return and transfer payment of taxes to  localities, supporting the development of economically backward  regions and the upgrading of old industrial bases.    --The new tax system streamlines and standardizes tax  categories. The elimination of tax categories not suited  to economic development, merging of duplicate tax categories,  and installation of certain necessary tax categories, will  contribute to tax-system simplification and efficiency. For  instance, we have switched all of the products previously  subject to product taxes to value added taxes, as well as  selecting 11 products, such as tobacco, alcohol, cosmetics,  expensive jewelry, and small motor vehicles, for collection of  consumption taxes in addition to value added taxes, to reflect  the principle of essentially maintaining the previous tax  burden. The new system's business taxes have been expanded  appropriately to include not only DIEs and units, such as state,  collective, and private enterprises, and operations by Chinese  citizens, but also FIEs and foreign enterprises. While the  old business-tax collection scope involved secondary industries  and all tertiary ones, the new business tax can include in  principle operations that provide taxable services, transfers  of invisible assets, and sales of real property. The new  business-tax taxable items are reduced from 14 to nine, with the  27 tax rates in four grades reduced to nine in two grades. The  collection of value added taxes on land can appropriately  regulate excessive real estate transaction profits. The urban  and rural construction maintenance tax will become one of the  key tax categories in the local tax system. Other revisions of  tax categories are: 1) we have abolished the rural market  transaction, livestock transaction, oilburning special, bonus,  and wage regulation taxes; 2) we have made the special  consumption tax a consumption tax with a special regulatory  role; 3) we have eliminated the collection from FIEs and  foreigners of urban real estate and car- and boat-use license  taxes, collecting uniform real estate and car-and boat-use  taxes, and suitably raising currently too low tax rates and  payments; 4) we have devolved authority to localities for  slaughtering and banquet taxes; 5) we are collecting inheritance  taxes.    Through this tax reform, China's new industrial and  commercial tax system will have the 17 tax categories of value  added, consumption, business, individual income, enterprise  income, FIE and foreign-enterprise income, resource, urban land  use, land value added, urban and rural construction maintenance,  real estate, car and boat, fixed asset investment orientation  regulation, stamp, securities transaction, inheritance, and  slaughtering taxes.</p>

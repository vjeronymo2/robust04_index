			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Matters Related to the Standing Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No documents have been received yet. This agenda item consists of three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subitems:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Report of the Chairman.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The United States strongly supports the active  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> role which the current Standing Committee, under the leadership of New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Zealand, has played in carrying out the many functions given to it by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolutions adopted by Conferences of the Parties. This includes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review of compliance with these resolutions by the Parties and making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions for appropriate action when Parties are not in compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Regional representation on the Standing Committee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Support an increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Standing Committee membership if budgetary implications can be resolved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Standing Committee is currently composed of six Regional voting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives of North America (Canada), Central and South America and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Caribbean (Trinidad and Tobago, the Vice Chair), Asia (Thailand),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oceania (New Zealand, the Chair), Africa (Senegal), and Europe (Sweden).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are also three  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex officio,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> nonvoting members: Switzerland  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (depositary country), Japan (past host country), and the United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (current host country). Each CITES Region currently has one representative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the Standing Committee, regardless of how large or small the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parties (Africa has 43 CITES parties, for example, while North America has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only 3 and Oceania only 4). A proposal submitted by Malawi but not yet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actually reviewed would increase the number of Regional representatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from Regions having larger numbers of Parties. The United States will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider support for such proposals depending on their exact nature and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only after full consideration by the Budget Committee of their financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Election of new members and alternate regional members:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Encourage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> membership which will continue the active role of the Standing Committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Regional representatives of North America, Europe, and Oceania are open  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for review by their respective Regions at COP9. The United States, as host  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of COP9, will continue on the Standing Committee as past host country until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> COP10. A new Chair will be selected by the new Standing Committee during a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting to be held at the close of COP9; while the United States will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a vote, the U.S. position is to encourage selection of a Chair with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strong commitment to a proactive Standing Committee role in the management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of CITES affairs, as New Zealand has done during the past two years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> X. Report of the Secretariat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Report of the Secretariat has not yet been received by the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When received, the Service will carefully review issues pertaining to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> success of procedures for Parties to set budgetary and work priorities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> setting of new short-term and long-term objectives for the Secretariat;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation of the performance of the Secretariat; and progress in assisting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parties to more forcefully implement the Convention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The biennial report provides the major way for the Secretariat, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary General, to report priorities, accomplishments, and problems to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Parties. These are critical management issues facing CITES which need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be addressed in the Secretariat's report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> XI. Financing and budgeting of the Secretariat and of meetings of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conference of the Parties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Financial Report for 1992&hyph;1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is possible at this time. The United States continues to advocate fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility and accountability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Anticipated expenditures for 1994 and 1995  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is possible at this time. The United States continues to advocate fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility and accountability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Budget for 1996&hyph;1998 and Medium-term Plan for 1996&hyph;2000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> See Doc. 9.10_Budget Estimates for the CITES Trust Fund for 1996&hyph;1997 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the Medium-term Plan for 1996&hyph;2000. This document was only received a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short time ago by the Service, and is still undergoing review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oppose any substantial increase in the Secretariat's budget representing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant increase in its work plan. Support budget increases requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Secretariat in cases where the growing membership is placing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing burdens on staff, without any commitment to an increased U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribution. Support an evaluation of priorities and possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reprogramming of budget items into underfunded or unfunded areas of higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

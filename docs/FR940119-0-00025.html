			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter expressed support for and endorsed adoption of Colorado's proposed amendment. The commenter stated that the amendment allows the Division to make sound scientific reclamation judgments based upon site-specific conditions and ensures an environmentally sound reclamation configuration. The commenter recognized that the amendment does not represent a blanket exemption from complete highwall elimination for preexisting operations but requires applicants to make a specific demonstration in order to qualify for the exemption. Lastly, the commenter stated that the amendment provides an appropriate balance between the responsibilities of the operator to make an adequate demonstration, and the Division's responsibility to evaluate each submittal in light of the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director agrees with the commenter that the amendment does not provide a ``blanket exemption'' from complete highwall elimination for preexisting operations (those operations existing prior to August 3, 1977, the date SMCRA was passed). An operator must use all reasonably available spoil to backfill highwalls that were created before August 3, 1977, and continued to be used thereafter (finding No. III.3.) and to backfill remined highwalls that were initially mined and abandoned prior to August 3, 1977 (finding No. III.4.). In either of these situations, if the volume of reasonably available spoil exists for the operator to completely backfill the highwall, the operator must do so under Colorado's proposed rules. As the commenter stated, an operator must under Colorado's proposed rules completely backfill the highwall unless the operator demonstrates that the volume of spoil is insufficient to completely backfill the highwall. For these and the other reasons discussed in finding Nos. III.3. and 4., the Director is, as requested by the commenter, approving Colorado's proposed rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. Request for OSM to Reject Colorado's Proposed Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter, on behalf of several individuals, expressed opposition to Colorado's proposed amendment and requested that OSM reject it. Specifically, the commenter stated that regulators have caused much of the breakdown in coal enforcement by cutting ``special deals'' that overlook violations and sidestep rules to accommodate coal operators. The commenter further stated that Colorado's proposed amendment represents a ``special deal'' for some Colorado operators and urged OSM to reject it for several reasons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter stated that the Federal law and rules (30 CFR 817.102) require complete elimination of highwalls at operating mines and Colorado cannot adopt rules that are less strict than the Federal law and rules (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 30 CFR part 732). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director agrees that section 515(b)(3) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.102(a)(2) and 817.102(a)(2) require the elimination of all highwalls. However, section 516(b)(10) of SMCRA requires that the Secretary shall make such modifications in the requirements imposed by this subparagraph as are necessary to accommodate the distinct difference between surface and underground coal mining. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons stated in finding No. III.3. above, the Director exercised his authority as the Secretary's designee to consider these distinct differences between surface and underground mines and approved Colorado's proposed regulations that allow incomplete elimination of highwalls for underground mining operations where the highwall was created prior to August 3, 1977, but continued to be used thereafter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the rationale of the finding and the substantive similarity of Colorado's proposed regulations to regulations previously approved in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Utah, the Director does not agree with the commenter's assertion that Colorado's proposed rules allowing for incomplete elimination of highwalls are less strict than the Federal law and rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

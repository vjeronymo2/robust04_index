			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A SPECIAL PARK FOR SPECIAL KIDS;  </P> <P> HANDICAPPED: SANTA ANA OFFICIALS AND THE CITY'S KIWANIS CLUB PLAN TO BUILD A  PLAY AREA WHERE YOUNGSTERS IN WHEELCHAIRS AND THOSE WITH OTHER DISABILITIES CAN  HAVE FUN.  </P> <P> When handicapped children go to a park, they usually wait for a turn that never  comes. Because playground equipment is not designed for the handicapped, they  can't get on the swings, play basketball, or even take a ride on a  merry-go-round.  </P> <P> "Most of the time, I sit in the sandbox and watch everybody else play," said  Ketan Gandhi, 9, who is afflicted with osteogenesis imperfecta, a disease that  makes the bones brittle.  </P> <P> His mother knows that her son wants to join the other children.  </P> <P> "I see his eyes. They are hurt. But he knows he can get hurt if he plays,"  Mrudula Gandhi said.  </P> <P> Members of the Santa Ana Kiwanis Club and city park officials hope to help  children like Ketan by building the county's first playground for the  handicapped, where basketball courts will have adjustable hoops and swings can  accommodate wheelchairs.  </P> <P> On Monday, the Santa Ana City Council approved an agreement with the Kiwanis  Club to begin developing the 6 1/2-acre, "barrier-free" facility within  Thornton Park, located on Segerstrom Avenue. The approval also gives the club a  chance to solicit donations and apply for grant funds to buy playground  equipment.  </P> <P> The Kiwanis Club proposed the park idea 3 years ago after working with students  at Santa Ana's Carl Harvey School for physically handicapped children, said  Clint Hopson, a club member. One member visited a park in Omaha, where city  officials built a playground specially for the handicapped. He then persuaded  the club to try to do the same in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "We realized that many of the kids didn't have a place to play and didn't have  a place to be like any other child," Hopson said. "We made it one of our top  goals to help the handicapped children have a place they can call their own."  </P> <P> At first, city and club officials concentrated on expanding a therapeutics  program at Fisher Park on the northern tip of the city. But that park wasn't  large enough for the specially designed equipment and also did not have enough  parking spaces, said Ron Ono, a park landscape-design manager for the city.  </P> <P> City officials then settled on Thornton Park, which is the city's  least-developed recreational area. The "barrier-free" section is planned on a  grassy knoll in the 30-acre park's north section. The facility will include two  basketball courts with hoops that adjust, a playground, special trails to the  park's lake, and a camping area with handicapped-accessible bathrooms.  </P> <P> The Kiwanis Club is trying to raise money and get support from other  organizations to help build the park, club president Angel Rivas said. The  estimated cost is at least $300,000, a good portion of which will go into  buying playground equipment.  </P> <P> "There's no park like this in the county," Rivas said. "Once this is built,  handicapped kids from throughout the county can come here and play."  </P> <P> Such a park is a dream come true for Ketan, who wants to ride a see-saw and  play on a swing. For now, he makes do by "popping wheelies" on his wheelchair  and playing on the limited number of gym items at his school.  </P> <P> "I want to have fun just like everybody else," he said.  </P></p>

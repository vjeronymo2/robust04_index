			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Letter: Accountants' virtues finally recognised Sir, Chartered accountants owe Michael Dixon one (Jobs Column, February 12). At last someone has recognised their inestimable virtue. If I didn't have such a high regard for the ethics and integrity of journalists, I would send him a bottle of something fizzy: I am sure he would appreciate vintage Tizer. I found it striking to see the degree of overlap between the attributes which the researchers found in chartered accountants and those which, I hope, Royal Air Force recruiters are looking for. Calm, even-tempered, inclined to plan ahead, reliable, not impulsive. These are exactly the characteristics which I would pray for in someone flying fast jets in low-level training over my house. In the letters column of a less serious newspaper than yours, Michael Dixon's story could be the spark for a long series of accountant jokes. I am sure you won't allow that to happen. Just in case, we have all heard the one about the difference between accountants and actuaries, and the one about the accountant advising a man landing by balloon] Ian R McNeil, president, Institute of Chartered Accountants, Chartered Accountants' Hall, Moorgate Place, London EC2</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / VW blames loss on failings by management VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's biggest carmaker, plunged into a net loss of DM1.25bn (Pounds 515m) in the last three months. But the worst is past, and the company aims to break even by year's-end, according to its chairman. 'I hope we will have a small dividend, but I cannot guarantee it,' said Mr Ferdinand Piech, chief of the group comprising VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda. The 1992 payout has been cut from DM11 to DM2. Confronting the worst group crisis and the most difficult market conditions since the second world war, VW will this year axe almost 20,000 of the 36,000 jobs scheduled to go by the end of 1997. Groupwide short-term working, which helped cut production by 160,000 to 755,000 units in the first quarter, will continue at least until the end of June. The main plant at Wolfsburg, for example, which stopped production for 13 days in the first quarter, will close down for 17 days in the second. Mr Piech, who spoke of an 'emergency', blamed management and structural failings during the boom of the 1980s for most of the group's problems. 'We did not do our homework,' he said. Only a small part of VW's difficulties could be put down to the cyclical factors that had hit sales. 'Good competitors like our neighbours in France can reach break-even point with capacity utilisation of less than 70 per cent,' he said. At VW the comparable figure was down from an unattainable level of more than 100 per cent last year. The group, which last year saw net earnings plunge 87 per cent to DM147m, yesterday announced that pre-tax profits had fallen 66 per cent to DM602m. In the first quarter of this year turnover was down 10 per cent and deliveries to customers had dropped 11 per cent. Output had shrunk 18 per cent, according to Mr Werner Schmidt, finance director. After slumping into a DM563m loss during the last three months of 1992, the group was still plagued by 'unhappy' market developments. Outlining the reasoning behind his forecast of a return to break-even this year, Mr Piech said the result would be helped by a 50 per cent cut to DM6bn in planned investment. Some DM800m had already been set aside for job cuts. Bitter pill, Page 21</p>

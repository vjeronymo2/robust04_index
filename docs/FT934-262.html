			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Row over rule by decree in Romania Romania's opposition yesterday accused the government of violating the constitution by passing a law allowing it to rule by decree during next month's parliamentary winter recess, Reuter reports from Bucharest. Some observers said the move was an attempt to push through unpopular new taxes agreed as part of a loan deal with the International Monetary Fund. Earlier, the hung parliament voted 159-1 in favour of the minority left-wing government headed by Mr Nicoale Vacaroiu. Opposition deputies refused to vote.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The state commission of inquiry into the Hebron  massacre this afternoon heard testimonies from members of the  General Security Services. The session was held behind closed  doors.    This morning's session was canceled, when members of the  Islamic Trust, or Waqf, from Hebron failed to turn up. Waqf  representatives said they would only testify before the  Palestinian committees investigating the massacre or to an  international inquiry. Mark Weiss reports:    [Begin recording] [Weiss] Five officials from the Hebron  Islamic Trust, or Waqf, were summoned to appear before the  commission of inquiry this morning, including the local Waqf  head, Shaykh Salah al-Natshah, and the director of the Ibrahimi  Mosque, Shaykh 'Atif Hammuri. The five didn't turn up, and this  morning's session was canceled.    Hasan Tahbub, the head of the Islamic High Committee that  runs Islamic affairs in the West Bank, explains the boycott  decision.    [Tahbub] In spite of our full respect for the individuals  and the high-level personalities, we consider that it is not a  neutral commission. And, we are asking for an international  commission to inquire as a fact-finding commission.    [Weiss] A statement put out by the commission judges  expressed regret over the boycott, stressing that the commission  is trying to clarify the truth and wants to hear from anyone who  can help to achieve this end. A similar statement was issued by  the Justice Ministry, which stressed that it was a state inquiry  and not a government commission, as the Palestinians claim.    The commission has the right to summon the Waqf officials a  second time, although such a move is unlikely. A second  alternative is to use statements given by Waqf officials when  the commission visited Hebron last week. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a news release from the Lao-American  Joint Technical Team, the team opened offices in two northern  provinces of Houa Phan and Xieng Khouang to carry out joint  operations between 4 May and 1 June. They were implementing the  humanitarian plan and policy of the Government of the Lao  People's Democratic Republic toward families of American  personnel missing in action during the war in Laos and  responding to the U.S. side's request for cooperation in  conducting surveys and excavations and investigating and  searching for American MIA's.    During the period, technicians from both sides jointly  conducted excavations at two points in Houa Phan Province --  points 2935 and 1336. In addition, the Lao Government granted  permission for the American technicians to investigate and find  out about American MIA's at a former detention camp in Viangsai  District, Houa Phan Province. These are MIA's whom the U.S.  side believes to be still alive. Through the excavations at the  two points, the technicians of both sides satisfactorily found a  lot of evidence and information. Following the investigation,  the team discovered that there are no living American MIA's as  suspected by the U.S. side. The joint operation in Houa Phan  Province began on 4 May and ended on 19 May.    Later, the technicians of both sides continued their work in  Xieng Khouang Province according to plans. In Xieng Khouang  Province, they conducted excavations at four points -- points  1558, 1432, 1926, and 1786. The joint excavation in this  province began on 19 May and ended on 30 May. It brought about  satisfactory achievements to the U.S. side. The joint operation  in Xieng Khouang Province, however, has not been completed yet.  Three more points remain to be excavated. The excavations at  these three points will be conducted in accordance with the  1993-94 plan. In this plan, in addition to jointly conducting  excavations, the Lao side allowed the U.S. side to investigate  two cases in Xieng Khouang Province at point 0060 and point  0925. The results of the case investigations has been  considerably good.    The Lao-U.S. joint operation on this occasion was correctly  carried out in accordance with the plan and it proceeded in a  good atmosphere of mutual understanding. The U.S. side has  highly appraised the achievements and expressed profound thanks  to the Lao side for the good cooperation.</p>

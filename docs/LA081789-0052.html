			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> As part of their "Steel Wheels" tour, the Rolling Stones are opening up New  York's Shea Stadium to rock 'n' roll for the first time in six years. The  Stones will perform two shows at the home of the New York Mets on Oct. 26 and  Oct. 28, with a third show possible, according to New York City Parks  Commissioner Henry Stern. Stern said the Stones' visit would revive a Shea  tradition that started with the Beatles' historic performances there 25 years  ago. The stadium has been dark to rock since the Police played there in 1983. .  . . In other instances of Stones mania, fans swarmed ticket outlets throughout  Northern California on Wednesday as Nov. 4 and 5 concerts at the Oakland  Coliseum were announced. The concert dates had been announced in San Francisco  15 minutes before the tickets went on sale at 9 a.m. Long lines were reported  at most ticket locations and promoters expected the 50,000 tickets for each  reserved-seat concert would sell out by the end of the day. The Stones last  played the Bay Area eight years ago. Shauna Snow  </P></p>

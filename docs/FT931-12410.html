			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Tadpole/IBM shares deal TADPOLE Technology has applied to the Stock Exchange for the admission to the official list of 502,289 new ordinary shares. The shares are to be issued to International Business Machines for a total subscription price of Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 326,000) at 65p per share. In addition, Tadpole will issue to IBM warrants to subscribe for 2.22m new ordinary shares - equivalent to 10 per cent of Tadpole's fully-diluted share capital.

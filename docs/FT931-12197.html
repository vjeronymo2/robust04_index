			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Management: Who's got the right stuff? - IBM needs a new boss. Louise Kehoe asks the experts to speculate on John Akers' successor WANTED: Executive willing to take on the most challenging management job in the world. Must be a natural leader, able to make tough decisions, boost the morale of 300,000 employees and win the confidence of millions of shareholders and customers worldwide. Knowledge of 'computer-speak' helpful. Salary high and negotiable. Benefits include instant worldwide recognition. Wearers of white shirts need not apply. As if International Business Machines did not have enough problems, the beleaguered computer company is now searching for a new chief executive to fill the shoes of John Akers, its chairman, who earlier this week gave notice that he will resign his management role. The committee of non-executive IBM directors, chaired by former Johnson and Johnson chairman James Burke, may be aptly qualified to prescribe the tough medicine that IBM needs. But finding the right person to cure IBM's ills will not be easy. Burke, however, has thrown the field wide open by stating that candidates from outside IBM's own management ranks will be considered for the first time in the company's 79-year history. Only one person - Ross Perot, the erstwhile US presidential candidate - has so far publicly volunteered for the job but there is no shortage of ideas in the computer industry, on Wall Street, and inside management consultancies on what sort of individual is required. Virtually no one - not even America's latest female role model Hillary Clinton - is being excluded. Entering into the spirit of the search, the FT has asked a number of experts for their views, not all of which will necessarily be appreciated at Big Blue. Scott McNealy, the irreverent young chairman of Sun Microsystems, a Silicon Valley company that outsells IBM in the fast-growing market for computer workstations, for example, claims he knows how to solve IBM's problems, but is keeping his ideas to himself. 'This is capitalism,' he declares. 'It's either have lunch or be lunch.' Who should head IBM? he asks. 'Someone lousy.' Suggestions include the chief executive of a computer company currently in bankruptcy and another who lost his job after his company was acquired. Steve Balmer, executive vice president of Microsoft, IBM's nemesis in the personal computer market, is more generous. He pays tribute to Akers' capabilities but still believes replacing him is a wise decision. 'IBM's problems require what the management consultants call a 'set break', a fresh approach. It will require a new way of thinking.' While the assumption is growing that IBM will indeed select an Akers successor from outside the company, observers are split on whether the non-execs ought to go one step further and hire a non-industry specialist. Steve Jobs, 37-year-old co-founder of Apple Computer, says IBM's problem is that it views the computer market from a hardware perspective in an era when computer programs, or software, represent the differentiating factor among computer companies. IBM 'needs people who see the world through software glasses. There is no one in IBM's top management who really understands software,' adding that because of the rapid pace of change few people over 45 understand it. Balmer of Microsoft, a company with many young executives, does not see youth as a requirement for the job of IBM chief executive. 'Age is not a qualification, the issue is whether or not the individual is locked into a fixed way of thinking,' he says. He does, however, agree with Jobs's view that IBM needs a leader who is well-versed in technology. Without such an understanding it would be very difficult for the IBM chief executive to have the courage of his convictions when it comes to deciding which parts of the company should be consolidated or spun off, he suggests. According to Noel Tichy, professor of organisation at the University of Michigan, IBM needs 'a revolutionary with the head, heart and guts to change IBM, from the top down. He or she needs the capacity to crash through the incredible bureaucratic resistance that still exists there'. Without such resilience, the new chief executive could end up like Mikhail Gorbachev, with the KGB on his back, Tichy suggests. 'And he must have staying power. This is a 10-year job, not a one- or two-year stint. At General Electric Jack Welch is 11 years into the game and he is not finished.' There are very few people of the calibre required to run IBM, Tichy and others say. Welch himself, Larry Bossidy of Allied Signal, Michael Walsh of Tenneco or John Sculley at Apple Computer might fit the bill, but none of them is likely to make himself available to IBM. 'It is nave to think that a Jack Welch or a Larry Bossidy would leave his company to join IBM,' says Tichy. Andrew Grove, president of Intel, could do the job, says regis McKenna. a silicon valley industry consultant. 'He is good at dealing with complex issues and has a high degree of energy - that is important. He's a good task master and very good at recognising talent.' But Grove seems to be enjoying the challenge of leading the fastest-growing semiconductor company in the world. Robert Palmer, a former semiconductor industry executive who succeeded Ken Olsen last year as president and chief executive of Digital Equipment, the second largest US computer company after IBM, is already winning plaudits for improving Digital's performance. Bill Gates, the 37-year-old chairman and chief executive of Microsoft, who has made more money in the computer industry than anyone on earth, might seem an obvious choice to turn his talents to IBM's problems. But his stormy relationship with his big rival over the years would make him an unlikely choice. Paul Stern, who yesterday resigned from his post as chief executive of Northern Telecom, may well, however, be seen as a serious contender. Among non-industry candidates, General Dynamics' William Anders gets the vote of Robin Buchanan, Bain &amp; Company's managing partner. Buchanan says Anders, a former Nasa test pilot and Apollo Eight astronaut, has a rare breadth of experience and believes in going for smaller and better. George Cox, chairman of financial services and computer consultancy group P-E International, is also certain that IBM should pick a non-specialist. 'The problem is not so much seeing the direction. . . it's turning the wheel. Remember that Colin Marshall (of British Airways) used to run a car hire business.' Perot, meanwhile, who began his computer industry career at IBM, has said that he would be glad to do whatever he could for the company. But opinion is divided. Perot 'has a lot of the right instincts. Autocratic as he is, he would not be a bad choice,' says Tichy. Others, however, are not giving Perot their vote. 'He would alienate a lot of people,' says McKenna. IBM could look within its own ranks for a maverick insider, such as James Cannavino, senior vice president and manager of IBM's personal systems business. He is responsible for the company's growing workstation business. Some, however, think that the search for a genius who can fix IBM's problems overnight is bound to be fruitless. Instead, IBM should be looking for about 10 people to run its various business sectors, says Wilfred Corrigan, chairman of LSI Logic, a Silicon Valley semiconductor manufacturer. 'IBM should become a portfolio of companies run by an investment management group,' he says. 'It is clear that it cannot be run as a single business.' Within IBM there are several strong business units that could be spun off as independent companies, Corrigan says. Overseeing the transformation should be the job of an investment banker, he suggests, eliminating the role of chief executive of IBM.

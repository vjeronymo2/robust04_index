			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Traders count cost of Confederation Life With little other activity to distract them, those traders and investors who were at their desks yesterday were busy trying to analyse their position with regard to bonds issued by Confederation Life, the Canadian insurance company placed in the hands of government regulators last week. Market-makers are no longer making prices in bonds issued by Confederation Life and its subsidiaries, given the uncertainty surrounding their value. Bonds issued by other Canadian insurance companies have also been hit, with prices marked down by up to 4 points, although most traders were not bidding for paper. 'Confederation Life's fate has made people more nervous about the (Canadian insurance) sector generally, and investors have been looking for bids,' said one market-maker, adding that few bids have been forthcoming. He also said that his firm had received a number of enquiries from vulture funds, looking to see how cheaply they could pick up paper, but there had been little sign of any buying. According to dealers, the Confederation Life group has three deals outstanding in the sterling bond market: Confederation Treasury Services, guaranteed by Confederation Life, has a Pounds 100m issue of 9 1/2 per cent notes due 1997, arranged by SG Warburg, and Confederation Life has a Pounds 100m issue of subordinated bonds due 2003, arranged by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. In addition, Confederation UK Holdings has a Pounds 50m deal due 2004 arranged by SG Warburg. In the Canadian dollar sector, Confederation Treasury Series, guaranteed by Confederation Life, has a CDollars 100m issue due 1997. The subordinated bonds are the weakest credit, as they will rank below other types of debt when any pay-out is made. Until August 8, the senior bonds were rated A by Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency. They were then downgraded to BBB and on Friday dropped to D, which means interest payments are in default or jeopardised. Meanwhile, the primary eurobond market ground to a halt yesterday, with large parts of Europe closed for the Assumption Day holiday. Moreover, the few remaining market participants were lying low ahead of today's meeting of the US Federal Open Market Committee. 'Although the market has largely priced in a rate hike, no one wants to anything before the meeting,' said one syndicate manager. All this, and the general summer apathy, should keep the flow of new issues to a minimum, traders said, with only a handful of small deals expected in some sectors, such as Canadian dollars and Japanese yen.</p>

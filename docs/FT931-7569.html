			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Oil companies prepare for battle over energy levy US OIL companies have begun to challenge President Bill Clinton's proposal for a new tax levied on the energy content of fuels, but the administration is hitting back by dubbing its critics lobbyists for special interests. The American Petroleum Institute has questioned the administration's figures for the tax, claiming that it will cost the average family Dollars 475 a year - four times the Treasury's estimate of its impact - and claims it will cost 700,000 jobs. But Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, yesterday said the API's figures were 'just wrong', and other members of the administration weighed in against the oil industry assault. 'A plan that is bold like this is going to have a lot of special interest opposition across the board, and so you are seeing the beginnings of it,' Mr Leon Panetta, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said yesterday. However, some oil industry executives have backed the tax. Mr Lodwrick Cook, chairman of Arco, said that by spreading the cost throughout the economy, the proposed tax would not unfairly burden any single sector of the economy or region of the country. The new tax will be imposed at a rate of 25.7 cents per million British thermal units on coal, nuclear energy and gas, and at a much steeper rate of 59.9 cents per million BTUs on oil. Mr Clinton said yesterday he would soon propose easing bank regulations to try to alleviate the 'credit crunch' that many businesses feel has stopped them from getting loans. Meanwhile, Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told a congressional committee there was no question the credit crunch still existed, and said the Fed believed some banks had become too cautious about lending.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Salary review bodies could be overridden THE first signal emerged yesterday that the government is considering overriding the pay review bodies, which recommend pay rises for nearly a third of public sector workers. The Department of Health postponed a meeting at which Dr Brian Mawhinney, minister of state for health, was to present oral evidence to the pay review body covering about 600,000 nurses and midwives. The department said another meeting would be scheduled after the Autumn Statement on November 12. It said the ministers and officials would then be able to give their evidence in a 'full and up-to-date economic context'. The five pay review bodies are independent of government, but ministers are able to 'give direction' to the bodies over what government can afford. Government may also reject the findings of the bodies or, less dramatically, phase in their recommendations as they have done four times over the last nine years for nurses. Health union officials, however, speculated that the Autumn Statement might include some sort of 'pay norm', or a temporary suspension of the pay review bodies which cover nurses and allied professions, the armed forces, teachers, doctors and dentists and people on top salaries. The pay review bodies are currently taking evidence and would normally make recommendations to their respective secretaries of state and the prime minister in January. The bodies have traditionally recommended relatively high settlements and have contributed to the much faster increase in public-sector pay relative to that in the private sector over the past two years. The bodies would be an important target of the government in its move to restrain public-sector pay - it is widely assumed it would like to keep public-sector pay to about 2 per cent or freeze it altogether in 1993-94. Legally, the government could suspend all pay review bodies except the one governing teachers which has a statutory basis. The teachers' review body was set up under an act of parliament last year. Once the government has referred a review of pay to the body - as it did in July - it has to make a recommendation.</p>

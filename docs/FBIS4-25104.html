			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Vladimir Mikh and Lynn Chang] </F>   [Text] Moscow, June 4 (CNA) -- There is little chance that  Moscow will allow nuclear waste from Taiwan into Russia for  disposal and reprocessing, according to an official from the  Russian Atomic Energy Ministry.    [words indistinct] Kotlov, section chief in the ministry's  Information Department, said in an interview that legal  restrictions and the potential public outcry would prevent a  deal from being struck.    "Article 50 of the law on the protection of the environment  states that no nuclear waste can be brought into Russia from  abroad. Furthermore, President Yeltsin signed Special Decree  Number 452 in [date indistinct], which explicitly bans this kind  of toxic material from entering the country," Kotlov said.    Following his recent visit to Russia, Taiwan Power Co.  Chairman Cang Chung-chien announced in Taipei May 29 that Taiwan  might send both low and high-level nuclear waste to Russia in  the future. Chang specifically mentioned that Russia's Kurchatov  Institute can process low-level nuclear waste and spent fuel.    Russian ecologists were originally alerted to the proposed  deal through a report in the Moscow daily IZVESTIA, which said  Taiwan officials participating in a scientific conference on  nuclear technology in St. Petersburg held initial talks with the  representative of an unnamed research center that manages 10  nuclear waste dumping sites in Russia. Russian ecologists  claim Mainland China and Sweden both received similar offers to  process Taiwan nuclear waste, but said Beijing did not bother to  reply and Stockholm flatly refused.    Kotlov said that in theory, nuclear waste from atomic power  stations constructed overseas with Russian technology and  assistance could be brought back to Russia under certain  conditions. He [word indistinct], however, that the possibility  of revitalizing cash-strapped projects with funds from potential  Taiwan contractors might be considered, but only if "there were  an official request."    But he also explained that construction of facilities to  process nuclear waste stalled after [words indistinct] due to  lack of funds. He said that although funding for nuclear waste  storage and disposal projects would soon be re-examined in the  state Duma, "it is unlikely the work will resume in the next few  years" due to cuts in the [words indistinct] budget.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Mitterrand cagey on new left alliance PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand last night responded cautiously to the call by Mr Michel Rocard, former prime minister and potential presidential candidate, for a new centre-left alliance of Socialists, ecologists and Communists after next month's parliamentary elections. Mr Rocard, who had previously adopted a low profile in the electoral campaign, called this week for replacement of the Socialist party by 'an open, extrovert movement. . . gathering all those who share the values of solidarity and the goal of progress'. The president said on French television that 'anyone has the right to create a new coalition' but that the first priority should be to 'reunify and strength the existing party'. Other senior Socialists, now steeling themselves for a humiliating election defeat by the conservatives, welcomed Mr Rocard's initiative. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, said he agreed with him but suggested the momentum of the new movement should be used to help the left in the electoral campaign. Mr Brice Lalonde, former Socialist environment minister and now head of the Generation Ecologie movement that has eroded Socialist support, praised the speech as the precursor to forming a new democratic movement in France. Mr Bernard Kouchner, the popular but non-partisan health minister, said Mr Rocard's ideas were 'really exciting'. Liberation, the centre-left newspaper, applauded him for his 'calculated risk' and for recognising the changes in the French political landscape. The response of the traditional left was more muted. Mr Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the Socialist party, whose presidential prospects have been clouded by his involvement in the Aids-contaminated blood scandal, said the party's membership should decide the future of French socialism. Mr Antoine Waechter, head of the Greens, the old-style ecologists, said his party had 'no intention of participating in the renewal of the Socialist party or of the left.' The French Socialists, flagging in the opinion polls and battered by scandals, have fallen prey to the same sort of identity crisis that beset the Britain's Labour party in the 1980s and is now preying upon the Italian left. Mr Rocard's call follows months of internal debate about the French left's prospects after the elections, with prominent figures, notably Mr Kouchner, having already alluded to the possibility of an alliance with the ecologists. President Mitterrand yesterday accused Britain of disloyalty for failing to accept the European Community's social charter, saying this was leading to cynical exploitation of workers in member states. Citing the case of Hoover, which is sacking 600 French workers and moving production to Scotland where labour is cheaper, he said Britain was encouraging a kind of competition that went against the spirit of the EC.</p>

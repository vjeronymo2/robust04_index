			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Anatoliy Kobelnyuk report from Luhansk Oblast and interview </F> with Anatoliy Savchenko, chief of the water resources department  at the oblast state administration office for environmental  protection, and with Lyudmyla Senchynok, associate at the  ``Luhanskheolohiya'' Geological Enterprise department for  accounting and utilizing subsurface water reserves and studying  their state: ``A Place in a Barrel With Brine'' -- first  paragraph published in boldface]    [Text] An ecological hangover -- this is a relatively  recent notion. Lysychansk, Siverskodonetsk, and Rubizhne, which  constitute the notorious chemical ``Bermuda Triangle,'' also  suffer the ``morning after the night before'' syndrome.  However, it is precisely here that there is particularly large  amount of brine [culinary brine is believed to bring relief  after heavy drinking]. But this brine is also a consequence of  the same ecological disaster.    Possibly everyone in Ukraine has heard about Lysychansk,  Siverskodonetsk, or Rubizhne. No wonder, because these are  towns of great chemistry. What harm has that chemistry done  there? It turns out that not only has it poisoned the air,  rivers, and soil, but even permeated the ground down to hundreds  of meters or even kilometers! The consequences may be extremely  serious, to the extent that these places may become totally  deserted. The triangle expands not only horizontally, but  vertically downward -- this is its horrifying characteristic.    During the times of Brezhnev, various commissions came to  Lysychansk, among them a USSR governmental commission headed by  [prime minister] A. Kosygin's deputy. Especially to find out  about the specific qualities of the brine produced in large  quantities by the local soda plant. Of course, the commissions  did not do anything specific, but they came. Now they have  stopped coming. Maybe they know there is not enough money to  implement potential projects?    Thus, since prerevolutionary times, production waste --  calcium chloride solutions -- has been discharged by the  Lysychansk Soda Plant.    Savchenko: These solutions don't appear to be so  terrible. In their composition, they resemble seawater.  However, there are huge amounts of them. They are stored in  pits, the walls of which are not impermeable. They percolate  into the soil and spread through aquifers. Besides that,  overfilled reservoirs may break unreliable dams and there could  be a catastrophe.    Kobelnyuk: Is it possible to neutralize such  production waste?    Savchenko: Nobody in Europe knows how to do this.  Such enterprises are located in coastal areas. The waste, as  it is, is discharged into the water.    Kobelnyuk: Is it at least possible to somehow use  the chlorides?    Savchenko: Prior to the disintegration of the  USSR, the soda producers received some assistance from the  Northern Fleet. The chlorides were used to prevent the icing  over of ships. As a result, reservoirs were gradually emptied.  Today, Russians in the north can do without Lysychansk.    Kobelnyuk: What is being done now?    Savchenko: Research work is under way. There are  specific proposals, in particular from the Kharkiv Scientific  Research Institute ``Karbonat.'' However, in addition to good  ideas, there must also be good money.    Lyudmyla Senchynok, associate at the state geological  enterprise ``Luhanskheolohiya'' department in charge of  accounting and utilizing subsurface water reserves and of  studying their status, does not see any reassuring prospects  either.    Senchynok: The reservoirs are overfilled, that is  why the plant's operations are on the verge of being halted.  Besides, the first reservoir was built back in 1898. The plant  owner poured the brine into what was then a huge pit. The  second storage pit was dug during the first five-year plan  period. The two have already been buried under soil.  Currently, there are dachas there. The third storage pit was  built in 1969. Although it is better than its predecessors, it  is far from being brine-proof. When, in 1976, the fourth  storage pit was built, our requirements for adhering to norms  were taken into account, but.... The dams of the existing  storage pits could collapse any minute, because they were built  with God knows what. Besides, karst structures have been  revealed in those places. The solution reaches marl soils, a  reaction takes place, and carbon dioxide forms as a result.  This creates an additional hazard.    The storage pits are overfilled, there are no new ones, and  new construction areas are not being prepared.    Kobelnyuk: Besides, there is a time bomb beneath  those dachas?    Senchynok: Yes, even though there have been no  explosions yet. Subsurface waters constantly wash sites of  waste accumulation. We suggested that the waste be processed  and dumped on the right bank of the Siverskyy Donets River,  where aquifers are weak. However, even in the past there was no  money for this, not to mention the situation now.    Kobelnyuk: What can be done with the brine?    Senchynok: The solid substance within its  composition could be used for manufacturing medicines. There  are some not very pleasant tasting calcium chloride tablets.  This substance could also be used as a filler in the production  of cement. However, it must be solid. It is too expensive to  form briquets and that is not acceptable anyway. There was also  a plan to carry the brine to Sivash Lake. However, it was  realized that the pipes would soon turn into salt planks.    Kobelnyuk: Therefore, we can only wait and see  what happens?    Senchynok: As a matter of fact, yes. The brine  spill around the storage pits of the plant has spread to 30  square meters over the drinking water horizon. We monitor the  water composition with the help of boreholes. There were times  when the spill grew very quickly, but now the situation is  changing gradually....    People within the ``triangle'' are already used to the  ``reactive'' -- saturated with various reagents -- air and look  almost without care at the small clouds that are all the colors  of the rainbow. People get used to anything. When the brine  gets out of control, drinking water will disappear over scores  of square kilometers. It will be impossible to get used to  that: People will either have to turn into fish or pack their  belongings.</p>

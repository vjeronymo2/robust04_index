			<p>BFN     [Text] Labor Minister 'Abdallah al-Amin and Deputy Dr.  Ayyub Humayyid were invited by the Social and Cultural Club in  al-Qusaybah yesterday evening to attend a seminar called  "Lebanon Between Plan and Reaction." It was held at the  al-Husayni Club in the town of al-Qusaybah in al-Nabatiyah. The  seminar was attended by a member of the Arab Socialist Ba'th  Party's regional command, 'Ali Zayn Ghandur, who headed a  delegation of the party's command in the south. The central  labor representative of the Amal movement, Bassam Tulays, also  attended, as did the members of Amal's command in the south; a  delegation from the Syrian Social Nationalist Party; a number of  officials; representatives from clubs and societies in the  region; and the residents of the township.    Minister al-Amin delivered a lecture in which he discussed  the Arab-Israeli negotiations that started with the Madrid  conference. He explained the various stages of these  negotiations. Minister al-Amin then discussed the U. S.  position, which promised to play the role of (?honest) broker in  the talks. But the Israeli stand insisted that there cannot be  negotiations with all the Arabs, but rather with every Arab  country separately.    Minister al-Amin added that President Hafiz al-Asad tried to  rectify the situation by balancing out the negotiations after  Yasir 'Arafat stepped out of the peace equation, took sides with  Israel, and dealt Arab solidarity a blow in one of its most  sensitive areas. The fact that 'Arafat stepped out of the peace  process clearly weakened all the peace courses at every stage.  In a public Israeli attempt to absorb the results of the Geneva  summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton, Israel  started trying to abort the results of this summit. The summit  had concluded with one very clear fact: that the solution needs  to be comprehensive and include all the occupied Arab  territories. In other words, Israel must withdraw from all the  occupied territories so that we can progress one step forward  toward peace and eventually toward comprehensive peace.    Yasir 'Arafat signed the agreement in Washington and does  not  have any idea what is awaiting the Palestinian people, added  al-Amin. All that Yasir 'Arafat has gained is that Rabin, after  a public appearance on TV, agreed to shake Yasir 'Arafat's hand  after Clinton put pressure on him. During the second signing  ceremony, the various stages of which we saw in the auditorium  of the Conference Center in Cairo, a real theater piece was  being acted out in front of us. This play has greatly harmed  Palestinian and Arab dignity. Yasir 'Arafat, this great leader  who compared himself to Mandela--the leader who has defeated the  British Empire and realized independence for South Africa, all  the rights for his people, and the world's recognition, as  opposed to a dwarf called 'Arafat--has succeeded in acquiring an  area of six square kms for the self-rule authority. This is the  person who did not work in the interest of his own people who  died in Lebanon.    Minister al-Amin added that Gaza and Jericho will not be  able  to absorb the mortal remains of the Palestinians. The Israelis  have given 'Arafat cemeteries, not dignity or a state. This is  one aspect of the negotiations. The other aspect which pertains  to you in the south since you are suffering daily from the  destruction and effects of the aggression, the Lebanese  Government--that is the cabinet and the Chamber of  Deputies--still clings to its previous stand which says that  Resolution 425 is the basis for every solution. As regards the  part on Lebanon which is outside the framework of Resolution  425, no one can accept just any solution. If we find a solution  that guarantees the dignity, security, freedom, sovereignty, and  independence of our country other than Resolution 425, then we  will abandon Resolution 425 and adopt this new resolution. But  so far, we have not found anything that can guarantee the  dignity, security, freedom, sovereignty, and independence of  Lebanon other than Resolution 425. This is why we adhere to it.  It is a clear text and has very clear articles and paragraphs.  It is a text that stipulates the full, comprehensive, and  unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Lebanese  territories to the internationally acknowledged borders of 1949.  Resolution 425 sets a mechanism for implementing this solution  by sending the UN Interim Force in Lebanon to supervise the  Israeli withdrawal and the deployment of the Lebanese Army in  place of the withdrawing Israeli army. In the past, the  Israelis along with the West in general and the Americans in  particular have found the excuse that Lebanon, as a result of  the civil war, lost its state, authority, and the Army and is  not capable of implementing Resolution 425. In other words,  there is yet no Army in Lebanon capable of implementing  Resolution 425.    Minister al-Amin continues: Now the war has ended and there  are no militias at all. If by militias they mean the  Resistance, then we answer that the Resistance is not militias.  It is Lebanon's peace-keeping force. It is the real peace  force. The victory of the Resistance will undoubtedly be a  victory for peace. The Resistance is not a militia nor does it  have anything to do with militias.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Radka Nenova] </F>   [Text] Budapest, January 28 (BTA) -- The signing of a brief  memorandum on the transshipment of goods across Serbia brought  to a close the talks between a Bulgarian and a Hungarian  delegation here last night. The document proceeds from the  procedure announced by the Brussels-based UN Sanctions  Committee. In compliance with this procedure, the sides had to  sort out some technicalities concerning Hungarian rules and  legislation.    "The Hungarians were understanding of all matters we  raised,"  Bulgarian Deputy Transport Minister Kharalan Kharalanov told  BTA. "There are some problems which our Hungarian partners were  unable to solve right now, but they promised to sort them out  and let us know soon. For instance, there was the problem on  how truck convoys for the journey back from Hungary to Bulgaria  will be formed."    On the initiative of the UN Sanctions Committee, the  Bulgarian and Hungarian delegations will confer in Budapest on  February 3 and 4. Quite a few problems will be specified at  that meeting. "At the meeting we will brief the committee on  these technicalities which we have coordinated with our  Hungarian colleagues, as well as on our arrangements with the  Bulgarian border control authorities and possibly with the  Serbian partners concerning the transshipment of goods via  Serbia. Evidently, the convoys will not start overnight. We  will also wait for the meeting in Budapest, to which we have yet  to receive an invitation from Brussels, and we will then send  the first applications for permits. Only after obtaining such  permits, complying with all technical conditions, we can  actually start transiting goods across Serbia," the Bulgarian  deputy transport minister said.    Each type and quantity of goods intended for transshipment  across Serbia have to be cleared with the UN Sanctions  Committee. These permits will be valid for three months, or the  procedure will be the same as the one followed in permitting  shipment of humanitarian assistance to Yugoslavia. In this  case, however, the committee will deal with transshipment of  goods to Western Europe and from Western Europe across Serbia to  Bulgaria and, possibly, on to the Middle East.</p>

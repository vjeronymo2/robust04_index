			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Aponte; quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, 17 Mar -- The  delegates of the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee  (CCRI)- General Command of the Zapatist National Liberation Army  (EZLN) have concluded the first phase of analyzing the  commitments for an honorable peace in Chiapas. The delegates  returned to their communities to explain the contents of the  document.    According to reports obtained here, the analysis process in  the Zapatist communities will begin during the weekend.    EZLN delegates have told this newspaper the discussion in  the  communities will take some time, because the wording of the  commitments is "complicated," and the communities are very  distant.    At the end of the first phase of the internal consultation,  they reiterated their concern over the "continuity" of the  commitments for an honorable peace in Chiapas, in light of the  upcoming change of the federal executive.    "We do not know if the proposals will be complied with by  Salinas' successor," the delegates have argued.    CCRI representatives have considered the federal  government's  compliance will be a fundamental "condition" for true peace in  Chiapas.    Committee delegates Pedro, Romeo, Carlos, and Emanuel have  said the consultation in the communities will take some time,  because the wording of the government commitments is  "complicated," and the Zapatist communities are very distant.    About 300 CCRI representatives who participated in the first  phase of the study began returning gradually to their hometowns  on 16 March.    Meanwhile, the delegates have said the EZLN has not yet  decided whether there will be a second phase of dialogue with  Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis or the manner in which  the contents of the 32 peace commitments will be approved.    During a short conversation in a CCRI-controlled area, the  representatives have said the advancements of the consultation  in its initial stage are minimum. The delegates have analyzed  point by point the commitments for an honorable peace in  Chiapas. "We are not in a hurry," and the most important thing  is to understand the contents of the texts, they have said.    Emanuel has remarked the Clandestine Committee has analyzed  carefully the government commitments, "and if they are not  fulfilled, we will continue the war. We are very tired."    The Zapatist representatives have returned to their  communities with the texts translated into Tzotzil, Tzeltal,  Chol, and Tojolabal, so as to explain to children, youths, and  elderly people the scope of the proposals. "They will say what  they think, but we do not think the government will comply," he  has said.    It is necessary for all members of the communities to  understand "there is nothing yet" from the dialogue in San  Cristobal de las Casas; there is no agreement, he added.    CCRI delegates have said, however, the EZLN is interested in  the follow-up of the government commitments, given the change of  president. "Salinas' departure is nearing, and we do not know  if his successor will maintain his policies," Emanuel has said.    Romeo has warned the federal government's compliance with  the  political and social requests is a fundamental "condition" for  true peace in Chiapas.    [LA JORNADA] What is going to happen with the weapons?    [Romeo] The weapons. One can never surrender the weapons,  but the government must meet the people's needs. This is the  only thing for what we are asking; we are asking for at least  for democracy. We want our rights to be considered. All our  comrades, men, women, children, and elderly people are  practically abandoned.    "You are realizing how the regions and towns are; they are  very screwed up. Just look at the roads, the pasture grounds,  how pasture grounds grow on stony grounds. We want the  government to hurry up. We can give the government a short term  for meeting our needs. We want the government to supply for  what we are asking, because we are dying.    "Years and years of death. So far it would be better to die  while fighting, but if the government meets its word, we would  be glad. We want a real and lasting peace, not just words: We  want deeds," Romeo has added.    The delegates have returned to their communities, many of  which are located four or five days away by foot. The initial  stage in the communities will begin during the weekend,  according to the CCRI.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Wanted, a more gentlemanly style - Engineering 'subbies' still have an uneasy relationship with their larger customers They want better standards and improved quality, which we deliver, but then won't pay higher prices to meet the extra costs. So we lose out.' The complaint comes from one of 50 small engineering companies, mostly subcontractors, surveyed recently for the 600 Group, the UK machine tool producer. It shows that, in a world of partnerships, preferred suppliers, long-term deals and single sourcing, the relationship between the humble 'subbies' and their larger customers can still be an edgy one. There are thousands of subcontractors in the UK and they tend to keep a low profile. The changing nature of their role, however, has increased their importance, and made it all the more crucial that they can work effectively with their customers without feeling they are being put upon. The traditional role of subcontractors, to provide extra capacity for manufacturers at peak demand, has virtually gone; instead, they have become a vital part of industry's manufacturing strategy as customers prefer to concentrate their own efforts on activities where they can add value and outsource as much as possible of everything else. This makes a great deal of sense, says Andy Sandford, editor of Subcon magazine. The customer gets a predictable supply and total flexibility, and does not have to invest in new machinery which may be under-utilised. The subcontractor, meanwhile, becomes a manufacturing specialist, spreading the cost of expensive but efficient manufacture over a number of contracts. The new approach is already quite sophisticated, and subcontractors have responded well to the challenge of, for example, supplying an automotive sub-assembly rather than a simple part, or adding more value to a component. That could involve, for example, sending out a machined part to be electroplated before delivering it to a customer. As its role develops, the engineering subcontracting industry is also becoming better at getting its message across to potential customers. More than 500 'subbies' will be showing what they can offer at the Subcon'94 exhibition at Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre from April 11-15. But many believe that, behind the rhetoric of supplier development programmes and long-term partnerships, there is still some way to go before an ideal level of trust between both sides of the industry is achieved. 'Things are moving in the right direction,' says Bob Knox, managing director of Luton-based Stanbridge Precision Turned Parts, 'but one is always a little bit worried about a long-term partnership. What happens if someone comes along and offers to cut the price for the customer by 1/2 p on each part?' The problem of lack of trust was highlighted last month in a report by Professor Richard Lamming of Bath University School of Management for the Department of Trade and Industry and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The necessary levels of trust are not present in the motor industry for 'lean supply' and consequently comprehensive lean production - to become a reality, he says. Sandford agrees that the automotive industry has had a reputation for being ruthless with its suppliers, whereas partnerships in the aerospace industry are more established. Overall, he says, when there is trust in a partnership it works well, but when the relationship is poor it can be unfair on the supplier. 'The supplier must be able to invest and make a reasonable profit, otherwise when the next contract comes up it will lose out on cost,' he says. One potential problem area is abuse of the open-book costing system, where subcontractors - but not, usually, their customers - reveal all their costings and profit margins. 'If the books show the subcontractor is making a 5-6 per cent profit margin and the customer says, 'We think you should only be making 2 per cent and investing in new equipment,' that's when the problems start,' says Sandford. Fortunately for the subcontractors, many customers realise they would be harming themselves by ending a long-term relationship simply because a rival supplier offered a slightly better deal, as the relationships are becoming deeper and thus less easy to end. Companies such as Stanbridge, meanwhile, are developing their own expertise to ensure that they can retain their long-term customers and win new ones. The survey for the 600 Group pointed to the need for 'subbies' to invest in high-quality equipment. 'A state-of-the art facility pulls a lot of weight. Customers like to see progress being made improving efficiency,' says Edward Kydd, managing director of Gatehouse Industrial Services, based in Mildenhall, Suffolk. Gatehouse, which makes sheet metal parts for the electronics, furniture and office equipment industries, has just spent about Pounds 250,000 on new equipment, which has led efficiency to rocket, says Kydd. Then there is the need for proof of quality manufacturing. Kydd is awaiting accreditation under British Standard 5750, and says that with 75 per cent of his customers having achieved the quality assurance standard already, Gatehouse needs it to maintain its position. At Stanbridge, Knox says the company's commitment to quality over the past five years, symbolised by its achievement in 1991 of Ford's highly demanding Q1 assessment, has helped it win extra business. Sometimes, the commitment to quality leads to increased costs that cannot be passed on to the customer. But the 'subbies' are also forming their own long-term relationships with their suppliers, for example of raw materials, so that costs and benefits can be balanced. Kydd sees this as a return to a 'more gentlemanly' way of doing things, echoing a call from one of the companies quoted in the report for the 600 Group: 'We're all in this together and should work together more to weather the storm.'</p>

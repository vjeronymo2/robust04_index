			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Alpha Oumar Konare this morning received  French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin, who had already held  a working session with Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and  Finance Minister Soumaila Cisse. Discussions centered on  France's cooperation to support the Malian Government's and  people's efforts following the devaluation of the CFA franc.  Here is Michel Roussin speaking to Mahamadou Kone.    [Begin Roussin recording] During this working session, we  discussed how to organize our cooperation at this difficult time  for us all -- for Malians and their brothers in other franc zone  countries and also for us, the French. A number of pledges have  been made and as Prime Minister Edouard Balladur stated and  President Mitterrand reiterated in Yamoussoukro, France honors  its commitments and France is here to support the substantial  efforts made by the government and especially by the people, who  understand that once this difficult period is over, it will be  followed by economic growth and development will become a  reality. For this reason, we must remain by the side of our  African partners and this is what I have come to discuss in  concrete terms with the prime minister and the finance minister.    My talks were less technical with the president than they  were with the prime minister and the finance minister. The  president gave a broad overview of the prevailing situation in  the subregion. Of course, we also discussed how to manage the  effects of the devaluation. I confirmed to the president  France's friendly support for Mali during this delicate period,  as my presence here today in Bamako with a large delegation  attests. We also discussed the upcoming summit in Ouagadougou,  where leaders of the members of the West African Economic and  Monetary Union are scheduled to meet and together draw the first  conclusions from the effects of the devaluation and get  organized for the next phase of this courageous exercise which  -- I am optimistic -- can enable everyone to experience an  economic rebirth. [end recording]    Mahamadou Kone also informs us that the French cooperation  minister will leave Bamako for Paris this afternoon.</p>

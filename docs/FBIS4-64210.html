			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Ministry of Defense: </F> "Defence Agreement With Romania"]    [Text] Malcolm Rifkind, The Secretary of State for Defence  today met Mr. Gheorghe Tinca, the Romanian Defence Minister and  signed a Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] covering a programme  of defence contracts between the United Kingdom and Romania for  1994 and 1995.    The MOU provides for a number of military contacts and  exchanges with the aim of developing jointly areas of practical  co-operation on a wide range of defence-related matters.    This is the first time a Romanian Defence Minister has  visited the United Kingdom since the break-up of the Warsaw Pact.    Mr. Tinca's visit, and the signing of the MOU, is seen as a  part of the ongoing process of strengthening security and  stability in Europe, and is entirely in line with the ethos of  the recently unveiled Partnership for Peace initiative. Both  nations welcome Partnership for Peace as a useful means of  building a closer relationship between NATO and countries of  Central and Eastern Europe.    Whilst in London Mr. Tinca will have discussions with,  amongst others, Admiral Sir Jock Slater, Vice Chief of the  Defence Staff and Mr. Moray Stewart, Second Permanent Under  Secretary. He will also visit Royal United Services Institute  and have talks with representatives of the UK Defence Industry.    Mr Rifkind said: "I am very pleased that a MOU covering  bilateral defence contacts has been agreed. Its signature  should herald a new phase of more structured and substantial  co-operation between us."</p>

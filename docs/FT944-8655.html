			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: RTZ, Kinross terminate talks on gold mine sale RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining group, and Kinross Gold, a junior Canadian company, have terminated negotiations on the sale to Kinross of the Ridgeway gold mine in South Carolina for USDollars 47m, writes Kenneth Gooding in London. No reasons have been given for the break-down in talks, but Mr Bob Adams, RTZ director of planning and development, said yesterday: 'We will lose no sleep over this.' Mr Bob Wilson, RTZ chief executive, said Kinross had made the first approach about the proposed deal and had offered a good price for what was RTZ's highest-cost gold producer. Ridgeway, which is expected to produce about 125,000 troy ounces of gold this year, also had limited reserves - about 10 years - and exploration potential. He said that, contrary to market rumours, RTZ had not put a 'for sale' sign on its US gold mines - which also include Barney's Canyon in Utah and Rawhide (51 per cent-controlled) in Nevada - but if the right offer came along it would be considered as these assets were not strategically important to the group.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Delta presses US for rules on negotiations Delta Air Lines, the third largest US carrier, yesterday called on the US government to define a standard framework for negotiating bilateral aviation agreements. Mr Ron Allen, Delta's chairman, also said he was increasingly frustrated at the failure of the US government to approve a partnership with Virgin Atlantic Airways to give Delta access to London's Heathrow airport. Delta and Virgin have been forced to postpone the introduction next month of their commercial partnership because of the US government's delay in approving the deal. Mr Allen said he would be 'shocked' if his government ultimately blocked the deal announced earlier this year with the smaller UK carrier. The partnership has been given the go ahead by the UK authorities. Under present regulations, only two US carriers - American and United - can serve Heathrow. Delta argues its partnership with Virgin would increase competition on transatlantic routes. Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman, has recently been urging the UK government to step up pressure on the US to restart negotiations on liberalising air services between the two countries. The US walked away from negotiations with the UK on liberalising air services between the two countries last December and has since refused to reopen talks. In the absence of a clearly defined international aviation policy, the US government has been forced to react to each different bilateral negotiation without any standard framework, Mr Allen said. This led to considerable pressure on the US administration from the conflicting interests of US carriers. American Airlines, the second largest US carrier which already flies into Heathrow, has led the campaign against the Delta-Virgin partnership. The UK is now expected to propose a new round of negotiations and offer initially greater access for US carriers to regional UK airports in exchange for US approval of the Delta-Virgin deal as well as other concessions for UK carriers in the US market. However, Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of British Airways, yesterday said he did not expect the talks to start before the end of next month. He said it was 'ridiculous' that the US government had not approved the Virgin-Delta deal. The two governments needed to acknowledge publically that their ultimate aim was total deregulation of airline services between the two countries. Although this was likely to take a long time to achieve, Sir Colin said it was important to establish clear milestones, with both sides making concessions to achieve the ultimate goal of 'open skies'.</p>

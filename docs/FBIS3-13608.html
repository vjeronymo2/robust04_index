			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 16 Mar (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  said that the Egyptian role in the Middle East peace process is  inspired by a strategic outlook where the Palestinian problem,  which has lasted for too long, should be resolved so that the  Middle East may enter a new phase. Musa added that a just peace  should involve Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab  territories and the recognition of the Palestinians' right to  self-determination.    Speaking at a seminar on the "Future of Peace in the Middle  East," which was held at Cairo University tonight, Musa said  that the Middle East does not live in isolation from  fast-breaking developments that have altered the postwar world.  A new world order is coming into being, although its features  may remain unclear because it is still in a transitional stage.  Egyptian diplomacy takes note of these developments, Musa said.  He added that those who remain isolated will fall behind.    The foreign minister mentioned that following the Cold War,  regional conflicts in Asia, Africa, and Latin America found  their way to the negotiating table. It was natural that the  Palestinian issue would move toward a solution with the new  changes in today's world.    Musa declared that Egypt does not impose its views on the  Palestinians or any other Arab party, but simply offers  assistance when requested to do so and when it deems that its  assistance is needed.    The foreign minister reiterated Egypt's position on  Jerusalem; namely, that Jerusalem is part of the occupied Arab  territories. Egypt, he said, rejects all Israeli measures that  were implemented with a view to Judaizing Jerusalem or declaring  it Israel's eternal capital.    Musa responded to a recent statement by U.S. President Bill  Clinton that Washington sees Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The  foreign minister described this statement as political and  tactical [siyasi wa taktiki]. If this statement signals a new  U.S. policy toward Jerusalem, Musa said, then Egypt completely  differs with Washington about this policy. The foreign minister  pointed out that the U.S. Embassy in Israel is still in Tel Aviv.    Minister Musa said that the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration  of Principles signed on 13 September 1993, stipulates that the  issue of Jerusalem is a topic open to negotiations. Jerusalem  is an open issue and Israel's measures there are invalid and  illegitimate, Musa declared.    The foreign minister voiced dismay over the UN Security  Council's delay in denouncing the massacre at al-Ibrahimi  Mosque. Describing the position of the UN Security Council as  most regrettable, Musa said that a resolution passed more than  two weeks after the massacre does not have the same force and  effect of one issued immediately. The role of the Security  Council is getting shakier by the day. The Security Council is  losing its effect on and importance for world public opinion and  is beginning to fall into the trap of double standards, a matter  which will lead to the erosion of UN credibility, Musa stated.    Minister Musa denounced the Israeli settlements in the  occupied territories as being invalid and illegitimate. The  Egyptian position following the massacre was not only one of  condemnation but also of calling for measures to guarantee the  safety of the Palestinians living in the occupied territories.  Security is a two-way street and the Israelis should have no  monopoly on it, Musa stated.    The foreign minister said that Egypt is calling for the  removal of some settlements, the disarmament of settlers, and  the outlawing of Israeli terrorist organizations. He pointed  out that Israel already outlawed two of these organizations:  Kahkh and Kahana Hay.    Minister Musa said that such demands will be presented at  the  negotiating table once the peace talks are resumed. This  underlines the need to resume these talks, he stated. Musa said  that there are only two methods to restore one's rights: either  war or negotiations. Shouting and calling for the  discontinuation of negotiations do not produce results, he  remarked.    Concerning the Middle East market, Musa said that this is an  idea that has only been expressed, not yet implemented. There  should be no fear of Israel because it is not a major country  [laysat dawla kubra] in the region, he said. The foreign  minister said that, regardless of what we may feel about it,  economic cooperation in the Middle East will be a normal matter  once a just peace has been achieved.    Musa said that Egypt will definitely not provide Israel with  water from the Nile. Egypt will not sign the treaty on  nonproliferation of nuclear weapons unless Israel signs it, he  added.</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Letter: Health and safety burden beyond EC directives Sir, You report that 'more than half UK companies are not complying with six health and safety laws which came into force on January 1' ('Companies 'fail to meet' EC health laws', March 23). It is hardly surprising. The Health and Safety Commission failed to publish the texts of some of the new UK regulations until December 1992 - eg, Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992, Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992, Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1992. Another reason for their failure to comply is that many will have realised that the UK regulations impose burdens on UK companies that go much further than the requirements of the EC directives. Bryan Cassidy, European Parliament, 97-113 Rue Belliard, 1040 Brussels</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT MAKES PASSOVER MATZO SO DIFFERENT  </P> <P> Maria L. La Ganga made an error in her explanation of why the Passover matzo is  different than matzo used on all other nights of the year ("Price of Matzo  Fixed, N.J. Indictment Claims," March 21).  </P> <P> The removal of a small piece of dough is not unique to Passover or to matzo, as  a matter of fact.  </P> <P> Rather, it is symbolic of the portion that was removed from all dough, whether  bread or matzo, and given to the priests that served in the Holy Temple as one  of the forms of community support.  </P> <P> For matzo to be acceptable for Passover use, stringent measures are taken to  guarantee that no leavening of the dough takes place. The entire process --  beginning with the mixing of the water and flour until the matzos are removed  from the oven -- may take no more than 18 minutes. Furthermore, the machines  are monitored to be free of any dough particles from one baking to another so  that the matzo be absolutely free of leavening.  </P> <P> For that reason, Kosher for Passover matzo contains no ingredients other than  simple flour and water. None of the above holds true for "year-round matzo."  The additional care and labor required results in greater expense which is  then, as usual, passed on to the customer.  </P> <P> RABBI ASHER Z.

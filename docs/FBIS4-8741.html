			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Cajnice, April 16 (TANJUG) -- NATO planes did not  bomb Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde on Saturday and the  Serbs did not down the NATO British plane which was shot out of  the sky over Gorazde earlier in the day because there was no  need for the Serbs to activate their anti-aircraft defence, the  command of the Bosnian Serb Army Herzegovina Corps said in a  statement.    The plane burst into flames and fell between Mt. Grebac and  the village of Ilovaca, some 15 kilometres west of Gorazde. The  pilot bailed out and fell at the Baba hill near Vitkovici on the  left bank of the Drina River, in Moslem-held territory, the  statement added.    The Bosnian Serb command also denied reports that NATO  planes  on Saturday destroyed a Serb tank which had allegedly been  shelling Gorazde.    The same source said Bosnian Serb forces were not attacking  the town and that Moslems in Gorazde were activating explosive  devices to create the impression with the U.N. troops that the  town was being shelled by the Serb artillery.    The Bosnian Serb command said it had obtained information  that Moslems in Gorazde were planning an operation which would  cause massive civilian casualties, similar to the one carried  out at a Sarajevo downtown market on February 5, and then blame  it on the Serbs.</p>

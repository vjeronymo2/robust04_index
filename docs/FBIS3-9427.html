			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Milan Cetnik: "Bjegovic's Maneuver"] </F>   [Text] Knin, 22 Mar -- A few days ago, during the  parliament session, the Krajina Government resigned. What the  average television viewer in Knin and Belgrade was able to learn  on the basis of news reports is that the assembly "does not  like" its government and that Bjegovic's cabinet, insulted and  "humiliated," "no longer wants to play the game." However, the  fact is that by resigning, Djordje Bjegovic has actually  strengthened the position of his government and cabinet, so that  at the moment he is virtually irreplaceable.    First, according to the Constitution, once a new parliament  is elected, the existing government automatically becomes the  caretaker government. Meanwhile, until a new government is  elected, the new parliament can remove any member of the  government from office. However, when the prime minister  resigns, something that prompts the resignation of the entire  cabinet, the Constitution prescribes that all the ministers and  the prime minister remain in their posts until a new government  is elected. Therefore, the government remains in place, and the  parliament -- which did not elect this government -- cannot  remove the ministers from their posts.    Bjegovic executed this maneuver with the aid of his close  associates, the Benkovac lawyers Radomir Kuzeta (justice  minister) and Sava Strbac (secretary of the government). In a  statement to TANJUG, Strbac confessed that by resigning,  Bjegovic "protected" the members of the government. The  government submitted a report on its activities to the  parliament as part of the seventh item on the agenda. The  eighth item on the agenda was the removal of the information  minister. By this time, Bjegovic and his advisers had already  come up with the life-saving maneuver -- resignation. However,  when it was time to tackle the seventh item on the agenda, the  prime minister briefly left the assembly hall, the information  minister was removed, and the resignation followed.    Therefore, the items on the agenda were switched, and  government sources said that Bjegovic had actually sacrificed  the unpopular lady (Tanjga was removed from power by a unanimous  vote of the parliament), while protecting himself and the  remaining ministers!    For three days, the deputies of the parliamentary position  (from Babic's and Seselj's parties) and those of the  parliamentary opposition (Martic's people and others) tried to  outwit each other, certain important decisions were made despite  the complaints of the minority that the majority was behaving as  the majority, the ministers preached to and praised deputies,  and the "position" monitored the procedures like the apple of  its eye.... However, it was absolutely clear that the  parliamentary session was overshadowed by two people who are not  shadows, namely, the two Milans (Martic and Babic), who were  watching the live television relay in some unidentified place,  and who sporadically used couriers to summon their people  (Bjegovic and Kovacevic) for new consultations and new  instructions!    In the current distribution of power, it is clear that the  president of the republic is far closer to the government than  the parliament, and that the parliament is some kind of  opposition on the Krajina political scene. Martic has nominated  Mikelic, whom he describes as a "prominent political worker" as  prime minister designate of the new government. However, the  majority of 45 deputies have already rejected him. On the other  hand, Babic's party has issued a public statement saying that  Mikelic was the man whom, four years ago, Zagreb (Ivica Racan)  dispatched to Knin, while today Belgrade is offering him as the  savior (?).    Even in the area where accord is necessary and unavoidable  (negotiations with the Croatian regime) there remains a distance  between the, for the time being, irreconcilable opponents. The  parliament has nothing against the Zagreb negotiations, but it  has stressed that it is waiting for a report on the basis of  which it will either reject or accept the possible decisions  reached at the Russian Embassy.    On two occasions yesterday, the majority in the parliament  "washed its hands" of the alleged bianco agreement for the  Zagreb negotiations. This was first denied by Drago Kovacevic,  head of Babic's deputy caucus, and late last night by the  parliament chairman, Radical Branko Vojnica, who denied the  claims of Knin Television.</p>

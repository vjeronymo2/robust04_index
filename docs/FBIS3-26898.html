The Lusa news agency, in a report monitored here, said the  guarantee was contained in a letter sent to the court by Macao  Xinhua Vice-Director Ke Xiaogang.    China has asked for the extradition of Bolivian passport  holder Antonio Ti Luo, 45, who is wanted on charges involving a  50 million dollar joint venture fraud, and Hong Kong British  Passport holder Yeung Yuk-leung, who is wanted on murder  charges, Lusa said.    The Supreme Court in the Portuguese enclave is due to rule  on  the request, although no date has yet been set.    Portugal abolished the death penalty in the last century and  under its constitution extraditions cannot be carried out for  crimes involving capital punishment.    The Macao lawyer of the two accused, Pedro Redinha, has  questioned the guarantee, saying the Xinhua bureau is only a  consular entity which would not have the power to commit state  authorities to the pledge.    London-based Amnesty International has also taken an  interest  in the case of Antonio Ti Luo and called on Macao not to  extradite him as Portugal has no extradition treaty with China  and because of its constitution, the agency said.</p>

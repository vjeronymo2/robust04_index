			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> SANTA MARGARITA TO FIND HOME IN COUNTY LEAGUE  </P> <P> Santa Margarita High School, the $26-million Catholic school in southern Orange  County, moved a step closer to finding a home for its athletic teams Thursday.  </P> <P> Orange County league representatives recommended to the Southern Section  Executive Committee that the school be placed in the Orange County area  beginning in the fall of 1990, which would place the school in an Orange County  league for the 1990-91 season.  </P> <P> Santa Margarita will likely be placed in the Pacific Coast, Sea View or South  Coast league, according to Trabuco Hills Principal Bill Brand, who attended the  meeting.  </P> <P> "This is a first for Orange County," Brand said. "This is the first time we've  had an opportunity to experience a parochial school in a public school league."  </P> <P> County principals will meet next Friday meet to determine in which league to  place the two-year-old school.  </P> <P> The school will be a member of the Olympic League for the 1989-90 school year,  but then will be placed in a new league as part of the realignment of Southern  Section leagues for the 1990-91 and 1991-92 school years.  </P> <P> League representatives and Santa Margarita athletic officials favored putting  the school in the county public school leagues. The league representatives had  two other choices, however.  </P> <P> They could have placed the school in the small private schools group, which  included leagues such as the Olympic. Typical enrollment in that league is  about 500. Santa Margarita's current enrollment is 470, but is expected to  reach 1,200 by the start of the 1991 school year.  </P> <P> Or they could have put the school in the larger Catholic schools group, where  it could have joined the Angelus League.  </P></p>

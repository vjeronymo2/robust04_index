			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Japanese parties promise more of the same: Recent political upheavals may prove to be just cosmetic JAPAN'S socialist opposition parties, rather than the ruling Liberal Democratic party, could emerge as the big losers from the country's political turmoil. The main gainers will be a new breed of conservative parties, chief among them the recently formed Japan New party, which will draw away independent voters in urban areas who have reluctantly voted socialist in the past. The emergence of modernising conservative parties, in part formed by splits in the LDP's ranks, may put a cap on the ruling party's vote in urban areas, but LDP support will not collapse. Those are the main messages of closely watched Tokyo metropolitan elections over the weekend, which suggest the 18-months old JNP could hold the balance of power after the general election due on July 18. The JNP, which ran 22 candidates in the Tokyo assembly elections, won 20 seats, an increase of 18. The Social Democratic party, the main opposition party, lost 18 of its 32 seats, while the LDP increased its standing by two seats to 44. The question is: will the JNP be more than just a passing fashion ? Its articulate founder, the 55-year old Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, says he aims for a 'power shift' in Japanese politics. He admits the new party will be stifled if it does not succeed quickly. He explains: 'We have a year. If our party does not make a secure footing within a power shift our popularity will drop.' Yet even if the JNP retains its popularity it is difficult to predict its influence on Japanese policy, largely because Mr Hosokawa has refrained from specific commitments. His aristocratic background is far from revolutionary. His family have been lords of a feudal clan for more than 600 years. When he entered politics in 1971 his haughtiness won him the nickname Lord Hosokawa. He served in senior positions for the LDP before becoming governor of his native Kumamoto prefecture in 1983. He resigned in 1991 when it seemed the LDP would support him to become governor of Tokyo. The LDP did not deliver and the subsequent launch of the JNP is widely thought to reflect his personal bitterness rather than fundamental policy disagreements with the LDP. Indeed, he recently told an magazine interviewer that Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, was someone with whom he could form a coalition government. Nor is Mr Hosokawa entirely free from hints of scandal. He has admitted accepting political donations from the Sagawa Kyubin transport group, which has become a byword for political corruption in Japan. In spite of this, Mr Hosokawa has managed to create a clean image for the JNP which attracts younger voters. The JNP's success has not just exposed the socialist's vulnerability and the limits to the LDP's support in urban areas. It also poses a dilemma for Mr Tsutomu Hata, the leader of Shinseito, the 44-strong group which defected from the LDP last week in the name of political reform. Mr Hata moved swiftly to ally with the Social Democratic party. But JNP's success has made the socialist opposition seem weak and backward-looking, qualities which the reformists in Shinseito want to avoid association with. Mr Hata's alliance with the ailing socialists seems to many voters to smack of old-fashioned opportunism rather than radical reformism. For all the recent upheaval, which started with Mr Miyazawa's defeat in a no-confidence motion, one thing has not changed: even the reformers are so afraid of antagonising special interest groups that they refrain from proposing clear and potentially controversial policies. There has been a huge upheaval in party labels, but not in policies. As a senior Finance Ministry official explained: 'The extent of the change has been overestimated. The parties are changing but unless this produces different policies for the government there will be little change and at the moment no one is offering any new policies.'</p>

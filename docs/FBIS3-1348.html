As the only party which realised this, the  National Party [NP] had to gain enough representation in a  future cabinet to communicate this concept successfully.    Mr Keys, who is standing in the April election as an NP  candidate, gave Port Elizabeth businessmen his reasons for  optimism and caution. "Although this is a minority opinion, my  view of a future economic policy under a government of national  unity is very good.... Every participant in the government is  agreed on an issue of primary importance: the achievement of  social objectives is the ultimate test of the validity of any  economic policy. There is total agreement on the no. 1 social  objective -- jobs. Nothing else, nothing complicated. Jobs.  Now we know, and our future partners know, you cannot create  jobs unless you have growth. We know, and they know, that you  cannot have growth unless you have investment."    The public sector could not produce growth or sustainable  job  opportunities. "Only the private sector operates in a stingy  enough fashion to achieve that."    South Africa needed an economy which was friendly to  investors and entrepreneurs, in which the private sector would  not only survive but flourish, said Mr Keys.    The business community had performed magnificently and since  1989 commodity prices had fallen drastically. In addition, the  outflow of capital had lessened since December. "I think the  worst is over."    In multiparty talks negotiators had managed to achieve an  institutional framework which secured property rights and  protected the independence of the Reserve Bank.    But a future government would have to trust participants in  the economy such as bankers, mining houses and trade unions to  get the best results. And it should learn that the creation of  job opportunities was not a "zero sum game". "We are the only  party which realises that creating job opportunities for one  section of the population doesn't mean that you have to deprive  someone else of opportunity. We have to make sure we can  communicate this concept successfully in the government of  national unity. The extent to which we can win these arguments  will depend on our representation in cabinet."</p>

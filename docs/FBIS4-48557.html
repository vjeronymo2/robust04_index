			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Bakili Muluzi will today become the second  president of Malawi. [passage omitted] Yesterday, Bakili Muluzi  appointed Justin Malewezi as vice president. Mr Malewezi is a  former senior civil servant from the Banda administration. Also  yesterday, the future president announced his program for  Malawi, one of the poorest countries in the world.    [Begin Muluzi recording, in English with superimposed French  translation] My first concern is the poverty in this country.  Forty-five percent of our people live in rural areas. It goes  without saying that these are the areas where you find this  poverty. This issue was at the forefront of my campaign, and I  would like to say that I think we'll have to take those areas  very very seriously.    I also spoke of the social services, of the health sector.  You know that out of every 1,000 children who are born here,  230 die before the age of five, and that's very very serious.    We must finally look at the education sector: 54 percent of  our population does not know how to read, and this is a very  high proportion. Those are my three main priorities. [end  recording]</p>

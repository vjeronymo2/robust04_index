			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rosa Icela Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Upon signing the Agreement to Coordinate Public  Security Operations in 1994, a program in which the government  will invest 226 million new pesos, Government Secretary Jorge  Carpizo said that in view of attempts to weaken the state, it is  time to strengthen the unity of all Mexicans and utilize the  vitality, strength, and creativeness of the institutions. He  stated: "Among Mexicans, there can be no enmity, only  adversaries."    Carpizo explained that the resources granted in the  agreements signed by the Government Secretariat and state  governments are intended to improve the quality of the police  force by training personnel in the most modern and scientific  methods of investigation.    Carpizo stated: "Let me speak clearly. Public security is a  state responsibility. Mexico's public security policies must be  improved because this is a permanent commitment to the nation  and with the law. That commitment rejects illegal actions. It  requires our public security corps to remain current, permanent  protection of our constitutional order and full respect for  liberty, human rights, and the guarantees supporting these  rights."    The government secretary signed the agreement with 29  governors and the Mexico City mayor. The governors of Baja  California and Tamaulipas, Ernesto Ruffo Appel and Manuel  Cavazos Lerma, were not present but sent representatives to the  meeting. The agreement was signed within the framework of the  National Public Security Program. The ceremony took place in the  Revolution Room of the Government Secretariat.    Carpizo said it is necessary to uphold and improve  conditions  that provide assurances, calm, and public security, all of which  are indispensable to promoting national development. Carpizo  explained that the federal government and the states must act  "responsibly," especially in view of calls for improved public  security without infringing on any constitutional guarantees.    The secretary explained that the idea is to reaffirm the  legal system and to strengthen conditions that nourish civilized  life, order, and public peace within the framework of respect  for rights and liberties.    The ceremony was also attended by Mexico State Governor  Emilio Chuayffet Chemor, who said Mexico has recently endured  violence which a majority of the people undoubtedly rejects. He  said "crime has tarnished our coexistence." According to him,  the country wants better public security so the state can  function legally.    Chuayffet Chemor said all sectors view insecurity as an  offense, so when it is occasionally the result of negligence or  abuse of authority, distress turns into indignation.    He added that the federal government has responded promptly  to public security demands and noted: "The federal entities  want to fight violence, crime, and the confusion between  legitimate claims and arbitrary attempts to impose particular  interests on the majority."    The state leader said more policemen are needed to fight  crime. This increase in forces is not meant to cause concern in  society but to bring it serenity. He added that "the community  expects promptness and efficiency from the people who serve it  by fighting those who would offend and endanger the community.  The people demand assurances and expect no reduction of the  freedom we all enjoy. They ask for a stern hand to enforce the  law but say there can be no justification for abuse and  excessive power under any circumstances."    Jacques Rogozinsky, general director of the National Bank of  Public Works and Services (Banobras), announced that his  organization designed a financial plan to modernize the public  security system equipment. The plan's objective is to support  the states in purchasing vehicles for their preventive police  and judicial organizations. He explained that the funds for  these vehicles will be funneled to the various states through  Banobras, which will be responsible for providing the vehicles  themselves. The federal government will contribute 25 percent of  the total cost of the units, while loans will provide the  remaining 75 percent over three years.    Rogozinsky went on to explain that five assembly plants will  be invited to bid. The bank will require a "unit cost and  discount reference list" for all vehicles and other equipment,  which will be a determining factor for all participants. In  addition, the bank will establish a "volume discount rate per  unit," which must be applied by all qualifying participants.    Socorro Diaz, undersecretary of civilian protection, crime  prevention, and social readaptation, said the funds will be used  to upgrade the organization and operations of the public  security forces in each state, including private security  agencies, weapons for the police force, communications  equipment, and other materials used for training and to preserve  order.</p>

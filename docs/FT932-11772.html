			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Dublin seeks audits of building society chiefs THE Irish central bank yesterday ordered all building societies operating in the republic to produce audited reports detailing directors' interests and transactions made by them. The order follows the dismissal of the chief of one building society earlier this week and local press reports alleging large insurance commission fees being paid to the director of another. The central bank issued a statement yesterday, saying that, on receipt of the reports 'the bank will decide whether further action is warranted'. It said it was also considering whether the regulation of building societies could be improved but stressed 'that it has no concerns about the financial stability or soundness of any of the societies'. Mr Edmund Farrell, the former chairman of the Irish Permanent Building Society, was dismissed by his board last week for what his successor, Mr John Bourke, said was 'abuse of office and betrayal of trust'. The board claims Mr Farrell made profits of IPounds 700,000 on property transactions between himself and the company. Mr Farrell has claimed that the transactions were approved by the board.</p>

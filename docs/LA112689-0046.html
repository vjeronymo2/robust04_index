			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISS MANNERS: A COUNTEROFFENSIVE TO FOOD FUSSES  </P> <P> How do we describe someone who is intensely aware of the composition and  consequences of every bit of food he or she eats, and takes pains not to ingest  anything offensive?  </P> <P> A sensible eater?  </P> <P> A sensitive person?  </P> <P> A gourmet?  </P> <P> A nutritionist?  </P> <P> How about a food fuss?  </P> <P> Miss Manners is not unsympathetic to the current interest in food from dietary,  aesthetic and political standpoints. She has always appreciated the traditional  religious and ceremonial considerations. She understands about allergies,  scruples and preferences.  </P> <P> But enough is enough. She can no longer tolerate people talking when their  mouths ought to be full. It's ruining her appetite.  </P> <P> What is more, it is ruining modern social life. The pretense of being grateful  for whatever refreshment is offered has disappeared into a self-righteous  demand for menu control. Guests are announcing what they want and what they  disapprove of. Those who consider themselves polite do it beforehand, kindly  allowing the hosts time to fill their orders. Those who don't care, do it right  at the table.  </P> <P> Hosts are being advised to be extra careful not to offend their guests by  serving -- well, any of the major or minor food groups. There isn't anything  that someone isn't allergic to, or against. The list includes: alcoholic  beverages, animal fats, veal, shellfish, nuts, saturated fats, pork, eggs,  fried foods, game, sugar, heavy sauces, red meat, butter, starches, organ  meats, heavy desserts and caffeine.  </P> <P> Kind of simplifies your dinner planning, doesn't it?  </P> <P> Rather, Miss Manners suggests that people put their energy into fighting back  against the food fusses.  </P> <P> We all agree that everybody does not eat everything. That is not the issue.  There are polite rules for avoiding what you don't want:  </P> <P> * If you are serving yourself, from a tray or a buffet table, don't take it.  Take what you can eat and leave the rest.  </P> <P> * If you are given something you don't eat, mess up the plate a bit (sure, you  know how -- Miss Manners saw you hiding your vegetables under your potatoes  when you were a mere toddler).  </P> <P> * If your list of things you don't eat covers everything served at a normal  meal, then eat before you go out. Take a minimum amount for messing-up  purposes. We don't want to waste food, but we don't want to waste the hosts'  energies, either, by making them rush around trying to find something to please  you.  </P> <P> * If you are worried about truly hidden ingredients -- ubiquitous foodstuffs  that are not easily detected, but to which you have a serious reaction -- you  are allowed one whispered word to the hosts, or a reminder in advance to those  with whom you dine often.  </P> <P> * Don't discuss food. (If Miss Manners weren't so polite, she would say, "For  heaven's sake, shut up about it.") Nobody is interested in hearing about what  you don't eat. Don't announce it, and refuse to be led into any discussions  about it. If prodded, just smile happily and decline what is offered, refusing  to supply an explanation.  </P> <P> Miss Manners is fighting this battle for the sake of beleaguered hosts, so she  feels she must make her own requests of them, in their interest.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Guillermo Alvarez Bajares, Central Information  Office [OCI] director, has said that, so far, the alleged  removal of ministers from the executive cabinet are merely  rumors, which must be denied because there are no official  statements about it; in other words, the government is denying  the continuous rumors on an alleged cabinet reshuffle reportedly  planned by President Rafael Caldera. Vicente Briceno has the  story:    [Begin recording] [Briceno] Alvarez reported that  Transportation and Communication Minister Cesar Quintini Rosales  still heads that ministry, but Quintini, who was at Miraflores  Palace apparently attending a Council of Ministers meeting on 25  May, refused to deny reports of his alleged removal from the  cabinet. Alvarez noted that any governmental change is the  decision of the president alone, thereby explaining that  ministers are not hired, nor do they buy their posts.    The OCI chief rejected the existence of any ambiguity as a  result of the division in the economic cabinet by ironically  stating that the only division at the Council of Ministers is  Defense Minister Division General Rafael Montero.    [Alvarez] There were rumors on a subject inherent to the  president: the change, dismissal, or removal of ministers. No  one else can make this decision. Therefore, these are  unofficial rumors.    [Briceno] Despite the OCI director's statements, it is a  fact  that President Caldera could be thinking about revamping the  executive cabinet. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Germany recoils at Stasi moral snakepit: Many easterners feel the west is putting their whole society on trial WHEN eastern Germany's most prominent politician, Mr Manfred Stolpe, the respected prime minister of Brandenburg state, arrives in London for official talks tomorrow he will be closely followed. Not, as he might have been when he was a dissident churchman under the communist regime, by the dreaded Stasi secret police, but by a growing all-German controversy about ordinary East Germans' secret contacts with the dark agents of the morbidly distrustful dictatorship that ruled them. It is a controversy that claws at the soul of a still divided Germany and threatens further to alienate the country's east and west. Pastors are charged with having informed on their congregations, members of the anti-communist opposition on each other - including a husband on his wife - and a leading footballer is alleged to have kept the Stasi informed about his team mates at Dynamo Dresden. And Mr Stolpe is at the centre of the controversy. The former senior Protestant church lay official recently disclosed to an astonished nation his nearly 30 years of contacts with the Stasi. But he argued that the Church had no choice in its efforts to wring humanitarian concessions from the communist leadership. Some Germans claim the Stasi controversy is part of a necessary act of Vergangenheitsbewaltigung, or mastering the past. Many east Germans, however, regard themselves as victims of a west German purification zeal which was notably absent after 1945. East Germans charge that the Stasi revelations amount to a west German-led witchhunt. They see a western plot - which includes the Treuhand privatisation agency - to 'colonise' east Germany by removing the last east Germans from responsible positions. 'The west wants us to believe that east Germany consisted of either the Stasi or its informers, that it was all bad,' Mrs Ute Francke, a young anti-communist east Berlin doctor said. Behind the bitter debate lie 200km of shelves containing Stasi files which were opened to the public on January 2. The Stasi syndrome escalated to an obsession when former opposition leaders were able to read their files. Their worst suspicions were confirmed as former colleagues turned out to be Stasi informers. Enough unsavoury details emerged to give the files the reputation of being a moral snakepit. If so, the files are simply 'symptoms' of the illness produced by the East German regime, Mr Joachim Gauck, the German government's commissioner for Stasi files, said in an interview in his austere headquarters. Mr Gauck, who was a co-founder of the New Forum opposition movement, is almost as controversial as the files. The gaunt pastor is accused of presiding like an 'inquisitor' over the files and indiscriminately using them to determine the guilt of alleged informers. He admits the files are flawed - incriminating records of prominent east Germans were erased in late 1989. But the files were not the only criteria for determining a person's guilt, he said. 'My job is to answer 15 questions on a formula and it is up to the requesting office to decide whether to exonerate or incriminate the person and to what degree.' Mr Gauck, however, has been attacked for insinuating that Mr Stolpe and other individuals would have a great deal of explaining to do about their Stasi contacts. He insists that he made such comments to the media as a 'private person'. Mr Stolpe, in disclosures in Der Spiegel news magazine of his Stasi contacts, argued that everyone needed to ask himself whether he had worked 'too closely' with the authorities and in some cases perhaps even 'hurt someone else'. To many it was an honest, if somewhat muddled, quest for the truth by a man who had helped gain the release of East German prisoners and rejoin families in divided Germany while protecting the east German opposition. But it was seized on by others as an attempt by Mr Stolpe to grab the initiative before damaging information on him was found in the files.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Europe unprepared for VAT changes FOUR out of 10 European companies are unprepared for the new European value added tax (VAT) regime which comes into force on January 1, according to a survey by accountants Arthur Andersen. Some 74 per cent of the companies questioned claimed to be ready for the changes but closer examination showed that many did not have a full understanding of what was involved and that far fewer were really ready. From January customs border controls will be abolished and companies with customers or suppliers in other European Community countries will compile their own VAT information and trade statistics. Business organisations have criticised the new system as too complex. About 38 per cent of companies have collected the VAT numbers from fewer than half of their customers while a similar number have supplied their VAT numbers to fewer than half of their suppliers. This could prove costly because companies which do not provide their VAT numbers to suppliers will be charged VAT. Few companies had made any effort to co-ordinate their response to the VAT changes throughout their European operations. The survey found that 35 per cent had not begun to make any changes when the survey was carried out early this month. Italy emerged as the best prepared country, followed by Spain and the UK. The French thought they were the best prepared but 80 per cent of businesses had fewer than half the VAT numbers they needed and 68 per cent had not made any changes. UK companies said their most serious problem was adapting their computers. VAT and 1993: Is Europe Really Ready? Arthur Andersen, 1 Surrey Street, London WC2R 2PS. Free.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pep fee waived THE END OF the tax year often leads to special offers from financial groups. Scottish Equitable* is offering to waive its fixed administration fee (Pounds 45 plus VAT) for those who buy its Premium personal equity plan between February 1 and April 30. The Premium Pep is linked to six unit trusts. There is no initial charge on these, which means investors buy units at the 'creation' price, which is well below the offer price. There is still a bid-offer spread of around 1 per cent, but this reflects Scottish Equitable's costs in buying and selling the shares the trusts own. Scottish Equitable does, however, impose an annual Pep charge of 0.875 per cent (plus VAT) on top of the normal yearly unit trust management charge of 1 per cent or so. And those who want to sell their Pep holdings will face exit charges within the first five years. Martin Currie, the Edinburgh-based fund management group, is also offering a 2 per cent discount on Pep investments into its range of nine unit trusts for those who apply by March 26. *On p19 of the Quarterly Review, published today, I attribute this plan incorrectly to Scottish Amicable. My apologies for this error.</p>

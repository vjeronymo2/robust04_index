			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UAL DIRECTORS CHILL ANY EFFORT TO REVIVE BID  </P> <P> UAL Corp.'s non-management directors said Monday that the company should remain  independent, ending efforts by an employee-management group to revive its bid  for the parent of United Airlines.  </P> <P> The directors, speaking for the entire board, said the group's failed  $300-a-share offer had been in the best interests of shareholders -- a  statement that suggests the board won't entertain a lower bid. UAL stock closed  Monday at $178.36 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, up $9.88 on  speculation about a new bid. The directors' statement came after the close of  trading.  </P> <P> Frederick C. Dubinsky, head of United's pilot union, said he was disappointed  that UAL's board refused to negotiate a revised bid with the employee group.  "Should the board change its views and be willing to discuss a transaction in  which employees would obtain a significant majority ownership, we remain  willing to participate," he said.  </P> <P> UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf on Monday indicated that his role in the takeover  effort was over, at least for now. He said in a statement that he hoped the  airline's workers would "now turn their full attention to operating the best  airline in the world."  </P> <P> United's flight attendants had no immediate comment on the board's decision,  although its unlikely the attendants would pursue a bid without the pilots. The  pilots and flight attendants could try to negotiate an ownership stake in  contract negotiations.  </P> <P> The $6.75-billion bid for the nation's second-largest airline fell apart Oct.  13, when United's pilots and top managers failed to come up with the financing  needed to fund the takeover. The takeover group was dealt another, perhaps  fatal, blow last week when its equity partner, British Airways, said it was  pulling out of the deal.  </P> <P> The buyout group worked with its advisers over the weekend to come up with a  new, lower offer, but it was unable to find a partner willing to replace  British Airways' $750-million equity contribution. The takeover would have  created the nation's largest employee-owned company, with 85% of United's stock  in employee hands.  </P> <P> Though non-management directors, speaking for the entire board, clearly  discouraged a sale of the company, they didn't close the door entirely. In a  statement, the board said it intends to explore "all strategic and financial  alternatives" to "maximize shareholder value."  </P> <P> With the employee group in disarray, there was speculation that Los Angeles  billionaire Marvin Davis might revive his effort to acquire the airline. Davis'  original $240-a-share bid in August set in motion events that led to the  proposed employee buyout.  </P> <P> Sources close to Davis said he was exploring ways to finance a bid. A source  close to Davis said it was possible that the failed employee bid "poisoned the  well too badly" for anyone to raise cash quickly for another offer. Davis and  the employee group share the same banker, Citibank.  </P> <P> Others close to the situation doubted that Davis would make a new offer.  "Marvin Davis wasn't real and isn't real," said Brian Freeman, an adviser to  United's machinists union, a group that opposed the employee buyout.  </P> <P> Wolf tried to put the best face on the failed takeover by citing a  "substantially improved working relationship" between management and United's  pilots union. Both groups had put aside old antagonisms to work on the buyout  effort, and the pilots agreed to a tentative contract that included increased  productivity. For example, pilots agreed to fly a Boeing 757 aircraft that had  sat idle until the buyout effort got under way.  </P> <P> There was speculation Monday that the failure of the Wolf-led buyout might  undermine Wolf's relationship with employees. The pilots and flight attendants,  who joined the buyout group last week, might blame him for the bid's failure,  some said. When told that Wolf thought the takeover experience had strengthened  his relationship with employees, Freeman said, "He should be a stand-up  comedian."  </P></p>

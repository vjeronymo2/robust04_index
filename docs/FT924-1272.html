			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Futures and options trading A SHORTAGE of stock coupled with continued rolling forward of positions from the December contract into March ahead of this morning's expiry boosted turnover in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. The December contract on the FT-SE started its last full session of trading at 2,733 and, but for a brief retreat two hours later, moved ahead throughout the day. Several dealers were said to have been caught short of December, although others concentrated on moving into the March contract, which accounted for the high turnover in that series. The day's high of 2,760 was reached just before the opening of Wall Street, and although a bout of profit-taking caused a retreat in December, the firmness in New York was said to have prevented a greater decline. Worse than expected UK unemployment figures had little effect on trading and the December contract was at a premium to cash consistently throughout the session. December finished at 2,747, up 7 from its previous close and at a five-point premium to the underlying cash market. Turnover in the December future was almost 9,000 contracts, while the volume in the March series reached about 7,000 Lots. The traded options saw heavy turnover of 38,138 lots. The FT-SE 100 option had 12,481 contracts dealt and the Euro FT-SE 3,364 lots.</p>

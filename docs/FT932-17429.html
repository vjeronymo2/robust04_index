			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Economist chief to take over at ITN MR David Gordon, chief executive of The Economist, is to be the next chief executive of Independent Television News. He succeeds Mr Bob Phillis, who left yesterday to become deputy director-general of the BBC. Mr Gordon, a 51-year-old chartered accountant, yesterday confirmed that he had accepted the job. Mr Gordon, who has worked for The Economist for 25 years, was chosen by Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, who is about to be appointed chairman of ITN, the television news organisation which supplies news to ITV and Channel 4. Yesterday the offer for ITN put together by a consortium led by Mr Green went unconditional in all respects. Carlton, Central, London Weekend Television, Granada and Reuters, the international news and information organisation, will dominate ITN, with 18 per cent each. Scottish and Anglia Television each have a 5 per cent stake. The new shareholders have already reached agreement in principle to buy ITN's London headquarters from Stanhope Properties in a deal worth Pounds 74m. The deal will relieve financial pressures on ITN.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu said,  shortly after meeting with his Cuban counterpart Roberto Robaina  in Montevideo, that there are no difficulties in the relations  between Cuba and Uruguay. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez  has  said that Robaina will make an unofficial visit to Paraguay in  the next few days. Ramirez added that Paraguayan President Juan  Carlos Wasmosy will not be able to receive Robaina because he is  traveling in Europe, and that he himself, Ramirez, will not be  able to receive Robaina either, because he is leaving today for  Morocco to participate in the signing of the agreement on the  Uruguay Round of the GATT.    Diplomatic relations between Havana and Asuncion do not  exist  at the present time, but Robaina's presence in Paraguay is  considered the first reflection of the intention toward  rapprochement between Paraguay and Cuba.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mustafa al-Liddawi, representative of the </F> Islamic Resistance Movement-Hamas in Beirut, by Ja'far Salim and  'Abbas Surur; date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted]    Al-Liddawi: Statements by the Hamas official  spokesman and representative in Jordan concerning the 'Afula and  Hadera operations were made after the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam  groups inside the occupied territories announced their  responsibility for the two martyrdom operations. The operations  were used as a pretext to implement this conspiracy against  fraternal Jordan, to blackmail it, especially after Jordan's  recent position toward the blockade of the Jordanian port of  al-'Aqabah and Jordan's link between its continuing  participation in the bilateral talks and the lifting of the  blockade. On top of this comes the painful impact of the  martyrdom operations on the occupation government.    AL-'AHD: It was said that Ibrahim Ghawshah and  Muhammad Nazzal's passports were withdrawn. What information do  you have on this?    Al-Liddawi: We do not say that the Jordanian  Government withdrew their passports. But after the news  conference that King Husayn held in Amman following the Israeli  threats to Jordan, the Jordanian foreign minister summoned  Ghawshah and Nazzal to explain developments and the government's  position on them. After listening to the two, the minister  asked their permission to keep their passports with him.    AL-'AHD: Many observers expect relations between  Hamas and the Jordanian regime to become tense.    Al-Liddawi: We do not expect such a thing. Our  relations with the Jordanian Government remain good, despite  what happened. Jordan appreciates that the Palestinian cause is  important for it. There are many reasons leading it to create  good relations with Hamas, which in turn appreciates Jordan's  importance for the Palestinian cause and the Palestinian people  in general. We also deeply respect all the Arab and Islamic  countries, especially those where we have an information,  political, or charitable presence. We want their security to be  stable, especially Jordan's. Hamas has no organizational  infrastructure or armed presence outside Palestine. It is not  our policy to embarrass Jordan or any other country. We believe  that relations with Jordan will not be harmed by what happened.  The government's recent measures against Hamas will not last.  [passage omitted]    AL-'AHD: Muhammad Nazzal told AL-'AHD two weeks  ago that Hamas would hit the Israeli settlements with rockets.  What is your comment on this?    Al-Liddawi: That's what I and brother Muhammad  Nazzal read in the statement issued by the Martyr 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam Battalions in the occupied territories. It threatened  the Zionists with more military operations against the enemy's  soldiers and settlers in retaliation for the massacre  perpetrated by the settlers in the al- Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron.    We are expecting more painful operations against the enemy  by  the Martyr 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions.    AL-'AHD: Does this mean that the target of these  operations will be the settlements built in the territories  occupied in 1967 or the ones throughout Palestine?    Al-Liddawi: This question should be put to the  Martyr 'Izz-al- Din al-Qassam Battalions operating in occupied  Palestine because all the planning, preparation, and  implementation of all the military operations is carried out in  the occupied territories.    AL-'AHD: How do you envisage the relations between  Hamas and Fatah in the event of the implementation of the  self-rule in Gaza and Jericho and the entry of 'Arafat and the  Palestinian police force into these two areas?    Al-Liddawi: We yearn to maintain good relations  with all the sides in the occupied territories. Fatah enjoys  support in the occupied territories and any fighting between  Hamas and Fatah would trigger the fire of civil war in  Palestine. We must avoid this as far as we can. Any struggle  between the two inside the occupied territories would be bloody  and destructive to our people. [passage omitted]</p>

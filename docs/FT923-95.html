			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Socks pull Sherwood up to Pounds 8.2m midway HELPED by the boost given to its garments division by its two socks businesses, Sherwood Group lifted pre-tax profits by 25 per cent to Pounds 8.18m in the first half of 1992. In May the company, which makes lace and produces bras, lingerie and socks, graduated from the USM, where it had been for six years, to a full listing. At the same time there was a 4-for-1 scrip issue. The pre-tax advance from last time's Pounds 6.55m was struck on turnover ahead 20 per cent at Pounds 66m (Pounds 55.2m). Operating margins rose from 14.2 to 14.3 per cent, while the pre-tax margin grew to from 11.9 to 12.4 per cent. Mr David Parker, chairman, said that some Pounds 29m of group sales were overseas. Turnover in the lace division declined from Pounds 41.3m to Pounds 37m: of that, Pounds 27m, or 73 per cent of divisional sales, was abroad. Lace operating profits were down almost Pounds 1m at Pounds 5.6m and the operating margin slipped from 15.8 to 15.1 per cent. Mr Parker said sales had been lost on the commodity end, which had had 'a more difficult time on price'. The almost three-dimensional lace produced for the top end of the market on Sherwood's new Textronic machines helped maintain margins, he said. The garments side lifted profits, turnover and operating margin, from Pounds 1.32m to Pounds 3.87m, from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 29.5m and from 9.2 to 13.1 per cent respectively. The two socks businesses - Samuel Eden and Charles W Hall acquired for a combined Pounds 26m in June 1991 and January 1992 - made the group one of the UK's leading sock producers. Capital expenditure in the half was Pounds 8m with 77 per cent of that going on Jacatronic and Textronic machines. One Textronic machine produces about Pounds 200,000 of turnover: Sherwood currently has eight and will have 12 next year when capital expenditure for the 12 months will fall to Pounds 9.5m. Gearing rose from 44 per cent at the December year-end to 59 per cent at June 30. Earnings were static on the enlarged equity at 5.3p per share and the interim dividend is raised 15 per cent to 0.9p (0.78p).</p>

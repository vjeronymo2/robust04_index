			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 3 February (MTI) -- The presidium of the  Federation of Young Democrats (FIDESZ), one of the most popular  opposition parties according to polls, has declared its support  for plans by the four liberal parties -- the FIDESZ, the  Alliance of Free Democrats, the Entrepreneurs' Party, and the  Agrarian Federation -- to conclude a cooperation pact for the  spring parliamentary elections. The FIDESZ would like to see  the document signed as soon as possible, FIDESZ Deputy Chairman  Tamas Deutsch told the press in Budapest today.    Deutsch feels that such an accord is worth concluding on the  basis of the principal agreement from Monday's [31 January]  meeting of liberal parties, even if party leaders fail to come  to an understanding about backing each other.    The four-party agreement would concern cooperation during  the  two election rounds.    By the FIDESZ's interpretation, mutual support between party  chairmen would mean that in constituencies where the leader of  one of the four parties runs for election, the other three  parties would enter no candidate.    Deutsch announced that, contrary to earlier plans, FIDESZ  deputy Imre Frajna will not run for election in the individual  constituency where Chairman of the Alliance of Free Democrats  Ivan Peto will compete for the mandate.</p>

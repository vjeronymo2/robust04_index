			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: SNP at sharp end in battle for steel - Bethan Hutton on nationalist hopes in Motherwell IF THE Scottish National Party is to have any chance of winning independence for Scotland it has to make inroads into Labour's vote in the industrial heartlands around Glasgow. That means winning seats like Motherwell South. The SNP stands at about 27 per cent in the Scottish opinion polls, almost double the 14 per cent of the vote it won in 1987. This indicates that it is likely to win a few rural seats from the Tories and the Liberal Democrats, but there has been little sign of its support increasing further. It needs to win nearly 40 per cent to take more than a couple of seats from Labour - standing at about 42 per cent in the polls - and win half the 72 Scottish seats, which it says would give it a mandate to negotiate independence. Motherwell South is one of the seats the nationalists are pinning particular hopes on. It is dominated by British Steel's massive Ravenscraig steelworks and Dalzell plate mill. The SNP has for years made the fate of the Scottish steel industry one of its biggest issues. Its task is to persuade traditional Labour voters in Motherwell that it can save the Scottish steel industry. 'We're all converts here,' said Mrs Kay Ullrich, the SNP candidate, waving her arm to indicate the party workers crammed into two smoke-filled rooms above a greengrocers, which act as the party's campaign headquarters. The conversion has been of Labour supporters to the SNP. With all the usual converts' zeal they are attempting to persuade the people of Motherwell to break a 47-year tradition of returning a Labour MP. Mrs Ullrich is a more established believer than most of her campaign staff - she joined the SNP in 1965. For many years the SNP's fight for independence seemed hopeless. Now she sees herself returning from the wilderness as the prospect of home rule for Scotland seems closer than ever. Mrs Ullrich claims that canvassing returns give her good reason to be confident. But she has to overturn a majority of almost 17,000 to unseat Mr Jeremy Bray, Labour MP for the constituency since 1974 and only the third MP for Motherwell South in 47 years. The SNP has achieved that kind of turn-around before, in the 1988 Glasgow Govan by-election when Mr Jim Sillars, another convert from Labour, turned a Labour majority of almost 20,000 into an SNP majority of 3,500. But that was a well-publicised one-off chance for the electorate to startle Labour out of its complacent position as the top party in Scotland. Can it really be repeated all over the country on April 9? After all, in another three by-elections in 1989 and 1990, Labour kept the SNP safely in second place. Mr Bray has never needed to campaign seriously in Motherwell before. He is an Englishman, an academic who acts as his party's spokesman on science and technology. He has long experience of industry - he took Motherwell South after losing his seat in another steel-producing area on Teesside. But his English origins may count against him now that nationalism has captured the imagination of many voters. The SNP feels it has got its teeth into Mr Bray on the issue of steel - they say he has betrayed his constituents by giving up the fight to save Ravenscraig. One convert paraded on an SNP platform this week was Mr Alan Raby, convener of the shop stewards at Dalzell, whose closure may not come for several years. There has been a split between the Labour-led unions at Ravenscraig, which are resigned to its closure, and the Dalzell union leaders, who have switched allegiance to the SNP and are still fighting for a future. The SNP has promised to nationalise the Scottish assets of British Steel, keep Ravenscraig going and expand its capacity. It argues that Scotland should compete to supply the North Sea oil industry, which it says is the biggest European market for steel. But the question remains of whether Ravenscraig could compete successfully, unsubsidised, with new plants planned by British Steel. On the streets the recurring theme is: 'It's too late for Ravenscraig now.' The people of Motherwell have seen the decline of steel over the years, as the unions and politicians fought a losing battle. Few are convinced that the SNP can deliver its promises. Mr Jim Law, a former steelworker who has been unemployed for eight years, is just the kind of person the SNP needs to convince. He has always voted Labour. Although he supports independence, he will be voting Labour again this time. 'The only reason I am not voting SNP is there is no chance of getting them in,' he says. There is still a large credibility gap to bridge. The SNP also has to battle against voter apathy instilled in people who have consistently voted for one party but been governed by another. The Scotsman newspaper still tips Motherwell South as a safe Labour seat. Mrs Ullrich says she knows independence will happen, but Mr Bray says he isn't losing any sleep over it yet.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has not yet approved the use of burnup credit in criticality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses for spent fuel storage and transportation casks. The applicant did,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, analyze credit for burnup as an alternative design acceptance basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the NUHOMS&hyph;24P DSC, pending future acceptance of burnup credit by NRC. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in the SER, the NUHOMS&hyph;24P DSC criticality safety is approved based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on, among other assumptions, the key assumptions of loading with irradiated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel assemblies with equivalent enrichment &lt;1.45 wt% U-235, misloading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unirradiated fuel with maximum enrichment of 4.0 wt% U-235, and soluble boron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in water for wet loading and unloading. The NRC still considers the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the burnup-enrichment curve, Certificate of Compliance Figure 1&hyph;1, as a fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selection criteria, to be prudent. Its use adds additional unanalyzed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservatism in the criticality safety margin. It is comparable to previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NUHOMS&hyph;24P approvals. Its use would also be consistent with the requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that storage cask designs be, to the extent practicable, compatible with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removal of the stored spent fuel from the reactor site, transportation, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ultimate disposition by DOE. Therefore, the NRC disagrees with the commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request to allow Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;24P users the option of using the burnup-enrichment curve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> M.12.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters stated that the listing of specific fuel types in the draft Certificate of Compliance is overly restrictive. Allowance should be made for very similar fuel types or a ``fuel qualification table'' as proposed by the vendor should replace the listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NRC agrees that allowance should be made for very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar types of fuel to be stored. The Certificate of Compliance provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this flexibility. The ``fuel qualification table'' consideration at this time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not subject to this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> M.13.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter citing the first paragraph of page A&hyph;27 of the draft Certificate of Compliance states that the postulated adiabatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heatup would result in concrete temperatures being exceeded in approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 hours. As a result, it is appropriate and conservative to perform the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visual surveillance to verify no vent blockage on a daily basis to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a blockage existed for less than 40 hours. The last sentence in the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph should reflect that the module needs to be removed from service if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it cannot be established that the blockage is less than 40 hours, not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24 hours. A 24-hour surveillance interval will adequately verify this. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter cited an inconsistency in Section 3 of the draft Certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance. Section 3.1 indicates that a module must be removed from service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if a vent blockage is in existence for longer than 24 hours. Surveillance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.3.2 indicates that a module must be removed from service if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concrete accident temperature criterion has been exceeded for more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24 hours. A vent blockage of less than 24 hours would not cause the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature limit to be exceeded, as explained in Section 1.3 and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objective for the 24-hour frequency required by surveillance 1.3.1. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apparent conflict between Section 1.3 and the action for Surveillance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requirement 1.3.2 should be resolved. It appears that Surveillance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requirement 1.3.2 actions are appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Certificate of Compliance has been clarified to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect the comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> M.14.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that Section 1.2.14 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Attachment A of the draft Certificate of Compliance is unnecessary because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time to transfer the DSC from the transfer cask to the HSM would normally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require less than 8 hours. During this time, even with temperatures above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100 <!-- PJG 0377 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F without the solar shield, any increase in fuel clad temperature and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neutron shield temperature would be small and therefore not detrimental.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the transfer cask is open to the atmosphere and would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressurize.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The vendor, VECTRA, has proposed this limiting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition of operation in lieu of showing what detrimental effect might occur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the cladding or neutron shield, should the ambient conditions involve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperatures above 100 <!-- PJG 0377 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. The NRC concurs with this condition as cited in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Attachment A, Section 1.2.14 of the Certificate of Compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> N. Several commenters raised safeguards/sabotage issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> N.1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter cited the World Trade Center bombing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ease with which a disturbed individual recently breached security and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remained undetected at a U.S. reactor. Explosive technology has become very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sophisticated in the last 15 years since the NRC and Sandia Laboratories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studied the effect of sabotage on shipping casks in the March 1979,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NUREG&hyph;0459, ``Generic Adversary Characteristics Summary Report.'' Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter made reference to an experiment with balloons which failed. Yet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another commenter questioned the degree of protection in the spent fuel pool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> versus dry cask storage. Will the cask be in a vital area? Will safeguards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be reviewed as part of the security plan? What is the effect on the security  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these casks?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

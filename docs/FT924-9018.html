			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Tessa keeps its attractions SAVERS disappointed with the fall in base rates but who are reluctant to move their money out of banks or building societies should not forget Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts. A combination of relatively generous rates and tax efficiency continue to make this an attractive product in spite of the limits on the amounts that can be invested. There is no tax to pay on interest earned in a Tessa, provided the capital is held for its full five-year term. The maximum investment in the first year is Pounds 3,000, with a limit of Pounds 1,800 each subsequent year, to a total maximum of Pounds 9,000. When Tessas were first launched in January 1991, banks and building societies competed with each other for the custom, which represented a reliable source of funds for a stable period. The institutions despair of money that simply chases high rates and is very liquid. The institutions are continuing to hold Tessa rates at a relatively high level. This can be gauged in two ways: the level of interest paid on Tessa in relation to base rates and in relation to savings accounts. In January 1991, base rates were 14.5 per cent and most institutions were offering 14 per cent and above. Base rates have fallen to 8 per cent and the table of selected banks and building societies shows that most lenders are offering returns of 8 per cent and over. In fact, the average Tessa rate of the selected banks and building societies shown is 8.14 per cent. Some institutions are paying considerably more than this, notably Allied Trust bank and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, National Counties, West Bromwich and Woolwich building societies. The rate of interest paid on most savings accounts is, however, considerably lower than base rates. The Woolwich does not require a notice period for the transfer or termination of a Tessa, but most institutions impose a period of between one month and 90 days. The savings accounts selected for comparison in the table are therefore one-month notice accounts. Where the bank or building society does not have a one- month account, or requires a minimum deposit in excess of Pounds 5,000, an instant access account has been selected. The maximum contribution possible to a Tessa since its launch is Pounds 4,800. The table shows that, in most cases, the rate offered on the Tessa is two or three percentage points higher than that on the savings accounts. The average interest rate is 6.05 per cent gross compared with 8.15 per cent gross from the institutions selected. And many with Tessas will find after five years that the overall rate is even higher if they qualify for the bonuses offered by most institutions. Savers who need their money before the five years is up still have access to their capital, just forgoing tax exemption on the interest. You are also allowed under the Tessa rules to withdraw interest without penalty. Of the institutions listed, only Bristol &amp; West offers a higher rate (on its Balmoral postal account) than on its Tessa. In taking out a Tessa, avoid banks or building societies that impose a fee for transfer or termination as this will reduce the total return should the Tessa be closed early.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                SAVINGS and TESSA INTEREST RATES COMPARED  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (per cent gross)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Institution                 Savings Account     Rate on      Tessa                                               Pounds 4,800  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbey National               Instant Saver       6.00         8.15 Allied Trust                1 month notice       7.98         8.95 Bank of Scotland                Premier          5.80         7.12 Barclays                   High Rate Deposit     4.50         7.50 Bristol &amp; West BS              Balmoral          9.65         8.25  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Chelsea BS                  Instant Option       6.00         8.00 Cheltenham &amp; Glouc            London Share       7.75         8.60 Co-Op                         Ultra Save 30      5.50         8.00 First Direct                 High Interest       5.85         7.88 Halifax BS                 Instant Xtra Plus     5.80         8.20  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Leeds                         Liquid Gold        6.00         8.25 Lloyds                      Instant Savings      5.00         7.50 Midland                     Meridian Savings     4.89         7.75 National Counties            Instant Access      6.00         9.60 Nationwide BS                 Cashbuilder        5.50         8.20  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Nat West                    Diamond Reserve      5.88         7.75 Royal Bank Scot               Gold Deposit       4.90         7.50 Scarborough BS                 First Post        7.90         8.00 TSB                             Instant          6.00         8.00 West Bromwich                Premium Shares      5.50         9.50  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Woolwich                       Prime Gold        5.65         8.60 Yorkshire Bank               1 month notice      5.00         8.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Average                                          6.05         8.15  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Moneyfacts  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

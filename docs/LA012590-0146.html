			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGOLAN GUERRILLAS SAY THEY BLUNTED REGIME'S OFFENSIVE  </P> <P> Pro-Western rebels in Angola have blunted a monthlong offensive by troops of  the Marxist government, which is supported by Soviet advisers, the deputy chief  of the insurgent organization said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "At this moment, the fighting continues, but the outcome is quite predictable,"  said Jeremias Chitunda, deputy to Jonas Savimbi, chief of the National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).  </P> <P> He said government forces pushed to within about 20 miles of Mavinga, a town of  about 13,000 that has long been held by the guerrillas. Chitunda said capture  of the town would have put government troops within "striking distance" of  UNITA's headquarters in Jamba, in southeastern Angola.  </P> <P> He said government casualties have totaled 300 troops killed and 651 wounded  since the offensive began the day before Christmas. He reported UNITA losses at  62 dead and 300 wounded.  </P> <P> Chitunda said about 100 Soviet advisers and technicians participated in the  offensive. Earlier this month, the State Department said Soviet participation  in the fighting marked a "dangerous escalation" in the 14-year Angolan civil  war.  </P> <P> Chitunda spoke to reporters during a visit to Washington to seek political  support for the rebels. The Reagan Administration provided covert military aid  to UNITA, but that aid is believed to have been cut off last year.  </P></p>

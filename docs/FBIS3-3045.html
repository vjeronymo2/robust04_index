The China Torch Hi-tech Industry Investment Fund is expected  to attract about $120 million as a result of co-operation  between the SSTC and the foreign firms, said Wang Ruiming, head  of the commission's Torch Programme Office.    The four are Tien Lee (International) Corporation and Wadley  Corporate Finance of Hong Kong, BBN James Capel of Canada and  the Arthur Anderson Accountant Corporation of the U.S.    The funds are to be poured directly into State projects  aided  by the Torch Programme which was set up in 1988 to market and  develop hi-tech in China.    Torch and the foreign firms are now examining about 30  projects which have applied for the funds.    SSTC has approved more than 1,500 Torch projects in the past  five years and local authorities have launched another 3.600.    Figures from about 1,300 State projects show a total output  of 14.29 billion yuan ($1.64 billion) last year, more than  double the figure in 1992.    Most Torch projects have been set up in the 52 State hi-tech  industrial development zones around the country.    Output of these zones leaped 145.3 percent last year to  45.83  billion yuan ($5.27 billion) and their export volume doubled to  $730 million.</p>

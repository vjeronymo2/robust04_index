			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / Most employers found to flout disabled quotas law MANY employers flout legislation designed to promote jobs for disabled people and get away with it, according to a report out today Three quarters of employers, some 25,000, fail to ensure that 3 per cent of their staff are registered disabled, says the report published by the independent Employment Policy Institute. It is not an offence to be under quota but it is for companies below quota to recruit a new non-disabled worker. The law is undermined by exemption certificates, poor monitoring and under-registration of disabled people, the report says. There have been 10 prosecutions since the law was passed in 1944. The report says rigid government definitions of unemployment 'hide' high unemployment among disabled people and therefore cover up widespread discrimination against them by employers. The official monthly count of those out of work and claiming unemployment benefit excludes many disabled people. Mr Patrick McLoughlin, employment minister, has urged employers to review recruitment and promotion policies to guard against discrimination. His comments came after a report found that Asian and young black people have more difficulty in getting a job than white counterparts.

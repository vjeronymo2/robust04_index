			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LAKE MIRAMAR PROJECT FOES QUALIFY FOR VOTE  </P> <P> The Save Miramar Lake Committee has collected enough valid signatures on  petitions to force a citywide referendum on a developer's plan to build 3,360  homes north of Lake Miramar, San Diego City Clerk Charles Abdelnour said  Friday.  </P> <P> A sample by the county registrar of voters of 5% of the names turned in by the  group Feb. 7 and 8 showed that it collected 37,718 valid signatures, far more  than the 25,594 needed to qualify for the ballot, Abdelnour said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Inevitable Battle'  </P> <P> "I'm jubilant, extremely pleased," said J. Gary Underwood, co-chairman of the  organization, which gathered more than 47,000 signatures in one month to force  the vote. "We knew we had it, and I guess the next step now is to prepare for  the inevitable battle with the developer."  </P> <P> In a related development, Bob Glaser, co-chairman of San Diegans for Managed  Growth (SDMG), said Friday that his organization has decided to mount a  petition drive to place a citywide initiative protecting San Diego's  environmentally sensitive lands on an upcoming ballot.  </P> <P> SDMG is still evaluating whether to aim for the San Diego City Council primary  elections Sept. 19 or a later ballot, but has concluded that the compromise  growth-management plan approved by the council in January does not adequately  protect hillsides, flood plains and wetlands.  </P> <P> "It's window dressing," said Glaser, who also serves as attorney for the Save  Miramar Lake Committee. "It's not a plan. It's captions and slogans and  directions to staff to write a plan."  </P> <P> Two environmental protection plans, one forwarded by the City Council and  another written by Citizens for Limited Growth, were defeated in last  November's election. Both were part of growth-management plans that included  controversial caps on home construction.  </P> <P> SDMG last year mounted a campaign to place a separate environmental protection  ordinance on the ballot, but abandoned that effort in favor of working to help  shape the city's plan. Some SDMG leaders were dissatisfied with the final city  product, claiming that it had been gutted by development industry  representatives who were also on a city-appointed committee that wrote the  plan.  </P> <P> The Miramar Lake referendum, which is being closely watched by the city's  environmental and slow-growth leaders, faces at least two obstacles before  Abdelnour can certify it for placement on the ballot.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BCE Has Filed Suit  </P> <P> BCE Development, which has an approved "development agreement" to build the  homes on 1,200 acres in Miramar Ranch North, has filed suit in Superior Court  to declare the petitions invalid. A hearing on that matter will be held  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Also, BCE or any other interested party can force Abdelnour to check the  validity of every signature by paying about $30,000 for the effort by Thursday  evening. Donna Nenow, spokeswoman for BCE, said that the company had made no  decision on the matter.  </P> <P> If the referendum is certified by Abdelnour, the council must rescind the  development agreement or place the referendum before voters within 11 months.  Abdelnour's office has suggested that the Sept. 19 primary, which will be the  first election conducted under the city's new district-only voting plan, would  be the most economical time to hold the election.  </P> <P> Four council members -- including District 5 representative Ed Struiksma, who  represents the area and strongly backs the development project -- are running  for re-election in the primary.  </P> <P> Struiksma said Friday that, with the court action pending, it is too early for  him to comment on when the referendum might be held and how it could affect his  re-election chances.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Only 658 Homes Opposed  </P> <P> Underwood's group opposes only 658 of the homes, an industrial park and a road  slated to be built on the picturesque hills immediately north of the lake. But,  because the city granted BCE a development agreement, a binding contract under  which the city gives the developer a guaranteed right to build the homes in  return for early construction of schools, parks, roads and a library, the  community group must overturn the entire project.  </P> <P> Underwood called on the council to rescind the agreement, eliminating the need  for a referendum. "I hope the City Council saves everybody a lot of money,"  Underwood said.  </P> <P> Underwood's group, relying heavily on volunteers, spent $20,353 to qualify for  the ballot. A rival group, backed by $445,000 of BCE's money, spent $457,000 to  oppose that effort and collect more than 52,000 signatures supporting BCE's  plans.  </P></p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (31): Waiting for a call - Why telephone privatisation is being held up INDIA'S most ambitious privatisation, initiated two years ago, is in the field of telecommunications. But court battles and the lack of a comprehensive policy have bogged down what could well be the world's largest expansion plan, connecting a population of more than 850m to the rest of the world. Contracts for paging systems are yet to be finalised. The government's attempt last year to award contracts to Indian and multinational companies for a cellular network in four metropolitan areas has been mired in controversy, with allegations of favouritism and corruption. After years of being neglected as a luxury, the Indian telecom industry is slowly coming into its own, as a crucial infrastructural element if reforms are to work. Budget allocations were substantially raised, to Rs231.3bn in the government's current Eighth plan (1992-1997), as against Rs45.3bn in the Seventh plan. The actual expenditure, however, was Rs81.22bn, almost double the outlay, but only after India had received a rap on the knuckles from the World Bank. Noting that the 'the quality of the current service is very poor compared to international standards' and pitifully thin compared with other developing countries, the Bank estimated the potential market to be 'three to four times the market currently being served,' with only 5.8m lines for a population exceeding 850m (an average of 0.52 telephone lines per hundred Indians). The Bank added that the case for substantial reform was 'overwhelming', and that much of the groundwork had already been prepared. The government's Department of Telecommunications is long overdue for restructuring. The DoT is a monolithic, financially self-sufficient organisation which has a monopoly of the regulation, direct provision of services, and promotion of telecoms equipment manufacturing. A committee set up in 1991 recommended as a first step the separation of these three functions so that independent regulatory and policy-making bodies could promote competition and private sector participation and concentrate on providing a flow of services to users rather than on the provision of physical infrastructure. Besides the establishment of these two independent bodies, comprehensive reform would include entry of competitors in both long-distance and local services and the reorganisation of DoT into regional operating companies for the northern, eastern, western and southern zones, besides a long-distance trunk line corporation, to run the telecommunications service in the country. But the government has been unable to decide whether this plan is feasible, or whether foreign equity participation should be allowed in these corporations. The government's expansion plan envisages adding 7.5m lines to the existing infrastructure by 1997, to reach 20m lines by the end of the century. Experts say this will still not meet the demands of a growing population and an expanding economy. But the DoT admits that the telecom infrastructure in the country could improve drastically if private companies were allowed to provide the basic telephone infrastructure. The DoT had sought Rs400bn from the government for its telecom budget, and it was decided that the sector should be partly privatised. The DoT invited global tenders for a range of telecom equipment and services, digital exchanges, and microwave systems and franchises for cellular and radio paging operations in more than 30 Indian cities. But the Narasimha Rao government made it clear that privatising the entire telecom sector was out of the question. Officials point out that it was only in the late 1980s that governments in most developed countries relinquished control of the telecom industry. 'We have not got to the stage where absolute privatisation is feasible or advisable,' says a senior official in the Communications Ministry. 'The government's main concern is to develop a telecom infrastructure in the rural areas, where private companies would not venture because there are no profits to be had,' he says. Last year, the government set up rural exchanges in 30,000 Indian villages, a giant leap considering that only 42,000 villages had been connected in the 40 years since Independence. 'We are all for liberalisation, but the telecom sector is a very sensitive one, so privatising it can only be on a selective basis,' says Mr Rajesh Pilot, a cabinet minister formerly in charge of telecommunications. The government's limited attempts to privatise telecommunications have attracted the biggest names in the world industry, including the American AT&amp;T and Motorola, Germany's Siemens AG, France's Alcatel, Sweden's Ericsson and Fujitsu of Japan. But the dispute over the awarding of contracts for a mobile telephone network highlighted the government's inability to implement policy decisions, and, in this case, to devise a system which competitors could not allege was unfair, corrupt, or arbitrary. DoT officials say lack of funds impedes progress in the sector, not the structure of their monolith organisation. Mr N Vittal, who heads the country's telecom commission, stresses that changes cannot be expected overnight. 'There is a need for transitional management and this calls for a strategic alliance between the government and industry,' he said recently. Foreign companies had often complained that India was doing 'too little, too slowly' in the telecom sector. An executive of a large foreign company which will supply the government with part of a Rs1.5bn switching equipment order said the the size of the market was tempting, 'but we are tired of hanging around Delhi's bureaucracy, waiting for them to make up their minds'. The stringent technical validation tests stipulated by the government took Siemens, Ericsson and Fujitsu several frustrating months to clear. 'What made things worse was that the government refused to specify which of the 40-odd tests we had failed to pass, so we could adjust accordingly,' says the manager of one company left out of the eventual award. But he was optimistic that, with the government's expansion plan under way, there would be further tenders floated for switching equipment. Voicing a common complaint of foreign investors, a telecom executive says: 'There is a stubborn reluctance among bureaucrats to get projects off the ground, even after the red tape has been surmounted, and clearances obtained.' Last year, Motorola threatened to move its Dollars 100m semi-conductor plant project and a telephonic pager company to China. 'But they are still here,' points out an official in the Telecom ministry. 'It's the size of the market and the growth potential we offer that makes it worthwhile for investors, even if sometimes they have to wait.'</p>

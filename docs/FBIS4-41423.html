			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Qoroqi; place and date not given-- </F> recorded]    [Text] The second round of Tajikistan's peace talks which  started on Saturday [18 June] at the Foreign Ministry's  Political and International Studies Department in Tehran is  continuing and the two sides have reached some agreements on a  cease-fire. On how the talks are progressing as well as on the  prospects for peace in Tajikistan, we talked with Shukurjon  Zuhurov and Otahon Latifi, the representatives of the government  and of the opposition, respectively.    Mr. Latifi, please tell us what topics were covered in the  major discussions in recent days and what progress has been made.    [Latifi, speaking in Tajik] The recent discussions  concentrated on the fact that we are searching for peace and  stability in our homeland. Of course, it is very difficult to  achieve reconciliation without talks. As to what the outcomes  will be, the future will tell.    [Qoroqi] It has been said that a temporary cease-fire until  the conclusion of the talks has been agreed on. What is your  opinion on the mechanism for this cease-fire?    [Latifi] A cease-fire mechanism has not yet been proposed.  When it is proposed, it will be discussed with UN experts who  are experienced in this field and it will be endorsed by us.    [Qoroqi] We also interviewed the Tajik Government  representative Shukurjon Zuhurov. Mr. Zuhurov, as the  representative of the Tajik Government at the peace talks, you  have heard what Mr. Latifi had to say. How acceptable do you  think these proposals are for your government?    [Zuhurov, speaking in Tajik] I strongly support what Mr.  Latifi said as far as establishing peace and stability in  Tajikistan as soon as possible is concerned. I would like to  say that today we feel that no one but the Tajiks themselves can  establish peace and stability in our homeland. We can be  assisted. But lasting peace can be established in Tajikistan  only when the Tajiks are reconciled with each other, when  general and national satisfaction is gained, and when the Tajiks  live as one nation in this country.    Thus, the second round of talks started in Iran--in the land  of the people who we feel want to help us very much--and we  started to solve the problems that were listed in the agenda of  our first round of talks in Moscow. And one of the major  problems, as you stated and as was heard in Mr. Latifi's  remarks, was establishing a cease- fire and efforts toward this.  We started discussions on this today and, God willing, we will  reach an outcome.    [Qoroqi] The opposition underlines the need to dissolve the  government and to hold free elections. In your capacity as the  representative of the government, what is your opinion on this?    [Zuhurov] Elections should be free and democratic overall.  If not, they cannot achieve tranquility. We have not yet  discussed how the elections will be held and the participation  of all the people of Tajikistan in the elections. We will try  to speed up these discussions because we have lost a lot of time.</p>

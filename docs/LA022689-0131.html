			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> NEW HOSPITAL PROGRAM TREATS TRAUMA VICTIMS  </P> <P> When she was 14, Lucille began a furtive three-year affair with a family friend  11 years her senior. Now 30, she struggles to maintain relationships and shies  away from socializing. Three weeks ago she swallowed sleeping pills in a  suicide attempt.  </P> <P> Recently terrified by a dream in which she wanted to kill someone, she has  turned for help to an inpatient program for victims of traumatic experiences,  started at Sierra Royale Hospital in Azusa this month. "I want to work the  anger out," said Lucille, who asked that her real name not be used.  </P> <P> The intensive 10- to 21-day program is open to all patients at the 57-bed  psychiatric hospital at no extra cost. Those who are not already in the  hospital can be admitted to the program at a cost of $600 a day, said program  director Donna Mognett.  </P> <P> About 30% of the hospital's patients have been victims of some kind of trauma,  according to Katherine Yont, director of marketing at the hospital.  </P> <P> Many trauma victims can be stabilized by outpatient counseling or through  self-help groups in the community, she said. But there are others who need to  "step away from their lives, be put into a structured program."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Life Skills Training  </P> <P> By Thursday, 35 people had signed up for the program, which caters to victims  recovering from experiences such as auto accidents, rape, incest and physical  abuse. Thirty-three of the patients were already in the hospital, Yont said.  </P> <P> Between group therapy sessions, participants are given training in life skills,  including assertiveness and stress management.  </P> <P> Legal issues are explored with a lawyer, and self-protection classes conducted  as part of the program, which Mognett said offers the first formalized  inpatient approach of its kind in the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> "Full recovery requires intensive work, which opens emotional wounds," said  Mognett, explaining why she felt people with such problems should stay at the  hospital.  </P> <P> Patients identify details of the trauma they are dealing with and confront it  by reliving the experience, an emotional release that is best dealt with under  close supervision, she said.  </P> <P> Patients are encouraged to physically vent their rage at an imagined  perpetrator, sometimes screaming or striking out with a foam-rubber bat,  Mognett said. They are usually exhausted or euphoric afterward, she added.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Victim Needs Support  </P> <P> "The victim is vulnerable, susceptible to irrational behavior, suicidal  attempts and homicidal thoughts, and needs a supportive environment to work  through this process," she said.  </P> <P> One patient said she was more comfortable revealing her feelings because she  felt safe living at the hospital. She was 15 when her mother killed herself,  she said, adding that she still battles "massive" feelings of abandonment.  </P> <P> "I don't have to (undergo therapy) for an hour and then go outside and deal  with the world," she said. Outside, "you can't cry if you feel like crying, or  get angry in the middle of the day."  </P></p>

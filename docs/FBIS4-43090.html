			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou gave a television  interview to Antenna [private radio and television network]  yesterday and referred to the improvement in the climate of  Greek-Turkish and Greek-Albanian relations following the recent  contacts by Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias.    The prime minister said that the government will insist on  the preliminary conditions it has set for lifting the embargo  against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM] but he did not rule out the possibility of the  issue being resolved before this autumn.    Referring to the economy, he ruled out the implementation of  new economic measures until the end of the year and expressed  his optimism in terms of a recovery of the economy.    Finally, Mr. Papandreou said that a government reshuffle  will  take place after the end of the Greek presidency of the European  Union but did not want to talk about his possible move to assume  the presidency of the country.</p>

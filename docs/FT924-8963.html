			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Gardening: A leaf from rich men's books - Robin Lane Fox chooses the grandeur of the arboretum to bid his annual farewell to the trees THIS WEEKEND is our last chance to say goodbye to the trees. In a very few days, they will be a bare tracery of branches, like the pillars of tall cathedrals, reaching for the light. While there is still time, put down your tools, pull on the wellingtons and head for a good arboretum. Arboretums begin as the extended vistas of very rich men: they end as enclosures with signposts and trail stickers and committed men with beards, striding out through mud-tracks with walking-sticks of natural wood. An arboretum's public is not merely keeping its children quiet. It likes picnicking on low round tables, recycled by the local hobbits, or lunching in anoraks and rain hats beside a car-boot which is locked in four-wheel drive. Against the burnished glow of the beech trees, I have seen the picnickers ushering out the season, passing vegetarian pancakes across tables with chairs sunk into the wet grass so that the paper plates are at eye-level. Arboretums have shops, nowadays, like log cabins. If you want a set of badger transfers or a walking-stick of cherry wood with a head carved like a duck, you will find it, this weekend, on sale at an arboretum where the oaks are turning rusty yellow. From May until mid-October, we can usually be happy in our own gardens: then, for a month, we are all better for a tree-park where somebody once spent masses of money. Arboretums are reservations of grandeur and mid-Victorian planting which have finally reached a peak. Among them, you can always find trees of a modest scale, such as Chinese forms of Sorbus with this year's exceptional berries or the yellow and scarlet leaves on the smaller forms of maple. Arboretums make me pine for a deep, less alkaline soil so that Acer Palmatum would grow freely and turn to a brilliant colour in my long grass. Gardeners are sometimes wary of this tree, imagining that all its forms look like the best-known relation, that feathery mound of purple foliage which looks stranded in small front gardens or in the Japanese corners of rockeries planted 100 years ago. Acer Palmatum does not have to be purple at all. The forms with Japanese names are much more subtle, holding tiny leaves in clusters or extending them like long fingers on branches which will often grow no more than 15 ft in a lifetime. My pin-ups are the yellow-leaved forms which are set with airy, narrow leaves and turn to a fiery colour on a slope of roughly-mown grass. Nurseries publicise bigger trees for autumn colour, Malus Bonfire or the more alarming forms of Prunus. Three or four of these fine Acers would go a very long way in gardens of half an acre or more, on the edge of a wood, in an orchard or on a bank beside the drive. Arboretums are also an introduction to new friends as well as a reminder of older attractions. I have just vowed that I must plant a Pterocarya somewhere because its long leaves and straight trunk are so remarkably fine. Its popular name is the Caucasian Wing Nut and in time it makes a very tall tree, upright and always dignified without obscuring too much light. It thrives on soils which also favour walnuts and is seriously underestimated in Britain. The leaves look like huge versions of a common ash, but they are earlier into leaf and much more emphatic. In a big space, a pair of Pterocaryas would be a bold frame at the further end of a long lawn. In an arboretum, these discoveries always happen, from flaming maples to Caucasian Nuts with wings. For me, the arboretum experience has a further dimension: time, and a humbling awareness of past years. Like the temple gardens of the pre-Christian world, these rich men's parks house trees of exceptional straightness, age and stature. To some eyes, they may seem to be a warning. If a Tulip Tree will grow 100 ft high in a 100 years' time, should we not hesitate before planting one in our own more modest gardens? These warnings pass me by, so long as the roots of the tree will not unsettle nearby buildings. You and I will not be here 100 years hence and meanwhile, a Tulip Tree will give us years of pleasure. If it is too tall for posterity, they can always cut it down. No doubt they will be less hung up about 'heritage', to judge from the legacy which we are parcelling up for them. Last weekend, I looked upwards into an ancient case in point. Above me, on millionaire's ground, towered a tremendous Thuja Plicata, planted in the Victorian past and left to soar upwards to a height of 70 ft or more. On the lower branches, a few feathery leaves lay thinly: would any unwary visitor assume that this enormous tree could be used as an evergreen hedge, responsive to clipping and feeding in any moderate garden? Chastened by its age, I had a vision of the clipped hedges of my childhood growing on into forests as their clipping ceased. These sights make you feel extremely small, until you turn round and there behind you are visitors in deer-stalker hats, trying to feed the grey squirrels and romanticise the hungry rabbits.</p>

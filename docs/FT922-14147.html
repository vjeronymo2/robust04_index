			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Northrop considers joining LTV bid NORTHROP, the US military aircraft maker, may join with Carlyle Group in bidding for LTV's aircraft division, Reuter reports from New York. LTV, the US steel and defence company, has been under bankruptcy protection for the past five years. Carlyle, an investment firm run by Mr Frank Carlucci, the former US secretary of defence, is part of one of two bidding groups for the LTV aircraft and missile business. Its bidding partner is Thomson-CSF, the French state-controlled defence company. Northrop was unavailable to comment on the possible bid for the aircraft division. A source said Northrop would not be a 50-50 partner in the division but that it would have a role in running the business if the Thomson-Carlyle bid succeeds. As part of the joint offer, Thomson is offering Dollars 280m cash for the LTV missile business. Carlyle has offered Dollars 90m cash plus Dollars 30m in securities for the aircraft business. Northrop is believed to be considering a way to help enhance the securities portion of the offer. The Thomson-Carlyle bid rivals a Dollars 355m offer by Vought, a joint venture formed by the US defence groups Martin Marietta and Lockheed.</p>

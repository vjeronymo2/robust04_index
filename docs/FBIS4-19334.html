			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "P2 Masonic Lodge Leaders Cleared of </F> Subversion"]    [Excerpts] (ANSA) Rome, April 16 -- Leaders of the  Propaganda Due (P2) masonic lodge, outlawed by an act of  parliament in 1982, were cleared of political subversion charges  by the Rome assises court Saturday [16 April].    The secret lodge's venerable grand master Licio Gelli was  sentenced to 17 years in prison for related crimes, while  General Gianadelio Maletti, a former top official at the  disbanded SID [Defense Intelligence Service] secret services,  got 14 years. Both men were given five-year reductions on their  terms.    The court's verdict came after four days in camera, and  after  Gelli failed to turn up for a promised statement to the court.  According to the prosecution, in the 1970s and early '80s, Gelli  managed to build up control over a large section of the press,  over one part of the magistrature, and over the intelligence  services in their entirety.    During those years, the prosecution told the court, P2 "was  a  criminal association aimed at committing many acts of espionage,  and of violation of secrets pertaining to national security. An  association aimed at changing the constitution by illicit means,  and at disturbing the work and prerogatives of the government  and parliament." Gelli's influence over the magistrature was  said to have been exerted through large financial contributions  to the conservative Magistratura Indipendente (Independent  Magistrature) group. Through influence at the very top of the  secret services he succeeded in installing himself more or less  as the country's intelligence chief, the prosecution alleged.    A hold over the press was achieved with the help of banker  Roberto Calvi who bought a controlling stake in the Rizzoli  publishing group which then began a campaign to buy up  newspapers. "This hold over press sources," said the  prosecution, "led to an immediate connection with political  interests, and each of those papers was a point of reference for  local political cells." [passage omitted]    Today's sentence handed down on Gelli was for counts of  perjury, possession of secret state documents, and sums paid to  Milan magistrates investigating the collapse of Calvi's Banco  Ambrosiano in 1982.    Unlike the other 12 people in the dock, Gelli was not tried  on conspiracy charges because authorities in Switzerland, from  where he was extradited to stand trial in Italy, refused to hand  him over for this charge. Other sentences handed out today  varied from two years and six months to 13 years and six months.  [Gelli's assistant] Umberto Ortolani was acquitted.    "If ever there was an association whose aim was to condition  (public life), that was the P2," commented Public Prosecutor  Elisabetta Cesqui, pointing out that the sentence claims the  secret lodge was "not an association to commit crime." Cesqui  added that she would have to see the motivation of the sentence  before making a final assessment, but judicial sources said she  will almost certainly take the case to the appeals court.    In her final address, the public prosecutor, who asked for  13  and a half years against Gelli, 10 against Ortolani and a total  of 69 for the other 11 defendants, argued that the P2 served as  an association to commit acts of espionage and the violation of  official secrets of importance to national security with the aim  of "modifying the Constitution by illegal means." Much the same  conclusions were drawn by the parliamentary enquiry whose  findings in 1982 led to the P2's banning in late 1982.    "I am horrified," commented Left Democrat Party Secretary  Achille Occhetto of the sentence. "Incredibly enough, years of  serious work by the parliamentary committee of inquiry into the  P2 of which I was a member have been cancelled. Faced by this  small sentence, we fortunately have many volumes of documents at  Parliament showing exactly the opposite." [passage omitted]</p>

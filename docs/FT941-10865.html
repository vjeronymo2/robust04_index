			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Sarajevo deaths revive debate over response The latest atrocity in Sarajevo, in which 68 people were killed by a mortar bomb in a city-centre market, has revived the long-running debate over the appropriate response to such an outrage. The United Nations has not yet been able to provide proof that the Bosnian Serbs, the widely presumed perpetrators of the tragedy, were responsible and US President Bill Clinton has pointed out that any retaliatory action should be based on such evidence. But if it is established that the Bosnian Serbs were responsible, it is still a matter of disagreement what the international response should be. With any action by UN ground troops, other than in self-defence, ruled out in advance - not least because they are far too weak to undertake such a task - western governments appear to be swinging in favour of air strikes against Bosnian Serb artillery positions overlooking Sarajevo. That would salve the consciences of western governments which have shown themselves powerless to stop the slaughter in Bosnia by peaceful means or verbal threats. It would also do something to restore the credibility of Nato, which has failed so far to carry out repeated threats to strike back at the Serbs if they did not end their 'strangulation' of Sarajevo. Possibly, air strikes could help to bring the Bosnian Serbs to their senses and persuade them to make a bigger effort to reach a peace settlement with the Moslems. But that is very much an outside chance. A more likely result would be a renewed offensive by the Serbs. They would probably redeploy their artillery around the Bosnian capital, retaliate against the thousands of UN peace-keeping troops in Bosnia - mainly French, British, Canadian, Spanish and Dutch - and force their withdrawal from Bosnia. as many politicians are already demanding. The inevitable result would be that UN aid convoys would be deprived of their military escorts and that their operations might have to be suspended altogether, threatening hundreds of thousands of Bosnians with starvation and death from cold. A decision to launch air strikes is also likely to break the international consensus on Bosnia, since it does not look as if it would gain Russian support in the UN Security Council. Under great pressure from Russian nationalists, such as Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, President Boris Yeltsin would find it very difficult to endorse armed action against Russia's traditional Slav allies, such as Bosnia's Serbs. Air strikes, as the new US defence secretary, Mr William Perry, has pointed out, could only be the first act. After the initial shock, it would still be necessary to reach a political settlement, for which prospects would not necessarily have been improved by international military intervention.</p>

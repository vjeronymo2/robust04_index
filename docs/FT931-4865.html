			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Domestic &amp; General rides the recession SLUGGISH SALES on the high street failed to restrict growth at Domestic &amp; General. The USM-traded specialist domestic appliance breakdown insurer yesterday reported a 26 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.43m (Pounds 2.73m) for the six months to end-December. D&amp;G, in which Eagle Star, the composite insurer, has a 10 per cent stake, lifted the interim dividend by 25 per cent to 7.5p. Earnings per share were also ahead 26 per cent, to 33.55p. Mr Howard James, managing director, said that the group intended to continue its expansion in the UK, where it has established marketing agreements with leading manufacturers such as Zanussi, Grundig and Electrolux and retailers such as Selfridges and Comet to sell its policies. He said that most of the group's recent growth reflected an increase in the overall size of the market for domestic appliance insurance. Even so D&amp;G is beginning to target markets in Europe. It is authorised to underwrite in France and has recently reached agreement with Plus Ultra, a subsidiary of Norwich Union, to sell policies in Spain. Gross premiums increased 23 per cent to Pounds 26.2m (Pounds 21.4m). Other income was up 22 per cent to Pounds 265,000 (Pounds 217,000). Underwriting profits amounted to Pounds 6.14m (Pounds 5.13m). Expenses rose to Pounds 5.55m (Pounds 5.22m). Net investment income was up 8.9 per cent to Pounds 2.86m (Pounds 2.63m), despite lower interest rates.</p>

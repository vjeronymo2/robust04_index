			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ole Bang Nielsen report: "EU Attempts Once Again To </F> Resolve Problems Concerning Enlargement -- Fish and Votes"]    [Text] Brussels -- Today, the EU [European Union] countries  will make a renewed attempt to reach an agreement with Norway  regarding its accession to the EU. At the same time, unity must  be obtained regarding the future size of the blocking minority  in the EU Council of Ministers.    Most people continue to believe that it will succeed.  However, in the run-up to a meeting between EU foreign  ministers today there has been considerable uncertainty as to  whether the EU can untangle the two knots that are continuing to  block enlargement of the Union to include Sweden, Finland,  Austria, and Norway as from 1 January next year.    The first knot, the fisheries dispute with Norway, appears  to  be the easiest to untangle. When the negotiations with Norway  were broken off last week, it was -- after all -- just cod worth  less than 40 million kroner that separated Norway from reaching  an agreement on accession to the EU of the kind already secured  by Sweden, Finland, and Austria.  <H5>  "Historical" Fish </H5>   The key issue continues to be Spain's demand that Norway  return Spain's "historical" fish. Until 1981, Spain had fishing  rights in Norwegian waters, and Spain is now demanding a quota  of cod from Norway if Norway accedes to the EU. Meanwhile, the  Norwegians are refusing to hand over a single fish.    A solution to the dispute lies in so-called paper fish,  whereby Spain would be given a share of the expected growth in  Norwegian cod resources, as calculated by marine biologists --  on paper, at least. That would satisfy Spain's demand for  Norwegian fish, while the Norwegian Government would be able to  say that it had not relinquished any of Norway's current  resources of fish.    A second possibility would be for the EU countries to buy a  cod quota for Spain from a third country, e.g., Russia or  Canada. However, this solution is not regarded as satisfactory  by Spain, which -- for reasons to do with its national  psychology -- is demanding that Norwegian cod be served at its  table.  <H5>  Knot Number Two </H5>   In any case, an acceptable solution for Spain in the  confrontation with Norway is still a precondition for being able  to untangle knot number two in the enlargement process, namely  the question as to how big the so-called blocking minority in  the EU Council of Ministers will be.    Here, too, it is Spain that is proving uncooperative by  refusing to allow the threshold for a blocking minority in the  Council of Ministers to be extended from 23 out of 76 votes to  27 out of 90 votes in the context of Norwegian, Swedish,  Finnish, and Austrian accession. However, Spain is being  strongly backed by the United Kingdom, both countries -- being  relatively large EU countries -- fearing that they will lose  their capability of blocking EU legislation if the threshold for  the blocking minority is not kept at 23. The United Kingdom has  10 votes and Spain has eight in the EU Council of Ministers.  Italy has also periodically flirted with the idea of supporting  this attitude.    Meanwhile, Germany, France, and the smaller EU countries are  insisting that the threshold for the blocking minority in the  Council of Ministers be adjusted in the context of EU  enlargement, so that it continues to represent 30 percent of the  total number of votes, as is currently the case.  <H5>  German Press </H5>   Germany is also expected to exert great pressure on Spain  and  the United Kingdom today with a view to moving them to drop  their minority view regarding the number of votes. Otherwise  there is a risk that the entire enlargement of the EU will be  delayed when the European Parliament in Strasbourg refuses to  approve an agreement based on the Hispanic-British model.    Spain is expected to cave in to economic pressure to  relinquish its attitude, partly as a result of the country  receiving a good fisheries agreement with Norway, and partly as  a result of Germany -- as the "treasurer" of the EU -- coming up  with ill-hidden allusions to the renegotiation of EU policy on  subsidies for Mediterranean agriculture, which will take place  later this year, where Spain stands to win -- or lose -- large  amounts of funding.    The resistance by the British is of a more political,  principle-based character.    However, as THE FINANCIAL TIMES, among others, pointed out  in  an editorial, the United Kingdom has a fundamental interest in  seeing Austria and the Nordic countries join the Union.    At the same time, Prime Minister John Major will not gain  any  ground over the Euroskeptic right wing of his Conservative party  by driving the conflict further toward a possible extra EU  summit meeting, at which the British would in any case be forced  to give way, the newspaper points out. According to the  FINANCIAL TIMES, "stupid Albion," as the paper calls the United  Kingdom, using a paraphrase of a former French insult referring  to the British, has certainly made a fool of itself on this  issue.</p>

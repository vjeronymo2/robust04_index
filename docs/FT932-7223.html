			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Personal View: Portillo risks targeting his own foot Targeting welfare benefits is again in fashion for the UK government in its search for cost savings. Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, has floated the idea as part of the current review of public spending. Political pundits declare its inevitability. Even the Labour party's Commission on Social Justice is giving it serious consideration. The argument is simple. Public spending is out of control, largely because of the expense of universal benefits; and universal benefits by their very nature go to the middle class, who do not need them. Targeting would enable welfare spending to be cut, thus relieving the pressure on the public purse while not hurting those really in need. But research by the welfare state programme at the London School of Economics, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, suggests that all these claims have to be treated carefully. It is true that welfare spending is at an historical high with respect to gross national product - 26 per cent in 1992-93. But this is in part a consequence of the recession, which both raises spending, through its impact on unemployment, and lowers GNP. If the green shoots of recovery are indeed appearing, then the crisis will melt away with the recessionary snows. It is also true that the middle class benefit extensively from parts of the welfare state. In some areas this involves large subsidies that are difficult to defend - for instance, the use by the middle class of the higher education system far outweighs any contribution they might make in terms of taxation. But in other cases the situation is not so simple. For the welfare state is not only, or largely, a Robin Hood device for taking from the rich to give to the poor. Rather it takes tax payments from people at one stage in their lives and, in return, pays benefits to them at another. We estimate that over their lifetimes people pay for between two-thirds and three-quarters of the benefits they receive from social security, education and health. Hence the welfare state is acting as a 'savings bank', smoothing the flow of resources for the same individuals over the life cycle. The welfare state is not a real savings bank in the sense that people get out the actual money that they have put in. Instead, today's workers pay for today's welfare beneficiaries. But they only do so because there is an understanding - an implicit contract - that they will be looked after if and when the need arises. If the welfare state is altered at this point, large numbers of people will feel the contract has been broken - that they have paid into something from which they will not themselves benefit. Moreover, even if any savings due to targeting are fed back to the losers through tax cuts, it is far from clear that they will end up being better off. Those who lose eligibility for benefits will be forced to make insurance provision for themselves, provision that may be more expensive and less flexible. Due to the costs of marketing, the payment of sales commissions and so on, the administrative costs of private welfare are much higher than for state welfare. And the market may fail altogether to offer some kinds of protection, such as insurance against unemployment. There is a further complication. Part of the welfare state does act as Robin Hood and does indeed take from the lifetime rich and give to the lifetime poor. It also redistributes between the sexes. Overwhelmingly, over their lifetimes women are net gainers from the welfare state, receiving an amount equivalent to the value of a good-sized house in a nice part of the country. This is largely because of the impact of universal benefits such as child benefit and the state earnings-related pension scheme. Removing them or cutting them would benefit men at women's expense. As Mr Portillo has found out, on this issue even putting a toe in the water has serious political risks. Targeting offends many powerful groups. Moreover, in many areas it is difficult to justify on more objective grounds. Political parties should be very careful before they plunge into this particular pool. Finally, it should be remembered that the current 'crisis' is in large part the government's own creation. In the run-up to the 1992 election, it sharply increased public expenditure on welfare. Spending on health, education, housing, personal social services and social security went up by more than 14 per cent between 1990-91 and 1992-93, far more than could be justified by recessionary pressure. All governments follow the electoral cycle, but they need to be sensitive as to whom they make pay for it when the election is over.

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Observer: Reserved plaice Harry Ramsden's fish and chip restaurant has as many working class credentials as Blackpool itself, so no surprise that it's proving popular with the Trades Union Congress. So popular is it that John Monks, TUC general secretary, made straight for it when taking a late supper on the eve of the conference. Sad to relate, Monks and Brendan Barber, his number two, were shown the door - because the restaurant had closed. Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, had managed to squeeze in earlier. Scargill may no longer be a big fish in the union pond; but he can still organise a plate of chips.</p>

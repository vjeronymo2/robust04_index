			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Markets Report: EU talk helps D-Mark The weak dollar and renewed focus on the outlook for European monetary union yesterday boosted the D-Mark, writes Philip Gawith. Recent discussion about a multi-tier Europe, the meeting of the EU monetary committee, and comments from senior politicians and bankers, all encouraged investors to switch from other European currencies to the D-Mark. The German currency closed in London at L1,016 against the Italian lira, from L1,011, and at FFr3.428, from FFr3.426, against the French franc. The dollar was also a victim of the D-Mark, showing no sign of bucking its recent weakness. It closed a pfennig lower in London at DM1.5426, from DM1.5537. Against the yen it finished at Y98.695 from Y99.25. In New York it ended trading at DM1.5438 and Y98.65. The Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey of the economy provided no support for the dollar, in spite of showing an acceleration of the economic recovery. Some analysts had predicted that economic growth would help the dollar, by curbing Japan's trade and current account surpluses. Sterling finished 1 1/2 pfennigs down at DM2.3904, but was firmer against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5496 from Dollars 1.5481. Analysts said the events of the past few days had reminded the market that, at least among the political classes, the idea of European monetary union was still alive. The EU monetary committee yesterday discussed a European Commission report recommending that 10 out of 12 member states take action to put their finances in order. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, addressed the German parliament on the same issue, telling members that Germany would ensure that the Maastricht treaty's provisions on financial discipline 'are strictly observed'. Mr Tim Stewart, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley, commented: 'This has highlighted the pressure on second tier countries to tow the line on policy. Markets are starting to tier currencies and assets, punishing countries which do not adopt convergent economic policies.' Analysts said talk about a multi-speed Europe had reinstilled confidence in the core currencies. The concern is that countries which drop out of the core will be under less pressure to pursue virtuous economic policies. One interesting development outside of the EU was the announcement by Ann Wibble, the Swedish finance minister, that her Liberal party would join a coalition with right or left-wing parties in order to ensure a majority government. The Swedish krona lost ground on Monday when opinion polls suggested that the opposition SDP might not win an outright majority in the September 18 elections, as previously suggested. Mr Stewart, however, sugg-ested that the prospect of an SDP in alliance with a centrist party like the Liberals was probably preferable to it winning an outright majority. 'It would take some of the heat off the SDP in terms of dealing with the left of their own party,' he said. The tankan report sent a clear message that the Japanese economy is recovering quite rapidly. The key diffusion index rose to -39 from -50 in the second quarter. This was better than Japanese companies themselves had predicted three months ago, suggesting a quicker than anticipated pick-up in demand. Mr Graham Turner, economist at Tokai Bank Europe, said the survey showed the Japanese economy was 'withstanding Y99 very well'. He added that the quicker than expected pick-up in world economic growth, which had helped Japanese exports, was a key engine of the upturn. Mr Turner was sceptical about whether higher economic growth would curb Japan's trade surplus. To the contrary, he said Japan's exports were increasing across the board and forecast a 'quite dramatic' rise in Japan's bilateral surplus with the US over the next 12 months. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade negotiator, will hold talks today and tomorrow with Japanese ministers, but Mr Turner is sceptical as to whether these can help the dollar. 'Trade imbalances laid the foundation for the trade talks and they are far more important than the talks.' Markets in the UK will be on alert in the next few days for any interest rate move arising from today's monthly monetary meeting. The balance of opinion has shifted away from an early policy tightening, reflected in money market rates, which have barely moved in recent weeks. Three-month sterling LIBOR continued to trade at 5 1/2 per cent. In the futures markets, September and December short sterling contracts benefited from the 'convergence argument' - that futures market rates must converge on cash rates, as contracts near expiry. The September contract closed at 94.34 from 94.32. The contract expires on September 21. Weaker gilt prices depressed the longer dated contracts. In its daily money market operations the Bank of England cleared a Pounds 400m shortage by providing Pounds 424m liquidity at established rates.</p>

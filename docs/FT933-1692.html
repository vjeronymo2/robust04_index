			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Downey quits as head of investors' watchdog SIR Gordon Downey, chairman of the Personal Investment Authority, resigned abruptly yesterday from the proposed self-regulatory body following regulators' criticism that he was unable to restrain industry interests on the board. He has been replaced by Mr Joe Palmer, a board member of the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, and a former chairman of the Association of British Insurers. Industry officials said Sir Gordon's departure followed growing concern at the SIB that the PIA board had been too willing to concede to powerful interests in drafting its operating guidelines. As a result, regulators feared that the authority's board had been plagued by in-fighting, delaying the completion of its proposed rulebook. Mr Andrew Large, SIB chief executive, has said that creation of the authority is central to his plans for enhancing investor protection. He has also said the SIB will not approve the authority unless it draws up tougher rules. In a letter to Mr Large yesterday, Sir Gordon said he was resigning because good progress had been made at the PIA and 'I do not see myself continuing into the operational phase.' He also said he expected the authority's board to be re-constructed. Sir Gordon, a former senior Treasury civil servant, had been chairman of Fimbra, the self-regulatory body for independent financial advisers. From the time he was appointed last year, he had been seen as too close to that sector of the industry. Also, board members said he had not faced down officials from the life insurance industry who wished to influence the authority's rulebook. Mr Palmer, 62, was group chief executive at life insurer Legal and General. Mr Large said Mr Palmer had supported his efforts to improve protection for retail investors, and had endorsed a letter to Sir Gordon last December in which tough requirements for the PIA were spelled out.</p>

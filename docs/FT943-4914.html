			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / PM's patience runs out after 'secret deals' row at No 10 Mr John Major yesterday ordered Mr Ian Paisley to leave the Cabinet room after the leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party refused to accept the prime minister's assurances on the Ulster peace process. The confrontation happened as Mr Paisley, accompanied by the DUP's two other MPs, tried to read a long statement condemning 'a concentrated attempt to move us ratchet by ratchet out of the United Kingdom'. Three times Mr Major interrupted Mr Paisley and demanded to know whether the DUP leader accepted his word that no secret deals had been done with the IRA. When Mr Paisley declined to answer, the prime minister ended the meeting and told the DUP delegation to leave. The meeting was always likely to be theatrical, given the need for both Mr Major and Mr Paisley to make their points, but it descended into farce when Mr Paisley ignored the prime minister and insisted on delivering the rest of his statement. As he read on, Mr Major left the room with Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister of state. Outside Downing Street, Mr Paisley claimed the prime minister had shouted at him as he tried to deliver his statement, and ended by ordering the DUP delegation to 'get out of this room. Never come back until you're prepared to say I speak the truth and do not tell lies.' Mr Paisley added: 'His language was disgraceful. He thought that he would stir enmity in our hearts, but the anger was in his heart. The shouting was on his part - we remained silent and heard him out.' British ministers and officials told a different story. Sir Patrick said Mr Major 'saw no purpose whatsoever in answering questions that Mr Paisley had put, or indeed any questions put by somebody who declined to accept the word of the British prime minister'. Mr Ancram said that Mr Major had been 'quiet and polite'. But he said the prime minister would not meet Mr Paisley unless the DUP leader backed down. 'If there is to be another meeting, the same assurances will be required of Mr Paisley,' Mr Ancram said. British officials said the prime minister decided to take a stand over his government's integrity after Mr Paisley accused him of lying in a broadcast interview. Downing Street hopes the confrontation will reinforce the government's credibility with moderate Northern Ireland unionists, whose support is crucial to the peace process. The brusque treatment of Mr Paisley is also designed to shore up support for Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionist party, which has so far gone along with the government's approach. Dr John Alderdice, leader of the non-sectarian Alliance party, praised Mr Major for standing up to Mr Paisley. 'Previous British governments have backed off and thought it better to appease the man, but Mr Major has simply run out of patience,' he said. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, said he would welcome a meeting with Mr Paisley.</p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Arts: Beethoven rolls over for King's - Promenade Concerts The tradition whereby the penultimate night of the Proms was given over to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony seems well and truly broken. It has to be right that other composers occupy this prestigious date and the choice fell this year on two of England's finest, Byrd and Purcell. It also - surprisingly - marked the first ever appearance at the Proms by the Choir of King's College, Cambridge. One venerable English institution meets another, the choir being the more venerable by some centuries as it dates back to the time of Henry VI. (Interesting to note that the residential choir school at King's and the Royal Albert Hall both date from the 1870s, when the Victorian patronage of music was at its height.) There is a point to this historical background. For decades after the war, and even longer before, it was the cathedral and college choirs of Britain that kept the flame burning for the sacred music of composers like Byrd and Purcell. But no more: small, fully professional choirs, such as the Tallis Scholars and the Sixteen, have risen to dominance in this repertoire, particularly in recordings. To hear the King's choir again at Friday's Prom in a selection of Byrd's early Latin pieces came as quite a surprise, not necessarily an unpleasant one. The traditional college sound (sweet treble tone, youthful light basses) is not as focused or concentrated as the professional groups, but it has a natural feel to it. Byrd is hardly likely to have heard his music sung by bands of hand-picked, well-drilled, potential soloists. Under the direction of Stephen Cleobury, its director of music, the choir gave mostly tidy and sensitive performances of the Byrd and Purcell's Come, ye sons of art. The King's style has never involved much digging for expression and its Purcell was on the wan side, light, stylish, agreeable on the surface, but needing a bit more straightforward punch. Of the soloists, Stephen Varcoe bit into his words with most determination. In between, London Baroque under Charles Medlam played Handel's Concerto Grosso Op. 6 No. 6 and accompanied the soprano Lynne Dawson in his motet Silete venti - well contrasted pieces, which gave a relatively long programme plenty of variety. Beethoven was not missed.</p>

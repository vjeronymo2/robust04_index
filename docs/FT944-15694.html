			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: London Last week's subdued inflation figures enabled the gilts market to continue its recent rally, so traders are braced for some profit-taking this week. The most important statistic of the week is probably Friday's first estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product growth. Most economists expect the recovery to have slowed down from the second quarter, but Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International (Europe), is plumping for a quarter-on-quarter rise of 1 per cent. He believes that this should not worry the gilt market, if growth is seen to be coming largely from exports. Indications of the strength of consumer demand will come from the Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey - out tomorrow - and Thursday's retail sales. The Bank of England will publish details of its coming auction tomorrow, with many traders expecting a five-year stock. The Bank took advantage of market strength to make two tap stock issues last week, and it was able to announce there would be no need for a November auction. Unless the numbers are particularly bad, it is not expected that tomorrow's public sector borrowing requirement figures for September will move the market, given the general consensus that the deficit is gradually falling.</p>

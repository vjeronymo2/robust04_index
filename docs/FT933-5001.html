			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Observer: Sole of discretion While most of Asil Nadir's personal effects went under the hammer at Christie's last month, a rather less public tender of his wardrobe has also been in progress, arranged by auctioneers Edward Symmons &amp; Partners. From the catalogue, it would appear that Nadir's waistline was almost as volatile as the price of Polly Peck shares, with suits ranging from 34 to 38-inch waist to be disposed of. More intriguing, however, is the collection of shoes, mostly size 10, but one pair size 9 and one size 12. Would that Hush Puppies could speak.</p>

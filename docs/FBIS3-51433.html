			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Colonia de Sacramento, Uruguay, 17 Jan (EFE) -- The  presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay today  agreed to integrate Bolivia as an observer country in all the  meetings of the work subgroups of the Common Market of the South  (Mercosur).    The decision was made during the fifth Mercosur summit,  which  ended in the city of Colonia, after a formal petition made by  Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada.    Presidents Carlos Menem of Argentina, Itamar Franco of  Brazil, Juan Carlos Wasmosy of Paraguay, and Luis Alberto  Lacalle of Uruguay issued a public declaration expressing their  satisfaction with the Bolivian Government's desire to extend and  strengthen its ties with Mercosur.    The declaration states: "They thus considered it appropriate  to respond to Bolivia's petition by inviting its representatives  to participate, as observers, in the meetings of the work  subgroups."    The presidents also state that "within the framework of  Bolivia's petition, agreements with Bolivia will be prioritized  with the perspective of its future total participation in  Mercosur."    President Sanchez de Losada attended the summit as an  observer and in his speech he stressed his country's interest in  Mercosur without forgetting other integration agreements Bolivia  has signed.    Technically, Bolivia cannot join Mercosur because it already  belongs to the Andean Pact, but it can associate with it through  a free market system.    The Bolivian president said before his colleagues that "we  must recognize that we have failed" in Latin American  integration "given the lack of political will to eliminate  borders that are presently more in the minds of our countries'  leaders than in geography."    Sanchez de Losada added: "Our peoples have always considered  themselves brothers and sisters within a great Latin American  family. In this process of attaining an ideal, we have fallen  and risen many times, but we are learning."    "With past experience and the demands of our current times,  we Latin Americans are taking more seriously the challenge of  integration, and Mercosur is proof of this," he added.    "We Bolivians are convinced that efforts like Mercosur, the  Andean Pact, and the Group of Three have the common objective of  making progress toward a greater and broader integration," he  stated.    Sanchez de Losada concluded by saying: "Bolivia plays a role  in this process by being a point in common and a contact among  regional groups. We are willing to play the role that  corresponds to us given our continental vocation, our deep  integrationist will, and our presence in the River Plate,  Andean, Amazon, Pacific, and Atlantic areas."</p>

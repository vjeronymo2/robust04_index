			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: S. African equities weaken THE fall in South African equities slowed yesterday, in the wake of the 2.8 per cent fall in the overall index on Monday, John Pitt writes. However, some analysts said that the trend was still downward and forecast that prices could lose a further 10 to 15 per cent in the fourth quarter. Gold shares, which had been boosted by a weak financial rand on Monday, lost ground as the quarterly reporting session began with publication of interim figures from Gold Fields. The gold index lost 7 to 895. The overall index fell 10 to 3,103 while industrials shed 15 to 4,088. The announcement by De Beers that it was considering retrenchment at its local mining operations because of the depressed state of the diamond market took the shares to an intraday low of R47.50. Late bargain hunting lifted the price to R48.25 for a gain of 40 cents, but the share price was still 48 per cent below its level six months ago. Some brokers remain sellers of the stock, because 1992 sales are likely to be the lowest for five years.</p>

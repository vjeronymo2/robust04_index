			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Ares-Serono suffers 39% decline Ares-Serono, the Geneva-based biotechnology drugs group, has reported another sharp fall in profits in the second quarter. Net income from continuing operations fell 39 per cent to Dollars 14.4m. The group, which develops hormones for stimulating human fertility and beta interferon-based drugs for multiple sclerosis and other diseases, has continued to step up its research and development spending in spite of weaker overall sales. Sales in the second quarter were down 3 per cent to Dollars 168.2m, as a 50 per cent slide in sales in Italy offset substantial gains elsewhere. Italy accounts for about a fifth of group sales, and a few important Ares products have been removed from the list of those the government will pay for. Meanwhile, R&amp;D spending jumped 38.6 per cent in the second quarter to Dollars 37.3m. In the first half, sales were down 5 per cent to Dollars 314.7m and net income from continuing operations tumbled a third to Dollars 28.05m. The group took a Dollars 9.6m charge on the sale of its diagnostics division in the second quarter.</p>

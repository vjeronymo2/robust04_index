The minister of state for  external affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, informed the Rajya Sabha in a  written reply that New Delhi has apprised the international  community of Pakistan's role in these activities. He termed  this approach by Pakistan as totally unacceptable and in  violation of the Simla agreement and universally accepted norms  of international conduct.    The Lok Sabha was told that there has been an increase in  firings by the Pakistani troops at Indian posts in the Uri,  Punch, and Rajaori sectors during the past few months. The  minister of state for defense, Mr. Mallikarjun, told the house  in a written reply that all such developments are carefully  assessed and appropriate and timely steps taken. He told the  members that our troops are fully prepared to meet any  eventuality.</p>

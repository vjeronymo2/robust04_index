			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE : LEVIN GIVES NEW LEASE ON LIFE TO LANDMARKS  </P> <P> When architect Myron Hunt died in 1952, he left behind a 50-year-old legacy of  landmarks including the Pasadena Rose Bowl, the Ambassador Hotel, the  Huntington Library and master plans for three local colleges. The work of the  New England-born architect bore a reticence and honesty that, one historian  says, made him appear as a puritan in the architectural Babylon of Southern  California.  </P> <P> Many of his elegant designs have recently been renovated. But others, like the  Ambassador Hotel, are threatened with destruction.  </P> <P> "As L.A. runs out of unbuilt space we have to think hard about recycling what  we have for economic and aesthetic reasons," architect Brenda Levin said. "Now  there is a new appreciation of saving buildings to form a new urban identity  out of the old and the new."  </P> <P> Levin leads the field in the increasingly important movement to renovate and  recycle Los Angeles' architectural heritage. Her landmark restorations,  including the Wiltern Theater on Wilshire Boulevard and the downtown Oviatt  Building, have won a number of historic preservation awards. She has also  renovated two historic L.A. markets, the Grand Central on Broadway and the  Chapman on 6th Street.  </P> <P> But two recently completed projects illustrate the breadth of Levin's talent in  giving new life to old buildings.  </P> <P> At the high end of the architectural spectrum is her renovation of architect  Myron Hunt's 1938 Thorne Hall at Occidental College. The low end is represented  by Levin's skillful adaptation of an old downtown warehouse into a residential  hotel and day-care center for homeless women.  </P> <P> Levin's $2.1-million renovation of Thorne Hall gave her challenges typically  faced by designers striving to renovate historic buildings without compromising  their classic character.  </P> <P> "Thorne Hall is one of Hunt's purest Palladian buildings," she explained. "Its  beautiful Beaux Arts colonnade closes the western end of the main campus axis,  and gives it its great sense of calm. I had to try and modernize the hall's  interior without cheapening its relationship to the dignity of its exterior."  </P> <P> Hunt linked Thorne Hall's landscaped forecourt, monumental porch and wide lobby  to the shoebox-shaped auditorium within, culminating in the proscenium stage at  the far end. Altering the character of any part of this progression could  easily have destroyed the unity of the design.  </P> <P> "The basic problem was acoustical," Levin explained. "The hall's sound quality,  designed in an age when the science of acoustics was as yet unborn, simply  didn't measure up to the demands of a modern orchestra and an audience attuned  to hi-fi stereo recordings." To create a better acoustical environment, Levin  devised an "eyebrow" of sound baffles that projects out over the proscenium  apron to bounce the music out to the 900 seats.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Daring Departure  </P> <P> Levin's one daring departure from Hunt's architectural reticence is a vividly  colored carpet, that flows from the lobby down the aisles like a spill of  painted flowers.  </P> <P> Levin argued that Thorne Hall's auditorium, with its dark-stained wooden  wainscotting and matching ceiling, "seemed a little somber for modern tastes. I  felt an element of flamboyance was needed, to perk up the atmosphere. In Hunt's  sober context the carpet may startle you at first, but I think it gives the eye  a needed shock."  </P> <P> Carl Vance, an Occidental College vice president, said the faculty was very  pleased with Levin's Thorne Hall renovation.  </P> <P> "We admired Brenda's subtlety in dealing with a historic building," he said.  "She was assured, caring, but not intimidated. She knew what needed to be done,  and carried it out with a sure and sensitive hand."  </P> <P> The conversion of a three-story commercial building on Skid Row into a  residential hotel for homeless women presented Levin with a very different  challenge.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shelter From the Hard Life  </P> <P> The Downtown Women's Center on Los Angeles Street provides small self-contained  apartments for 48 women seeking shelter from the hard life of the streets. In  addition, a new day-care annex designed by Levin serves another 50-60 women  daily with a place to shelter, shower, have a hot meal, do laundry and catch a  few hours of safe sleep.  </P> <P> The day-care annex, with its lively color-tiled exterior walls, leaps out like  a sign of life in the shabby and dangerous district. Its architecture is tough  but playful, offering an oasis of hope for homeless women who often find  themselves the ultimate victims in the vicious Skid Row pecking order.  </P> <P> "We get women in here who are really tortured, by street criminals and their  own private hallucinations," said Jill Halverson, founder and director of the  Downtown Women's Center. "It's important our tenants feel secure at all times  within the building, given the violence of the surroundings."  </P> <P> Her success with historic restoration and architectural recycling has brought  Levin respect, but it has also typecast her practice. She feels increasingly  confined by the label of "restoration architect."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Branded a Preservationist'  </P> <P> "To some extent I've been branded as a preservationist," she said. "That's made  it hard to crossover into the realm of new architecture with no recycling  component -- but it's beginning to happen, thank God!"  </P> <P> Two projects currently on Levin's drafting tables represent a major shift  toward non-preservation design.  </P> <P> The Pasadena Civic Center West development, a mixed-use project including  shops, offices and apartments facing the historic Pasadena City Hall, will  match the architecture of its neighbors without aping their style. A totally  modern Levin design is displayed in the proposed Buena Vista Pumping Station  commissioned by the Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power.  </P> <P> "After nine years in practice, I feel I'm finally earning my spurs as an  architect for all seasons," Levin said. "For a while there I feared I might be  considered too 'sensitive' to design non-preservation projects."  </P> <P> Levin is happy that clients are beginning to trust her with a wider range of  projects, where she can begin to bring different design skills into play.  </P> <P> "Whether I'm restoring old buildings or designing new ones, my experience in  renovation and recycling has given me an awareness of the value of our  architectural heritage, that can create a vital continuity between our city's  first and second eras of growth."  </P></p>

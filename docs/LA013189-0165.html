			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> NBA FINES LAIMBEER, DAUGHERTY $5,000 EACH FOR FIGHTING  </P> <P> The NBA has fined Bill Laimbeer of the Detroit Pistons and Brad Daugherty of  the Cleveland Cavaliers $5,000 each for fighting.  </P> <P> The two exchanged blows during Cleveland's 80-79 victory last week over  Detroit.  </P> <P> Both players missed games Sunday after receiving one-game suspensions without  pay. The suspension cost Daugherty $10,900, Laimbeer $7,300.  </P> <P> Cleveland general manager Wayne Embry also was fined $1,000 for leaving his  seat behind the Cavaliers' bench and charging the court during the fight.  </P> <P> Laimbeer has said he won't appeal the fine.  </P> <P> "I think the best thing for me would be not to talk about the incident  anymore," he said. "I should just get ready to start playing basketball and  keep my mouth shut."  </P> <P> Daugherty said he will appeal.  </P> <P> "I was wrong to take a swing, at him, but to put me in the same boat as  Laimbeer is ludicrous," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (6): Spin-off for Norwegian industry - Commercial benefits / The commercial star of the Winter Games is the programme for officially licensed products. Revenues are expected to be five times higher than originally projected in 1990 Lillehammer called its national sponsorship programme Team Birkebeiner - named after a 13th century group of royalists renowned in Norway for their daring rescue of a young prince from rebel forces. It is a title that conveys a sense of strength and resourcefulness to all Norwegians. The activities of Team Birkebeiner comprise the biggest Norwegian component out of a total projected income for the Lillehammer Olympic Organising Committee (LOOC) of NKr2.5bn. Other sources of revenue are ticket sales, licensed goods, and the sale of TV rights - handled, in practice, by the International Olympic Committee. Nine Scandinavian sponsors - Volvo, IBM, Statoil, Norwegian Post, TBK (telecommunications), ABB (climate control), Sparebanken, Procordia, and Norwegian Telecomm - have contributed a total of NKr390m to the Games. A further 17 smaller companies have signed up as official suppliers, worth a budgeted NKr75m. However, the commercial star of the Winter Games is the programme for officially licensed products, with revenues five times higher than originally projected in 1990. The final income will probably exceed NKr100m, on a total turnover of NKr946m - all returning to Norwegian factories and workshops. Goods range from Olympic knives - where the producer has had to introduce an extra production shift to cope with demand - to fine porcelain and T-shirts. Judith Gloppen, LOOC project leader for licensed products, believes the success is due to an aesthetically-led design programme, careful selection of producers, and strict quality control. The cheap rubbish sold from pavement stalls at most leading sports events would be totally out of place in Norway. 'Out of more than 1,000 applicants who came to us with licensed product ideas, only 35 were accepted,' says Ms Gloppen. 'In close co-operation with the LOOC, they have developed more than 150 different products based on our own design elements.' Novel themes include ancient Norwegian rock carvings and traditional elements of Norwegian culture. Another success is the extent to which clothing incorporating the Lillehammer and Olympic logos has become fashionable among young people - from toddlers to teenagers - right across the country. Every sweater contributes to the cost of the show. Official estimates suggest that 300 permanent and 450 temporary jobs have been created by the products. The IOC was so impressed by the range of goods that they have been put on display in the newly-opened Olympic Museum in Lausanne and Olympic president Samaranch has urged future Games host cities to base their programmes on Lillehammer's precepts. No Olympics would be complete without mascots. Kristin and Hakon, child dolls from Norway's folklore, are a good deal more tasteful than many previous examples. A consignment of 60,000 has recently been sent to Italy, and they are selling well in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and the US. In Japan, where officials are already limbering up for the 1998 Winter Games, marketing rights for Lillehammer products fetched a remarkable NKr10m. In Norway itself, one of the biggest breakthroughs has been in the construction of new venues using the most advanced techniques in timber structures. The new methods are attracting international interest to one of the country's most important industries. Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre is the world's largest modern timber building. 'Until Hamar was built, the longest clear span in laminated wood was 66 metres. This has now increased to 96.4 metres,' said Frode Alhaug, chief executive of timber group Moelven Industrier. 'What has been created here has shifted the boundaries of what can be achieved with wood; in terms of size, span of load-bearing elements and fire safety,' he added. Some 2,000 Norwegian companies have supplied goods or services to the build-up in Lillehammer. Many have had to expand or learn new skills to do so. But there is a feeling abroad that the Olympics has brought Norwegian industry forward a generation in just four years.</p>

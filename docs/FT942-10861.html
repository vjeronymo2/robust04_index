			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Russian premier sacks minister Russian prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin has sacked a deputy privatisation minister in an attempt to fend off accusations that he is moving too slowly and ineffectively on economic reform. Mr Vladimir Kvasov, the prime minister's chief of staff, revealed in a newspaper interview that Mr Valentin Sychkin, deputy chairman of the Committee for State Property, was fired for failing to provide office space for unspecified officials. Mr Dmitry Vasiliev, another deputy privatisation minister and a driving force behind a mass sell-off of state assets, would be scolded next week for not submitting a new privatisation plan for later this year, he said. The criticisms are part of a series of attacks from Mr Chernomyrdin on three ministries whose top staff are still closely identified with radical leaders forced out of office last winter. Infuriating the men in question, Mr Kvasov made public the fact that Mr Sergei Alexashenko, deputy finance minister responsible for the budget, and Mr Yakov Urinson, a deputy economics minister, had been scolded for not meeting deadlines on issues such as the distribution of state investment credits. He said that the ministers of economics, finance and privatisation had been given a week to 'put their departments in order'.</p>

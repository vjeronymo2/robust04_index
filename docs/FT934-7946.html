			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Boeing order secures 737 development BOEING, the US aircraft manufacturer, yesterday announced that the next-generation development of its best-selling 737 airliner had been secured through a Dollars 2.5bn order from the Dallas-based Southwest Airlines. The airline has ordered 63 of the 737-X airliners for delivery from late 1997. Some 32 of the orders result from the conversion of options on the existing 737-300 variant. The 737-X has been designed by Boeing to be more competitive with the range of small airliners manufactured by Airbus Industrie, the European consortium. They will fly further and faster than existing 737 variants thanks to improvements to the wing design and a new engine from CFMI, a joint venture between General Electric and Snecma. Southwest Airlines has a fast-growing network of short-haul, frequent flights in the US. Its policy of offering no-frills services at low cost has turned it into one of the few airlines currently making profits in the fiercely competitive US market.</p>

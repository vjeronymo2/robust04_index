			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Aid refused for Maxwell pension funds THE government has rejected private attempts by representatives of Maxwell company pension schemes to secure compensation for funds stolen by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Solicitors for the pension schemes met Mr Tony Newton, social security secretary, and Mr John Redwood, consumer and corporate affairs minister, recently to ask for compensation on the grounds that government-backed bodies failed to regulate the pension funds' investment activities properly. Imro, which regulates the fund management industry, had authorised Bishopsgate Investment Management, a Maxwell-owned entity, to manage the pension funds of other Maxwell-owned companies. The funds argue the government bears some responsibility because pension funds are specifically exempted from the Financial Services Act, which set up the self-regulatory system, and because pensioners are excluded from the government-sponsored Investors Compensation Scheme. Mr Ken Trench, chairman of the Maxwell Pension Action Group, said that of the Pounds 695m originally missing from the pension funds, Pounds 237m had been recovered by the provisional liquidator for BIM, while it was 'hoped' that another Pounds 217m would be recoverable. Meanwhile, solicitors for the new trustees of Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme, Travers Smith Braithwaite, have produced a report evaluating potential targets for legal action. MGN's pension scheme has assets of between Pounds 115m and Pounds 150m, but needs assets of Pounds 315m to meet current projections of liabilities. Solicitors are seeking a clause in the scheme's trust deed which would require any purchaser of Mirror Group to make good any shortfall in assets should the scheme be terminated.</p>

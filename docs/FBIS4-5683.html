			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance  will decontrol commercial paper issues by life and nonlife  insurance firms to raise short-term funds, ministry officials  said Monday [11 April].    The officials said a formal decision will be made by the end  of this week.    They said the decision is in line with a recommendation in  June 1992 by the Insurance Council, an advisory panel to the  finance minister.    The officials said insurance companies are expected to issue  their first commercial paper in May at the earliest.    Insurance firms have hitherto raised necessary funds through  sales of securities holdings to cover the extraordinary  expenditure caused by natural disasters.    They will be able to issue commercial paper to refund  debentures issued by them in the past.    The ministry conditionally lifted controls on commercial  paper issues by leasing and consumer credit companies in June  last year.</p>

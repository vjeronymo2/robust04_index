			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Letter: Central fund would offer answer to pensions protection problem Sir, Lex ('Pension funds', December 18) highlights the fact that the ability of a pension fund to cover accrued benefits on winding-up by purchasing annuity policies can be prejudiced by the high current cost of annuities and by the difference between the investment policies appropriate for ongoing and discontinued schemes. Lex states that 'the challenge is to find a measure which safeguards minimum standards without putting potential benefits at risk.' We agree fully with this sentiment, and believe we have devised a potential solution to the problem, which we have explained in some detail in our submission to the Goode Committee. In essence, we have proposed that a tax approved centralised Discontinuance Fund should be established which would accept transfer payments from occupational pension schemes when the sponsoring employer goes into liquidation. The transfer terms would reflect the investment returns which the Discontinuance Fund expected to achieve; the fund would adopt an equity based investment strategy similar to that of an ongoing occupational pension scheme which continued to enjoy financial support from the employer. The terms on which it would accept liabilities would be compatible with the funding and investment strategies adopted by ongoing schemes. I would emphasise that under our proposal such a fund would only cover liabilities for which appropriate transfer payments had been received from the trustees of schemes which were winding up. There is, however, the separate matter of some form of compensation scheme. We share the reservations of many others about the equity and practicality of any such arrangement. If, nevertheless, one were to be introduced, the use of the Discontinuance Fund as a funding vehicle would minimise its expected cost as a result of its equity-related investment policy.

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Vulnerable times for US bond market: Why investors will be nervous during the Republican convention US Treasury market dealers and investors will be glued to their television screens tonight, nervously awaiting President Bush's acceptance speech at the Republican convention in Houston. Since the end of last week the bond market has been troubled by rumours that Mr Bush will temporarily set aside his long-term goal of balancing the budget and unveil a tax-cutting package aimed at breathing fresh life into both the economy and his own re-election hopes. Such a move might be popular with the Republican party faithful, but it could be a setback for the bond market. Analysts fear that a tax cut announcement could bring the market's impressive mid-summer rally to a halt. The rally has brought long-term yields down from 7.8 per cent in early June to 7.3 per cent today, the lowest level seen in five and a half years. It has been built on the gloomy outlook for the US economy, which the market expects to remain weak well into 1993, and inflation, currently at just over 3 per cent and which should fall even further during next year. The rally at the long end has also been partly technical - the result of longer-dated maturities catching up with the gains of short- and intermediate-term securities. Successive cuts in US interest rates during 1991 and 1992 made the yields on short-term liquid assets such as money market funds and bank certificates of deposit (CDs) extremely unattractive. This forced investors to switch their money into short and intermediate debt  -the two-year, five-year and 10-year treasury securities - where yields were higher. There was less demand for long bonds at the time due to fears about inflation. It was not long before the gap between the yield on the long bond (nearly 8 per cent) and on short and intermediate securities (between 4 per cent and 6.5 per cent) grew so wide that investors began moving their money further up the maturity spectrum to earn a better yield. 'The long end is the most interesting part if you are looking for significant capital gains,' says Mr Roger Gray, head of fixed income and currency at Rothschild Asset Management. Demand for treasuries has been very strong. According to figures compiled by the Investment Company Institute, net sales of bond funds in the first six months of this year totalled Dollars 103.9bn, double the Dollars 57.1bn in the first half of last year. If money keeps pouring into bond funds at its current rate, 1992 will be the best on record. The treasury market has been helped by the relatively poor performance of equities. Bonds have offered better returns than any comparable investments for much of this year. Many managers of global bond funds remain overweight in the US treasury bond market, as they believe there is scope for further gains. Mr Nick Henderso, head of fixed income at Gartmore, the UK fund management group, says: 'We're slightly overweight in the US, and have been steadily building up our position in North America, but we would not increase it further.' Mr David Gibson, head of fixed income at Schroder, says: 'Although US bond yields probably do have further to fall, we think the market is overbought and that there is now scope for better gains in Europe than in the US.' International fund managers are watching the Bundesbank closely for signs of a possible easing in German interest rates which would pave the way for lower rates in other European countries. The US market's new-found confidence could be dented by political uncertainties, especially if President Bush engineers a politically motivated tax cut at this week's convention. Lower taxes means three things to the bond market, all of them bad: a stronger economy, higher inflation and a bigger federal deficit. The fact that the bond market has reacted so nervously to rumours of a possible tax cut underlines how vulnerable it is during the election campaign. Analysts warn to expect further volatility as election day (November 3) draws nearer, and a possible end to the rally if Governor Bill Clinton maintains his lead in the polls. Ms Christine Pinto, senior strategist at Merrill Lynch, believes the market is in for a rough ride. She says: 'I'd probably say a good bet is that we'd see a 7.5 per cent yield (on the long bond) before we saw 7 per cent, given the fact the consensus thinks Bush isn't going to get enough steam up through to November. The bond market could get a little rattled.' Any negative reaction to a Clinton victory could be short-lived, according to Mr Bob Beckwitt, portfolio manager at Fidelity, the biggest fund group in the US. 'What happens to the economy over the next year is what matters, and Clinton will have only a marginal effect on the economy if he gets elected.' What about life after the election? The bulls believe inflation will lie dormant for the next one or two years as the economy remains weaker than normal. Longer-term trends are also moving in the bond market's favour, says Ms Pinto. She says the US population is ageing, the baby boom generation will save more and spend less, and the housing market will remain depressed, which means that poor demand for mortgages will keep interest rates down. She adds that US households currently have Dollars 3,650bn in short-term liquid assets (such as bank accounts, money market funds, CDs). Much of that is earning low returns, and when it matures later this year it is likely to search for a higher yield elsewhere - possibly in equities, but more likely in bonds.</p>

			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / House sales 'to rise 15%': Homes more affordable than for many years, says Halifax The housing market recovery will gather pace next year, Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, says today. It expects house sales to increase by 15 per cent in 1994 while prices could rise on average by about 5 per cent. Halifax says in its new year forecasts that it does not expect measures announced in last month's Budget, including further phased reductions in mortgage tax relief, to inhibit the recovery. 'Houses are as affordable now as they have been at any time in the past decade, and are probably as affordable as they have been since the 1960s in many parts of the country,' it says. It adds that the average mortgage repayment as a percentage of male average earnings has fallen to 22 per cent compared with a peak of almost 50 per cent in 1989-90. In spite of this the number of house sales in England and Wales was thought to have risen by about only 5 per cent this year while average UK house prices increased by about only 2 per cent. Halifax expects the pace of recovery to accelerate next year as the general economic recovery becomes more pronounced and fears of unemployment diminish. 'We expect activity levels to rise by around 15 per cent in 1994, probably in excess of 1.3m house moves in England and Wales,' it said. That would compare with a low of 1.1m moves in 1992 and a peak of 2.1m in 1988. Halifax expects sales next year to remain 'well below the 1.6m to 1.8m level which was the norm for much of the 1980s'. It forecasts that further improvement is likely to be modest with annual sales stabilising at about 1.5m and annual price inflation likely to remain in single figures for the foreseeable future. 'Over a long period of history, house prices have had a fairly stable relationship with earnings. We expect this to continue. The days of boom and bust in the UK housing market are hopefully ended and we are seeing a return to housing being safe if not spectacular investment,' it says. Halifax forecasts that net mortgage lending will rise from Pounds 17bn to Pounds 18bn this year to Pounds 21bn to Pounds 22bn next year. Lending was expected to rise gradually by about Pounds 2bn a year through the 1990s. This would still leave mortgage lending below the 1988 peak of Pounds 40bn.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ HOW THE COST OF BUYING HAS COME DOWN  ------------------------------------------------------------------                      Price     Monthly    Price     Monthly                    in 1989   repayment      now   repayment                     Pounds      Pounds   Pounds      Pounds  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Luton               76,000         620   54,000         280 Bristol             70,000         570   60,000         320 Cambridge           95,000         790   70,000         380 Oxford             100,000         840   73,000         400 Reading             95,000         790   75,000         410 Southampton         75,000         610   55,000         290 Swindon             70,000         570   55,000         290  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Average for semi-detached house bought with 80% loan Halifax Building Society  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

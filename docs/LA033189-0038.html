			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COLLECTORS BLAME FOR PRICES OF AUTOGRAPHS  </P> <P> Now that the obnoxious pay-per-autograph season is behind us for another year,  let's divide the blame and put it where it belongs. If you're among the  thousands of collectors, you might not like the idea that the players are not  at the top of the pecking order here.  </P> <P> Who is responsible for those outlandish prices charged for signatures at card  shows around the country?  </P> <P> It will come as a disappointment to the purists in ga-ga land that "greedy,"  "self-centered," or "inconsiderate" athletes are often little more than  innocent victims of the craze that has turned into a multimillion dollar  business.  </P> <P> Sorry folks, but, contrary to popular opinion, the players are not the ones who  establish going rates at these autograph extravaganzas. And if you run into one  of your heroes in public, he's not going to ask for $5 or $10 to sign a ball,  card or picture. He might not sign (especially in the middle of the main  course), but it won't be because you don't have the cash in your hand.  </P> <P> It's still possible your idol is of the clay variety and might try to protect  his market value. But even if he's that sinister, you have to go step by step  to the bottom line to find all the culprits.  </P> <P> Ultimately, you get to the consumer, and that's where you stop. In this case,  for the most part, that translates to collectors, the most serious of which  become investors in a market that sometimes pays off better than blue-chip  utilities.  </P> <P> Consider this one: About two months ago an individual spent $30,000 for 40,000  1989 cards bearing the picture and vital information of Milwaukee's Gary  Sheffield. Quick math reveals that works out to 75 cents apiece.  </P> <P> Because a player's rookie card is considered the most desirable throughout his  career (because it becomes increasingly more difficult to find), this  speculator was gambling that the Brewers' infielder would enhance the value by  winning the American League Rookie of the Year award. He is considered the  preseason favorite.  </P> <P> Since that time, half of the Sheffield cards reportedly have been sold at  prices ranging from $1.35 to $2.50. That translates to a return of at least  $27,000 on the investment -- with half of the inventory still outstanding.  </P> <P> The purchaser? A high school junior in Scarsdale, N.Y.  </P> <P> With staggering amounts of dollars to be made in the collector market, it was  only a matter of time before others went after a piece of the action. Enter  promoters, agents and, ultimately, the players themselves.  </P> <P> When the memorabilia-autograph shows -- like the ones held in Atlantic City and  New Carrollton, Md., during the winter -- are put together, somebody takes a  risk, everybody pays and the players walk away with hefty appearance fees.  </P> <P> But the accepted notion that players set a price for their autograph, sit at a  table next to a cash register and put the autograph fee in their pocket is the  biggest misconception of this fad-turned-scam, which may be on the brink of  pricing itself out of business. Minnesota outfielder Kirby Puckett, for one,  has said he will no longer do shows because of the negative reaction and the  carnival-like "hustle" that is involved.  </P> <P> Autograph fees are determined by two things -- how "hot" the player is, and how  much it costs (fee, plus travel expenses) to get him there.  </P> <P> Brooks Robinson, who has probably signed more autographs than any man alive,  has profited from many appearances. But he says the market is close to being  glutted.  </P> <P> "I do about 30 (shows) a year, but if I had the time I could probably do 200,"  Robinson said. "It's gotten to the point where there's just too many of them  now. I've been to shows where promoters have lost their shirt. A lot of time it  (success of a show) depends on who is there, how hot he is, how much it costs  to get him -- and how recently he may have done a show in the area.  </P> <P> "It's really a no-win situation for the players, but they have no alternative  other than to look at it as a business. That's what it is -- and it's a big  business.  </P> <P> "I do my charity work here at home (Baltimore)," said Robinson, "but there's no  way I'm going to Cleveland, or Wheeling or even New Carrollton without getting  paid.  </P> <P> "The people that go to those shows know what they're getting into; nobody goes  there expecting to get anything for free. They go to buy, sell and get  autographs and 99 out of 100 go away feeling good.  </P> <P> "Every once in a while somebody will say this (paying for an autograph) is  ridiculous, but when they go they know who's going to be there. They have to  buy a ticket to get in, usually $3 or $5, and that entitles them to one  autograph. They pay for everything else."  </P> <P> Believe it or not, one of the considerations before booking an athlete is how  many times he can sign his name in an hour. "When they ask me that, I tell  them, 'More than anybody else -- and I can have a good time doing it,' "  Robinson said. "That's what some of these guys (players) don't understand. The  key is to enjoy yourself."  </P> <P> That's not always easy, according to Jay Finglass, owner of Jay's Sports  Connection in Towson, Md. Finglass has promoted a few small-scale shows locally  and attended countless others.  </P> <P> "The promoters are not interested in you talking -- only how many autographs  you sign in an hour," Finglass said. "Time spent talking is money out of their  pocket."  </P> <P> Finglass agrees that the players get too much of the blame for the  pay-per-autograph sessions, but he also points out that exorbitant appearance  fees can drive up the price considerably. That's where the agents come in  because, in virtually every instance, bookings are made directly with the  representative, who has a clue as to what his client is worth in the  off-season.  </P> <P> "Some of these guys, before they reach the really big dollar state, can make  more money in the off-season than they do by their salary," Finglass said. "But  it's not fair to put all of the blame on the player. It's the system.  </P> <P> "People willing to pay for autographs, promoters who can take a huge financial  risk while looking for a profit, and excessive appearance fees all combine to  drive the prices up."  </P> <P> How much is a player's appearance worth? As much as a promoter is willing to  pay.  </P> <P> How much is an autograph worth? As much as a collector is willing to pay.  </P> <P> "A player like Brooks, for instance, his signature, especially around here,  isn't worth as much because he's signed so many autographs over the years,"  Finglass said. "The promoter of the show in New Carrollton lost a bundle. He  paid Jose Canseco about $15,000, Pete Rose $12,000 and Fred Lynn $10,000. The  price for Canseco's autograph (one of the hottest on the market) was $14 and he  signed about 500, which was a lot more than either Rose or Lynn.  </P> <P> "You can price yourself out of business, and it's getting to the point where  the risk is much greater than the reward."  </P> <P> So much so, Finglass believes, that the number of shows is going to start to  dwindle. When that happens, the prices also will drop because it is a case of  supply and demand.  </P> <P> But players aren't stupid. If somebody is going to make money from an  autograph, the signee is going to get his share. They know there is a market to  be nourished and, for that reason, some players aren't as willing to sign a  baseball card in a happenstance situation. There have always been those who  don't sign autographs on their time.  </P> <P> And there are other considerations besides the money. In Anaheim, Calif., for  instance, there is one autograph hound who has been around the hotel lobby so  long he could be showing up with his offspring any season. In New York, it is  not uncommon for autograph seekers, young and old, to catch players as they  board the team bus, then make it to Yankee Stadium in time to greet them when  they arrive -- and then duplicate the procedure after the game.  </P> <P> "That's where the player gets bad-rapped, when they try to get away from it in  public -- but there are ways to handle that," said Robinson. "Now, though, it  really is a no-win situation for the players."  </P> <P> It might improve, but it's unrealistic to believe that collecting autographs  will ever again be a means of fulfilling a youthful fantasy. Those days are  gone.  </P> <P> You can blame the players if you want, but don't forget the rest of the system  that includes agents, promoters and -- most important of all -- the collectors.  </P></p>

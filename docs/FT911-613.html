			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: EC insurance UK insurers should sit up. The buzz from Brussels is that the long dormant insurance accounts directive is poised for adoption by the EC council of ministers next month. This seemingly obscure bit of legislation will harmonise requirements for technical reserves and set common rules for valuing assets and liabilities. Not for the first time in EC matters the British are staging a belated rearguard fight. The main grouse is that unrealised investment gains on non-life business will not be allowed through the profit and loss account. The Pru and Eagle Star do this at the moment, for example, though smoothed over a longish period. Another clause going down badly in London is a demand for detailed segment information. Companies say they are happy to provide this to national authorities but not to their competitors. Last-minute lobbying on these points may or may not succeed. More important is the fact that the Germans look like winning their battle to avoid any mention of the market value of assets. This issue gets close to the heart of the problem - different tax treatment - which the EC is signally failing to tackle. German companies have no wish to draw attention to their much-criticised privileges, notably the conservative reserving which enables the likes of Allianz and Munich Re to understate their profits. It is the financial firepower they have built up on the strength of this which spells trouble for the UK insurers after 1992.</p>

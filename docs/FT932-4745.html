			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Easing the reporting burden The small company audit has been the focus of a great deal of attention in recent months. The government's drive against red tape has given urgency to a long-running discussion of the merits of the small firms audit and the government has proposed exempting businesses with turnover of less than Pounds 37,600. This concentration on the audit has overshadowed the introduction of changes in the reporting requirements for small and medium-sized companies which could also reduce the bureaucratic burden. A statutory instrument which came into force last November permits for the first time a reduction in the amount of information which has to be presented to shareholders and the outside world. Statutory instrument (SI) 2452 - full title The Companies Act 1985 (Accounts of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Publication of Accounts in Ecus) Regulations 1992 - came into force seven months ago. Few companies have been aware of it as a reporting option but it is becoming more widely known. Small and medium-sized companies have been able to file abbreviated accounts (initially called modified accounts) with Companies House since 1981 but they have still been required to provide full accounts to shareholders. Abbreviated accounts had benefits in terms of confidentiality but increased the accounting burden because they were in addition to the full accounts and not a replacement for them. By contrast, accounts prepared under SI 2452 may replace full accounts and, while the reduction in the reporting requirement is only modest, may represent an attractive option to some companies. So says Ray Mayes, a partner at accountants Buzzacott and author of a new guidebook* to small and medium-sized company accounts. Accounts prepared under the SI 2452 rules - they have yet to acquire a more convenient label though 'exempt accounts' has been suggested - comprise simplified versions of the full directors' report, balance sheet and notes to the accounts. The directors' report may dispense with about a dozen clauses including those requiring 'a fair review of the development of the business', details of changes of asset values and of important post-balance sheet events. The balance sheet may group items which must be reported separately in the full accounts. Exempt accounts require only that goodwill and 'other intangible assets' be reported while full accounts require development costs, patents and other similar rights and goodwill to be reported separately. Companies making use of the exemptions may also omit notes to the accounts covering taxation provisions, a detailed product and geographical breakdown of turnover and information on directors' earnings. In addition to easing reporting requirements SI 2452 also raised the thresholds for companies qualifying as small or medium-sized. It increased the turnover limit for 'small' from Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.8m and for 'medium' from Pounds 8m to Pounds 11.2m, letting a further 13,000 companies through the net. Reflecting its origins in a European directive, the new rules also allow accounts to be drawn up in ecus. Some accountants fear the new rules will merely complicate matters by adding a new reporting level to the existing full and abbreviated accounts. 'They will bed down over time but at first sight they only pay lip service to easier reporting,' says Alistair Rose, a partner at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'They will represent a fairly minimal saving in cost and time.' But others welcome them as a first, if modest, reduction in the reporting burden on smaller firms. 'A well-managed company would have the information in its management accounts anyway,' says Mayes. 'But this saves the need to convert them into a form suitable for statutory disclosure.' *Preparing Company Accounts. Practical Guidelines for Small and Medium-Sized Companies. Accountancy Books.

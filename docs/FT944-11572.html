			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / The return of the high-flyers: Japanese exporters are learning to live with a rising yen and becoming more competitive No matter how strong the yen, Japan's electronics exports will always be competitive, a Japanese executive boasted to a securities analyst last week. That claim, while exaggerated, helps explain why few in Japan's exporting industries flinched when the yen touched a new high of Y96.1 to the dollar in New York on Wednesday, 15.5 per cent above its level at the end of last year. Until recently, Japan's exporters were the first to moan when each new jump in the exchange rate wiped billions of yen off their overseas earnings. Now they are celebrating. A sharp rise in export sales to the growing economies of the US, east Asia and Europe has allowed them, for the first time in years, to shrug off the pain. With their break-even points reduced by the cost-cutting imposed by three years of economic slowdown, and more than 20 years of coping with a rising currency, exporters are starting to make startling increases in profits. NEC, an electronics group which believes it can still make money on semiconductors at Y90 to the dollar, signalled that better times were around the corner a few months ago, when it threw a Y100m (Pounds 635,000) party in a posh hotel. Lavishness on that scale has been almost unheard of in Tokyo since the heady days of the late 1980s. The 150-odd companies which have so far reported their results for the half-year to September show that NEC is not the only one with the right to roll out the sake. They produced an average rise of nearly 18 per cent in recurring profits (before extraordinary items and tax), well above the average market forecast of 15 per cent. This is in spite of the yen climbing from Y103 to the dollar to Y98.6 during the same six months. Even more surprising, the sectors most dependent on exports include the best performers, with profits from the big five integrated electronics groups up more than three-fold, and profits from precision instrument makers doubled. Yet only recently, the Keidanren and Nikkeiren, the leading business federations, were issuing dire warnings that the yen's rise would wreck Japanese manufacturing. Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, however, has maintained that the pain is only short term. In the long term, he argues, the yen's strength forces corporate Japan to make itself even more competitive. Some sectors have suffered badly at the hands of cheaper foreign competitors as the yen has appreciated. In the car market, Japan will this year cede to the US its position as the world's biggest producer. And South Korea last year briefly knocked Japan out of top place in shipbuilding. Overall, however, analysts believe Japan has kept its share of world exports steady at just over 9 per cent since the last count in 1991. This is because the exchange rate is not the only factor in competitiveness. Most of Japan's exporters have found room for improvement in other factors such as costs, prices, quality and demand. They have become experienced in searching for such improvements, given that the yen has been on a rising trend since 1972, when it stood at Y360 to the dollar. On cost-cutting, Japanese industry's main technique has been to shift production capacity overseas and to increase purchases of components from abroad. Nearly one-third of cars and machines made by Japanese-owned companies now come from outside Japan. Almost a quarter of its manufactured output is made abroad, and this is expected to double by the end of the decade, estimates the Tokyo office of Jardine Fleming, a securities firm. Pessimists argue that this overseas exodus will deplete Japan's manufacturing base. Yet, argues Mr Mieno, this is really an appropriate redistribution of labour between low-wage countries, for making price-sensitive commodities, and high-wage ones such as Japan, for making high value-added products. Japanese exporters' other main cost-cutting technique has been to shed labour through freezing recruitment and encouraging early retirement. It has been a slow process, with manufacturing jobs falling by just 3 per cent in the past year. The latest bout of labour cost-cutting started in mid-1991, stimulated by the onset of Japan's recession rather than by the rise of the yen. Industry was initially slow to act. This was due to the tradition of offering life-time employment to staff - one reason why corporate earnings collapsed so dramatically at the start of the downturn. By the same token, however, this steady cost-cutting will continue into the upturn, leading many securities analysts in Tokyo to expect much sharper corporate profits rises in the next two years. There is plenty of scope for improvement: manufacturing industry's recurring profit margins are thin, at 1.8 per cent of sales. On prices, Japanese exporters have benefited from following Mr Mieno's advice to shift upmarket into high value-added products. This leaves them relatively immune from undercutting by cheaper producers. They have also continued to expand their lead in quality control, notably in automotive components, which allows them to sustain higher prices. Even with commodity-type goods such as paper, steel beams and polyester, foreign demand has been strong enough during the past six months for Japanese exporters to push through price increases - despite the yen's rise. Demand has been the final component in Japanese exporters' new-found ability to live with a high yen. They have the good fortune to be going into a recovery with plenty of under-used domestic capacity at a time when US industry is struggling to keep up with demand. Japan willingly fills the gap at prices buoyed by the inflationary pressures created by capacity constraints in the US. At the same time, the structure of Japan's exports - up 8.3 per cent in the six months to September - is fast changing in favour of east Asia, where the yen is not so strong against local currencies and where prices are rising even faster than in the US. Asia overtook the US as Japan's biggest export market in 1991, and now its exports to Asia exceed sales to the US by a third, in dollar terms. The downside of Japanese companies' success in export markets is that it contributes to the strength of the yen. The currency pressure on Japanese manufacturers to sharpen competitiveness further is therefore unlikely to let up. On their past record, they will not fail to respond.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Constitutional Court on Social </F> Security Ruling"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 15 -- "The figures fired out over  the last few days are not credible," said Constitutional Court  President Paolo Casavola today on the court's controversial  ruling on pension backpayments that has been estimated as  widening the INPS [National Agency for Social Security] pension  agency deficit by figures ranging from 9 to 30 trillion lire  (5.6 to 18.75 billion dollars), and possibly spelling a  corrective mini-budget.    Expressing puzzlement over the discrepancy in the figures,  Casavola said the Court was told by INPS on April 15 that its  sentence would cost 9 trillion lire.    "What are we supposed to do about it if the head of INPS  then  provides the government with different figures," he went on,  referring to this week's INPS estimate of 22 trillion lire.  Labor Minister Clemente Mastella has put the total bill even  higher, at 30 trillion lire.    "INPS is a public body, there ought to be some sort of  public  data bank," said Casavola, reiterating that it was the Court's  job to judge laws, not to suggest how laws should be financed in  accordance with the constitutional requirement that every law  have adequate cover.    But he described the INPS pickle as the result of  "improvident" past policy, claiming that previous governments  had ignored its warnings.    As to the possibility of the backpayments being spread over  different fiscal years, Casavola said it was "up to the  government to decide how it is to find the financial cover."    Commenting indirectly on the furore caused by its ruling,  Casavola hinted at a need for the Court to work more closely  with parliament in framing action to prevent such financial  problems coming to a head with apparently little warning. He  expressed favour for the German model, where "the court  expresses an opinion, giving parliament the time to intervene  and adjust things."    Casavola also described the polemics over the repayment of  an  85,000 lire lump-sum healthcare tax as "demagogical." "Young  people spend more than that when they go to the disco," he said.    The court has around 50 public spending cases pending,  Casavola said.    The INPS press office clarified later that the cost of  making  backdated supplementary payments to about 600,000  pension-holders was initially estimated at 9 trillion lire, but  could rise to 16 trillion lire, "as recognised even by a  Constitutional Court expert" if it were to apply to all the  pension-holders who had not received these payments as of  September 30 last year.    The 16 trillion becomes 22 trillion by adding in the 6  trillion lire cost of a second Constitutional Court ruling, last  December, making pensions reversible, INPS said.    The rough figure attributed to Mastella is a stab at  including extra costs for interest payments and monetary  fluctuations, which "cannot be quantified until the dates of  sentence pronouncement and application are known," INPS said.  It denied receiving a request "on April 15 or any other date"  for a cost estimate from the Court.</p>

And  everyone knows that the West now finally has to come to a  decision: Does it want to counter the killing with military  force after all, or does it capitulate to terror?    The West has been shying away from the decision to intervene  for 22 months; this is how long Sarajevo has now been besieged.  For every day since the beginning of the siege, 15 people have  been killed. With bewilderment we watch a European city being  strangled, the people being deprived of dignity and life.    Week after week the poison of growing accustomed has  increasingly paralyzed our thinking. Whoever does not see any  practical way out, always finds intellectual excuses for doing  nothing. We have shouldered the burden of the unbearable  easily; after all, one can live well in the neighborhood, even  in times of war. What, however, are we going to answer when our  children ask us one day: What did you do when Sarajevo died?    The poison of growing accustomed acts slowly, but reliably.  Conscience gradually goes to the dogs in the process. After  all, it has been expected to tolerate a lot during the Balkan  war so far:     -  "ethnic cleansing," the driving away of  millions from their homes in the name of nationalist  mania;    -  concentration camps full of emaciated prisoners, rigid  with terror behind the barbed wire;    -  mass rape as a dirty weapon  of war and the most miserable humiliation;    -  hunger blockades,  which are supposed to break the will to survive of the  defenseless civilian population and demonstrate the helplessness  of the UN helpers;    -  destroyed mosques, burned out libraries,  bombed hospitals and schools, artillery attacks on the old city  of Dubrovnik and the bridge of Mostar;    -  torture and thousands of  brutal, vile murders.    Horrible pictures; they passed before our, the audience's,  eyes. Finally, we resigned ourselves to them. Not without  reasons of realpolitik. The arguments were provided by the  military: The quicksand of the Balkans will unavoidably devour  everyone who is crazy enough to intervene in the war. Thus,  hands off. The only thing that could be done was to provide  humanitarian aid. Even that cannot be forced.    After the massacre of Sarajevo the failure of this  realpolitik has finally become obvious. Because the European  Union, the United Nations, and NATO have not countered the  violence with determination a single time, because every drunk  militiaman was able to stop the UN convoys, because the blue  helmets were permitted to record only the number of salvos fired  while standing beside the guns, because the international  community has acted with such terrible helplessness, it has  practically supported new violence.    The moral defeat is joined by the foreign policy disaster.  There have been too many resolutions without consequences, too  many broken promises, too many empty threats. If the United  Nations and NATO do not act now, either, their credibility and  integrity will be lost for a long time.    Just a month ago at the summit in Brussels NATO confirmed  its  readiness to "carry out air strikes in order to prevent the  strangling of Sarajevo, the protection zones, and other  endangered areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina." On the weekend, UN  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali called on NATO to prepare for air  strikes at Serbian positions.    Everyone knows that bombing the artillery positions in the  mountains around Sarajevo or firing missiles at the besiegers of  Tuzla and Srebrenica will not end the war, because military  force can never settle this conflict. However, one must finally  set a sign against the mass murder in Bosnia -- 200,000 dead in  two years. "Words of dismay are no longer sufficient," Tadeusz  Mazowiecki, the UN rapporteur for the former Yugoslavia, told  the Geneva Human Rights Commission.    No sensible person will underestimate the enormous risks  that  a military intervention entails. The Serbs could retaliate  against the lightly armed blue helmets and thus further endanger  the deliveries of aid to the starving civilian population. The  Muslims could feel encouraged in their resistance against a  compromise at the negotiations. The NATO attacks could hit  innocent people. The war could escalate further.    However, this is not likely. When U.S. President Clinton  threatened with attacks last year, the Serbs gave in  immediately. When nothing happened, they once again stepped up  the pressure on the besieged towns. At the Geneva negotiations  their aggression has always been rewarded so far, and the same  goes for the aggression of the Croats. The negotiators of the  European Union and the United Nations could negotiate in a much  tougher way if the diplomatic efforts were backed up by credible  military pressure.    It is a terribly difficult decision. Everyone who weighs the  pros and cons feels torn apart. Are the potential negative  consequences of intervention more important than the visible  consequences of nonintervention? On the other hand: Could not  thousands still be alive if the international community had  thought of its responsibility in time?    Historical memory might make the decision of one's  conscience  easier: Shevaq Weiss, the president of the Israeli Knesset,  addressed a moving appeal to the five permanent members of the  UN Security Council: "The continuing actions of genocide in  Bosnia are a sign of shame for human society." And he added:  "We, as members of a people that was the victim of such  massacres while the world looked on in silence, cannot  participate in such a cover-up."    If Europe does not want to betray its civilization once  again  in this blood-soaked century, it must counter the barbarism with  military force.</p>

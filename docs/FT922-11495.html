			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Albania and IMF agree economic reform plan OFFICIALS from the International Monetary Fund in Tirana have agreed an outline economic reform plan with the newly elected democratic party government in Albania led by Mr Sali Berisha. The plan emphasises the need for the rapid closure of uneconomic state enterprises and an end to the current system of state subsidies. The new government inherited a disintegrating economy with annual inflation running at over 500 per cent and industrial production at less than a third of capacity due to shortages of water and breakdowns in electricity supply. Part of the key mining sector is at a standstill. Official unemployment is put at 20 per cent of the labour force but thousands of workers produce little in factories crippled by raw material and component shortages but are still being paid 80 per cent of their wages.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Shipping line controls sought Shipping lines should not be allowed to fix prices for the land leg of long-haul deliveries, the European Commission said yesterday. A report by Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, says that shipping 'conferences'  -powerful agreements between shipping lines - would be contravening competition rules if they agreed to fix prices on road or rail transport to and from ports. At present, shipping conferences have a bloc exemption from competition rules on the port-to-port leg of journeys, allowing them to fix common rates. They argue that they be unprofitable, otherwise. However, big EU exporters say the shipping lines are behaving as an illegal cartel and imposing exorbitant prices. The report, approved by the Commission yesterday, will be presented to transport ministers at next week's council meeting.</p>

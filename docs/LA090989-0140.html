			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DALLAS PASTOR HEADS PUSH FOR DRUG-FREE COMMUNITY AREAS  </P> <P> The Rev. Patrick L. Williams of Crest-Moore-King United Methodist Church in  Dallas may be critical of President Bush's drug program, but he is one of a  growing number of clergy who are not relying on the government to solve the  drug crisis.  </P> <P> Williams is heading an effort in the Texas-New Mexico area to encourage local  churches to create four-block "drug-free" areas in their communities, pulling  together the expertise of a variety of counselors, therapists, social workers,  church workers and other professionals to do the job.  </P> <P> The Dallas minister is Southwest coordinator for the Black Family/Community and  Crack Cocaine National Network, a group which grew out of a conference held in  April in San Francisco organized by the Rev. Cecil Williams, pastor of Glide  Memorial United Methodist Church in San Francisco.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conference This Month  </P> <P> Patrick Williams, who is not related to the San Francisco minister, said he  hopes the program begins to take shape in the Southwest Sept. 22-23, when an  organizing conference takes place at the University of Texas Southwestern  Medical School.  </P> <P> He said the idea of drug-free zones will be tested at the conference,  commenting, "I don't know whether the community is going to buy into it."  </P> <P> But if that approach that is adopted, then all of the resources of the  communities will be brought to bear to completely "turn around" the four-block  areas, wresting control from drug dealers.  </P> <P> Thus far, noted Williams, there has been a vast outpouring of support from  professionals who work in the drug rehabilitation field. More than 100 have  signed up for the conference.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Few From Clergy  </P> <P> The clergy response has not been so encouraging. "I have to be honest with  you," Williams told Religious News Service in a telephone interview. "The  response (from clergy) has not been that overwhelming. . . . We're lucky if we  have a dozen."  </P> <P> Williams explained, "My theory is that the church is in denial in such a big  way that it's hard for us to admit we're impotent in this area."  </P> <P> But he is not giving up. He said he plans to send representatives to churches  with personal invitations to participate in the program.  </P> <P> In the Dallas area, Williams noted, he plans to flood the area with 23,000  brochures.  </P> <P> "The clergy have not been very responsive, that's the bottom line, and we're  the ones who should be leading the charge," Williams said.  </P></p>

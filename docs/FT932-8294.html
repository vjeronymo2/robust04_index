			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (8): 'Big bang' to widen options - Capital markets The Chilean right is fond of portraying Mr Alejandro Foxley, the finance minister, as a mere administrator of the fruits of General Pinochet's economic miracle. But before the end of the year, Mr Foxley hopes to have left his mark as an innovator, with a new law aimed at implementing 'the deepest and most complete reform to the domestic capital markets' since the early 1980s. His 'big bang' will widen the investment options open to private pension funds and insurance companies. Since Chile reformed its social security system in 1981 - introducing a compulsory savings scheme, managed by private companies known as Administradoras de Fondos de Pensiones (AFPs) - pension funds have become the biggest institutional investors in Chile. They now manage almost Dollars 13bn of funds, equivalent to one third of gross domestic product. The draft bill, sent to Congress in January, is long overdue. AFPs have been complaining since the late 1980s of the dearth of investment options in Chile, as they are accruing much faster than they are paying out benefits. Under the proposed legislation, AFPs will be able to diversify their equity portfolios and invest in new instruments, such as securitised bonds and closed-end entrepreneurial development funds. The government hopes the latter will be a source of long-term capital to small and medium-sized businesses. AFPs will be allowed to invest up to 10 per cent of their portfolios in shares, corporate bonds and gilt-edged securities abroad. Although AFPs were authorised to invest in a more restricted number of foreign instruments last year, they have yet to dip their toes into the international capital markets. They are adopting a cautious 'let's study all the options' approach, much to the chagrin of the legions of foreign investment bankers currently touting for business in Santiago. Mr Foxley says the reforms are imperative, in order to spread risk and ensure better long-term returns for Chile's 12-year-old private pension fund system. Both the government and the pension fund managers expressed concern last year over the growing concentration of AFP equity portfolios in a limited number of privatised utilities. Almost half of these investments are held in electricity and telephone companies, some of which performed poorly in 1992 and depressed the overall returns on AFP investments. The reforms have called on some elements of US trustee legislation to introduce revenue bonds for the finance of large infrastructure projects. Under this scheme, the money raised by bond issuers is managed by a trustee who disburses funds as the project develops. The finance ministry sees revenue bonds as an important vehicle for substituting foreign finance for big projects, particularly now that the country is pushing to upgrade roads, ports, irrigation, telecommunications and power generation. Insurance companies, which manage about Dollars 3bn of funds, will be allowed to invest up to 15 per cent of their funds in foreign equity and bonds and in the derivatives markets at home and abroad. While the stock market and Chile's 19 AFPs broadly welcome the proposed reforms, they are bitterly opposed to parts of the law that will tighten regulation on the thorny question of insider trading and other potential conflicts of interest. The controversy is bogging down discussions in the Senate. In essence, investment managers, be they mutual funds, AFPs, stockbrokers or insurance companies, will be required the keep their own investments separate from the portfolios of their clients - a rare practice to date and a state of affairs that has caused Chile's securities watchdog many headaches. The second issue - the handling of 'privileged' or insider information  - is a much trickier question, given the close-knit nature of Chile's small business community. The government wants to oblige AFPs to appoint a certain number of independent directors to their boards, men who have no financial interest in the companies AFPs invest in. At present, it is quite common for company directors to wear several hats at once. 'Even if the government succeeds in tightening regulations,' says Mr Mario Lobo, an investment analyst in Santiago, 'loopholes will inevitably persist until the business community itself accepts that the use of privileged information is unfair practice.' The proposed reforms have already galvanised the capital markets in Chile. Santiago's stock exchange rallied by 16 per cent in January, when the bill was sent to Congress. Trading was unusually heavy in second-tier stocks that might soon become eligible for the enlarged portfolios of AFPs. Santiago has also seen a spate of initial public offerings, which will give the stock market more depth and liquidity. Social security reforms elsewhere in Latin America, modelled broadly on the Chilean AFP system, are also tempting Chilean pension fund management companies to venture abroad. Six Chilean AFPs are setting up subsidiaries in Peru, where private pension schemes were introduced this month. Another four AFPs plan to establish themselves in Argentina.</p>

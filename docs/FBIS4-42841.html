			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["cr"-attributed report: "Negative Image Deters"] </F>   [Text] Duesseldorf, 4-5 Jun -- The Federation of German  Industry (BDI), the Federation of German Chambers of Industry  and Commerce (DIHT), and the Ibero-America Association (IAV)  will shortly establish a "Latin America Discussion Group." The  activities in the region must be coordinated and strategically  oriented, the Latin America initiative of the three supporters  mentioned above says. The starting point of their concept is  the insight that the negative image of Latin America, where  involvement has long been stable but rather limited, has  deterred new investors or people interested in exports from  German industry.    The profound reform process of Latin American states, the  "victory of the market economy," is seen only by insiders. "For  German industry, Latin America threatens to become a continent  for specialists only," the associations warn. Above all,  medium-sized and smaller companies have missed new opportunities  for getting involved in Latin America, the authors of the  initiative criticize. In contrast, large German industries can  partly point to positions that dominate the market.    The expansion of the foreign trade infrastructure, the use  of  foreign trade instruments as a whole, but also the lack of  planned diplomacy by visits and contacts are seen as the main  reasons for the dismal situation. As a result, the framework  conditions for entrepreneurial involvement are deteriorating  even further, it is said. In addition, the BDI clearly  criticizes Bonn's thrift policy, which has led to dramatic  cutbacks also in the system of chambers. The bad classification  of the Latin American trading partners in connection with the  reform of the Hermes system is also felt to be of little help.    After its founding, the discussion group of the three  associations, which will be joined by the Foreign Ministry, the  Economics Ministry, the Development Aid Ministry, and the  spokesman of the Latin American chambers, will engage in similar  activities as the APA [Asia-Pacific Committee]. One of the most  urgent tasks consists of:     -  Working out a political framework  concept of the Federal Government for Latin America;    -  Planning of  regional conferences in Latin America and of entrepreneurs'  conferences in Germany, which is to address primarily  medium-sized companies;    -  Improving the transparency of activities  of the Federal Government and the laender as well as of the  economic promotion companies, institutes, chambers, and  associations;    -  Improving public relations work;    -  expanding and  further developing foreign trade instruments with the goal of  making involvement in Latin America also possible for  medium-sized companies and of promoting cooperation with Latin  American companies.     In detail, this means the expansion and interlacement of the  network of foreign trade chambers and the coordination of a  concept of fairs and exhibitions with regional focal points. In  addition, there is the improvement of the coordination of  officials sent by chambers, the Technical Cooperation  Association (GTZ), and political foundations. Furthermore, it  would be desirable to jointly plan trips by Federal Government  officials and industrial figures, giving priority to regional  focal countries.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Each Licensee shall establish a written Valuation Policy approved by its Board of Directors or General Partners that includes a statement of policies and procedures that are consistent with Section III of this appendix. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> G. Documentation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Each Licensee shall prepare and retain in its permanent files a valuation report as of each valuation date documenting, for each portfolio security, the cost, the current Fair Value and the previous Fair Value, plus the methodology and supporting data used to determine the value of each such portfolio security. The minutes of meetings of Boards of Directors or General Partners at which valuations are determined will contain a resolution confirming that the valuations of each portfolios security were determined in accordance with Licensee's duly adopted valuation procedures and will incorporate by reference the valuation report signed by each Director or General Partner along with any dissenting valuation opinions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> H. Instructions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A model Valuation Policy is presented in Section III below. Licensees may adopt the model in its entirety or make appropriate modifications, additions or deletions. Any changes, however, must be generally consistent with the model. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A second version of the model Valuation Policy is presented in Section IV. This section repeats the language of Section III, but is expanded to include additional explanatory paragraphs. These paragraphs are commentary provided by SBA to assist Licensees in interpreting and applying some of the model valuation criteria. They may be adapted for inclusion in the Licensee's Valuation Policy, if desired. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> I. Approval <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Any Licensee that utilizes the exact wording of Section III, without any additions, deletions, or changes will be presumed to have an acceptable Valuation Policy. It is acknowledged, however, that this wording may not be entirely applicable to all Licensees. If a Licensee wants to adopt a Valuation Policy that is different from Section III, the Licensee must obtain SBA's written approval of such Policy. If changes from the wording of Section III are minor, it is suggested that the Licensee indicate deletions with a caret ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=3 --> ! <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) and underline additions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants for either a Section 301(c) or 301(d) license must submit their Valuation Policies for approval as part of the licensing application process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> III. Model Valuation Policy <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> A. General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The [Board of Directors] [General Partners] have sole responsibility for determining the Asset Value of each of the Loans and Investments and of the portfolio in the aggregate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Loans and Investments shall be valued individually and in the aggregate [at least semi-annually_as of the end of the second quarter of the fiscal year and as of the end of the fiscal year.] [at least annually_as of the end of the fiscal year.] Fiscal year-end valuations are audited as set forth in 13 CFR Part 107 Appendix III, Section II, paragraph D. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. This Valuation Policy is intended to provide a consistent, conservative basis for establishing the Asset Value of the portfolio. The Policy presumes that Loans and Investments are acquired with the intent that they are to be held until maturity or disposed of in the ordinary course of business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> B. Interest-Bearing Securities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Loans shall be valued in an amount not greater than cost, with Unrealized Depreciation being recognized when value is impaired. The valuation of loans and associated interest receivables on interest-bearing securities should reflect the portfolio concern's current and projected financial condition and operating results, its payment history and its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments when due. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. When a valuation relies more heavily on asset versus earnings approaches, additional criteria should include the seniority of the debt, the nature of any pledged collateral, the extent to which the security interest is perfected, the net liquidation value of tangible business assets, and the personal integrity and overall financial standing of the owners of the business. In those instances where a loan valuation is based on an analysis of certain collateralized assets of a business or assets outside the business, the valuation should, at a minimum, consider the net liquidation value of the collateral after reasonable selling expenses. Under no circumstances, however, shall a valuation based on the underlying collateral be considered as justification for any type of loan appreciation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Appropriate unrealized depreciation on past due interest which is converted into a security (or added to an existing security) should be recognized when collection is doubtful. Collection is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> presumed  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> to be in doubt when one or both of the following conditions occur: (i) Interest payments are more than 120 days past due; or (ii) the small concern is in bankruptcy, insolvent, or there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The carrying value of interest-bearing securities shall not be adjusted for changes in interest rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The valuation of convertible debt may be adjusted to reflect the value of the underlying equity security net of the conversion price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> c. Equity Securities_Private Companies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Investment cost is presumed to represent value except as indicated elsewhere in these guidelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Valuation should be reduced if a company's performance and potential have significantly deteriorated. If the factors which led to the reduction in valuation are overcome, the valuation may be restored. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The anticipated pricing of a Small Concern's future equity financing should be considered as a basis for recognizing Unrealized Depreciation, but not for Unrealized Appreciation. If it appears likely that equity will be sold in the foreseeable future at a price below the Licensee's current valuation, then that prospective offering price should be weighed in the valuation process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Valuation should be adjusted to a subsequent significant equity financing that includes a meaningful portion of the financing by a sophisticated, unrelated new investor. A subsequent significant equity financing that includes substantially the same group of investors as the prior financing should generally not be the basis for an adjustment in valuation. A financing at a lower price by a sophisticated new investor should cause a reduction in value of prior securities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

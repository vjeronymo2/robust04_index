			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Argos jumps 38% to Pounds 13.2m - Move to selling by mail order being considered ARGOS, the catalogue shopping group, said yesterday it was examining a 'number of options' for diversification and hinted that a move into direct mail order selling might be a possibility. Argos' venture into furniture retailing through its Chesterman chain proved to be a costly error as customer demand failed to meet expectations, and Chesterman was closed in March. But Mr Mike Smith, chief executive, said the company was still keen to extend its retail activities into areas 'consistent with our competence'. If Argos failed to find a suitable opportunity for expansion or acquisition it had not ruled out redistributing some of its cash reserves to shareholders in the form of higher dividends, he added. His comments came as the group revealed a 38 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.2m. Mr Smith said the company had seen a fragile recovery in consumer confidence and total sales in the 24 weeks to June 19 were up 10.3 per cent to Pounds 366m (Pounds 332m). Stripping out the effect of seven new store openings, however, the like-for-like sales increase was 5.9 per cent. Mr Smith said much of this increase was due to 'management initiatives, including the conversion of its remaining 'Best Sellers' stores, which previously carried only a limited range, to a full range, and changes to its catalogue. Last year's pre-tax figure of Pounds 9.5m included a Pounds 2.25m loss at the Chesterman furniture chain. Excluding that loss, the profit increase was 11.9 per cent. Although profits were in the mid-range of analysts' forecasts of between Pounds 12m and Pounds 14m, the share price slipped 10p to 328p. Analysts said the City was worried that Argos faced higher costs, and pressure on its gross margin. Mr Smith said the gross margin last year increased by 0.25 percentage points, thanks to increased sales of higher margin items such as furniture and jewellery. However, he admitted that growing price competition in UK retailing would 'drive gross margins down'. The interim dividend is lifted to 2.35p (2.2p), while earnings rose from 2.08p to 2.93p. Interest income fell slightly due to lower interest rates, but this was partly offset by an increase in average cash balances to Pounds 112m (Pounds 88m). Mr Smith said Argos planned to open a further 25 stores this year, taking the total to 322. It has an eventual target of about 600 stores.</p>

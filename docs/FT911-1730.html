			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Demand for French bonds sustained THE French government sold FFr7.77bn of bonds at yesterday's regular monthly auction, with demand sustained despite the lull in activity caused by this fortnight's market holidays. The auction puts the government well ahead in its borrowing programme for 1991, with a total of FFr52bn raised so far in bond issues compared with a full-year target of FFr100bn. The Tresor had announced a target range of FFr6bn to FFr8bn before yesterday's auction, but the non-competitive bids which primary dealers are allowed to submit after the auction at the average price are expected to take the amount raised over this level. Bids concentrated on the main 10-year tap stock, OAT 9.5 per cent 2001, where the Tresor accepted FFr3.74bn out of FFr12.4bn of bids. The cut-off price of 104.50 gives a weighted average yield of 8.78 per cent, 25 basis points lower than at last month's auction. The government sold a further FFr2.575bn of OAT 8.25 per cent 2004 at a cut-off price of 95.65, giving a yield of 8.82 per cent. It also accepted bids for FFr1.45bn of OAT 8.5 per cent 2019, its longest dated bond, at a cut-off price of 95.95, giving an average yield of 8.88 per cent.</p>

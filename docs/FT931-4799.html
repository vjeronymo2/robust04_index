			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / MP seeks switch on Scots verdicts A CAMPAIGN to abolish Scotland's 'not proven' jury verdict is gaining momentum, supporters said yesterday. Mr George Robertson, a Labour MP, is to launch a private member's bill seeking abolition, in the hope of focusing attention on the issue. Campaigners say the verdict - an acquittal, but less emphatic than the 'not guilty' verdict - is unfair both to the accused and to the families of victims. Mr Robertson, MP for Hamilton, said Scots law originally gave juries the simple choice of 'proven' or 'not proven'. But one jury, anxious to emphatically clear an accused man, declared him not guilty, and since then three possible verdicts have been available. A 1975 committee on criminal procedure headed by Lord Thompson agreed the verdict should stay, although a minority of the committee disagreed. Ironically, the Scottish verdict is now being studied by the Royal Commission on criminal justice in England and Wales, and Scottish authorities have said they will study its views on the subject. Scotland's lord advocate, Lord Rodger, said last year in a letter to Mr Robertson that while the case for a not proven verdict could be overstated, there was 'some justification' for the argument that its availability reduced the chances of a miscarriage of justice. At present Scotland's juries of 15 people return verdicts by a simple majority. Mr Robertson said it was 'almost certain' that this would have to be reviewed if the verdict were abolished.</p>

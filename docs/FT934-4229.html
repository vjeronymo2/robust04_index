			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Markets: Markets toast the chancellor's health - The reaction in London / The Budget and You Fancy that. Not only did chancellor Kenneth Clarke leave beer well alone in his first Budget, but when it was over you could still think of him as the kind of chap to spend an evening with in the pub. Our Ken may be a bit pugnacious but underneath that bluff exterior ticks the decent heart of a man prepared to buy a round of doubles for the old folk to keep them warm in winter. The trouble is that just when the evening draws to close in a merry haze, you know he's going to turn round and say: 'It's on you.' At the outset both the gilts and the equity market loved the Budget. The FT-SE 100, which had already risen 31 points on Tuesday, surged another 66 on Wednesday. Admittedly the movement slackened after that, but the net gain of 68 points over the last three trading days of the week was striking compared with the advance of only 15 points that followed Lord Lawson's give-away Budget in 1988. Similarly gilts advanced about three points over Tuesday and Wednesday though the gains tapered towards the end of the week, partly reflecting caution ahead of next week's auction. That apart, there are plenty of reasons why the glow should last longer in the gilts market than for equities. Not only did Clarke announce that Pounds 7bn of gilts already sold to banks and building societies would count towards next year's funding. He took another Pounds 5.5bn in tax increases and spending cuts out of the PSBR for next year on top of the Pounds 6.7bn already pencilled in by Norman Lamont. He promised a balanced budget by the end of the decade, which may stretch credibility a bit but is better than having no such target. And he forecast that underlying inflation would not exceed the government's 4 per cent ceiling next year. So long as the spending controls work, this adds up to a recipe for lower gilt yields. Inflation will continue to be squeezed and the government's demands on the gilts market should fall below Pounds 30bn in 1994-95 compared with around Pounds 50bn this year. What is good for bonds, though, is not necessarily the same for equities. So far the equity market seems blithely prepared to ignore the moment when the bills start to come in. The squeeze on consumer demand will become ever tighter after April. Clarke's economic growth forecast of 2.5 per cent may only work if the savings rate falls sharply and that is unlikely unless confidence revives. While the chancellor won plaudits from the City for fiscal rectitude and from Tory back benchers for restoring the government's grip, it was easy to forget that this year's two Budgets will take some Pounds 750 away from households earning Pounds 30,000. There is some consolation for the equity market. Lower inflation and lower long-term interest rates make p/e multiples and yield valuations acceptable that would have been unthinkable a few years ago, as the yield-gap chart on this page shows. Besides, if fiscal austerity really does cause the recovery to falter, Clarke can always ring Eddie George at the Bank and tell him that, while the timing is of course now up to him, it would be a good moment to cut interest rates. That would help gilts and equities by prompting another big flow from bank and building society deposits. The cosy theory that a strong gilt market should underpin equities depends, though, on gilts actually responding to the chancellor's treatment. There is room for doubt in both a domestic and an international context. The gilt market has much more grounds for worry about whether the chancellor will stick to his spending plans. If he does not, its PSBR estimates are thrown out of gear, but equities would benefit because fiscal policy is not quite as tight as previously assumed. Moreover ten-year gilts are already trading at an unusually narrow spread of 66 basis points (hundredths of a percentage point) over US Treasury issues and 71 basis points over German bunds. Until the chancellor's credibility on spending is established with overseas investors gilts market trends will depend heavily on what happens in other markets. The sporadic nervousness in the New York bond market is food for thought. For the time being it looks as though foreign investors still like the UK. The strength of sterling, above DM2.56 yesterday afternoon, bears this out. Shorn of foreign support which seems prepared to defy most rational criteria, though, the equity market could look a sorry sight. As striking as Tuesday's Budget was a string of disappointing results. On Wednesday the General Electric Company warned that its profits this year would show little improvement over 1992 because of higher development spending on defence projects and poor markets for products like cables. At least Lord Weinstock will not even have to pay 1p a share for Ferranti's assets now, but it would help if he could find some useful way of investing that ever-mounting cash pile. GEC shares fell 13p to 324p on the week. Argyll also chose Wednesday to report that its profits would be reduced by about Pounds 40m this year because of a decision to write down its stores. The announcement overshadowed a 6 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits and raised worries about other food retailers who will come under increased pressure to do the same. Argyll fell 8p to 255p on the week. On Thursday it was Hanson's turn. Its full year profits fell to Pounds 1.02bn from Pounds 1.29bn, the dividend was held and it warned of higher interest charges as its wheeze of borrowing in dollars and investing spare cash in sterling has become much less lucrative. It is also to float its housebuilding units to raise possibly as much as Pounds 500m. All that was worth a fall of 12 1/2 p to 266p. Ladbroke baffled everybody. On Tuesday it disclosed that Michael Hirst, a senior director who runs its hotel division, had sold just over half his holding. On Thursday the company announced that the sale was, however, unconnected by amicable discussions it was having with Hirst about his future. On Wednesday it also said it would pay a foreign income dividend, which institutions dislike because they cannot reclaim a tax credit. Yesterday Ladbroke began to backtrack, but the odds on this adding up to good news have lengthened. The shares fell 17p to 145p. But it was not all gloom on the corporate front. Carlton Communications leapt 57p to 834p after Monday's agreed Pounds 624m bid for Central Independent television. Royal Bank of Scotland stole the show on Thursday with a surge in full-year profits from Pounds 12.6m to Pounds 265.2m and a 25 per cent increase in its dividend. It rose 46p to 384p on the week. That underlines the attraction - in times of weak growth and low interest rates - of companies with secure and rising dividends. Other banks like Lloyds might benefit too. So would those ailing supermarkets if only they would cut their store opening programmes and pay surplus cash to shareholders instead.</p>

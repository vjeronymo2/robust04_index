			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / German economics minister quits: Mollemann's departure comes as fresh blow to coalition cabinet MR Jurgen Mollemann resigned yesterday as German economics minister and vice-chancellor, in a fresh blow to the stability of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's three-party coalition. His sudden and emotional departure followed his admission that he had personally sanctioned and signed letters promoting a product manufactured by a relation. The decision opens a big gap in Mr Kohl's cabinet, already hurt by the premature resignation of four other ministers in the past nine months, including that of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister and vice-chancellor, who was Mr Mollemann's mentor in the minority Free Democratic party (FDP). Mr Kohl had already promised to shuffle his cabinet in the last week of January. Mr Mollemann, who had hoped to become the next leader of the FDP, was not particularly popular with his colleagues, not only in the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) but also among Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU), for his outspoken free-market views. However, his departure after 10 years in the government was greeted officially with regret. His demise follows press revelations that his ministerial notepaper had been used to promote a security device for supermarket trolleys made in Cologne by a company called Pro Invention, part-owned by a cousin of his wife, Carola. In a statement issued before Christmas, Mr Mollemann had claimed that blank notepaper carrying his signature, intended for use when he was away from the office, had been used without his knowledge for letters to leading supermarket operators, urging them to look at the plastic token produced by Pro Invention. Yesterday, he admitted that he had been consulted about the letters by his personal assistant, had agreed to their distribution on the grounds that handicapped workers would be involved in the manufacture and had failed to notice that the final letters made no mention of the handicapped. 'I did not lie,' he said yesterday after cutting short a holiday in the Caribbean and consulting his colleagues in the leadership of the FDP. 'I authorised the original statement in good conscience, and to the best of my knowledge. But that does not lessen my self-reproach for having failed adequately to ascertain the facts.' Mr Mollemann, a former teacher who had risen to the top of the FDP largely as a result of skilful public relations, turned on the German media for exposing the affair and for hounding his wife and children in recent days. He said he no longer intended to stand for leadership of the FDP when Mr Otto Lambsdorff steps down this year, leaving the way open for his colleague, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, to take over. There has been speculation that Mr Kohl will try to appoint Ms Birgit Breuel, head of the Treuhand privatisation agency in east Germany, as economics minister in the coalition cabinet, although she is a member of his own CDU.

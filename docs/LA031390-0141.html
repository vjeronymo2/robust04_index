			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPAN SURPLUS FALLS 31% IN YEAR  </P> <P> In an encouraging sign for U.S. trade, Japan's trade surplus fell for the 10th  straight month in February by 31% from a year ago, the Finance Ministry said  today.  </P> <P> The February decline to $5 billion followed a dramatic 90% fall in January's  surplus, the biggest year-over-year drop in more than 10 years.  </P> <P> February exports shrank by 1.9% to $21.96 billion, the fifth consecutive  decline.  </P> <P> Imports were pushed up by higher oil prices and rose 11.9% to $16.95 billion --  the lowest percentage gain in five months.  </P> <P> Japan's exports dropped back because of sluggish U.S. demand and growing  production of Japanese goods at U.S.-based factories. Exports to the United  States fell 5.9% to $7.12 billion.  </P></p>

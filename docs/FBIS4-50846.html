			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Jingwei (6392 4842 4885): "Army Officers </F> Transferred to Civilian Work Should Be Placed Appropriately  Without Any Deviation"]    [Excerpt] The 1994 provincial meeting on the placement of  army officers converted to civilian work was held in  Shijiazhuang on 6 May. Cheng Weigao, secretary of the  provincial party committee, made a speech at the meeting. He  stressed: Army officers transferred to civilian work should be  placed appropriately without any deviation in an effort to  satisfy the army, the localities, higher levels, and the people.  Chen Yujie, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee,  presided over the meeting and offered his opinions on  implementation of the guidelines of the meeting. Li Haifeng,  vice governor of the province, also spoke at the meeting.    Cheng Weigao said: The congratulatory letters sent by  Comrades Jian Zemin and Li Peng on 3 April to the national  meeting on placement of army officers transferred to civilian  work have expressed the importance of the work of placing army  officers transferred to civilian work and have clearly pointed  out the orientation of this work. Party committees and  governments at all levels must conscientiously study and  successfully implement the guidelines of this meeting in order  to appropriately place army officers transferred to civilian  work. Success in army building requires not only the efforts of  military units, but the great support and coordination of local  party committees and governments. Successful placement of army  officers transferred to civilian work is of extremely great  significance in stabilizing the army, consolidating national  defense, and enhancing the combat effectiveness of the army.  Today when we are carrying out reform and opening to the  outside world with the purpose of quadrupling the 1980's GNP by  the end of this century, what is most needed is stability.  Failing in army building, there will be no stability. Party  committees and governments at all levels must consider the  placement of army officers transferred to civilian work as a  major political task and grasp it in a resolute manner.    In recent years, the province has achieved great results in  economic construction. These results are inseparable from the  fact that a large number of army officers who transferred to  civilian work have become backbone forces on various fronts.  Such officers have high political expertise, a strong sense of  organizational discipline, a high level of education, and  certain specialized skills and knowledge. So, we welcome the  transfer of such officers.    When talking about the placement of army officers  transferred  to civilian work in this and the past few years, Cheng Weigao  said: Each year, We transferred two to three thousands of army  officers to civilian work thanks to the hard work of personnel  departments and organizational departments at all levels.  Generally speaking, the work in this aspect has been good. At  present, although we are faced with the tasks of streamlining  organizations and expanding enterprises' autonomy in employment  and personnel affairs, we still should try every possible means  to appropriately place army officers transferred to civilian  work.    Cheng Weigao stressed: This year, in placing army officers  transferred to civilian work, we must handle affairs in strict  accordance with state policies on placement of army officers  transferred to civilian work. All localities and all units are  banned from formulating policies of their own. In placing such  officers, we should resolutely avoid such unhealthy tendencies  as entering through the back door. We should satisfy the  demands of such officers to the maximum in line with their  respective characteristics and specialities. We should try  every possible means to resolve their problems with regard to  lives, houses, jobs, and schooling and employment of their  children so that they can fully display their role in economic  construction.

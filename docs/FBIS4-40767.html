			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mikhail Gorbachev: "Keeping Russia Out Is a </F> Mistake"]    [Text] Relations between Russia and the West are not going  well. I believe the time has come to say so openly, not only  because I see that the seeds shed by the old weeds in the past  are still growing, but above all because I see a danger of other  evil weeds being planted, more or less on purpose, on all sides,  in line with a logic of alienness, or antithesis, for which  there should no longer be any justification.    The annual G-7 summit will be held in Naples in a few weeks'  time. I see that, after much shilly-shallying, it has been  decided to hold an economic G-7 and a political G-8. In other  words, the Big Seven will discuss economic trends in the world  community among themselves, then they will move on, bringing  Russia in, to look at the political situation.    Let me say straight away that, from some points of view,  this  is a step forward, as it means involving Russia in the analysis  of and reaction to overall international problems. It thus  means reducing the chances of mutual incomprehension,  misunderstanding, and suspicion. However, from other points of  view this attitude reveals an antiquated mindset. Indeed, my  first objection concerns the legitimacy of separating politics  and economics. To all intents and purposes, the Seven are  telling Russia that they are the ones who wield real power, and  that they are only granting it a consultative role as regards  the consequences of the options that they, and only they, are  entitled to select.    Does all this reflect actual reality? Only very partially.  Russia is undoubtedly a country in difficulty, its currency is  not convertible on the world market, it is deeply in debt, and  its repayment capacity is limited. But its real weight in world  affairs is certainly not less than that of Italy, or France, or  Canada. So there are other, unconfessed, unspoken, but obvious  reasons for keeping it out: There is a refusal to extend the  membership of the club that lays down the rules of the game.    The West's objection that Russia is still a country that  lacks stability, is susceptible to political and institutional  upsets, and is therefore not entirely reliable is a weak excuse:  Difficult though the situation may be, it would be  inconceivable for Russia to "change camp." Keeping it out of  the club increases its difficulties, from the psychological  point of view as well, as it heightens its feeling of isolation  and reinforces the obstacles to full integration. The truth of  the matter is that the idea that the world has to be governed by  the paramount interests of one side, the strongest, still  survives. This is a very shortsighted brand of "realism."    However, membership of the club must not be the ultimate  goal, the mere achievement of which is to be regarded as an end  in itself. The G-7, even if it becomes the G-8, cannot -- and  will not -- be the seat of government of a stable new world. It  can only be, for a certain time, a transitional arrangement born  of the needs of the moment, of the lack, or inadequacy, of  fairer, more functional international structures. There will be  problems if it ends up by taking on a permanent role that does  not rightfully belong to it. Otherwise, sooner or later, the  question will be raised in many quarters whether it is right for  the world to be governed by a club whose members' only  qualification is their economic and military strength.    Take the painful experience of the crisis in Yugoslavia.  Strong as they are, the Great of the world have proved unable  to prevent it, indeed they have ended up by encouraging it,  precisely because there were no instruments for preventing it.  This is what needs doing: creating them in as short a time as  possible. Placing this issue on the Naples agenda would be a  sign of awareness and responsibility.    Take the debate surrounding the Partnership for Peace as  well. The West is inviting Russia simply to join. Russia is  replying that it is willing to accept, but that it asks for a  special status, to be granted to it on the grounds of its role  as a major power. This is another example of the subservience  of current Russian policy and of shortsightedness on the part of  the West. Instead of prioritizing the creation of European  structures, creating a security council for the CSCE, its own  peacekeeping force, etc., and subsequently looking into the  possibility of using NATO structures in this context, the  factors are being inverted and NATO, which was created for the  purposes of the Cold War, is being extended, quite apart from  everything else.    Is this merely an error? I fear something more serious, a  prolongation of the old logic of supremacy that the West is  continuing to impose. The 50th anniversary celebrations for the  opening of the second front give pause for bitter thought and  concern. They have been presented in an unacceptable,  unilateral manner, as if victory came about thanks to the  decisive contribution of a single side of the coalition. This  is not only a distortion of historical truth and an attempt to  diminish the Soviet Union's crucial role in defeating Nazism.  It is a symptom of a resurgence of ideology.    The fact that the opening of the second front was seriously  delayed and that, as a result, the USSR was left alone to fight  on the "first front" has been willfully forgotten and glossed  over. This cost the population millions of victims, and it would  have been right to commemorate them on this occasion. For the  sake of argument, I could retort that Russia would have been  glad to celebrate the anniversary a year ago, because it would  have meant that the Normandy landing had taken place not in  1944, but in 1943, when the USSR was entrenched in Stalingrad,  when it was on the verge of catastrophe, when the troops were  given the fateful order, number 227: "Not a single step back."    It is not my intention to underestimate the military and  political significance of the Normandy landing. It reflected  the spirit of the coalition, it was essential. But the outcome  of the war had been decided by then, largely thanks to Soviet  efforts.    President Clinton has mentioned the fact that the world  "would have been a different place" without the Normandy  landing, almost as if to say that the USSR was against it, as it  was aiming to conquer Europe. This is worrying, as it  contradicts the most elementary historical truth, the very  interpretations of the then leaders, Roosevelt and Churchill  included. But it also a sign of something worse: the desire to  ignore common goals, the joint efforts to put an end to the Cold  War and to build a new Europe and a new world order without  suspicion and barriers.    The current Russian leadership has chosen to turn a blind  eye, taking everything in its stride on the grounds that "it has  always been that way." It is true, that was how it was. But  anniversaries were celebrated differently then. We were not  invited and we knew why: We belonged to different, opposing  blocs. But not being invited today takes on another, unpleasant  meaning, because we are partners now. I would say more:  Present-day Germany and Italy should have attended as well, as  that victory now represents a value common to all democracies.    It will be advisable to reflect on why this did not happen.  It could mean that there are still those who have barriers and  curtains in mind, and are ready to rebuild them.</p>

Aleksandr Pochinok, deputy chairman of the budget committee,  said there are no major divergences from the original version.  The deficit has risen from 61.2 trillion rubles to 62.4  trillion. This is due to a minor increase in the budget's  expenditure allocations. Aleksandr Pochinok noted that the  budget is fairly tough and the deficit is completely acceptable.  At the same time he stressed that the government is again  trying, via budgetary laws, to change the tax legislation.</p>

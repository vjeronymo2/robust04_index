			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 5 Apr (TANJUG) -- Vladimir Lukic, prime  minister of the Srpska republic, told TANJUG today that the  authorities of the Srpska republic have taken all measures to  bring to justice the perpetrators of the deplorable events in  Prijedor as soon as possible.    "Some international humanitarian organizations were in a  rush  to make the Prijedor events into a spectacle, with the clear  intention of accusing the authorities of the Srpska republic of  attempting to carry out a systematic eviction of the Muslim  population," Lukic said. He added that although there have been  some excesses, the civilian and military authorities of the  Srpska republic have been doing everything to minimize their  number.    "It is regrettable that the international humanitarian  organizations do not see the real state of affairs on the  territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is a fact that the  human rights of Serbs living in Muslim and Croat territories are  under much greater threat," Lukic said, citing as an example the  position of the Serbs in Sarajevo, Konjic, Zenica, and Tuzla.    He stated that the best confirmation of the situation  regarding human rights and the rights of national minorities is  the fact that many Muslims do not wish to leave the territory of  the Srpska republic, because they feel completely safe and  protected.</p>

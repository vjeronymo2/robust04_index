			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Taiwan Aerospace - the one-year-old with big ambitions FOR A company almost exactly one year old, Taiwan Aerospace (TAC) could be accused of running before it can walk. Despite having less than 100 staff, invested capital of about USDollars 200m (Pounds 120m) and only one small factory, it has been courting the world's largest aerospace companies offering fresh cash for Western technology. Last November it reached preliminary agreement to buy 40 per cent in McDonnell Douglas' commercial aircraft division for up to USDollars 2bn. Both sides say discussions are continuing, but observers in Taiwan say talks have stalled. Following this setback, yesterday's announcement of a 50/50 joint venture with British Aerospace's regional aircraft division gives TAC the chance to prove it is able to execute, as well as dream up, the big idea. TAC was set up in September 1991 to negotiate joint production agreements with foreign aircraft manufacturers and link them with Taiwanese sub-contractors. The largest shareholder is the government with 29 per cent. Other shareholders include some of Taiwan's largest companies such as shipping group Evergreen and plastics giant Formosa. But the thinking behind TAC goes back further. After Taiwan's rapid economic growth as a low cost manufacturing centre, the island lost competitiveness in the 1980s as wage and land costs increased sharply. In an effort to upgrade its industrial base, the government designated ten strategic industries which it pledged to foster. Aerospace was one of the most important. Spurned by international arms suppliers until recently because of worries over China relations, Taiwan had already been forced to develop with foreign assistance its own military aircraft, the Indigenous Defence Fighter (IDF). This has received mixed reviews, but the government was concerned that because its programmes were military, key aerospace-related technology was being denied the private sector. Starting in 1990, it set up two government agencies to co-ordinate the public and private sectors and inject aerospace technology into industry. Finally, with the creation of TAC, it launched a high-profile procurer of foreign technology. Under the memorandum of understanding signed yesterday, final assembly of BAe's RJ family will be split, initially at least, between the UK and TAC's factory in central Taiwan. Mr Charles Masefield, president, BAe regional aircraft, said there will be 'no limit' on technology transfer to Taiwan. It could include transfer of BAe's wing design aerodynamics, used on the European Airbus, as well as electronics and avionics, he said. In return, BAe will receive about Pounds 135m for 50 per cent of the division, and access to Asia through a cheaper manufacturing base. Mr Denny Ko, president, TAC, estimated skilled Taiwan labour costs are 30 per cent below Europe. BAe said it can cut costs 20 per cent to 25 per cent by moving to Asia. Precise details on where components will be manufactured have not been agreed. Other, cheaper Asian locations may be used. BAe already makes undercarriage doors for the 146 aircraft in north east China. Mr Masefield said the proportion of manufacturing transferred from the UK would depend 'entirely on whether it is cost effective'. The joint venture is due to begin operations on January 1 next year. Before then the two sides will decide how it is to be structured. They have agreed already, however, that marketing and support will be co-ordinated on a worldwide rather than regional basis. Aerospace analysts in Taiwan said the joint venture was likely to be a good deal for TAC. There are fears, however, that TAC is trying again to link up with a troubled Western aerospace company. Doubts also remain how substantial a company TAC really is. This is mainly because of the perceived failure to agree although there are fears again doubts remain about how substantial a company it is. This is mainly because of the perceived failure to agree terms with McDonnel Douglas. Mr Ko said TAC's factory, which only recently started production of some small parts for the IDF, could quickly be expanded with up to 300 more workers. 'The advantage with BAe is that we are getting in on a deal which is on-going. That makes it easier to raise the money,' he said. Under an agreement reached when TAC was set up, shareholders are due to increase their investment by NTDollars 4.2bn later this year, lifting TAC's capital base to NTDollars 5.5bn.</p>

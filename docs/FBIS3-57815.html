			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dirk Achten: "Understandable"] </F>   [Text] A demoralized General Francis Briquemont, the  Belgian commander of the UN forces in Bosnia, is bitter in his  criticisms of the international community, the United Nations  and the European Union. The UN Security Council passes lofty  resolutions, creates safe areas, on occasion makes threats, but  on the ground the resources are lacking to even start with these  tasks. It is enough to make a person despair, and clearly  things have reached a point where they make even the general in  charge feel unusual bitterness.    In his first weeks on the ground, Briquemont thought that he  had some power to stop the arbitrariness and madness. When  Serbian militiamen shot at his troops in July, he threatened  retaliation if it happened again. A day later that situation  indeed arose and nothing could be heard from the tough general.  When two weeks later NATO, which is after all not an unknown  institution to a Belgian soldier, said it was in favour of  possible bomb attacks on Serbian positions, Briquemont was a  vehement opponent. The confusion is total, he said, and my  soldiers are dispersed. In these circumstances bombing would  solve nothing.    Half a year later the confusion is still total and  Briquemont's UN soldiers are part of it. Who still knows what  the UN has come to Bosnia to do? To give food to the needy, who  then fight on or are shot dead? To protect safe areas? To  sponsor negotiations? To clean things up a bit? Or simply to  wander around, a question of knowing what is going on?    Therefore General Briquemont's demoralization is not  surprising. He tried and then discovered that it did not lead to  much. He thought that the persuasive power of the African  discussion would produce some result. He hoped for an  international community which could impose respect and had a  clear objective. Of course that was not the case. The UN  soldiers in Bosnia are taking part in terminal care and like  indignant tourists watch ethnic cleansing and the destruction of  a piece of European culture.    And even that is not without risk. Every now and then a UN  soldier dies. Recently a group of Canadian soldiers was  kidnapped and mistreated by Serbian militiamen. The incident  was noted and it was hoped that it would go no further. The  West, the United States, and certainly Europe does not want a  firm intervention. The policy is one of containment, the  Bosnian conflict must remain limited, a local issue. Within  these limits much, if not anything, can happen. So that less and  less people still follow the news, so that Bosnia becomes  folklore, the little local war which can provide striking images  now and then, but ever less frequently.    And further? Foreign Affairs Minister Willy Claes is very  angry with the Serbians -- in any case he has been angry with  them many times in the past -- and is threatening new sanctions  to stop aggressive Serbian expansionism. As if sanctions have  any effect here any more. A clearly outlined policy on this  Serbian violence, with support to victims and neighbors and a  clear message to Serbia, is a very different matter.    But, as Claes of course knows, that presupposes some  unanimity within the European Union on this conflict. What is  involved here is not a large-scale military intervention, but an  assessment of the situation. It seems that Europe is not able  to even manage that. The general, who must sort things out on  the ground in these circumstances, is becoming depressed. A  perfectly understandable reaction.</p>

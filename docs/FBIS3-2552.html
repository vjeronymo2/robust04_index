Lin Sheng chaired the closing ceremony. Executive chairmen  including Sun Qi, Lin Sheng, Liu Mingjiu, Yue Weichun, Wang  Suzhi, Gao Qingzhou, Zhang Lingyun, and Zhang Chenglun were  seated on the rostrum. Former Chairman Xu Shaofu and former  Vice Chairmen Weizhi, Wu Jianan, Zhang Yan, Yu Jingqing, Shen  Xianhui, Chen Yanzhi, Liu Qisheng, and Li Ming attended the  session as nonvoting members.    At the session, (Zhang Jueyun) reported on examination of  motions at the second session of the seventh provincial CPPCC  committee on behalf of the motions examination committee. The  session adopted the resolution on the work report of the  standing committee of the provincial CPPCC committee, the  resolution on the work report of the motions examination  committee, and the resolution on the second session of the  seventh provincial CPPCC committee.    The resolution called on all CPPCC members; the CPPCC  organizations, democratic parties, and mass organizations at  various levels across the province; and the personages of all  circles to work with one heart and soul under the leadership of  the Liaoning Provincial CPC Committee and to make positive  contributions to fulfilling the 1994 reform and construction  tasks.    Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, made  a speech at the session.    He said: In the past year, the provincial CPPCC committee  held high the banners of patriotism and socialism;  conscientiously exercised the functions for political  consultation and democratic supervision; positively participated  in and discussed political affairs; and did a lot of work and  produced wide influence in promoting reform, expanding the scale  of opening up, establishing contacts, eliminating  contradictions, promoting social stability, promoting the  building of socialist spiritual civilization and socialist  democratic politics, expanding the contacts with the people at  home and abroad, and promoting the peaceful reunification of the  motherland. The provincial CPPCC committee organized its  members, democratic parties, CPPCC organizations to engage in  the activities of suggesting ways and means particularly for the  promotion of progress in the second pioneering work. Thus, many  valuable opinions and suggestions were set forth. All this has  made positive contributions to promoting the progress of reform  and opening up.    Gu Jinchi said: The year 1994 is a year to accelerate the  setup of the socialist market economic system. The new  situation of setting up the socialist market economic system has  set new higher demands on the CPPCC work. We hope that the  CPPCC organizations at various levels will conscientiously  exercise the functions for political consultation and democratic  supervision, suggest better ways and means for setting up the  socialist market economic system, closely grasp the two major  subjects of unity and democracy, and do a lot of work to  safeguard social and political stability. We should  conscientiously study ways for bringing into better play the  CPPCC's functional role in the new situation of setting up the  socialist market economic system and continue to create a new  situation in the CPPCC work.    Sun Qi, chairman of the provincial CPPCC committee, made a  speech at the closing ceremony.    Sun Qi said: During the session, all participants, with a  high-degree sense of responsibility and mission, positively  participated in and discussed the political affairs in line with  the provincial actual conditions of economic construction,  reform, and opening up. All democratic parties positively  conducted their functions for participating in political affairs  and talked freely. This has embodied the close ties of showing  utter devotion to and sharing weal and woe with the CPC. I  believe that through the concerted efforts of all members, all  tasks as defined at this session will be realized successfully,  and the provincial CPPCC committee will further improve its work  of participating in and discussing political affairs and make  greater progress in its work in the new year.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATH OF RAIDER TORAN STIRS EMOTIONAL GAMUT FROM SADNESS TO ANGER  </P> <P> I was disgusted by the attitude displayed by Vann McElroy in the wake of the  Stacey Toran tragedy. I believe that McElroy is quite mistaken: Operating a  motor vehicle after drinking enough alcohol to raise one's blood-alcohol level  to over three times the legal limit certainly makes one "less of a man."  </P> <P> What a depressing contrast to the uplifting story of Dave Dravecky.  </P> <P> BRUCE A.

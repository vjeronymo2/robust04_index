AFP's  Beijing bureau chief, Gilles Campion, filed a verbal protest  with the authorities after police seized the camera of  photographer Manuel Ceneta and opened it up to expose the film.    Witnesses said several hundred people had gathered behind  security barriers on the eastern side of the square to watch  delegates leave the Chinese parliament building. At about 10:45  a.m. (0245 GMT), two protesters stationed at different parts of  the square hurled pamphlets at the passing delegates. Uniformed  and plainclothed police, who have been controlling access to the  square since parliament opened its annual session on March 10,  quickly moved to disperse the crowd, seal off the area and  destroy the photographer's film.    The official news agency Xinhua later issued a dispatch  quoting a foreign ministry spokesman, who criticised AFP. It is  "improper for foreign journalists to cover news in China without  going through necessary formalities," the dispatch cited the  spokesman, who was not identified, as saying. "The spokesman  also said that two Chinese women were stopped by other citizens  for disturbing public order this morning," the agency said,  without saying whether the two had been arrested or had any  connection with the pamphlet incident.    Tiananmen Square was the scene of massive pro-democracy  protests which were crushed by the army during the night of June  3-4, 1989.    Dissidents and intellectuals have made several attempts to  put across their pro-democracy and pro-human rights views ever  since delegates began arriving from all over China for the  parliament session.    Three open letters have been sent to delegates, but Monday  was the first time dissidents have openly defied the police.    Before the session began police launched a massive  intimidation campaign with the arrest of some 15 dissidents,  forcing some of the better-known to stay away from the capital  while parliament met. Four foreign correspondents were briefly  held for questioning by police after they met with dissidents  during the visit to Beijing by US Secretary of State Warren  Christopher March 11 to 14.</p>

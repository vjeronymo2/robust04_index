			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Havel by Robert Tamchyna at the </F> Lany presidential residence in Prague on 27 February; from the  "Conversations at Lany" program -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [Tamchyna] Incompetence or going beyond one's  authority--these were the words used in connection with the  personal initiative by Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys on  resolving the conflict in the Balkans. These are the final  assessments, I would say. I think, however, that you, given  your position, have been trying to find some rational  explanation of this unusual political move, as it were, because  this move ignored a minister's subordination to government  policy. Have you found this explanation?    [Havel] This appears to be a popular topic these days, and  one is reluctant to comment further on it because many comments  have already been made. Nevertheless, it seems to me that it is  my duty to add a little more.    I am unable to find a proper explanation. Minister Baudys's  intention was undoubtedly noble. But the whole matter was so  dilettantish that it broke all of the elementary rules of  diplomacy, politics, and so on. This was almost shocking. I  firmly believe that the sensation it caused and the degree of  shame it generated for our Republic is perhaps a sufficient  lesson to all of us to exercise caution.    At issue here is not merely the fact that Minister Baudys  failed to consult our constitutional officials on his original  idea, whose content was very contentious, by the way. The point  here is that this is not the way in which international  initiatives should be pursued. [passage omitted]    It was so absolutely dilettantish from start to finish, and  I  firmly hope that nothing of this kind will ever be repeated.  But, should that be the case, the consequences of it would have  to be more serious.    [Tamchyna] Conditions of the NATO ultimatum to Bosnia have,  on the whole, been met. The world can take a deep breath in the  few days to come. Mr. President, despite all of this, don't you  feel that Minister Baudys's personal position, presented to the  world, or the discrepancies between your statement and the  statement by the Czech prime minister could send a signal to the  world that our foreign policy is not completely united on this  currently very important issue?    [Havel] The fact that representatives of the same state hold  contradictory views does not, of course, create a very good  impression. [passage omitted]    The fact is, however, that the state must have its own  foreign policy and direction, which it has. I think that, in  principle, all of us are acting within the foreign policy  constraints. In some cases, it might appear that some have gone  beyond these constraints. It appears that all of them should  give careful thought to what they are saying, and they should be  aware that thinking aloud, which is often well intended, can  give an altogether different impression once journalists get  hold of it. [passage omitted]    [Tamchyna] In the light of some political evergreens  repeatedly discussed by the government, it seems that the fine  and sensitive fabric of relations within the ruling coalition is  not always as firm as it should be. Mr. President, in this  context, what do you think about the two election bills [on  local and Senate elections] approved by the government this week?    [Havel] First, I am pleased to see that these bills have  actually been passed by the government and that they will soon  go through the parliament. Given that local elections and  elections to the Senate are scheduled for this fall, it is high  time to get these bills ready. I think that retaining the  principle of a combined electoral system in the bill on  elections to local and city councils is a good thing. [passage  omitted]    As for the elections to the Chamber of Deputies and the  Senate, it is absolutely proper, and I think that it is a good  thing that elections to the Chamber of Deputies should be based  on the proportional representation system and that, as  prescribed by the Constitution, elections to the Senate should  be based on the majority system.    I do not wish to declare this categorically, but I myself  favor the principle of small-sized constituencies with one seat.  This was agreed by the government. This is, indeed, a clear  majority system as prescribed by the Constitution. From the  voters' point of view, the system is easier to understand; I  think it is correct. [passage omitted]</p>

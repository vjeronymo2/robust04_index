			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THEATER NOTEBOOK: ON THE STAGE, AN APRIL FILLED WITH SPRING OPENINGS  </P> <P> Passover gets the performance treatment at Highways in Santa Monica on April  10, when the traditional Seder will be celebrated with a mix of old and new  ritual: readings from the Haggada both ancient and feminist, Middle  East-inspired food, performance and music -- on the flute, guitar and  saxophone.  </P> <P> (The Seder is a religious meal accompanied by the retelling of the Jews' escape  from Egypt; the Haggada is the biblical narrative.) "Not all of us are Jewish,"  said Robin Podolsky, one of the seven people who assembled the evening. "And  within those of us who are Jewish, there's a real range. For instance, I'm  quite secular; my spiritual practice is as eclectic as you can get. Malcolm  Boyd knows more about liturgy than anyone. And Brian Zeiden is a student of  religion -- and quite observant."  </P> <P> The unifying intent, she added, "was to consciously re-create the link between  theater and ritual. For a lot of us, there's a memory and affinity for the  ritual of Seder -- sitting around the table as a child -- and wanting to say,  'This is what we do in our lives: tell stories to make sense of the world.' As  critical thinkers, we try to take those stories apart. As actors we try to put  the magic back, albeit informed with understanding."  </P> <P> The seven, who for the most part are either gay, lesbian or people with AIDS,  have also sought to include the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict by  inviting a dozen Middle Eastern artists to participate. "The story of the Seder  is the narrative thread that pulls the evening together," Podolsky said.  Participants are asked to provide an offering: a music performance or symbolic  reading, food (only unleavened bread will do) or goods such as candles and  incense. Admission is $5.  </P> <P> This month in theater:  </P> <P> Today: Two one-acts by Julia Rader, "Found Naked" and "A Poisonous Gas From  Another Planet" -- on, respectively, a morning in a mental hospital and a  menage a quatre, open at the Powerhouse in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> * Monday: "Monday at Stages" opens at Stages Trilingual Theatre in Hollywood,  featuring weekly performances incorporating poetry, music, movement, video and  stories.

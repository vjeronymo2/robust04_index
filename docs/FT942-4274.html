			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Water hit by Pounds 8.4m Amtec charge Unhappy diversification dragged down profits at Northumbrian Water which yesterday announced a 9.5 per cent decline at the pre-tax level to Pounds 62.8m, on sales 18 per cent ahead to Pounds 298.6m. The rate of dividend increase has been maintained in spite of the profits decline. The proposed final is 16.2p against 15p, bringing the total to 24.3p - 8 per cent higher than last year. Earnings fell by 17 per cent to 83.5p. Profits were hit by an Pounds 8.4m charge for withdrawing from the loss-making pipe maintenance company, Amtec, which had been announced at the interim stage. Northumbrian said uncertainty surrounding the current price review had held back orders for Amtec. 'People are just not committing expenditure on that activity until they know the results of the review,' the company said. Amtec was one of Northumbrian's earliest diversifications after privatisation, purchased for about Pounds 5.8m. The core water and sewage division returned operating profits 21 per cent up at Pounds 80.8m, on sales 7 per cent higher at Pounds 225.7m. Unlike its fellow water companies, Northumbrian saw an 11 per cent increase in raw water delivered for industrial use. The non-regulated businesses, which include an environmental consultancy operation and waste management, incurred operating losses of Pounds 3.3m, against a profit of Pounds 2.9m. Northumbrian said the integration of the environmental consultants purchased from Simon Engineering last year was proceeding according to plan. The company has admitted mistakes in the past over the integration of Amtec. It said no further acquisitions in this business were planned until Entec was fully in hand. Northumbrian sought to stress its financial strength, with cash flow rising from Pounds 36.1m to Pounds 146.7m. This reflected the release of funds invested in leasing, the group said. Total investment in leasing fell from Pounds 96.7m to Pounds 50.4m. Net debt as a proportion of shareholders' funds fell from 14 per cent to 8 per cent. COMMENT There are two things to consider about Northumbrian: its track record on diversification and its financial strength. On the first issue, the Amtec experience has been a disaster. The group's strategy also seems uncertain, being based on a variety of businesses, none of which seems to stand out bar waste management. On the other hand, Northumbrian has managed to retain one of the highest dividend covers in the sector, in spite of the Amtec upset, and it is only just geared. Most expect Northumbrian to receive a higher than average increase in the current price review, due to its heavy capital commitments. Forecasts are for Pounds 77.5m, with a further 8 per cent divvie rise to 26.4p. The shares are likely to remain jittery until after the review.</p>

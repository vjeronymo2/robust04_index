			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> 366 DRUNK-DRIVING SUSPECTS ARRESTED  </P> <P> Orange County law enforcement authorities, armed with a tougher legal standard  for drunkenness, arrested at least 366 people on suspicion of driving while  under the influence of alcohol over the Labor Day weekend.  </P> <P> Three people were killed on the county's freeways during the long weekend in  two traffic accidents that the California Highway Patrol said involved drunk  driving.  </P> <P> There were scores of minor alcohol-related traffic accidents reported  throughout the county between 6 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Tuesday, officials said.  </P> <P> The CHP's three Orange County bureaus reported that 167 motorists were arrested  for driving while under the influence of alcohol on the county's freeways.  </P> <P> In Westminster, CHP officers reported 59 arrests, more than double the number  the station made last Labor Day weekend, and the most arrests over a three-day  weekend in years, CHP Officer Lyle Whitten said.  </P> <P> Whitten attributed much of the increase in arrests to more vigorous enforcement  and a new law that lowered the legal standard for drunkenness to a a  blood-alcohol level of 0.08%. The previous standard was 0.10%.  </P> <P> Whitten said 9% of the Labor Day weekend arrests were of persons who met the  lower standard. "They would have driven away last year," Whitten said.  </P> <P> Whitten also said, however, that it appears that more people are drinking and  driving, despite heavy advertising campaigns aimed to discourage the illegal  practice.  </P> <P> "Drunks are out there killing innocent people," Whitten said. "That's the  reason we are putting so much emphasis on drunk driving. (But) you'd think DUI  would be reduced, not increased, because of enhanced enforcement."  </P> <P> CHP Officer Angel Johnson said the Santa Ana office arrested 63 motorists  suspected of driving under the influence, five less than last year.  </P> <P> And CHP Officer Ken Daily said officers stationed in the San Juan Capistrano  office made 45 DUI arrests, compared to 25 last Labor Day weekend.  </P> <P> Police in two cities -- Laguna Beach and Brea -- set up one-day sobriety  checks, making 32 drunk-driving arrests over the weekend.  </P> <P> "It was a great weekend," Laguna Beach Police Sgt. Raymond Lardie said.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department and the Anaheim, Costa Mesa, Newport Beach and  Huntington Beach police departments each reported making more than 15 DUI  arrests.  </P> <P> Police in Cypress, Fountain Valley, Fullerton, Garden Grove, Irvine, La Habra,  La Palma, Placentia, Seal Beach, San Clemente, Tustin and Westminster all  reported arresting fewer than 10 drivers suspected of being drunk.  </P> <P> "That's pretty low considering there was special enforcement out," Garden Grove  Police Lt. Ron Weigand said. "People were obviously acting good."  </P> <P> Santa Ana and Orange police officials said they were unable to provide the  number of DUI arrests made in their cities over the weekend.  </P> <P> The only city that reported making no arrests of drunk-driving suspects was Los  Alamitos.  </P></p>

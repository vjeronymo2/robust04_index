			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> AMTRAK PLATFORM PLANS UNDER REVIEW  </P> <P> Construction of an Amtrak passenger stop in Ventura could begin as early as  February, city officials said.  </P> <P> Ventura Redevelopment Administrator Miriam Mack said city engineers are  reviewing the proposal's final plans, and bids will be solicited as soon as the  review is complete.  </P> <P> The 300-foot-by-12-foot passenger stop will be located on Harbor Boulevard west  of Figueroa Street, across from the Ventura County Fairgrounds.  </P> <P> Mack said the city's main concern is ensuring that the four- to six-month  construction does not coincide with next year's Ventura County Fair. She said  if a bid isn't awarded by January or February, the city could have to delay  building until the fair is over.  </P> <P> The passenger platform will cost about $500,000, and the city is seeking a  $250,000 grant from Caltrans to help fund the project, Mack said.  </P> <P> The Amtrak San Diegan, which stops at Santa Barbara and Oxnard, will stop at  Ventura four times a day when the platform is complete.SCOTT LAWRENCE  </P></p>

Commenting on the development of the peace process in the  Middle East following the vicious massacre of Hebron last month,  the Jeddah-based AL-MADINAH cited statements made recently by  the Israeli Prime Minister Rabin and a high-ranking Israeli  general and said the statements made it clear that Israel does  not sincerely interest in peace and talking about peace is just  for local consumption and for wasting time. [passage omitted]    For its part, 'UKAZ, also published in Jeddah, expressed  surprise on the American latest positions on the peace process  in the Middle East and said the American stand would not remove  obstacles that hinder realisation of a peaceful settlement.    The paper criticized the U.S. attempts to prevent the  Security Council from making a resolution to denounce the  massacre of Hebron. It also deplored a statement attributed to  President Clinton recently on the status of al-Quds [Jerusalem]  as an insult for the Arab and Moslim people.    The paper cited the importance of an international  protection  for the residents of the occupied lands before making any  breakthrough in peace talks. [passage omitted]</p>

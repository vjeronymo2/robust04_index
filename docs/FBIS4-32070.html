			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav </F> Jovanovic by Edouard Van Velthem; place and date not given]    [Text] [Van Velthem] In the past week, the latest  cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina seems to be holding. Is this  good news for Belgrade?    [Jovanovic] Certainly. We want to see a complete cessation  of hostilities without any conditions and have been arguing for  this for several months already.    [Van Velthem] From the start the Yugoslav Government has  defended the European plan for the partition of Bosnia. Is it  at the same time exerting pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to  induce them to accept this peace process?    [Jovanovic] I do not believe this is necessary. The Bosnian  Serbs are resolutely constructive in this respect. They  accepted the 49 percent allocation of territory several months  ago now during negotiations on the British aircraft carrier  "Invincible," and confirmed this accord in Brussels when the  Twelve submitted their action plan. Today, without making any  objection in principle, they are primarily seeking to improve  not the quantity but the quality of the territories allocated to  each side. Radovan Karadzic reminded Andrey Kozyrev of this  when he met with him in Moscow earlier in the week.    [Van Velthem] With respect to Russia, there is rather the  impression of a coldness between Moscow and Belgrade since the  angry outburst against the Bosnian Serbs by Mr. Churkin, Mr.  Yeltsin's emissary.    [Jovanovic] That is a false impression. What happened  between Mr. Churkin and Mr. Karadzic is purely a matter for  them, we were only indirectly involved. Our relations with  Russia remain good, there is mutual trust, and there is no lack  of communication.    [Van Velthem] If political dialogue is renewed, are you  going  to demand guarantees on the lifting of sanctions against  Belgrade?    [Jovanovic] We have always been calling for this. It is  inseparable from progress in any peace process, the one is not  possible without the other. We also insist that the question of  lifting the embargo should be laid down in the agreement itself.  I am not saying that it must be lifted immediately and  automatically at the moment of signing, but it must be treated  as an unavoidable international obligation. The peace agreement  and the lifting of sanctions must be treated as twins in a sense.    [Van Velthem] What is today the economic situation of  Yugoslavia under the embargo?    [Jovanovic] There has been a clear, even spectacular,  improvement since the stabilization plan launched by Mr.  Avramovic, now the head of the National Bank. We are still a  long way from the day-to-day circumstances we would like, but  there has been a clear change in the past four or five months.  Hyperinflation has been checked, the dinar exchange rate is  holding up, and prices are stable. The energetic efforts by the  government to maintain this level has met with a much greater  serenity on the part of the population than previously. There  is also renewed respect for law and order, despite sporadic  incidents that are the direct result of the proximity of the war  in Bosnia. In short, compared with the tensions we previously  saw, there has been a general calming process at work, economic,  social, and even political. Most of the parties are coming  together in support of a core of national and state interests.  That was far from the case before.    [Van Velthem] In Bosnia itself, associations of Serb  citizens  are continuing to demand the preservation of the undivided,  multiethnic state. Do you support such initiatives?    [Jovanovic] It is not a movement, it simply serves the  pretensions of the Muslim authorities to be representative of  Bosnia's three communities. There are a small number of Serbs  there who are either "little collaborators" or people who are  unable to choose their position faced with the Muslim  authorities. But it is a marginal phenomenon. In Sarajevo, in  Zenica, or in Tuzla, the silent majority of Serbs still present  is simply waiting for the first opportunity to leave their  ghetto and join the territory of the Srpska republic. It is a  sad reality, but it must be acknowledged, and not only on the  Serbian side: Among the Croats and the Muslims too, there is  growing migration to return to regions controlled by their  nationals. These areas have seen a fratricidal war.    [Van Velthem] Peace in Bosnia would not be enough to bring  calm to the Balkans. Major questions remain open, Krajina or  Kosovo in particular.    [Jovanovic] The Krajina question is a part of the general  Yugoslav crisis. A procedure in three stages, which we support,  has already been launched between Knin and Zagreb. The  cease-fire has been achieved, the normalization of economic  relations will follow within the next few days, and the field  will then be clear to attack the most sensitive and most complex  objective, a permanent political solution.    Kosovo on the other hand is a separate issue, distinct from  the present Yugoslav crisis, internal to the Federal Republic  grouping together Serbia and Montenegro. It is a problem of  separatism that has existed for at least a decade. We have  guaranteed wide-ranging cultural, territorial, and  administrative autonomy to our two provinces, Voivodine and  Kosovo. We have no problem in the north because the populations  concerned exercise their prerogatives. In the south, on the  other hand, the Albanians refuse all dialogue, reject democratic  electoral procedures and boycott the institutions proposed to  them. We have always said that national minorities have the  right to develop their four principal identities, ethnic,  religious, linguistic, and cultural, and these needs are assured  by our new constitution.    [Van Velthem] Would this go as far as reestablishing the  internal autonomy previously granted by President Tito?    [Jovanovic] Albanian leaders themselves admit that this is  no  longer possible. The models of the past have become inadequate  for new circumstances. Yesterday's Yugoslavia no longer exists,  and the international community that did all it could to achieve  that should be the first to realize it.</p>

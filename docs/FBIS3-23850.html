			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Postnikov, corresponding member of </F> Russian Agricultural Academy and director of Scientific Research  Institute of Chemical Production and Technology, and Anatoliy  Kondratenko, chief specialist in Main Chemical Plant Protection  Administration of Russian Ministry of Agricultural Production:  "It Is Time To Gather...Fertilizer"]    [Text] Agrometeorological forecasts for the majority of  Russia's regions are completely favorable, promising good  conditions for ample precipitation in spring. Farmers feel that  this gift of nature cannot be dismissed. It will be important to  concentrate on local applications of complete fertilizers during  the sowing of spring crops. Their effectiveness will be higher  than ever, because of the extremely low content of nutrients in  the soil. Last year's negative balance of nitrogen, phosphorus,  and potassium--when the quantity of these removed from the soil  with the harvest and weeds was three times as great as the  quantity added to the soil in mineral and organic fertilizers.    In addition to this, even the meager remaining supply of  nitrogen was washed into the deepest layers of the soil by the  fall rains, and winter grain crops required top dressing almost  everywhere. Besides this, widespread blight and root rot are  expected, and these will have to be combated with protective  chemicals and with complete liquid fertilizers and phosphorus  and potassium solutions. In short, mixtures of fertilizers,  pesticides, and retardants will have to be applied on a broad  scale, mainly by agricultural aircraft.    In southern Russia this work should begin any day, but it  probably will not begin because the mineral fertilizer storage  bins of farms and associations of the Agricultural Chemicals  Administration are empty, and no one knows where the gasoline  for airplanes and helicopters will come from. The production of  mineral fertilizers has been stopped or is on the verge of being  stopped at the large chemical combines in Nevinnomyssk,  Tolyatti, Uvarovo, Kemerovo, Dzerzhinsk, Solikamsk, Cherepovets,  and Balakovo. There has been a corresponding dramatic decrease  in the demand for raw materials for fertilizer produced by the  Apatit, Uralkaliy, and Silvinit production associations. As a  result, last December agricultural producers obtained an average  of only 500 grams of nutritive substances per hectare of plowed  land.    In more specific terms, farms in Volgograd, Saratov, Kurgan,  Orenburg, Novosibirsk, and Omsk oblasts, Altay Kray, Kalmykia,  and Dagestan have two or three kilograms of mineral fertilizers  per hectare for this year's harvest. Farmers in the United  States use 100 kilograms per hectare, farmers in Germany use 400  kilograms, and in the Netherlands they use 800 kilograms per  hectare!    Last year's sad experience testified that the preferential  credits and 30-percent subsidy for mineral fertilizers and  pesticides in March resulted only in a sudden high demand for  them in April and May--i.e., at the height of the spring sowing  season, when chemical combines were unable to fill all orders in  such a short time. Furthermore, the state aid to agriculture  went astray in commercial banks.    Is this likely to happen again? It might. Secretary O. Lobov  of the Russian Federation Security Council informed the  president of the disastrous state of the production and use of  mineral fertilizers. On the last day of last year, B.N. Yeltsin  issued the appropriate instructions to the government. Now  almost a whole month has gone by. What has happened? No one is  doing anything, and it appears that no one plans to do anything.  After all, it will not be the first time the omnipotent Ministry  of Finance and Ministry of Economics have put the brakes on such  instructions.    Apparently, in the words of the biblical parable, it is time  to start gathering stones instead of scattering them. We see  only one solution: The state should pay chemical combines  directly for fertilizers, meliorative chemicals, and pesticides  delivered to the storage facilities of the Agricultural  Chemicals Administration. This is the only way agricultural  producers will be able to conduct agrochemical and protective  operations on the necessary scales and at the best possible  times.    This should not be viewed as aid to the rural community:  Agriculture not only produces food, but also provides jobs for  tens of millions of industrial workers in the chemical industry,  machine building, power engineering, transportation, and other  branches!</p>

Aerospatiale has just landed a third customer for its Eryx  missile, thus bringing the value of all its firm orders to 1.2  billion francs. Norway, following Canada--which by coincidence  is another "cold country"--has just purchased Eryx, "the only  short-range antitank missile for use by infantry units."  Lightweight and compact, the French missile is also the first  missile capable not only of being launched in close quarters but  also of damaging a heavy tank at close range (600 m).    According to the firm, the three Eryx orders received this  year [1993] cover a total of 14,400 missiles and 1,049  launchers. France has ordered 2,700 missiles and 200 launchers  to be supplied from the first two phases of production. Canada  signed up for 4,500 missiles and 425 launchers this past summer  at a total price, according to Aerospatiale, "on the order of  400 million francs." Norway has just ordered 7,200 missiles and  424 launchers for an announced figure of about 650 million  francs (with an option worth 300 million francs to be picked up  before the end of 1996).       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Over 14,000 Eryx Missiles Ordered                                          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Description       |France            |Canada            |Norway            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Missiles          |2,700             |4,500             |7,200             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Launchers         |200               |425               |424               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Contract*         |200               |400               |650               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |% offset          |0                 |100               |100               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |* In millions of francs.                                                   |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      That is the largest Eryx order received to date by the  French  firm, and it is the second to be received from a NATO country.  According to Aerospatiale, it is also "the largest defense  contract ever signed between France and Norway." Oslo is thus  becoming a good customer for French weapons and for French  missiles in particular, considering that Norway also ordered a  sizable batch of Mistral very-short-range surface-to-air  missiles from Matra Defense back in 1990.    The Eryx order was signed at Aerospatiale's head office in  Paris on 23 November by Odd I. Nielsen, director of the  Logistics Command of the Norwegian Army, and Jean-Louis Fache,  director of Aerospatiale-Missiles, in the presence of Norwegian  Minister of Defense Jorgen Kosmo and Norwegian Ambassador Arne  Langeland.    On that occasion, the Norwegian minister emphasized that  Eryx  is "another example of successful cooperation" between the two  countries in the field of armament. Louis Gallois, president and  CEO of Aerospatiale, described the contract as representing a  "real partnership combined with technology transfers." The  offset agreement was signed at the same time by J.-L. Fache and  Oivind Baekken, general director of armament. Aerospatiale  points out that those "high-technology" offsets involve  cooperation in research and development (risk analysis software  and image processing software engineering) and the co-production  of Eryx subsystems in Norway (the explosive charge by Raufoss in  cooperation with Dyno and the missile wing unit by the NFT).  Those components are being subcontracted for the entire Eryx  program, not just for the missiles intended for Norway, as was  the case previously with the Eryx tripods and sight units for  Canada. But Aerospatiale will maintain a unit for production of  the missile's wings, and Giat Industries will do the same with  respect to the explosive charge (of SERAT design).    The French Army has already taken possession of its first  mass-produced Eryx missiles, several dozen of which have been  fired this year [1993] in winter conditions, both in Canada and  in Norway. The Eryx has therefore qualified as a "cold-weather"  weapon but also as a "hot-weather" weapon thanks to firings in  Djibouti, says Aerospatiale. In all, according to the firm, the  number of missiles fired for evaluation and testing comes to  nearly 300.    Canada will take delivery of its first Eryx missiles at the  end of November [1993], and Norway will receive its missiles  early in 1995.    According to Aerospatiale, these three orders will keep the  Bourges plant busy producing about 500 missiles per month. The  current monthly production rate is only 150. But the firm says  that the monthly rate is going to increase: to 300 in the first  half of 1994 and 800 the year after that, after which it will  top out at 1,000 missiles per month by the end of 1995 or the  start of 1996. Aerospatiale expects to sell 50,000 Eryx missiles  between now and the end of 1988.</p>

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Sir John Prideaux: ex-bank head - Obituary SIR John Prideaux, chairman of National Westminster Bank during Britain's secondary banking crisis in 1974, has died aged 81. He attended Eton and entered banking in 1930 when he joined Arbuthnot Latham, a merchant bank connected with his mother's family. Sir John had been a territorial officer in the Middlesex Yeomanry and during the second world war served as a staff officer. As a colonel he served at Second Army headquarters. He joined the board of Westminster Bank in 1955, and became a director after the merger with National Provincial in 1968. Sir John served as chairman of National Westminster from 1971 to 1977. During the secondary banking crisis NatWest was the subject of intense speculation about heavy losses stemming from aggressive pursuit of domestic business and loans connected with the Italian financier Mr Michele Sindona. Sir John took the highly unusual step of issuing a public statement denying that NatWest faced any insolvency crisis, which effectively ended the speculation. Sir John was from 1977 to 1980 a member of the Wilson Committee which reviewed the functioning of City institutions. At the time the left wing of the Labour party was calling for nationalisation of banks. The committee recommended that no major changes be made. Sir John served as chairman of the Committee of London Clearing Bankers from 1974 to 1976 and was vice-president of the British Bankers' Association from 1972 to 1977. He was awarded an OBE in 1945 and knighted in 1974. His other interests included St Thomas' Hospital, where he was treasurer and chairman of the governors from 1964 to 1974, and the Goldsmiths Company where his family had been wardens for four generations. He became prime warden in 1972.</p>

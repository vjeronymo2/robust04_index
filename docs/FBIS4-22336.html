Zaveryukha, vice premier of the Government of </F> Russia: "Related Sectors, One Interest"]    [Text] Aleksandr Kharlampiyevich Zaveryukha was born  in the settlement of the Sovkhoz imeni Elektrozavod in  Novosergiyevskiy Rayon, Orenburg Oblast, in the prewar year of  1940. He began his labor activity as a tractor operator on his  native sovkhoz, from where he left to serve in the ranks of the  Soviet Army. He came to the first course of the Orenburg  Agricultural Institute with quite a rich life experience and  serious labor and army training, which, obviously, was useful.  The newly fledged agronomist grasped the rudiments of vocational  skills after graduation from the higher educational institution  when he assumed the post of chief economist of the Uran Sovkhoz  in his native Novosergiyevskiy Rayon. He grasped them very  successfully if after 3 years in the same rayon members of the  Komsomolskiy Kolkhoz elected him their chairman. He worked in  this post for 11 years.    In 1978 straight from the [post of] kolkhoz chairman,  bypassing intermediate levels of authority, A.Kh. Zaveryukha  right away was appointed deputy chief of the production  administration of agriculture in the oblast, which he headed  soon. Then he worked as first deputy chairman of the oblast  agro-industrial committee and as chairman of the oblast soviet  of agro-industrial formations. In 1992 he was appointed general  director of the All-Russian Scientific Production Association of  the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Beef Cattle  Breeding. He defended his dissertation without giving up his  work. He is candidate of economic sciences.    A.Kh. Zaveryukha, people's deputy of the Russian  Federation, vice premier of the Government of Russia, among  several national economic sectors, also manages the Russian  Federal Forest Service.    From time immemorial two concepts--forest and arable  land--have been indivisible in the consciousness of the Russian  man. Time has confirmed with all obviousness: They cannot be  examined separately--this is fraught with big losses. Successful  work by peasants largely depends on the state of the country's  agriculture and, naturally, they are vitally interested in  seeing to it that forestry affairs are conducted competently and  sensibly.    The state privatization program determines: Russia's forest  lands are federal property and are not subject to privatization.  The Federal Forest Service should now become the only owner of  Russian forests. However, at the beginning of 1993 about 80  percent of the country's forests were under its authority. As  before, 7 million hectares of plantings are under the authority  of various ministries and departments (the Ministry of Defense,  hunting establishments of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food,  and administrations of the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg).  The Federal Forest Service and its local bodies, fulfilling the  requirements of the new forest legislation, must immediately  accept all forests and bear responsibility for their  preservation and reproduction. When there is one owner in the  forest, it will be possible to solve the problems of  agricultural workers more successfully.    Agricultural workers count on forestry experts in many ways.  They hope that state bodies for the sector's management, jointly  with territorial bodies of power, will be able to solve the  problem of leasing available plots of forest lands on favorable  terms to timber cutters meeting the needs of rural dwellers for  lumber. It is also necessary to examine with territorial bodies  of power problems concerning the preferential supply of felled  and sawn timber for the rural population. It would be advisable  for the Russian Federal Forest Service to prepare on behalf of  the government recommendations to territorial bodies of power  about the free sale of dead-standing and windfallen trees to the  population.    In 1993 forestry establishments of the Russian Federal  Forest  Service procured 18 million cubic meters of timber by way of  improvement tree felling. This timber is used for the needs of  the local (basically rural) population. The production cost of  timber procured by forestry establishments is much lower than  that of commercial structures. Moreover, in accordance with the  president's edict the profit from the processing of timber from  improvement felling is not taxed. To increase improvement  felling volumes to scientifically substantiated norms and to  more fully meet the needs of the rural population for timber and  fuel are important tasks of forestry bodies. One would like  forestry bodies to pay more attention to the farms that are  being established. In particular, for their stabilization and  support the Federal Forest Service must develop a program for  leasing sections of forest lands to farmers on favorable terms.    Soil erosion does irreparable damage to land resources, the  environment, and our economy. The soil of eroded and  erosion-dangerous agricultural areas now makes up 56 percent.  Erosion annually devours about 1 and 1/2 billion tonnes of  fertile soil. The president of the Russian Federation and the  Government of Russia are disturbed by the existing situation  with the protection of land against degradation. Urgent actions  are necessary. The examination of this matter was referred to  the Security Council of the Russian Federation. In erosion  control it is difficult to overestimate the significance of  forest reclamation measures. Field-protective forest belts  ensure not only soil protection against erosion, but, at the  same time, greatly increase harvests and lower production costs.    The afforestation of gully and ravine systems eliminates  their desiccating and draining effect on adjoining territories  and brings destroyed lands back into the economic turnover. The  forest reclamation of sandy lands and arid pastures counteracts  deflation processes to a considerable extent and makes it  possible to obtain a variety of agricultural and forestry  products scarce in these regions. For example, 3 to 5 hectares  of sand in the Lower Volga Area put into agricultural turnover  under the protection of forest plantings are equivalent in plant  output to 1 irrigated hectare of high-grade soil. For the  complete protection of agricultural land in the Russian  Federation it is necessary to have 12.3 million hectares of  forest belts.    The long-term plan for anti-erosion measures determined the  immediate volumes of work on protective afforestation--5.1  million hectares. A total of 2.9 million--only one-fourth of the  scientifically substantiated need--were established. The program  for an increase in Russia's soil fertility envisaged the  establishment of 252,000 hectares of all types of protective  plantings in 1992-1993. According to preliminary data, execution  will make up 60 percent. Why have the volumes of work been  curtailed? Local agricultural enterprises refuse to allocate  land plots for forest plantings (this problem is aggravated  owing to the change in the forms of land ownership) and problems  concerning the financing of this work are solved poorly.    Russia's forests represent a vast storeroom for the  replenishment of food in the country through the use of  wild-growing berries, mushrooms, nuts, medicinal raw materials,  and other gifts of the forest. For now, however, these resources  are utilized poorly. In the last 2 years the procurement of  wild-growing fruits and berries has decreased by a factor of  five and of medicinal-technical raw materials, by a factor of  more than two. There is a similar picture with respect to other  indicators. But forestry experts in the Republic of Kalmykia and  in Vologda, Karachayevo-Cherkess, and Kemerovo forestry  administrations have been able to organize work quite well.    Russian forests have many honey-bearing resources, which  creates a good basis for the development of bee-keeping. This  potential is also by no means fully utilized everywhere. Whereas  Tatarstan annually procures honey at the level of 340 quintals,  Samara Oblast, 140, Altay Kray, 210, and Sakhalin, 335,  Krasnodar Kray, only at the level of 60 quintals and the  Republic of Mari El, 31. Honey production is also poorly  organized in a number of other regions.    Forestry establishments have plenty of opportunities to  develop subsidiary farms. However, the results of work in 1993  point to an alarming situation with the supply of products of  agricultural production. Whereas in 1991 subsidiary farms of  forestry establishments produced almost 12,000 tonnes of meat,  which is more than 30 kg per worker, in 1993 they produced only  about 8,000 tonnes. Forestry experts in Vladimir, Pskov,  Smolensk, and a number of other forestry administrations  unjustifiably refused to manage subsidiary farms. They  transferred up to 90 percent of the available livestock to  various structures under a department of the industrial sphere.    But forestry experts in the Udmurt Republic and Voronezh,  Tambov, Tula, Rostov, Kurgan, and Kemerovo oblasts, despite  difficulties, not only have preserved the production of  agricultural products, but also have a rise in basic indicators.  In brief, under the most difficult conditions of the  transitional period of the market economy, with a desire and a  skillful approach it is possible to have one's own meat, milk,  and other products, which becomes a good support for workers.    I deliberately do not dwell here on the "pure" problems of  forestry--a great deal is written about this in the pages of  LESNAYA GAZETA. Nevertheless, it is worth talking about one.    It is known that, owing to the reduction in production and  the sharp rise in the cost of machinery, the degree of equipment  of forestry establishments with labor-saving and ecologically  safe machines and mechanisms used in improvement felling, in  reforestation, and in other operations has dropped in recent  years. Therefore, proposals on granting goal-oriented  preferential credits for the purchase of machinery, which  contributes to an increase in the volumes of forest tending and  to an improvement in its quality, should be submitted to the  government.</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PIERCE MEN'S VOLLEYBALL TEAM OPENS DEFENSE OF STATE TITLE  </P> <P> The Pierce College men's volleyball team will attempt to defend its title today  when the Brahmas begin play in the four-team state junior college championships  at El Camino College.  </P> <P> Orange Coast, the South Coast Conference champion, will play West Valley of San  Jose at 10 a.m. Pierce, which finished second in the South Coast Conference,  will play Golden West at 2 p.m.  </P> <P> The winners of the semifinals will meet at 7 p.m. for the championship.  </P> <P> Orange Coast, with four starters back from the team that won the 1987 state  title, is favored to win the championship. The Pirates defeated Pierce twice  this season in matches that lasted four and five games.  </P> <P> "I think our kids will respond to the challenge," Pierce Coach Ken Stanley  said. "We are looking for that match with Orange Coast, but if we start looking  past our opening match, we're in trouble."  </P> <P> Pierce is led by outside hitter Rico Guimaraes, who was all-conference last  season, and middle blockers Turhan Douglas, Mark Grondan and Corey Davidson.  </P></p>

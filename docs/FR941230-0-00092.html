			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Amendment 6 and its implementing regulations, the eligibility requirements for a replacement vessel more than 5 ft (1.52 m) longer than the replaced vessel were significantly different from the requirements indicated in the August 28, 1990, notice. Under the final regulations, a replacement vessel more than 5 ft (1.52 m) longer than the qualifying vessel it replaces is eligible for a ``provisional A'' permit endorsed for the length of the longer vessel, but such a ``provisional A'' permit can be converted to a permanent ``A'' endorsement only if the vessel made Pacific groundfish landings in three successive 365-day periods after replacement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendment 6 provides sufficient rationale as to why a new entrant_that is, a vessel under contract for construction or conversion during the 1984 to 1988 window period_should have to meet a subsequent landing requirement to convert a ``provisional A'' endorsement to an ``A'' endorsement. Absent this requirement, any fishing vessel under contract for construction in any U.S. shipyard prior to August 1, 1988, would have been eligible for a limited entry permit, regardless of the actual intent of the owners to participate in the Pacific groundfish fishery. The landings requirement was thus a useful surrogate for confirming the owners' actual intent to operate in the fishery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to replacement vessels, however, the new landings requirement served to disqualify persons who were clearly committed to the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery through their prior participation, but had the misfortune of not knowing in advance that they would be subjected to a 3-year landing requirement for their new vessel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is reasonable to assume that some owners of qualifying vessels replaced those vessels prior to September 30, 1990, with larger vessels based on the expectation that they would be issued a limited entry permit endorsed with the size of the replacement vessel. A decision to grant these individuals an ``A'' permit endorsed with the size of the larger replacement vessel is consistent with the objectives of the FMP to ``accommodate historical participation'' and is consistent with the information on probable qualifying criteria available to the public prior to September 30, 1990. Therefore, NOAA has determined that those fishing vessel owners who replaced a qualifying vessel prior to September 30, 1990, with a larger vessel and who were denied ``A'' permits endorsed with the size of the larger replacement vessel were treated unfairly and should be issued ``A'' permits endorsed with the size of the larger replacement vessel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some individuals denied limited entry permits for larger replacement vessels in place prior to September 30, 1990, may have already purchased additional permits and combined them with a permit endorsed with the size of a smaller replaced vessel in order to obtain a permit endorsed with the size of the larger replacement vessel or may have sold the permit issued for the smaller vessel. NOAA intends to allow vessel owners in this circumstance to be granted a permit endorsed for a length overall which, if combined with a permit endorsed for the length overall of the replaced vessel, would result in a permit endorsed for the length overall of the replacement vessel. This will be determined based on the harvesting capacity ratings listed in 50 CFR 663.33(g). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Three faults caused big Tube breakdown A combination of three separate failures was responsible for the unprecedented breakdown which crippled a large part of the London underground network during the past six days, it was revealed yesterday. Much of the blame for the widespread failure was traced to two burnt-out cables in one of the two power stations supplying the network. But a fault in a cable running from the second power station and a defective transformer elsewhere combined to bring the system down, London Underground said. These faults led to the most serious breakdown on the Underground network since the second world war and prompted calls for increased spending on its ageing infrastructure. At one stage 20,000 people were trapped in trains in tunnels. London Underground said it expected to operate a full service from today. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said investment in the Underground was at its highest level for three decades in spite of complaints in the Commons from Labour MPs. Mr MacGregor also said that modernisation of the Central Line, which was at the heart of last week's chaos, amounted to Pounds 750m and was due to finish in 1995. Mr Denis Tunnicliffe, London Underground managing director, said Mr MacGregor was right, but that there were 30 years of underspending to make up. In addition, annual spending of up to Pounds 800m promised in 1991 had since been reduced by more than Pounds 200m a year. 'If we had received the money we were promised, the power supply system would have been more up-to-date,' he said. 'It is unattractive spending, with no charisma, but it is vital.' London Underground put the cost of the breakdown at Pounds 2m, because of lost revenue, ticket-holder compensation and the cost of 24-hour engineering work needed to track down the fault. The problems of the past six days might have been avoided if London Underground had been able to take power directly from the national grid, but only parts of the network are connected, Mr Tunnicliffe said. It is working on a project which will allow the entire Underground to draw on the grid. Engineers had originally been looking for the fault at the eastern end of the network. But discovered from data print-outs that the main problem, burnt-out cable, was at its Lots Road power station in Chelsea, west London. The Central Line had been worst affected because the equipment for shutting down the line in the event of a leakage of current was very old. It is to be replaced next year.</p>

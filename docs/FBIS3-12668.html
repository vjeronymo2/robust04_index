			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The newspaper HAMSHAHRI, published daily with a  circulation of 200,000, is undoubtedly one of Iran's most  successful newspapers. The secret of this success is not just  that this newspaper is full of content and variety and sells at  half the price--5 tomans--of the rest of Tehran's newspapers.  Nor is its success due only to the fact that it has a  professional and experienced staff. Sociologists and media  experts emphasize two other factors in this regard: One is the  fact that it is very appealing as a four-color newspaper with a  more attractive and orderly layout in a land where the  revolution has eliminated all colors other than black and white.  The other factor is that HAMSHAHRI is basically a "nonpolitical"  newspaper, in the sense that in reading and looking at it one  concludes that it does not insist on showing itself as a staunch  defender of the government and the revolution.    Informed observers say HAMSHAHRI has chosen all these  methods  and procedures according to a calculated plan. Whatever the  truth may be, it is clear that two newspapers, one of them  KEYHAN of Tehran and the other the heavyweight JOMHURI-YE  ESLAMI, make most of their attacks against HAMSHAHRI, with such  things as their criticism of the mayor for spending the "public  treasury" to publish a newspaper to make propaganda for himself.    Despite all this, no one knows whether this newspaper has  revenues and income or whether it really gets help from the  municipal government. If the opponents of the mayor and the  monthly HAMSHAHRI could do so, they would stop its publication,  but it seems that their power has not yet reached the newspaper,  even though one of the regime's most powerful clerics, Ayatollah  Khaz'ali, has said concerning the mayor that he is one step away  from a religious decree that he should be killed.</p>

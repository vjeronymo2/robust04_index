			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Revisions to the "Customs Procedures of the PRC Concerning </F> Levying Import Duties on Incoming Travelers' Luggage Articles  and Personal Postal Articles"]    [Text] Beijing, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- The newly revised  "Customs Procedures of the PRC Concerning Levying Import Duties  on Incoming Travelers' Luggage Articles and Personal Postal  Articles" ["procedures"] were promulgated recently.    The official in charge said: The "procedures" were  formulated  in April 1991 by the State Council's Tariffs Regulations  Committee. To accommodate the changes resulting from the  state's financial and taxation system reform and from the  adjustments in import duties, and to better implement the  state's industrial policy, the State Council's Tariffs  Regulations Committee, based on State Council Decrees 134 and  135, made revisions to the "procedures." The major revisions  are: First, the term "import duties," as it is referred to in  the "procedures," has been redefined. The definition of "import  duties" in the original "procedures" included customs duties and  industrial and commercial tax. Due to the turnover tax system's  reform, the term industrial and commercial tax has been canceled  and replaced with value-added tax and consumption tax. To  accommodate the change, relevant articles and provisions of the  "procedures" have been revised accordingly. Second, automobiles  and motorcycles have been removed from the list of taxable  luggage and postal articles, and import duties have been levied  on these items as ordinary import goods according to the "Import  and Export Duty Regulations of the Customs of the PRC," to  better manage imported automobiles and motorcycles and to better  carry out the state's industrial policy. Third, the term  "grain, grain powders" in the No. 1 "Table of Duty Rates" has  been changed to "food." Fourth, customs duties, value-added  tax, and consumption tax have been combined into one duty rate  to simplify tax levy procedures.    The official said: The aforementioned revisions do not  affect the regulations governing the amounts of taxable and  tax-exempted luggage articles of incoming travelers and incoming  personal postal articles.    It has been learned that the State Council's Tariffs  Regulations Committee's office is under the State Economic and  Trade Commission, and is responsible for carrying out work  delegated to it by the State Council's Tariffs Regulations  Committee.</p>

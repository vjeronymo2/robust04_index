			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo worries Pharmaceuticals leader Glaxo reversed gains achieved earlier in the week as one US house downgraded the stock. There were additional worries emanating from the company's Japanese arm and the shares fell 13 1/2 to 608 1/2p. The stock had risen sharply after the clean sweep by the Republican party was seen to have banged the nail in the coffin of the Clinton healthcare reforms. However, yesterday, one US research house Hambrecht &amp; Quist, which is believed to concentrate much of its firepower on the pharmaceutical sector took Glaxo off its buy list and moved the stock to a hold. The house said that although there might be some upside to the stock 'possible negative events are much closer on the horizon'. There was also news of the arrest of an assistant professor in western Tokyo for allegedly accepting more than Y100,000 in bribes from two Nippon Glaxo employees. The subsidiary denied the claims saying it had only paid legal research fees.</p>

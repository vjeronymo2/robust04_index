			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Groupe Bull decision on US partner is postponed DEEP differences within the French government have forced Groupe Bull to delay the announcement of its choice of a US equity and technology partner until next week. The loss-making, government-owned computer manufacturer had been expected to announce this week its choice between International Business Machines (IBM)and Hewlett Packard as a source of an important computing technology called 'Risc', which is expected to form a critical part of its product strategy for the remainder of the decade. The winning partner is expected to take an equity stake, thought to be between 5 and 10 per cent, as a token of its commitment to the relationship. IBM looks increasingly the likely winner. Last week, it was clear that Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, and the French Finance Ministry were in favour of IBM, while Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime minister, and Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, favoured Hewlett Packard. Mrs Cresson and Mr Strauss-Kahn are now thought to be reconsidering, although the decision could still go either way. A plan to link Bull with the profitable French Telecom is thought to have only Mrs Cresson's support. Brussels believes the company will sign a deal with IBM and use the agreement as justification for a FFr6bn (Dollars 1.1bn) subsidy from the French government. The EC is already examining the proposed subsidy under its competition laws. Mr Gerard Roucairol, Bull vice-president for corporate research, said yesterday the company was satisfied with the quality of the technology on offer from either of the US companies. Despite huge losses last year, Bull's transformation plan is beginning to work. It has managed to make FFr1bn of savings a year already, and has cut 9,000 staff, a quarter of the workforce.</p>

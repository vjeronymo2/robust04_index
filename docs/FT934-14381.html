			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Property: Chantilly race . . . SITED conveniently for a business family with racing interests, Chateau de la Chausee (pictured left) is 27 miles from Paris, 12 from Charles de Gaulle airport and little more than a mile from Chantilly, venue of the French Derby and a renowned training centre. The property, which has a British owner, overlooks the river Nonette. Parts date from the 18th century and the main structure was retained when the house was rebuilt by the Masson family in 1860. Accommodation includes drawing room, dining room and library, master bedroom suite and five other bedrooms. In the five-acre grounds are a staff lodge, two unmodernised cottages, a former chapel, tennis court, stables, garaging and paddocks. The gardens are a particular feature. London agent Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629 8171) suggests a guide price of Pounds 2.2m.</p>

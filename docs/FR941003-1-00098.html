			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) The Agency Official should collect available information, determine whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undertaking involves a programmatic action, a land management area, or a specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project, and carry out further identification by making a reasonable and good faith effort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to identify historic properties within the area of potential effects, with reference to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nature of the undertaking, its likely effects, and the extent of available information on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> historic properties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) In order to provide a reliable basis for a ``reasonable and good faith effort'' to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify historic properties subject to effect, agencies should:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Consult with the SHPO, local governments, Indian tribes, Native  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hawaiian organizations, and other Native American groups and traditional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cultural authorities, community organizations, academic institutions, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> others with knowledge of or concerns with history, culture, historic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preservation issues, and specific historic properties that may be affected;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Consult existing registers of historic properties, including but not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to the National Register of Historic Places and State and local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registers, reports of prior historic property surveys, and knowledgeable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projections of historic property distributions;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Review other existing information on historic properties potentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by the undertaking, including any data concerning the likelihood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that unidentified historic properties exist in the area of potential effect, and relevant background information sources on each areas history, prehistory,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> architecture, sociocultural characteristics, and cultural geography as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Determine to what extent available information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides a reliable basis for decisionmaking consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 106 requirements and 36 CFR Part 800, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the need for additional investigations given the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of alternatives under consideration, the scale of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undertaking, the nature and severity of likely effects, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accessibility of each area of potential effect, and similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Programmatic actions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For undertakings involving the potential effects of a program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on historic properties and historic and cultural values, the identification of historic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preservation issues and historic properties subject to effect should include agreement with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other consulting parties on a process for ongoing identification and evaluation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properties. This may include administrative modifications to or adaptation of the standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portions of the Section 106 process contained in the Council's regulations in &sect;800.8, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may categorize types of resources that will be subject to varying identification and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation methodologies. For example, a programmatic undertaking to maintain,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modernize, selectively staff, and partially abandon fire observation towers in national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forests nationwide could involve a long-term plan to use historic records to identify and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate historically significant  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> types <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of towers against agreed-upon criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Management and maintenance areas.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For undertakings involving the potential effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of land-use planning or maintenance practices for specific management units, such as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national park, national forest, military installation, Federal office complex, or similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discrete area, the identification of historic properties subject to effect should involve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporation of the process into a standard operating procedure for a General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management Plan, Historic Preservation Plan, Land Use and Resource Management Plan,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or similar comprehensive planning tool with an appropriate national, regional, or statewide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> context to evaluate the historic significance of identified resources. For example, ongoing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management activities for a Bureau of Land Management district should include a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuing program of sample field survey, predictive modelling, and regional evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria, tied to other resource management needs and operating procedures for mineral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exploration, range and timber management, road construction, fire control, and recreation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. (Such a program is also required under Section 110 of NHPA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Project areas.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For undertakings involving the potential effects of a specific action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or series of actions such as new construction, a decision needs to be made whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> large-scale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and complex, or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> small-scale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and less complex.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

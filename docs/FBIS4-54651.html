			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Number of People Intending To </F> Vote Is Increasing -- Forecast by Four Public Opinion Research  Companies"]    [Text]  <H5>  Szonda Ipsos </H5>   The Szonda Ipsos Media, Opinion, and Market Research company  has been collecting data on the views on political institutions,  parties, and politicians since the beginning of 1991. On the  basis of analyzing this data base and the latest -- April --  data, it prepared the following forecast for the first round of  the parliamentary elections to take place on 8 May.    The expected participation level (in percentage of people  entitled to vote) will be between 56 and 63 percent nationally;  the most likely participation level is 58 percent nationally.  Participation figures in the various areas (the counties and  Budapest) can significantly deviate from the national average in  both directions.    If the first round is valid in all 20 areas, namely more  than  half of the people entitled to vote participate in all counties  and Budapest then it is most likely that the parties that formed  parliamentary groups in 1990, and no other party, will again get  into Parliament. It is not completely impossible, but there is  very little chance for the Agrarian Federation, the Workers'  Party, and the Republic Party to reach the 5-percent limit.    If the first round is valid in all areas, then 130 to 135  mandates will be decided on the basis of the area lists.  Through this, the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] can get 62  to 68 seats, the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] 22 to 26,  the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] 15 to 19, the Federation of  Young Democrats [Fidesz] 12 to 17, the Christian Democratic  People's Party [KDNP] five to 10, and the Independent  Smallholders Party [FKGP] also five to 10 seats.    However, in contrast to 1990, we now have to consider the  possibility that the first round will not be valid in all areas  because less than 50 percent of the entitled people will vote.  Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg, Hajdu-Bihar, Bacs-Kiskun, and  Jasz-Nagykun- Szolnok counties have the biggest chance for this  but, considering a participation at around 58 percent, the most  likely scenario is that only Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county will  have an invalid first round.    If the 8 May round is invalid in an area, the distribution  of  the area mandates can be significantly different from that  indicated above because participation will presumably be much  lower in the second round. The size of the difference will  naturally depend on which counties will have to hold a second  round, and what level of participation will then be reached.    In the individual electoral districts, similarly to 1990,  the  mandates will mostly be decided only in the second round because  most of the candidates will not get an absolute majority of  votes in the first round. For this reason alone -- regardless  of the validity of the voting on the basis of lists -- the  mandates of the national lists can only be decided after the  second round.    Considering the fact that the electoral law prohibits the  publication of public opinion polls in the last eight days  before the elections, there might even be considerable  differences between this forecast and the actual election  results because the intentions to participate and the party  preferences can still significantly change between the date of  the last survey (8 to 18 April) and the day of the elections.  <H5>  Modus </H5>   In its regular "omnibus" researches, the Modus Economic and  Social Marketing Ltd. also poses questions on election  preferences. The questions are directed at the level of  participation in the elections, primary and secondary voting  preferences, and dispreferences. The last of Modus's national  surveys took place between 1 and 8 April at 100 collection  points, in the form of personal interviews. The sample  represents the country's population according to gender, age,  level of schooling, and type of dwelling place. The proportion  of the people questioned in the sample corresponds to people  over the age of 15 living in various regions of the country.  The size of the sample is 960.    According to their latest surveys, the proportion of those  people who would participate in the elections, if they were held  today, has increased (73 percent). In their view, this can be  attributed to the effects of the campaign. This change took  place mainly to the detriment of "I do not know" answers, which  allows us to conclude that the campaign mainly convinced the  uncertain voters about the need to vote, rather than the  citizens who are not interested in politics. Some 69 percent of  those who intend to vote named a party. This means that,  similar to 1990, the campaign activity of the last few days will  have a major effect on the final results.    Examining the parties preferred by those who selected a  party, the Modus found that the MSZP can expect 36 percent of  the votes. It seems that the trend that began in November 1993  is also continuing in the campaign period. The Socialist have a  good chance of winning the elections. Preference for the Fidesz  is at 17 percent. According to indications, the Fidesz's  descent has stopped. Compared to the survey in February, the  SZDSZ lost 0.8 percent, which cannot be seen as a significant  change. According to the April results, 16 percent of people  who selected a party would vote for them. Out of the parties of  the current government coalition, the KDNP is the most stable  party, its expected result was 9 percent in both of the last two  surveys. Sympathy for the MDF and the smallholders is moving in  opposite directions: The MDF's is increasing and the  smallholders' is decreasing. However, both changes are within  the statistical error margin. All parties currently outside  Parliament can expect less than 1 percent. Therefore, according  to the Modus's assessments, the current parliamentary party  structure will only change in its proportions rather than its  members.  <H5>  Gallup </H5>   Gallup's last survey was conducted between 22 and 24 April  on  a national sample of 1,500 people representing the country's  adult population. Fifty-five percent of the people questioned  before the elections were very sure about their participation,  and a further 18 percent said that they would certainly go to  vote. On the basis of this, it is likely that the participation  in the elections will approach or even reach 70 percent.    According to Gallup, out of those who selected a party, a  chsnge of only a few percent in party preferences can be  expected during the campaign period. Within the whole  population, the proportion of MSZP supporters increased from the  March 19 percent to 20 percent, the SZDSZ's from 9 to 11  percent, the MDF's from 6 to 8 percent, while the Fidesz's  decreased from 10 to 9 percent. These differences based on the  whole population change if we only consider those people who  intend to participate in the elections. Among the likely  voters, 31 percent of those who already selected a party would  vote for the MSZP. Among the absolutely certain participants,  this proportion is 33 percent. (This was 35 percent in the  previous month.) Among the likely voters, the SZDSZ can expect  16 percent, the Fidesz 13, and the MDF 12 percent. The FKGP  would receive 9 percent, and the KDNP 7 percent on the basis of  the answers. If only those people went to vote who are very  certain about this now, the Fidesz and the MDF would get 11  percent, the SZDSZ 14 percent, the FKGP 9 percent, and the KDNP  7 percent.    Eighty-five percent of people who named a party are very  certain or certain that they would also choose the party they  now prefer on 8 May, and 15 percent are still uncertain about  this.    Apart from the six parties mentioned above, none of the  others are expected to have a chance to acquire 5 percent  support. According to the expectations of 30 percent of people,  the MSZP will win the elections on 8 May, 15 percent expect the  SZDSZ, and 11 percent the MDF. The corresponding proportions  were 24, 13, and 10 percent in the previous month. The  proportion of people who were unable to answer this question  decreased from the 41 percent in March to 31 percent in April.    The campaign had more effect on the views on the prime  ministerial candidates. Gabor Kuncze's performance is the most  striking. In March, if a decision had to be made between [MSZP  Chairman] Horn and Kuncze, 23 percent would have selected Kuncze  and 46 percent Horn. In April, these proportions changed to 32  and 39 percent.    In March, 20 percent named Horn, 19 percent Boross, and 10  percent Kuncze to the question "All in all, whom would you  prefer most as the country's prime minister?" In April, 22  percent would welcome Horn, 17 percent Boross, and 16 percent  Kuncze as prime minister. (In both months, 18 percent of people  were unable to answer this question.)  <H5>  Median </H5>   According to the Median Public Opinion and Market Research  Ltd, no one can claim to offer absolutely precise predictions 10  days before the elections, because even the latest polls were  done at least one and a half to two weeks before the elections  and no one can foresee what will happen during the remaining  days of the campaign.    However, in view of the participation in the elections, it  is  possible to make predictions on the basis of rather clear  trends. Participation on 8 May will certainly exceed the 1990  level and can be expected at 74 to 80 percent according to our  assessments.    It is even more difficult to predict the party results on  the  basis of lists. The results of the latest survey (this was  between 15 and 20 April in the case of Median), the trends  preceding this, and background information on the parties have  to be taken into consideration. Median weighted the "raw"  answers with sympathy figures for the parties, and opinions on  the parties' interest representation and problem solving  abilities.    All in all, Median gave the results in a relatively narrow  margin, indicating the minimum, maximum, and most likely values  according to their current knowledge. According to this, the  MSZP can expect 31 to 38 percent (most likely 34), the SZDSZ 15  to 19 (17), the MDF 9 to 14 (11), the Fidesz 7 to 10 (9), the  KDNP 7 to 10 (7), and the FKGP 6 to 8 (9), while the other  parties together can expect 11 to 17 percent (most likely 14).</p>

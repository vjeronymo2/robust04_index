			<p>BFN     [Text] Cajnice, 4 Apr (TANJUG) -- Following a relatively  quiet night, early this morning Muslim forces launched a fierce  artillery and infantry attack from the direction of Gorazde  toward Cajnice and Foca, the command of the [Bosnian Serb]  Herzegovina Corps announces.    This is the seventh day of the spring offensive by the  so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army aimed at reestablishing the  green transversal from Sarajevo via Gorazde to Sandzak. The  fiercest battles are being waged in the area of Potkozarje and  Oglecevo.    Serb military sources claim that the Muslims have given up  attacking toward Cajnice via Gradine and Trebesevo because they  suffered huge losses in that area over the past few days.    The command of the Herzegovina Corps said that there were no  casualties among Serb fighters in the past 24 hours.</p>

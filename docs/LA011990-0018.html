			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> RUNNER TAKES LONG ROAD BACK;  </P> <P> TRACK: LAURA CATTIVERA FIRST RAN IN THE SUNKIST INVITATIONAL AT 15. SHE'S  RETURNING AT 22 AFTER FIVE LOWER-LEG FRACTURES.  </P> <P> The last time that Laura Cattivera ran in the Sunkist Invitational track meet  she was a sophomore phenomenon at Mira Costa High competing in the seeded girls  mile.  </P> <P> She placed second that night, her 15th birthday, with a time of five minutes,  one second.  </P> <P> Tonight at 7:35, seven years later and two days before her 22nd birthday,  Cattivera will again take to the Sports Arena indoor track in the Sunkist  $100,000 women's mile, competing against Romanian star and Olympic 1,500-meter  champion Paula Ivan, among others.  </P> <P> It is a sort of homecoming for Cattivera, who has not been prominent in Los  Angeles track and cross-country circles since her early high school days.  </P> <P> "People have forgotten the name," said Vince O'Boyle, Cattivera's coach. "They  haven't seen her, they don't know who she is."  </P> <P> Cattivera didn't disappear. After her sophomore year in high school, when  Cattivera qualified for the Kinney National Cross-Country meet, she was plagued  by a series of five lower-leg fractures in high school that resulted from  overtraining. The injuries prevented Cattivera from performing to her ability,  and she competed only sporadically in her junior and senior years.  </P> <P> Her history of injuries scared away some colleges, but Princeton cross-country  and track Coach Peter Farrell didn't lose interest. He recruited Cattivera,  pitching the fact that running at Princeton would present less pressure than at  other schools.  </P> <P> Cattivera liked the idea of placing academics first and running second.  </P> <P> As it turned out, though, academics came first, second and third at the Ivy  League school.  </P> <P> "My first year was tough," Cattivera said. "I was totally unprepared for the  academics at Princeton."  </P> <P> Cattivera, an American history major, adjusted to the academic load and began  producing for the Tigers. As a junior, she was the heptagonal cross-country  champion. The heptagonal competitors include the Ivy League, Army and Navy.  </P> <P> In her senior year at the outdoor heptagonals last May, Cattivera won the  1,500, 3,000 and anchored the winning 800 relay on the same day, leading  Princeton to a team championship.  </P> <P> She said it was the most fun she had experienced at a track meet.  </P> <P> Cattivera then placed fifth in the 3,000 at the NCAA championships.  </P> <P> Farrell said the fun has just begun for Cattivera.  </P> <P> "(Despite) all the academic distractions at Princeton, she became a  national-class runner," he said. "I think, training in California, with just  running to worry about, Laura can become an elite runner. I wouldn't compare  her with Lynn Jennings (a Princeton alumna and world-class road racer and  cross-country runner), but she is taking steps to be like her."  </P> <P> O'Boyle said Cattivera has made good progress. Her personal bests are 4:41 for  the mile, 4:17 for the 1,500 and 9:31 for the 3,000. Last fall she came in 13th  at The Athletics Congress national cross-country meet at San Francisco. She is  now training for the world cross-country championships qualifying meet to be  held in February in Seattle.  </P> <P> Tonight, Cattivera hopes to make her homecoming successful by getting a speed  workout in preparation for the February race. As far as the $100,000 prize  offered in the mile to anyone who can break the world record of 4:18.86,  Cattivera said it's out of reach and she "won't even worry about it."  </P> <P> Cattivera figures to refresh the memories of track watchers tonight. Thursday  morning she ran into an old acquaintance who asked, "Are you still running?"  Cattivera modestly answered with a nod, neglecting to mention the Sunkist meet.  </P> <P> But after tonight's re-introduction to the track world and a possible  appearance at the March world cross-country championships in France, everyone  should know who Cattivera is.  </P> <P> Again.  </P></p>

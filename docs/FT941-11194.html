			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Investors trust in low interest rates - Why launches of new funds are at record levels Investment trust launches in the first month of 1994 have raised more money than the total for 1992, and could beat the 1993 total by the end of the first quarter. More than Pounds 1bn is accounted for by two trusts alone - the Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust and theMercury European Privatisation Trust. New issues are coming out virtually every other day to mop up the demand that has been pushing many existing trusts' share prices to a premium to net asset value. There are currently about a dozen trusts at various stages of launch, from the first announcement of intent, tothe final listing. This level of activity is chiefly the result of the same low interest rate environment which has fuelled the 'flight into equities' already evidenced by record unit trust inflows. Private investors are searching for homes for their money which offer higher returns than the 3 or 4 per cent paid by many building society accounts. The record demand for the two European privatisation trusts shows just how much money is looking for a home. The offer for the Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust closed on Wednesday with applications being drastically scaled back to keep the trust to its maximum size of Pounds 500m. Enough applications were received to make it Pounds 880m. It is,for the moment, the biggest UK investment trust launch ever. However, itis likely to be overtaken within a month by the Mercury European Privatisation Trust, which has already raised Pounds 325m through its placing, and has set its limit at Pounds 575m. The public offer closes on March 2, and is almost certain to be oversubscribed. The previous record was set by the Mercury World Mining Trust last December, which pulled in Pounds 425m. New investment trusts in 1993 raised arecord total of Pounds 1.49bn, not including Lloyd's corporate capital investment trusts, which pulled in Pounds 700m. But Mr Nigel Sidebottom, of stockbrokers Gerrard Vivian Gray, who manages private client funds invested in investment trusts, says investors are no longer buying equity funds indiscriminately, as value is becoming harder to find. 'My feeling is that the markets have had a pretty strong run over the last 12 to 18 months. Everybody is looking at it and saying, have I missed the boat? They are looking for some angle, some story, whichmay outperform the market. I think that is why they are focusing generally on funds which are quite specialised - Mercury World Mining, the privatisation trusts, single country funds, emerging markets.' Specialist funds can give added value even to institutional investors, who may manage more general portfolios themselves. Nearly all the new issues so far this year are specialised in some way - single country, smaller companies, privatisations or with a split capital structure. Country funds, such as new trusts for Taiwan and Israel, give institutions a way into markets which would otherwise be inaccessible or not cost effective to research. Investment trust shares traditionally trade at a discount to their net asset value. Mr Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst at SG Warburg, says discounts are at their narrowest for 20 years, and many trusts are at a premium. Even Foreign &amp; Colonial, the oldest and largest investment trust, has been trading at a premium, off and on, for the first time since 1972. Buying investment trust shares at a premium is an expensive way into the stock market - with some trusts, you would currently pay 15 per cent more for the shares than the underlying assets are worth. It is also risky, as the premium canbe wiped out in a day if sentiment changes. With new issues, however, investors can get the same assets for virtually no added cost. Most new trusts issue free warrants, often one for every five shares, which acquire their own valueand compensate for the impact of issue expenses. The same is true for conversion share issues by existing funds, such as that currently under way for the Fleming Japanese trust. As long as trusts are trading at a premium, new issues will keep on flowing. The question now is whether the current climate can be sustained. A stock market crash would obviously eliminate discounts, but the real threat to fundamental demand is interest rates. If interest rates went back to 10 per cent, individuals who had been putting Pounds 100 a month into investment trust savings schemes could withdraw it all and go back to the building society. 'That could push prices back to a discount quite quickly,' says Mr Sidebottom. Even so, higher interest rates would not necessarily mean the end of investment trusts' new-found popularity with private investors. 'I think the equity market may have made a lot of permanent converts from this period of low interest rates,' he says. Private investors may switch much of their money back on to deposit when interest rates rise again, but they may have overcome their fear of the markets sufficiently to leave a portion of their savings in investmentor unit trusts.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LARGEST UK INVESTMENT TRUST LAUNCHES OF PAST 3 YEARS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Trust                             Year       Pounds m gross  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mercury European Priv             1994              max 575 Kleinwort European Priv           1994                500.0 Mercury World Mining              1993                425.8 London Insurance Market           1993                280.0 M&amp;G Income                        1991                246.5 M&amp;G Recovery                      1992                129.8 HTR Japanese Smaller Cos          1993                100.0 Schroder Split Fund               1993                100.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: NatWest Markets/AITC  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

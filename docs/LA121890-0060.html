			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'CYRANO' A MOST HANDSOME FILM  </P> <P> The glorious new "Cyrano de Bergerac" (opening today at the Royal) brings  together the right man -- Gerard Depardieu -- at the right time of his life and  career with one of the juiciest roles in European drama, one he was born to  play. And with precisely the right nose.  </P> <P> What could be a better harbinger of the pleasures to come than the perfection  of this Cyrano's nose? Depardieu's already generous proboscis has not been  built out all that much; it's been expanded into the Jimmy Durante schnozolla  range and boasts a Bob Hope ski slope. It's just outsized enough to obsess a  vain, brilliant man like Cyrano, but not so big as to be all-out Pinocchio  freakish. This allows us to perceive that Cyrano sees himself as a beast far  more than we do, which gives fresh meaning and poignancy to Edmond Rostand's  hero, who has enchanted audiences around the world for 93 years.  </P> <P> A poll once revealed that Cyrano is France's favorite literary character,  beating out even Jean Valjean and D'Artagnan. This makes perfect sense. Most of  us, rightly or wrongly, are less than thrilled by our looks and have  experienced unrequited love, which inevitably carries with it the desire to  make it bearable by romanticizing it.  </P> <P> Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau, who adapted the play for the screen with  Jean-Claude Carriere, one of the most distinguished of screenwriters, doesn't  bring on the object of Cyrano's secret adoration, his cousin Roxane, played by  witty, heart-stopping beauty Anne Brochet, until we're well into the 138-minute  film. Rappeneau is being neither digressive nor draggy; to the contrary, he  wants to sweep us up and immerse us in his lusty, exuberant evocation of  17th-Century France, a world of elegance and earthiness, grandeur and squalor.  Have no fear: This "Cyrano" is a film of dash and vigor, an exceptionally  graceful adaptation of a play for the screen.  </P> <P> How appropriate that the film begins in a theater, for Cyrano is the most  theatrical of men yet also a poet, playwright and critic as well as a career  military man. Arriving fashionably late and undetected, he suddenly appears in  a high balcony box to denounce the old ham declaiming away on stage. In the  ensuing mayhem (eagerly anticipated by the audience), Cyrano ends up prepared  to duel anyone so foolish as to mock his nose. Gradually, we come to see the  perceptive, lonely creature beneath the bravado. You can already envision an  Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, a la "Phantom of the Opera."  </P> <P> The one man who gets away with making fun of that nose is the handsome  Christian de Neuvillette (Vincent Perez), but then, he is Roxane's suitor and  at her request has arrived to join Cyrano's regiment. Although a wit in verbal  parrying with Cyrano, Christian admits to becoming tongue-tied in expressing  love and admiration for women. In one of the most famous instances of vicarious  love in all of literature, Cyrano is soon writing Christian's love letters to  Roxane, who swoons in response, and is coaching him in his pursuit. All that  has gone before and all that is to come -- including the battle of Arras --  provides a turbulent, large-scale backdrop for the disguised expression of  Cyrano's consuming love for Roxane and its consequences.  </P> <P> Within this most extravagant of romantic gestures that Rostand created for his  tormented hero, the filmmakers and the actors express the full range of human  nature. Cyrano is at once noble and self-sacrificing yet self-aggrandizing and  -dramatizing as well. For more than 15 years, Depardieu has been establishing  himself as a premier actor of his generation, right up there with Robert De  Niro, his co-star in Bertolucci's "1900." Cyrano taps Depardieu's incredible  inner reserves, his passion, intellect and physicality, and he has the strength  and presence to sustain one of the most drawn out death scenes of all time,  showing us at once Cyrano's vaunting gallantry and monumental, outrageous  egoism. There is complexity and intelligence in Perez's Christian and Brochet's  Roxane, too; they are not beautiful blanks but reflective individuals with  their own emotional capacities. There's also a delightful comic portrayal from  Jacques Weber as another of Roxane's suitors, a middle-aged nobleman and  self-deluded poseur who has the pomposity knocked out of him in battle.  </P> <P> This "Cyrano" (rated PG) is well-nigh flawless, with scarcely a moment's lull.  Legions of people both in front and in back of Pierre Lhomme's effortlessly  fluid camera have striven successfully to make the past seem to be happening in  the present. In addition to Lhomme, whose palette is muted and luminous,  principal contributions are Franca Squarciapino's period-perfect settings and  costumes that seem lived in, and Jean-Claude Petit's full-bodied score. Anthony  Burgess' fine English subtitles even go so far as to translate Rostand's verses  whenever feasible. And let's not overlook Michele Burke, who designed that  wonderful nose for Cyrano.  </P> <P> 'Cyrano de Bergerac'  </P> <P> Gerard Depardieu: Cyrano  </P> <P> Anne Brochet: Roxane  </P> <P> Vincent Perez: Christiane  </P> <P> An Orion Classics release.

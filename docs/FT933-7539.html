			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Cheung Kong soars in first half CHEUNG KONG, the flagship of Mr Li Ka-shing's listed Hong Kong empire, announced net profit of HKDollars 4.53bn (Dollars 591m) for the six months to June 1993; almost double the 1991 figure of HKDollars 2.35bn. The results exceeded stock market expectations, primarily as a result of an exceptional profit of HKDollars 708m on the 220m covered warrants issued by Cheung Kong in 1991 against its holding in Hutchison Whampoa. The company also benefited from a substantial increase in profits from associated companies, which contributed HKDollars 3.28bn, compared with HKDollars 306m in 1992. That reflected the turn-around of 42 per cent-owned Hutchison Whampoa, as well as contributions from a number of partly-owned property developments, which included Kingswood Villas and Laguna City. Cheung Kong took significant steps to build up its diminishing Hong Kong land bank during the first half of the year. It finalised agreements to develop a 162,000 sq metre luxury housing estate with the Pacific Concord Group, and a 209,150 sq metre commercial and residential project with Mainland group China Resources. Mr Li predicted that Hong Kong property prices, which have risen steeply this year, would stabilise in the second half of 1993, but that sales levels would remain high. The directors announced an interim dividend of 24 cents a share, up from 20 cents a share in 1992.</p>

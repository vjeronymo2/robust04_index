			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Ruling No. 11 of the Judiciary Chamber for Information </F> Disputes under the President of the Russian Federation, Issued  on 21 April 1994 in Moscow": "On the Material `What A Life...  People Have!' Published in EXPRESS-GAZETTE No. 5, March 1994"]    [Text] On behalf of the Council of the Federal Assembly of  the Russian Federation, the Federal Assembly's legal  administration has filed a claim with the Judiciary Chamber for  Information Disputes under the President of the Russian  Federation regarding false information contained in the material  "What A Life... People Have!" published in EXPRESS-GAZETTE No.  5, March 1994.    After reviewing the material, hearing the legal  administration's representatives, I.I. Zablotskiy and G.L.  Dyakonov, and the representatives of EXPRESS-GAZETTE, S.A.  Shibalov and A.S. Ivanov, and studying additional materials  supplied by representatives of the parties, the Judiciary  Chamber finds that:    EXPRESS-GAZETTE in issue No. 5, March 1994 under the rubric  "Investigation" published editorial material on the subject of  the Provisional Statute on Support of the Activities of Deputies  of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian  Federation, approved by State Duma Decree No. 41-1GD, dated 21  January 1994, and published in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA on 29 January  1994.    Contrary to the content of the Provisional Statute, in the  material "What A Life... People Have!" the editors put forward  their own untrue and slanderous conjectures and comments  regarding material and organizational support for deputies'  activities.    The disgraceful writing style, and a dense concentration of  insulting, untrue, and absurd allegations are evidence that  EXPRESS-GAZETTE essentially chose the road of mocking the State  Duma deputy corps and humiliating and discrediting elected  representatives of the people.    During a court hearing EXPRESS-GAZETTE representatives  admitted that the material was untrue and biased, but attempted  to find an excuse by saying that much of its information and  data had allegedly come from other sources. In addition, they  said that this is a "young" newspaper and that such writing  style was allegedly necessitated by the need "to come into its  own" and "win over its competitors."    The Judiciary Chamber rejects such arguments. There are no  references to other sources in the material. Analysis of  submitted supplemental materials showed that there are no  verbatim reprints, while many conjectures, insulting hints, and  contentions represent EXPRESS-GAZETTE's own "creative work."    Also impermissible is the contention that for the sake of  gaining a foothold in the newspaper marketplace one may resort  to the use of cheap sensations, publication of untrue and  insulting materials, and mockery of the institutions of Russian  statehood.    The Judiciary Chamber, of course, reaffirms the right of the  mass media to cover the activities of state bodies truthfully  and objectively, which includes criticism. EXPRESS-GAZETTE  editors had the opportunity to compare their own perceptions  with the previously published Provisional Statute and see proof  of elementary ignorance and confusion. Instead, EXPRESS-GAZETTE  chose a different road--the road of slander, mockery, and  ridicule.    The Judiciary Chamber also found that EXPRESS-GAZETTE Editor  in Chief A. Kupriyanov deliberately, without good reason, did  not show up for the hearing and did not present any explanations  regarding the circumstances of origin of this material.    Taking the above into account, and guided by Articles 9 and  12 of the Judiciary Chamber Statute, the Judiciary Chamber  resolves that:    1. The material "What A Life... People Have!" published in  EXPRESS-GAZETTE No. 5, March 1994, shall be deemed untrue and  biased.    2. The aforementioned material shall be considered a gross  violation of legal and ethical norms aimed at insulting the  State Duma deputy corps and discrediting the institution of  Russian statehood.    3. It is found that EXPRESS-GAZETTE Editor in Chief A.  Kupriyanov grossly violated Part 2 of Article 49 and Article 51  of the Russian Federation Law "On the Mass Media."    In keeping with Article 12 of the Judiciary Chamber Statute,  the chamber recommends that the EXPRESS-GAZETTE founders relieve  A. Kupriyanov of his duties as editor in chief.    4. This decision shall be sent to the EXPRESS-GAZETTE  editors  for publication.    5. The mass media shall be advised that it is impermissible  to publish untrue and biased data of sociopolitical interest.    [Signed] Judiciary Chamber Chairman A. Vengerov</p>

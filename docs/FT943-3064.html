			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Perplexing economic data ignored by Dow Wall Street US share prices made some progress yesterday afternoon in spite of mixed economic news and a lethargic bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 15.47 higher at 3,895.33, thanks in part to computer-guided buy programs which lifted some blue chips late in the session. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.28 ahead at 468.80 and the Nasdaq composite added 2.77 at 768.60. NYSE volume was 296m shares. During the morning, the thin activity suggested that investors were perplexed about the current state of the economy. The day's economic news may have served to compound the uncertainty. The Commerce Department announced a 0.8 per cent increase in August retail sales, a weaker result than the 1.0 per cent gain which had been forecast. But in spite of the recent anxiety over inflation, the market could gain little comfort from the report. Retail sales, excluding cars, came in at 0.7 per cent, against expectations of a 0.4 per cent gain. This indicated that activity was stronger than suggested by the headline figure. Stocks held steady on the release of the data, with the bond market offering no guidance whatsoever. With Treasuries showing no change, share prices meandered within a narrow range throughout the morning. The release of the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report on economic conditions at midday elicited a muted reaction, too. In finding that the economy continued to grow at a moderate pace, the Fed told a story with which Wall Street was already familiar. Still, the Dow industrials built up some momentum during the afternoon. Caterpillar rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 55 1/8 , Coca-Cola Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 47 1/8 and United Technology Dollars 1 to Dollars 64 1/4. American Express put on Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 31 7/8 , buoyed no doubt by its recent moves in the travel and credit card businesses. Heightened speculation on the future of the NBC broadcasting network influenced the share prices of the companies involved. Walt Disney, which was reported to be in talks on acquiring NBC from General Electric, slipped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 41 1/4 . GE rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 50 1/4 . Time Warner, also said to be discussing a possible deal, edged down Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 36. Following Kohlberg Kravis Roberts' Dollars 2bn bid for Borden, Quaker Oats inspired early buying from those who consider the food group as a likely target. The stock had been up Dollars 2 3/4 by midday, but receded later to Dollars 79 1/2 for a gain of Dollars 3/8. CompUSA, an electronics retailer, jumped Dollars 2 1/4, or 24 per cent, to Dollars 12 amid reports of insider buying and a strong sales outlook. Canada Toronto sought fresh impetus in the aftermath of the Quebec election as the market also awaited a speech later in the day in which Quebec's president elect Jacques Parizeau was expected to lay out his sovereignty plans. In spite of a 0.9 per cent decline in the heavily weighted gold shares sub-index, the TSE 300 composite index was a slight 0.81 of a point firmer at the close at 4,345.03, while gaining issues outnumbered losers by 371 to 360. Volume came to a moderate 56.1m shares. Brazil Equities in Sao Paulo, after early firmness, closed a net 0.63 per cent down in heavy trade, rattled by unconfirmed rumours late in the session that some small financial institutions and a state-owned bank faced liquidity difficulties. The Bovespa index was finally off 346 points at 54,764. 'Shares dropped on rumours that a major state bank was having problems in squaring its position at the central bank,' a broker at a leading commercial bank said. 'If that is true, other small banks would be affected as well.' Analysts said recent central bank action, aimed at squeezing the market's liquidity, was the cause of the rumours. Chart analysts said investors could also have used the rumours as an excuse to cash profits after stocks had risen 86 per cent so far this year. The market was also keeping a close eye on Telebras' performance after a federal judge's ruling that cancelled a 1990 Telebras share subscription. The ruling has to be ratified by a second judge next week. Telebras preferred fell 1.5 per cent to RDollars 52.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Generators may be forced to buy coal A LAW requiring electricity generators to use more coal is among the options being considered by the government in its effort to keep open some of the 31 pits earmarked for closure. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, also said yesterday that his department was studying cutting the price of British coal through subsidies or further levies on consumers. He told MPs that it was a 'genuinely open review' and that the government had not reached views on any of the 15 areas for action which had been identified by the review team. Many of the options, however, were subject to European Community and international constraints. Those constraints were highlighted yesterday when Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the energy commissioner for the EC , told a parliamentary select committee that the UK would have to reduce the nuclear levy, raised from electricity consumers, if it wanted to subsidise coal. Commission policy is that only 20 per cent of energy used to produce electricity can be subsidised. In the UK all of this is taken up by the nuclear industry. Although the levy on electricity bills is falling - the surcharge on bills will be reduced from 11 per cent this year to 10 per cent in 1993 - further action may be required if coal is subsidised. Mr Heseltine's announcement suggests that none of the proposals made in public to the trade and industry select committee has been ruled out completely. Mr Martin O'Neil, Labour's energy spokesman, said Mr Heseltine's 'dramatic widening of the coal review' would make it 'even more difficult for him to face down public opposition to his pit closure programme'. Mr Heseltine's list included an investigation of the 'dash for gas', suggesting that the government may scale back future generation plans and review the operation of pricing formulae which critics say obscure judgment of the real cost of gas. He also referred to criticism of the electricity market after its privatisation two years ago, saying there would be consultation with the regulator about whether any company is abusing its market position. National Power and PowerGen, the two generators in England and Wales, have been accused of operating a duopoly to force up prices. Other areas for investigation are: Reducing the cost of coal production through changing working practices and privatising pits; Trade in coal, through increased exports of UK coal and import substitution, and in electricity, through interconnectors with Scotland and France; The impact of environmental commitments, including those relating to carbon emissions and desulphurisation, and the development of opencast mining.

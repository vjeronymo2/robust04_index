			<p>BFN     [Text] It is known that Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin interrupted his holiday in Sochi and flew to  Germany on Sunday to undergo a medical investigation for kidney  stones. Chernomyrdin's trip to Germany appears to be a rather  strange one, if one takes into account the fact that the best  medical institutions in Russia are located in the resort where  he was vacationing, Reuters considers.    It was reported by the DPA agency that all the experts  examined Chernomyrdin and acknowledged his state of health as  excellent.    According to a correspondent of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, the  question arises as to whether the unexpected trip to Germany by  Chernomyrdin is window-dressing preparation for his resignation  due to the state of his health.    It is interesting that, according to a report from Russia's  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, people surrounding First Deputy  Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets have unambiguously given it to be  understood that their boss may soon become prime minister.    Another probable candidate for the post of head of  government  is Yuriy Skokov, chairman of the Federation of Goods' Producers.    This is what KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA writes. According to  reports from informed sources in the government of Russia, the  issue of the resignation of Viktor Chernomyrdin from the post of  prime minister due to his state of health and the appointment of  Yuriy Skokov has fundamentally been decided among those  surrounding Boris Yeltsin. Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin  himself allegedly agrees with this formulation. According to  unofficial information, Yeltsin already met with Yuriy Skokov  last Monday, as a result of which the necessary draft  presidential decrees only need to have Yeltsin's signature added  to them.</p>

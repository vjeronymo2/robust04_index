			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> BIRD DOESN'T SOAR AS HIGH AS HE USED TO; AND CELTICS LANGUISH  </P> <P> OK, so what is the matter with Larry Bird?  </P> <P> His heels are fine. The Boston Celtics are satisfied he has no physical  problems. Entering tonight's game in Milwaukee against the Bucks, Bird is  averaging 23.3 points, 10 rebounds and 6.9 assists in 37.7 minutes a game. All  but his rebound average are team highs. He is also leading the club in steals  and turnovers and is second in blocked shots.  </P> <P> But no one who watches the Celtics with any regularity can be deceived by such  numbers. Mr. Evergreen clearly has had a rough re-entry from a year's idleness,  and one cannot help but suspect it's having a trickledown effect on his  teammates.  </P> <P> It might be simplistic to resurrect that timeworn adage, "As Bird Goes, So Go  The Celtics," but that generally was true when a healthy Bird was winning most  valuable player awards and the team was collecting the Larry O'Brien Trophy  from a champagne-doused Commissioner David Stern with Brent Musburger close at  hand to ask the pertinent questions.  </P> <P> Now, both Bird and the Celtics are struggling, providing everyone a glimpse of  the flip side to the "As Bird Goes . . . " theory. It's a side we haven't seen  -- we all assumed last year's plunge was because of Bird's foot injuries but  one that, in retrospect, is perfectly understandable.  </P> <P> In other words, are the Celtics at the stage where they're only as good as  their struggling superstar? Have they grown so dependent on him -- even after a  year's absence -- that he carries them down as well as up? The evidence seems  to suggest that is the case.  </P> <P> Before he was hurt, there was never a question as to who wore the pants for the  Celtics on and off the court. Bird would throw chairs in the locker room if he  wasn't satisfied. He would rip teammates for not setting picks or other  perceived transgressions. He felt qualified and obligated to do so. And people  listened.  </P> <P> But like a politician who has lost his constituency, or a speaker who has lost  his audience, Bird cannot come across as the unflagging, take-charge guy if he  isn't, well, taking charge. Everyone simply assumed he would reaffirm his  status as the club's consummate whip-cracker and everything would naturally  flow from there.  </P> <P> "Larry still has the same bearing and demeanor that he always has had," Boston  General Manager Jan Volk says. "He still is a personality and a force off the  court."  </P> <P> But Volk also says: "The biggest part of Larry's leadership role in the past  has been to lead by example. And he's not there, yet. The effort is there and  there is a fine line between very good and great. He has to get back over that  line. I think he'd be the first to acknowledge he has a long way to go."  </P> <P> He does. It's easy to note he is incapable of playing one-on-one defense  against anyone with a modicum of quickness. That's why Bird speaks forcefully  about the need for others to help on defense. He can't do it alone, which  doesn't exactly make him the most credible spokesman.  </P> <P> It's also easy to point to Bird's shooting, which is the most glaring and  visible of his weaknesses. There have been far too many Phyllis Diller shooting  nights, including the nine for 27 effort against the Lakers Friday.  </P> <P> In nine games this season -- or 40% of the time -- Bird has shot less than 40%  from the field. In his last healthy season, 1987-88, he shot under 40% only 11  times. This season, he is shooting 45.7%, which may be all right for the  Washington Bullets' Jeff Malone but is unacceptable for Bird.  </P> <P> That is one reason behind Boston Coach Jimmy Rodgers' share the wealth  philosophy, which Bird has had trouble accepting. Bird is the foremost  proponent of deregulation. The fewer constraints, the better. No constraints is  downright Utopian.  </P> <P> Bird always has been given a long leash -- some would say no leash -- but there  was an implicit understanding that such widespread latitude also produced  dividends. He would win games. He would exhort teammates. He would make the big  play. When others couldn't, he could.  </P> <P> This season, Bird has done little of the above, which may make him uneasy about  assuming any leadership role. And are his teammates any less culpable if they  delegated leadership authority to Bird simply because of who he was rather than  what he did? Is it fair to ask so much of Bird given everything he went through  -- and is still going through -- when the team and league is changing all  around him?  </P> <P> The question of leadership always is a touchy and risky one. There's nothing  worse than having someone try to be what he is not. Or cannot be. But in the  past, Bird stepped forward and everyone else got out of the way.  </P> <P> One source close to the Celtics recently suggested Bird no longer is interested  in refiring his leadership rockets. The suggestion was that the fire wasn't  there as it once was. All of his good friends from years past -- Quinn Buckner,  Bill Walton, Artis Gilmore -- are gone. And in their places are players he  barely knows.  </P> <P> If there was one "given" this season, it was that Bird would fill the  leadership void from last year. If he can't, or won't, the Celtics will find it  hard not to drift aimlessly, which is exactly what they did last season.  </P></p>

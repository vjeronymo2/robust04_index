			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / People: Trying to practice what he preached Sir David Trippier, the former small firms and environment minister who lost his Rossendale seat at the last general election, yesterday entrenched himself firmly in Manchester's financial and professional community by becoming non-executive chairman of the Davenham Group, an emergent corporate finance and investment specialist. Davenham was bought out by Colin Davenport and Mike Hamlyn - hence the name  -from the Burns-Anderson Group, then a Bristol-based company with a Manchester office, in 1991 after even the fabled Sir John Harvey-Jones as its chairman had failed to save it from collapse. Davenham has since done well, including managing the assets of Edington, Henry Cooke group's failed mini-merchant bank, for the KPMG Peat Marwick administrator; Edington's depositors are now expected to get back 100p in the pound. With offices in Manchester and Sheffield, Davenham was backed by Pounds 10m of equity and debt at the buyout, so it knows something about its own market, which is finance for growing business, mainly in the north. It also has a small stockbroking subsidiary in which Trippier, who was a stockbroker before becoming an MP, will take a close interest. Trippier's other Manchester activities include a seat on the board of surveyors Dunlop Heywood and a consultancy with solicitors Halliwell Landau; he has dropped the chairmanship of Tepnel Diagnostics, the biotech business which was spun out of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, while keeping his share options. 'I couldn't do much more for Tepnel now it is past the start-up stage,' he said yesterday. 'Because it helps to finance growing businesses, Davenham is always going to be at the exciting end of things. It is certainly hard work trying to do all those things I used to tell people they should be doing when I was small firms minister.'</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / International Company News: Nippon Steel moves into computer production NIPPON STEEL, the world's largest steel producer, is moving into computer manufacturing as part of a plan to diversify into electronics and information systems. Its first product, to be launched in the UK tomorrow, is a 'notebook' computer weighing less than six pounds but with all the functions of a desk-top personal system. The computer, called 'Librex' is being launched in the US and UK but not yet in Japan. Mr Takashi Iwamoto, president of Nippon Steel Computer based in Langley, Berkshire, said the Japanese market for small computers was dominated by NEC. He said competition in the notebook sector was especially intense. New competitors stood a better chance of building a market presence in the US and Europe, where notebook computers are only now becoming popular. He said the company would eventually manufacture the notebook machines in Europe. It had recruited Mr Ian King from Toshiba to manage the UK operation and Mr Andrew Carver from Compaq, the leading US personal computer supplier, to head European sales and marketing. Nippon Steel, with annual sales in excess of Dollars 20bn, is entering the computer business as a response to slow growth in its traditional business. One of the largest users of industrial computers in Japan, it has already established joint ventures for marketing equipment from US companies.</p>

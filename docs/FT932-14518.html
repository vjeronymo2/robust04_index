			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Young US leader shatters old Japanese trade certainties THE Japanese, who understand symbols, used to feel rather proud when Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, prime minister from 1982 to 1987, represented them in international deliberations. At sessions with President Ronald Reagan he had plenty to say, forging apparently genuine first-name relationships with the US administration, appropriate for a member of the statesmen's club. At G7 summits he was equally vocal and often was not even the shortest participant. The contrast with Friday in Washington could hardly have been greater. There, captured on global television, was the young and vigorous 46-year-old President Bill Clinton towering over his diminutive Japanese counterpart, 73-year-old Kiichi Miyazawa, a reflective man but the last, and therefore the weakest, of his generation of Japanese politicians to become prime minister. Worse than the symbolic physical contrast between the two men, Mr Clinton was lecturing Mr Miyazawa in a way that no US president has spoken publicly to a Japanese prime minister in living memory. Here was a president born after the last war telling a man old enough to have represented his country at the San Francisco peace conference in 1951 that the world had changed, the US was changing and that Japan would have to change with it. This is serious stuff for Japan. The US has been the bedrock of its international constellation since 1945. More particularly, inside the relationship, there was an absolute Japanese assumption, even as it became economically mighty, that the man in the White House was their ultimate protector, no matter what retaliation was threatened by Congress, no matter how many Japanese radios were smashed on the lawns of Capitol Hill and what American public opinion felt about Japanese takeovers of US institutions. Mr Clinton was careful not to throw all the co-operative fruits of the last two generations out of the window. He emphasised US commitment to regional Asian security, never threatened to withdraw US troops from Japan or South Korea, and was complimentary about Japan's role as G7 chairman in putting together the Russian aid package. But he made it equally clear that, as far the US was concerned, the end of the cold war had altered the nature of US perception of its own national security. 'The cold war partnership between our two countries is outdated,' he declared. 'We need a new partnership based on a longer-term vision and above all based on mutual respect and responsibility.' For Mr Clinton, who does not consider himself a protectionist as classically defined, the foundation is a new trade and economic relationship. It means a reduction in Japan's trade surplus, if necessary by agreements on specific sectors, replete with numerical targets. It also implies a continuous engagement by Japan in promoting global economic growth beyond the series of emergency stimulus packages that Tokyo has frequently contrived to produce as a result of US pressure. Mr Miyazawa had conceded that 'gaiatsu' (foreign pressure leading to Japanese concessions) was 'perhaps part of our culture'. But that sometimes leisurely practice now runs squarely up against a US government disinclined to be patient or play ritualistic games. In Tokyo last week, even Mr Warren Christopher departed from his nominal diplomatic brief as secretary of state to press his Japanese opposite numbers on specifics such as the Japanese personal computer market. The US impatience on bilateral trade and with Japan's passivity in the Uruguay Round negotiations may also extend to a growing intolerance with the introspection of the Japanese political system. The ruling Liberal Democratic party's domestic problems are well understood in Washington, but attract little sympathy. If 'change' is the present leitmotif of US politics, then the inability to adjust in the Japanese system becomes all the more difficult to accept, especially when the US can see that there is a new, rising generation of more outward-looking Japanese politicians apparently hungry for power but still consigned to the waiting rooms. Certainly, Mr Miyazawa has left Washington, like none of his recent predecessors, with presidential fleas in his ear. For a country like Japan, always comfortable in certitudes, this is a very disturbing message.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Luxembourg, March 9 -- Foreign Minister Andrzej  Olechowski discussed in Luxembourg on Wednesday with his  Luxembourg counterpart Jacques Poos the issue of strengthening  the status of Poland and other Central European states as  prospective members of the Western European Union (WEU).  Jacques Poos is the head of the Council of WEU.    Olechowski and Poos discussed also Poland's relations with  the European Union and NATO.    A debate on the status of Poland and other Central European  states which have been WEU's partners for consultation is still  being held and should end at a session of the Council of WEU  scheduled to take place in Luxembourg on May 9-10, Poos stressed  at a joint press conference ending Olechowski's visit to  Luxembourg.    Poos expressed his hope that during the May session the  Western European Union would agree on granting Poland and other  countries of the region a status very close to association. He  admitted, however, that such a status would not give Poland  "legal security guarantees but will enable its full  participation in political discussions and its gradual inclusion  into joint operations in the military sphere".    According to Olechowski, the associate status with the WEU  would be better for Poland than its partnership with NATO.    During his one-day official visit to Luxembourg Olechowski  was also received by Grand Duke Jean and Prime Minister Jacques  Santer.</p>

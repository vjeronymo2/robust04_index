			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Money Markets: Bank lends at 12% RATES WERE little changed on the London money market yesterday, but for the fourth Friday running the Bank of England signalled that another cut in UK bank base rates would not be welcomed at present. The central bank has sent the same warning on each Friday, including when rates were last reduced on April 12. There was no strong reaction to news of large losses by the Conservative Party in Thursday's local government elections. Three-month sterling interbank was unchanged at June short sterling futures opened lower at 88.82 on Liffe, and fell to 88.78 at the close from 88.84. Day-to-day credit was in very short supply on the cash market, and the Bank of England indicated its wish for caution on interest rates by not supplying enough help to take out the full underlying shortage and by inviting the discount houses to use their borrowing facilities after lunch. A shortage of Pounds 1,600m was initially forecast, but this was revised to Pounds 1,650m at noon and back to Pounds 1,600m in the afternoon. Total assistance of Pounds 1,456m was provided. An early round of help was offered and at that time the authorities bought Pounds 496m bills outright, by way of Pounds 1m Treasury bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent; Pounds 4m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent; Pounds 1m Treasury bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent; and Pounds 490m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Before lunch another Pounds 485m bills were purchased, via Pounds 65m Treasury bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent; Pounds 268m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent; and Pounds 152m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. The authorities did not offer to buy bills in the afternoon, but lent Pounds 475m to the discount houses for seven days, at the existing base rate of 12 per cent. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of Treasury bills drained Pounds 1,713m, with a rise in the note circulation absorbing Pounds 525 and bank balances below target Pounds 130m. These outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds 770m to liquidity. At the weekly Treasury bill tender the average rate of discount on 91-day bills fell to 10.9612 from 11.1700 per cent and the average on 182-day bills declined to 10.5408 from 10.7243 per cent.</p>

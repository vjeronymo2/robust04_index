			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Asea, BBC shares up on rumours Shares of Asea and Brown Boveri, the founding companies of engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri, have surged on the annual pre-press conference speculation that their directors will do the decent thing and order the conversion of their paper into a single unified ABB share, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. This time, the speculation originated in Stockholm, driving the Asea 'A' shares up SKr20 to SKr581 on Monday, and by a further SKr6 to SKr587 yesterday when the Affarsvarlden index dipped 10.0 to 1,527.6. Zurich arbitrageurs made sure that BBC bearers followed yesterday, showing a SFr19 rise to SFr1,129 as the SMI index fell 16.23 to 2,902.4. ABB officials yearn for a single share to bolster the group's multinational image, but the controlling families are in no hurry to create one. The Swedish Wallenbergs now cast 33 per cent of the Asea votes with only 20 per cent of the capital, while the Swiss Schmidheinys speak for 14 per cent of BBC with only 4 per cent of the capital. In other Stockholm trading, Gambro was marked SKr15 lower to SKr399 in reaction to results.</p>

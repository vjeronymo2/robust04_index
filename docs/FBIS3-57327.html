In a speech to the  governors of 18 regions in the city of Orel on Tuesday, he said  the main points of a statement on economic, crediting and  financial policies the government and the Bank made last May had  been implemented, but this did not lead to curbing inflation as  planned. On falling inflation at the end of 1993, Gerashchenko  attributes this to an artificial underfunding of the national  economy.    In his words, money supply was reduced from 60 percent at  the  end of 1992 to 30 percent last year.    The CBR president called for economic policy corrections and  for an integrated concept of investment policy raising the  possibility of subsidizing interest rates for farm credits in  some cases. He suggested an issuing of government securities on  a large scale in an attempt to try to narrow this year's deficit.    Gerashchenko says that uncertainties about the economic and  investment climate prevent commercial banks, which accumulated 4  trillion rubles of "free money" as of January 1, from investing  it into the economy, an indication of a new spiral of inflation  being imminent.    Under the existing legislation, he said, "we cannot force  them into investment." The CBR president says that incentives  such as tax benefits or interest rate subsidies must be created  to reverse the situation.    Gerashchenko has called for seeking ways of attracting those  free funds into the Russian economy.</p>

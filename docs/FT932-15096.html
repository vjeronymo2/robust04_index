			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Book Review: Pessimistic blast from the past HANDELN FUR DEUTSCHLAND By Helmut Schmidt Rowohlt Berlin, DM 34, 256 pp When authors start thinking about Germany, they often lie awake at night. While preparing this passionate recitation of the challenges facing united Germany (featuring the subtext that, had a certain well-known snuff-taking statesman remained in charge, things would not be in such a mess), former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt did not, one suspects, enjoy much sleep. He reveals that, during preparation of the manuscript, he dreamt a Nazi government came to power and banned publication of Die Zeit, the weekly newspaper of which he became co-proprietor after leaving office in 1982. The nightmare seems to have strengthened Schmidt's conviction that, should unification go awry, Germany would be threatened by extremism: 'On no account should we ever again allow a rise of left or right-wing fundamentalism.' Schmidt as chancellor between 1974 and 1982 won a worldwide reputation for brainpower and efficiency. This was, however, only one side of his character. In this book we glimpse Schmidt the moralist, the schoolmaster and the patriot. His point of comparison for today's nation is the Germany of Hitler and the Germany of the Weimar republic. In view of the legacy of the past, and what he terms as the Germans' tendency to intolerance and ideological excess, Schmidt pointedly says that, even after unification, Germany is 'not normal'. His central thesis is that reunification is a blessing, but the political establishment has failed to master the consequences. 'The German nation is in an infinitely better state than at any time since 1933. All Germans are free; all are equal before the law; we have elected our government and can vote for another one; we need fear neither violence by the state, nor secret police; our standard of living is high; our external security is not seriously under threat. At the same time our situation is in no way satisfactory. We have made serious errors, and we are placing ourselves in further danger through prejudice, egotism and sloth.' Although his views sometimes appear over-pessimistic, the persistence and clarity with which Schmidt puts them forward are admirable. It is a pity that he allows the contempt with which he regards his successor, Helmut Kohl, sometimes to cloud his judgment. Kohl wins praise for having seized the chance of German unification in 1990. Otherwise, the chancellor is portrayed as a combination of knave and buffoon. 'Practically everything else which Kohl undertook after October 3 1990, the date of German unity, was partly wrong, partly mistaken, too hesitant and too late.' Schmidt indulges in his leaning towards apocalyptic views when he writes in the opening chapter that missed chances since 1990 raise the risk that united Germany could have 'only a limited life'. But his overall conclusion is surely correct. The passage of German unity has been made still more difficult by policy errors in Bonn, principally the government's underestimation of the hurdles facing economic recovery in the east. He believes that, unless Germans in east and west show a far greater willingness to share the burdens of reunification, Europe's pivotal nation will remain unsettled for a relatively long period. In laborious detail, Schmidt sets out problems and solutions. He covers everything from asylum policy and the Bundeswehr to measures to reduce the budget deficit. In view of the recession, he is against tax increases for the moment. Schmidt calls on the Bundesbank - his bete noire - to cut interest rates substantially. And he takes the central bank heavily to task for obstructing the road to European monetary union. It is 'unhealthy', he says, that the Bundesbank president appears more powerful than the German foreign minister. The best parts of the book are where Schmidt shows his more human side. There is a somewhat puritanical streak here. A fierce assailant of the debilitating influence of television, he suggests that schoolchildren hold regular classroom discussions on the nature and content of television programmes. Schmidt closes the book with an emotional and eloquent appeal for ordinary Germans to tighten their belts and show 'solidarity' to make unification a success. For all the power of his arguments, the book has some shortcomings. One lacuna concerns his own previously held views on German unity. As late as summer 1990 he was on record as predicting East German unemployment would start to fall as recovery took place from 1992 onwards. Some hint of the fallibility of his earlier predictions would not have come amiss. Schmidt also seems to hold fluctuating views on the political reliability of his countrymen. In connection with post-unity decision-making, he writes: 'I have no real confidence in the political constancy of our people.' Yet he also claims that the German electorate 'have understood our position and our difficulties better than the politicians'. The most important contradiction involves Europe. Although a convinced supporter of European union, he indicates that a unified Europe will not be possible until his own country 'has brought the process of German unity, politically and economically, to a successful conclusion'. By then, however, it may be too late. For Schmidt also records that if Europe does not adopt a single currency by 2000, 'the D-Mark will, with virtual certainty . . . dominate the whole of Europe'. Because of the burdens of history, and his lack of faith in the political acumen of his compatriots, Schmidt does not want the D-Mark to rule Europe. His account none the less leaves the reader with the impression that this will be the most likely outcome.</p>

			<p>940927 FT  27 SEP 94 / Observer: Frying tonight Calling all under-employed Eurocrats - if that isn't something of a tautology. Get to work on rescuing Belgium's national snack, chips doused in mayonnaise. A potato shortage, caused partly by the hot summer, partly by farmers planting fewer spuds last season as a result of low prices, is threatening to extinguish the Belgian chips'n'mayonnaise snack, or at least convert it into something of a luxury. An opportunity here for Britain's Potato Marketing Board to justify its temporary reprieve and lend its support to the vanishing Belgian pomme frite?</p>

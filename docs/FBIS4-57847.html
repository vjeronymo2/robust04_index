			<p>BFN     [Report by Jose Quintero De Leon]    [Text] Comptroller General Jose Chen Barria has asked all of  the country's lawyers and members of the Supreme Court of  Justice to establish something that was already done in 1991 --  to remove secrecy protection from corporations so that offenses  can no longer be committed under this system.    His proposal was prompted by the scandal involving the  Homsany Group, which the National Bank of Panama [BNP] and the  Comptroller General's Office accuse of stealing millions of  balboas from the BNP. "We cannot let corporations' secrecy  serve to commit crimes," Comptroller Chen said. He said that in  this particular case, his office is using a precedent set by  Panamanian law regarding corporations. It would be up to the  courts to determine if it is possible to remove the cover of  secrecy from corporations, he said.    Regarding meddling by the Comptroller General's Office in  this case, he said the office acted according to its  responsibility and the law through the Directorate for the  Recovery of State Property.    In those instances, the delegated District Attorney's Office  continues gathering evidence, which clearly proves a crime was  comitted. The Homsany Group is trying to evade justice by using  the veil of corporations. "I hope the courts will do their work  and that the proofs, which are categorical, will be sufficient  for justice to prevail in Panama."    Chen Barria described what the Homsany Group did -- using 38  companies to steal 5.6 million balboas -- as detrimental to the  BNP's funds, which belong to all Panamanians. In fact, 33 of  these 38 companies were never in business, but their legal  representatives and those who signed as loan debtors were  employees earning between $200 to $250. "All of this shows a  duly structured and planned crime," Chen Barria commented.    The companies involved in this crime are not operating, but  the comptroller general revealed that the Homsany Group is  running these companies under other corporations.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Halifax about to report fresh house price fall First signs that the pace of the housing market recovery may be faltering are expected to emerge this week when Halifax building society announces that house prices fell in May. The society's latest housing figures are expected to be published tomorrow. They represent the second successive month in which Halifax, Britain's largest mortgage lender, has reported a fall in prices compared with the previous month. The decline in the past two months has coincided with the introduction of tax increases in April. There have been fears that the increases could inhibit returning consumer confidence. Signals from the housing market remain very mixed. Nationwide, Britain's second-largest building society, said yesterday that according to its mortgage figures house prices had risen by 1.4 per cent in May compared with the previous month. Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's operations director, said: 'May is traditionally a strong month for the housing market and the relatively large rise in prices recorded should be seen in that context.' The average price of a home had risen by 3.3 per cent to Pounds 54,617 during the previous three months. But Mr Davis agreed that 'recent indicators of market activity have been mixed'. He said: 'The underlying strengthening of the market which began in the spring of last year is likely to be maintained, but progress is steady rather than spectacular and heavily dependent on local conditions. 'The underlying trend over recent months has been broadly flat though prices continue to show positive gains compared with the same period last year.' Halifax had been prepared to regard a 0.2 per cent month-on-month price fall in April as a blip but has become more worried at a second successive monthly decline. As a result it is expected to warn that its forecast of an average 5 per cent price rise this year is less likely to be achieved. Nevertheless, it still expects to see some small increase. It is likely to wait for three or four months of falling prices before revising its forecast. It believes that it is still too early to determine the outcome of April's tax increases on housing market confidence although it is concerned that the rise in sales by estate agents may also be faltering a little. The Halifax house prices are seasonally adjusted, unlike Nationwide's survey. Halifax also uses a larger sample of mortgage loans.</p>

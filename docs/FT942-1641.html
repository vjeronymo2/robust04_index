			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Observer: Warsaw's honeypot This weekend Warsaw plays host to an event that would have warmed the cockles of the heart of Jacques Attali, former president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. International aristocrats, Citibank, Burger King and, yes, the EBRD are helping with the organisation of a series of events - including a ball and candle-lit dinners - to raise funds for a new children's cancer hospital, which will receive almost half the proceeds. The EBRD in London says it's providing 'no financial support whatsoever', though it thought it may have given permission for its name to be used. Warsaw's Royal Castle, rebuilt in the 1970s by Edward Gierek, then Communist party leader, will, for the first time since it was destroyed during the second world war, be the scene of a 'Red and White' dance - 'carriages at two' - on Saturday. Sunday will be devoted to visiting stately homes. Serena Balfour - her husband Neil has been acting as an EBRD consultant in Warsaw since 1992 - is the gala's moving spirit. She has assembled a glittering crowd of the great and the rich, including Rocco Forte, whose Bristol Hotel will be housing some of the prominent guests. Balfour says that, besides charity, the aim of the exercise is to erode Poland's foreign image as a desperately dull and dreary place. In a personal capacity, Guy de Selliers, a deputy vice-president of the EBRD, is one of 200 guests, including Wieslaw Kaczmarek, Poland's privatisation minister, who has been invited to attend at a reduced rate. Other guests will be paying Dollars 1,310, plus Dollars 290 for their room in the Bristol; not exorbitant, but still rather beyond the average monthly Polish salary, equivalent to Dollars 200.</p>

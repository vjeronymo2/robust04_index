			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Guorong (2621 0948 2837)] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, 15 Jun (XINHUA) -- The fifth meeting of  the Sino-Indian joint group on the economy, trade, science, and  technology opened here today. Both sides exchanged views on  further developing and expanding Sino-Indian trade. Both sides  also agreed that there is great potential for economic and trade  cooperation between the two countries.    Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation, and Indian Commerce Minister Mukherjee headed their  respective delegations at the meeting.    Mukherjee said that thanks to their joint efforts and  compared to 10 years ago, bilateral trade has increased in a  many-fold way and has scored good results. He pointed out,  however, that this trade still does not accord with the two  countries' status. Wu Yi agreed with Mukherjee's views and said  that the economic and trade cooperation between the two  countries needs to be further developed.    Wu Yi said that both China and India are strong in the area  of technology. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage the  development of the technology trade. Over the last year, the  range of bilateral economic and trade cooperation has begun to  develop from the commodity trade to the technology trade. There  has been considerable development in the areas of mutual  investment and technological cooperation. Both sides can take  advantage of each other's superiority in the areas of  metallurgy, machinery, and computers.    Mukherjee expressed the hope of changing the mode of  Sino-Indian trade transactions, which used to be mainly  conducted through a third party. Wu Yi agreed with him on this  point.    This afternoon, Wu Yi and Mukherjee also signed the 1994  Sino-Indian trade agreement and the minutes of the fifth meeting  of the Sino-Indian joint group on the economy, trade, science,  and technology.</p>

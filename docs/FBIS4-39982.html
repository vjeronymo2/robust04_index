			<p>BFN     [Text] On Friday Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed a  decree on the banking system in Russia. The president's press  service has issued the full text of the decree.    The decree states that the restrictions included in the  first  section of the presidential decree on banks of November 17, 1993  do not affect operations with Russian residents if these  operations are specified in licences granted by the Russian  Central Bank up to the issuing of the decree to foreign banks or  banks with joint capital set up on Russian territory by banks  from countries with which Russia has concluded agreements on  investment encouragement and protection.    The president agreed with the suggestion of the Central Bank  on granting licences to carry out banking operations to foreign  and joint banks if foreign states grant Russian banks similar  conditions in their activities abroad.    The president recommends that the Central Bank increase its  supervision of the work of commercial banks, credit  organizations and carries out thorough investigations of their  activities no less than once every two years. The Central Bank  has been given three months to work out and present to the  government suggestions on developing consumer credit.    The Central Bank has also been charged with accelerating the  pace of setting up a fund for protecting the money of citizens  invested in Russian banks.    The decree stipulates that investments can be guaranteed by  the state at the expense of this fund in cases set down in  Russian law.    The president spoke in favor of adopting new banking laws to  secure the mutual representation of the government and the  Central Bank in order to carry out agreed measures on carrying  out credit and monetary policy.    The decree also lays down that the Central Bank will take  part in government sessions while the finance and economics  minsters will take part in sessions of the Council of Directors  of the Central Bank.    Laws and actions by organs of state power disrupting the  unity of the system of the Central Bank are declared  inadmissible. The document states that the Central Bank is a  federal bank and according to the Russian Constitution its  actions are regulated exclusively by federal organs of state  power.</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Milken judge set for top job in Justice PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is reported to have selected Judge Kimba Wood to be attorney general, subject to final checks by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to make sure she does not create the same kind of problems that forced his first choice for the position, Ms Zoe Baird, to withdraw. Ms Wood, a 49 year old anti-trust lawyer who has been a federal district judge in New York since 1988, is best known for presiding over the trial of Mr Michael Milken, Drexel Burnham Lambert's junk bond specialist, for securities fraud. Before becoming a judge, she represented the Lloyd's insurance market as an attorney for the New York firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby and MacRae. Some more senior candidates for the position of attorney general, such as Judge Patricia Wald of the federal appeals court in Washington, have declined to make the move from the bench to the Justice Department. Officials said Mr Clinton would not announce Ms Wood's nomination until FBI background checks had been completed. The process is being conducted carefully to ensure that no flaws, such as Ms Baird's admission that she had hired an illegal alien as a nanny, emerge during her confirmation hearings. Although a White House spokesman said the president was angered by leaks of the candidates for the position, other officials indicated that Ms Wood's name, along with those of Mr Charles Ruff, a Washington lawyer, and Mr Gerald Baliles, a former governor of Virginia, was being widely circulated to test for reactions.</p>

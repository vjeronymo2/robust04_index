			<p>BFN     [Text] Harare May 24 SAPA -- More than 7,000,000 people in  the Southern Africa Development Community region are in need of  food aid, World Food Programme regional information officer  Mercedes Sayagues said on Tuesday.    Ms Sayagues said about 3,000,000 Malawians, 2,500,000  Angolans, 1,500,000 Mozambicans, 150,000 Swazi and 150,000  Tanzanians would require aid this year, the ZIANA news agency  reported.    "While we are not having problems transporting food aid to  Tanzania, Malawi and Swaziland, Angola and Mozambique are our  problem countries," she said, adding that poor roads in the two  countries hampered the delivery of food aid.    "Crop failure added to Angola's problems and we have been  delivering about 16,000 tons of food to 1,600,000 people in need.    "Tanzania has its problems and they are being fueled by the  spill over of refugees from Rwanda and Burundi. Tanzania now has  more than 400,000 refugees." She said.</p>

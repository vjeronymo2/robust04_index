			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Perverse Sir, Would you buy an advertising campaign for your company from an advertising company which did not understand the value of a company name ('Saatchi chairman forced to quit by US shareholders', December 17)? In 20 years Saatchi has built an enviable worldwide profile attractive to both clients and investors. Anonymity would seem a rather perverse corporate move, but very attractive to the competition.

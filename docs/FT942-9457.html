			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Business Travel: A trip abroad is no holiday - Many staff feel entitled to keepperks My recent article on this page asking whether business travellers should give their frequent-flyer points and cash rebates to their employers ('A partiality for perks', April 25) attracted the following riposte from a reader in Suffolk. 'The fact that you have written the article at all is evidence of the common view of those left behind at the office, that leaping on to an aeroplane means that one is going on holiday. 'The serious business passenger is the victim of every inconvenience afforded by airlines, datelines and civil disturbance. He or she should be the beneficiary of any advantage, personally.' The majority of respondents held this view. A business traveller from Volkswagen said: 'Why should the company penalise travellers and take away their little innocent pleasure of accumulating perks that they won't be able to use anyway? Remember, when they are on vacation they want to stay at home, not fly again.' A reader from the Netherlands added: 'I hope you will also leave us with the benefit of another perk - the copy of the FT we receive on board.' However, one senior executive wrote: 'Imagine if BA said: 'Choose our routing and flights for your next business travel purchase - even though they are a bit more expensive than the competition - and we will give you money in a brown envelope, addressed to your home.' Unarguably, a case of significant bribery. 'Yet staff have no qualms about air miles. Travel agents will tell you that executives will practically kill to gain air miles. Please don't attribute any quotes to me. I am in a minority of one, it seems.' Not quite. A substantial minority made the same point, adding that the company should also receive any cash rebates paid to travellers. One respondent wrote: 'Any time spent travelling is working time, paid for one way or another as part of the contract of employment. If some of this time is wasted and there is compensation to be had, then the compensation belongs to the owner of the wasted time - the company.' Mr Geoffrey Budd, company secretary of Dixons, the electrical retailer, asked whether travellers who accepted frequent-flyer points or cash compensation could experience legal difficulties. 'Where the employee is a director, there is an obligation not to make a secret profit and therefore he should account to the employer for all such benefits,' Mr Budd wrote. 'If, as a matter of corporate practice (whether articulated or adopted by default), employees are allowed to retain these benefits, they are presumably disclosable to the Inland Revenue and liable to income tax. This may be less important so far as free flights are concerned, but could be significant in relation to cash compensation.'</p>

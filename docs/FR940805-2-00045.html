			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from American Institute of Smoking Cessation, Inc. (hereinafter ``AISC''), its President, Kenneth C. Grossman, and its Vice-President, Jane A. Grossman, marketers of The Grossman Method seminar, a single, three-hour, group hypnosis session program for smoking cessation and weight loss. The Grossman Method seminar is offered to the public nationwide by Kenneth C. Grossman at hotel locales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for the reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final the agreement's proposed order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission's complaint charges that the proposed respondents deceptively advertised: (1) The likelihood of seminar participants' success in achieving abstinence from smoking cigarettes and weight loss; and (2) the effectiveness of proposed respondents' smoking cessation methods in leading consumers to achieve smoking abstinence compared to other stop-smoking methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Success  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The complaint against AISC, Kenneth C. Grossman and Jane A. Grossman alleges that the proposed respondents failed to possess a reasonable basis for claims they made regarding the success of their seminar participants in quitting smoking and quickly achieving weight loss, and made a false claim about smoking abstinence success. Through advertisements placed in various media in advance of their seminars, proposed respondents represented that surveys prove that 97 to 100 percent of their seminar participants permanently abstain from smoking after attending those seminars. The complaint alleges that this claim is false.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed respondents further represented through their advertisements, including the use of consumer endorsements, that seminar participants: (1) Typically are cured of smoking addiction and permanently abstain from smoking cigarettes; (2) are cured of smoking addiction without experiencing irritability, anxiety or weight gain; and (3) typically achieve weight loss quickly. Finally, proposed respondents represented that over 300,000 seminar participants have permanently quit smoking as a result of attending the Grossman Method seminar over the last fifteen years, and that up to or over 98% of consumers attending The Grossman Method seminar have quit smoking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that these success claims for seminar attendees' smoking cessation and weight loss are deceptive because proposed respondents did not posses adequate substantiation for those claims at the time they made the claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order seeks to address the alleged success misrepresentations cited in the accompanying complaint in five ways. First, the order (Part I.B.) requires proposed respondents to possess a reasonable basis consisting of competent and reliable scientific evidence substantiating any claim about the performance or efficacy of any smoking cessation or weight loss program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the proposed order (Part I.A.) prohibits proposed respondents from representing that seminar participants are cured of smoking addiction without experiencing side effects, such as irritability, anxiety or weight gain, unless the claim is substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, the proposed order (Part I.C.) prohibits proposed respondents from representing through any endorsements that seminar participants have achieved success in smoking abstinence or weight loss unless the claimed success is representative of the typical or ordinary experience of all such participants, and competent and reliable scientific evidence substantiates that claim, or respondents clearly and prominently disclose either: (1) What the generally expected results would be for program participants, or (2) the limited applicability of the endorser's experience to what consumers may generally expect to achieve, that is, that consumers should not expect to achieve similar results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, the proposed order (Part I.D.) generally prohibits proposed respondents from misrepresenting the existence, contents, validity, results, conclusions, or interpretations of any test, study, survey or report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Tsygankov: "`Things Would Be Harder; </F> Things Would Be Worse': The Chairman of the Belarusian National  Bank on Possible Unification of Belarus's and Russia's Monetary  Systems"]    [Text] At a press conference held in Minsk Stanislav  Bogdankevich, Belarus's chief banker, talked disapprovingly  about those "heightened expectations" which exist in the society  with regard to the absorption of the Belarusian currency. "It's  simply amazing how tenaciously vital such expectations are,"  Bogdankevich declared, and then he uttered the sentence quoted  in the headline above. Bogdankevich based his pessimism, first  and foremost, on the circumstance that it is specifically the  devaluation of the national currency which is helping to keep  exporters afloat. "But instead of seeing these problems, society  is maintaining and even encouraging certain illusions," he  emphasized.    In speaking about the Russian-Belarusian talks, Bogdankevich  said that the Russian side was constantly departing from  positions which had been worked out quite some time ago. In  contrast to previously signed agreements, Russia now considers  it necessary to retain clearing operations. At the present time,  moreover, the Russian experts (and these include deputy  ministers and even ministers) are already proposing to eliminate  the National Bank of Belarus and to open a branch of the Central  Bank of Russia in Minsk. The Russians have also begun to  renounce unified prices on energy resources (Prime Minister  Kebich has steadfastly emphasized that this is the most  important thing in the process of monetary unification); and  they are proposing to introduce agreed-to or contract prices. To  a question from NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA as to whether it would be  possible--at least theoretically--for Belarus to agree to such  conditions Bogdankevich replied: "No! We in Belarus are not  suicidal. Neither Kebich nor Bogdankevich will ever sign such  documents. At the same time, however, the National Bank chairman  did reaffirm that he supported the signing of an agreement based  on previously stipulated conditions. "We were prepared to sign  it even yesterday," Bogdankevich declared.    Bogdankevich commented quite sharply on the frequent trips  taken by Prime Minister Kebich to visit his colleague  Chernomyrdin and their private-type, one-on-one meetings. "I  don't understand these meetings, nor do I see their results," he  said. Furthermore, the chairman harshly criticized Belarus's  domestic economic policy, particularly the issuance of more than  one and a half trillion to the agrarian sector. This money was  distributed among the kolkhozes and sovkhozes in proportion to  their amounts of arable lands, regardless of profitability and  productivity. "This is not only not the path to a market-type  economy. Such things were not done even under socialism,"  Bogdankevich declared indignantly. He reported that just during  the first two months of this year the money supply in this  republic doubled. In Bogdankevich's opinion, the inflation rate  in March will exceed 50 percent; he also predicted a sharp rise  in the rate of exchange for the dollar.    The National Bank chairman reaffirmed his adherence to  market-type relations, but he stated the following with regard  to development in Belarus: "We are not at the beginning of the  path, but rather at the beginning of its beginning." In point of  fact, as of right now, there is not a single state economic  entity which has declared bankruptcy, whereas at certain  enterprises turning out products "for the warehouse" the  employees are earning from 500,000 to 600,000 (as compared to  the average wage of 200,000 in Belarus). Bogdankevich termed the  situation in the matter of accounting "communism." It is a  situation whereby as much as you like can be taken and used  without any intention at all of paying it back.    Bogdankevich's words demonstrate once again that nowadays  within the Belarusian leadership he has remained, in fact, the  only firm advocate of market-type relations and independence for  this republic. Therefore, regardless of Bogdankevich's  statements to the effect that he does not take a confrontational  stance in relation to the government, many observers and  journalists have a feeling of concern for his further career.</p>

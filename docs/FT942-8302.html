			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (12): Tax free era is over - Mutual funds have room for growth despite recent legislation Mutual funds in Greece have experienced explosive growth over the past five years: numbers have have risen from two to more than 70, with a total of Dr1,320bn under management at the end of the first quarter this year. This pattern looked likely to continue, when the socialist government unexpectedly imposed a 15 per cent tax on distributed dividends from the funds' earnings from previously untaxed sources such as government securities, capital gains on equities and foreign earnings. A second blow came when the government decided to tax interest earned on 'repos'  - fixed-term repurchase agreements - at 15 per cent, too. Previously, income from government securities had been wholly tax-free, although interest earnings on bank deposits were taxed at 15 per cent. Both measures were included in a new fiscal package voted through parliament last month, intended to raise revenues and curb tax evasion. However, they are expected to slow down the growth of mutual funds over the next 12 months. Furthermore, according to some fund managers, they could lead to redemptions. 'Some people will leave as an emotional reaction - rather than a logical one  -simply because they don't want to pay tax,' says Mr Dimitris Paparistides, a fund manager with Intertrust. Other investors may redeem their holdings in order to buy government bonds - still tax-free for individual investors. However, they are not likely to take up the five- and seven-year bonds which the state has been selling to the funds in order to extend its debt profit. With Greek holdings in mutual funds equivalent to only about 14 per cent of bank deposits, compared to 60 per cent in France, there is still considerable potential for growth. However, the funds have more than 70 per cent of their holdings invested in government securities, paying real interest rates of 8-10 per cent, while many of them have been using repos as the equivalent of short-term bank deposits. Neither will fund managers be able to bypass the new legislation through ploughing back gains from investments now subject to tax. While profits from capital gains need not be distributed, dividends and coupon earnings must be paid in full. Mr Paparistides says: 'Unless government bonds are also taxed, the rapid increase in the growth of funds will be halted.' The cynical view is that the government has decided to tax mutual funds as part of its drive to reduce tax evasion. There are an estimated 200,000 small- and medium-sized investors with holdings in mutual funds, of which a sizeable portion derives from the black economy. At worst, investors may decide to take a tax-free profit by redeeming their holdings before December 31, when dividends are distributed. According to the Union of Greek Institutional Investors, this would force the funds to liquidate large volumes of holdings, with potentially disastrous effects on the Athens stock market. Mutual funds took off in Greece as part of the liberalisation of financial markets at the end of the 1980s, while the lifting of controls on medium-term capital movements offered the option of making investments abroad. Both banks and insurance companies have been active in setting up funds, which are required to have minimum capitalisation of Dr200m and are managed by independent companies. Large Greek insurance companies are well placed to market the funds to small investors through their extensive sales networks. While the funds can invest freely in Greek or European Union equities and new issues, no more than 20 per cent of holdings can be invested in stock markets outside the EU. Funds are not permitted to invest more than 10 per cent of net worth in a single company and cannot hold more than 40 per cent of its portfolio in companies in which it owns five per cent or more. The maximum stake a fund can take in an individual company is 10 per cent. The maximum holding in one company by all the funds managed by a single investment company is limited to 30 per cent. As a result, a parent bank or insurance company cannot lean on fund managers to shore up prices or indirectly underwrite capital increases. Before the new tax measures, mutual fund managers were predicting another year of healthy growth, with total investment rising to well over Dr2,000bn. The projections have fallen, but some managers remain optimistic. 'We still believe that funds under management can rise to around Dr1,700bn this year in spite of the tax,' says Mr Spyros Kriticopoulos, investment director at Alico Eurobank. Alico found itself in the uncomfortable position of launching a fixed income fund just after the new measures were introduced, together with a US dollar bond fund. While subscriptions for the fixed income fund were considerably lower than originally anticipated, the bond fund attracted 'a lot of interest, suggesting that investors are willing to diversify rather than liquidate their holdings,' Mr Kriticopoulos adds.</p>

The case is to be returned to the State  Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Moldova in view of  opening penal procedures against the judges belonging to the  anti-constitutional court in Tiraspol, who participated in the  passing of the illegitimate sentence that jeopardized the life,  freedom, and health of those sentenced.    At the same time the Moldovan body decided to terminate the  preventive arrest of the six [members of the Ilascu group].    In a statement made to our correspondent, Nicolae Gore, a  member of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Republic of  Moldova, emphasized the fact that today's court ruling annuls  the Tiraspol sentence and all its consequences. According to  the laws of the Republic of Moldova, as soon as the sentence was  annulled, the Ilascu group has to be released from jail, added  Nicolae Gore.</p>

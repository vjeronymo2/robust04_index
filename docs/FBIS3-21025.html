The National Center  for Space Studies (CNES) will act as chief contractor for the  device, which has been dubbed Vegetation. The Earth observation  satellite Spot-4 is expected to be placed into orbit around  mid-1997.    The French space agency announced that the European  Commission and the CNES 1 had signed an agreement  to allocate 16 million ecus to the French agency for the program  on 17 January in Paris. Besides the European Commission, France,  Belgium, Sweden, and Italy will team up on the project, for  which Aerospatiale (France) has been selected as chief  industrial contractor in charge of instrument payload.    Europe expects to finance 50 percent of the cost of the  Vegetation program, including manufacture of the instrument and  construction of an image-processing center. According to the  CNES, the Commission already plans "an additional funding  package."    The CNES directed construction of the first three Spot  satellites, in partnership with Belgium and Sweden. Spot-3 was  placed in orbit last 26 September.  Footnotes    1. Represented by Mssrs. Jean-Pierre Contzen, general  director of the Joint Research Center (the European Commission's  JRC), and Jean-Daniel Levi, CNES general director.</p>

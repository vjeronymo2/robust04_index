			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Peruvian government upholds sale of airline THE PERUVIAN government has upheld the sale of the state-owned airline Aeroperu to a consortium headed by the Mexican carrier Aeromexico. Aeromexico and partners bid Dollars 54m for the airline, but the sale was challenged on the grounds that the Peruvian carrier would be controlled by foreign investors, contrary to Peru's privatisation rules. While Aeromexico would own only 47 per cent of Aeroperu, it was maintained that its close ties with its Peruvian partners gave it effective control. However, Peru's economy minister said the sale was a 'closed case'. Aeromexico will, therefore, gain control of Aeroperu's flights to Europe and expand business into South America. The sale comes as Aeromexico, which has around half the Mexican market, is holding talks with Mexicana, Mexico's other principal airline, on a possible merger. Mexicana is expected to make heavy losses this year, and its owners are keen to team with the more efficient rival. In spite of a recent law against monopolies, the government appears willing to let the merger go ahead. Investors in Aeromexico and Mexicana will, it is reported, create a holding company to manage both airlines, with Aeromexico having majority ownership. The new holding company may well seek an alliance with Continental Airlines, since Mr Alfredo Brener, Mexicana's main shareholder, will acquire an interest in the Houston-based carrier when, as expected, it emerges from bankruptcy protection soon.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the Commission notes that the proposal contains safeguards designed to ensure that only qualified firms are permitted to register as order service firms. For example, CBOE Rule 6.77 retains the provisions currently applicable to stock services and requires firms to apply to the CBOE's Membership Department for registration as an order service firm. Under CBOE Rule 6.77, the applications will continue to be reviewed by the CBOE's Membership Committee, which will consider the applicant's financial condition, regulatory history, and other factors in determining whether to approve the firm's application for registration as an order service firm. The Commission believes, as it has stated in connection with stock services, that it is appropriate for an options exchange to monitor firms operating on its floor to ensure the proper operation of floor activities and thus to require Membership Committee approval of order service firms. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24814 (August 18, 1987), 52 FR 32224 (August 26, 1987) (order approving File No. SR-CBOE&hyph;87&hyph;07).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal also contains provisions designed to ensure the financial integrity of the order service firms. Specifically, proposed CBOE Rule 6.78 requires order service firms to obtain a letter of guarantee issued by a member of the OCC. Under the letter of guarantee, the issuing clearing member accepts financial responsibility for all orders handled by the order service firm on the CBOE floor and for all financial obligations of the order service firm to the Exchange. CBOE Rule 6.78 also provides that no clearing member shall be permitted to guarantee more than three order service firms without the prior written approval of the Department of Financial Compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, paragraph (d) of CBOE Rule 6.77 makes clear that to the extent an order service firm takes orders for the purchase or sale of commodity futures contracts and options thereon, it must comply with the CEA and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Paragraph (d) also requires order service firms to keep the CBOE's Department of Financial Compliance apprised of their registration status under the CEA on an ongoing basis, including any financial reporting or capital requirements. Accordingly, the Commission expects the CBOE to allow only those firms which meet the applicable requirements of the CEA to register with the Exchange as order service firms. In addition, the Commission expects the CBOE to carefully monitor the order service firms' compliance with the relevant provisions of the CEA and to revoke the CBOE registration of any order service firm that fails to satisfy those requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> It is therefore ordered,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;16) is approved.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9&blank;15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10&blank;17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

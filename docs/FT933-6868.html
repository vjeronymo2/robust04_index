			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Mercedes intends to cut further 14,000 jobs next year MERCEDES-BENZ, the luxury car and commercial vehicles maker, aims to cut more than DM1bn (Pounds 394m) from its labour costs by shedding a further 14,000 jobs in Germany next year and reducing employee benefits. The company, which opened talks about the cuts package with workers' representatives yesterday, suggested that further steps could be needed, and warned also that forced redundancies in administration and the bus and trucks divisions might be unavoidable. Company-paid benefits for the remaining workforce would in future focus on health and pension contributions, it said in a statement. Traditional Christmas and other bonuses would be linked to group performance, and other payments 'out of keeping with the times' would no longer be paid. The proposed workforce cuts follow a reduction of 14,700 in the domestic payroll in 1992 and the planned loss of a further 7,000 jobs this year. The threat of possible redundancies, virtually unknown in German industry, suggests traditional means of cutting jobs - early retirement and natural wastage - no longer suffice. The proposed cuts in benefits, which follow similar savings tactics pioneered recently by Bosch, the leading motor components maker, demonstrate growing confidence that industry can attack time-honoured perks. It is common for German paint-shop workers, for example, to be granted extra paid leave to take annual 'cures' in spa towns, even though working conditions and health protection have improved dramatically since such schemes were introduced. Mercedes, like other German vehicle makers, has discovered that medium-term savings plans put forward last year are insufficient to counter the impact of the motor industry slump. Springtime forecasts that the German market would shrink by 20 per cent and overall European sales by 10 per cent have been over-optimistic. While total car sales in western Europe fell 18 per cent in the first seven months of this year - due partly to a 25 per cent drop in Germany - deliveries of Mercedes models tumbled by more than 27 per cent. According to VDA figures, first-half production of light trucks in Germany fell 34 per cent. Mr Achim Diekmann, director of Germany's VDA automotive industry association, said recently 100,000 jobs would have to go by the middle of 1995. Nissan warning, Page 7 Honda profits fall, Page 19</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Yugoslavia named Ante Markovic, 64, a liberal reformer from Croatia, as new  premier in a move to try to pull the country out of its economic crisis.  Analysts saw Markovic's appointment by the collective state presidency as  evidence that a political compromise might have between struck between Serbia  and Croatia, the country's two largest republics. It also signaled that  Yugoslavia might move more firmly toward economic reforms that party  conservatives resisted last year as the country plunged into its worst  political and economic chaos since World War II. Markovic, whose appointment  must be approved by Parliament, will succeed Branko Mikulic, whose government  resigned Dec. 30.  </P></p>

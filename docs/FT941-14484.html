			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Arts: One sail short of a full rig - Theatre Daphne Du Maurier (1907-89) wrote three plays: the third, September Tide opened in London in 1948 and is now at the Comedy Theatre in a joint production with The King's Head, the Thorndike Theatre Leatherhead and the Liverpool Playhouse. This brief Cornish sea tale is one sail short of a full rig; but it is well acted and neatly paced. Evan, a rumbustious Welsh artist of the Dylan Thomas variety, is unromantically married to Cherry, a sulky, idle Chelsea art student. They visit her mother, Stella, at her beach house in Cornwall; Evan falls in love with his new mother-in-law, and the situation is further complicated by Cherry's loutish brother and Stella's suave local suitor. It is hard to tell whether this is a comedy: director Celia Bannermann's problem is that Du Maurier's style is so open that any interpretation can fit. The lines played as jokes pop up uninvited and unannounced: 'How do you do, I'm mother,' says Stella to Evan, 'I've never had a son-in-law' and he replies 'Perhaps I'll be the first of many.' Du Maurier is at her best in stories which adapt well for the screen (Don't Look Now, Jamaica Inn, The Birds) where her wonderful ability to create atmosphere can be translated into images which have a vaguely menacing feel. This show starts with a haunting tune from Eric Satie and ends with Stella looking at the ferry which carries Evan away. In between there are meaningful pauses over Evan's portrait of Stella and a warning about the power of those September tides. In essence, this resembles Noel Coward's Brief Encounter. One character declares love for another and the situation becomes too too unbearable for both. The acting carries the weakness of Du Maurier's plot. As the brawling Evan, Michael Praed is superb: loose-limbed, quirky and passionate. His moods shape every scene he plays. Opposite him, Susannah York as Stella is still too distrait for a woman he would fall for; her best scene is alone on stage waiting for him to tie up a boat during a storm, without speaking, she gets across how worried she is that he might not return, and then hides her concern from him when he does. Elsewhere, the cast seems less certain about their difficult roles. Hermione Norris as Cherry is belligerent to a fault, and Peter Byrne as Stella's suitor polite beyond belief. Du Maurier originally called the play Mother, and based the central character on Ellen Doubleday: it still bears the marks of that infatuation, although Du Maurier protested that she was not a lesbian. What she has left is a vacuum of a play filled by two good central roles. Comedy Theatre (071 867 1045)</p>

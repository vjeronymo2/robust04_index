OBSERVERS  </P> <P> Officials of five Central American nations Wednesday endorsed a plan to send  U.N. peacekeepers to the region to ensure that guerrillas don't launch  cross-border raids.  </P> <P> The plan, which needs U.N. approval, calls for up to 100 military observers to  monitor Central American border areas.  </P> <P> "We approved the document in the sense that we discussed the document, and  there are no disagreements," Nicaragua's deputy foreign minister, Victor Hugo  Tinoco, said after talks with military and Foreign Ministry officials from El  Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala.  </P> <P> Representatives from the five nations will next ask the world body to begin  setting up the peacekeeping force, a step Tinoco called "a formality."  </P> <P> Final approval must come from the U.N. Security Council.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] History has provided us with many examples of  how dangerous it is to neglect the technical equipping of the  armed forces. [passage omitted]    Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin, Russian first deputy defense  minister, answered questions from our correspondent.    [Begin Kokoshin recording] The task of the Defense Ministry  has been in the key areas to ensure, albeit with minimum  funding, since we have been constantly underfinanced, both the  development of the most up-to-date equipment and its serial  production; nonetheless, the new equipment that has been  developed in general in recent years has been, so to speak, a  very slender trickle, but it is coming through and it will come  through. In 1994 we shall probably have to direct our main  efforts on preserving what the forces have and on modernizing  what they have. This includes such celebrated air defense  missile systems as the S-300VM and TOR systems. We will also of  course be ordering the BUK M2 system and a number of others,  which cover the whole spectrum in respect of range and altitude.  That is to say, we are talking about those systems which when  linked together in a unified complex can tackle air defense  tasks in a theater of military actions.    We have in general, I consider, reached a definite new level  in the development of tactical communication systems. By as  early as the end of this year we should have provided the most  up-to-date communications facilities for a number of our elite  units in the most important areas where combat tasks or tasks  close to combat ones have to be tackled. We do not intend  either to do without new ships, and the launching of new ships  is planned. The hoisting of the St. Andrew's flag is planned  aboard a new destroyer at the Northern Shipyard and we hope by  the end of 1994 to have completed work on the heavy missile  cruiser Petr Velikiy.    We are continuing work on the most varied kinds of space  facilities and this year we shall be adding something and our  space group, so to speak, will be renewed. Improvements are  being made too to our space missile-attack early warning systems  and to our space-based communications, including for the  tactical system for instance.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour plays downdivisions on Europe LABOUR yesterday disguised its internal divisions over the Maastricht treaty by keeping open all its options if the government tries to press ahead with ratification. After an at times heated debate at the weekly meeting of the parliamentary party, MPs voted by an overwhelming show of hands to remit three diverging proposals on strategy, allowing the shadow cabinet to prepare a new position for presentation next week. While the vote risked Conservative charges that Labour is as undecided as the government on how to react to the Danish referendum result, it served to maintain an appearance of party unity. The compromise was widely seen as a short-term tactical victory for the party leadership, which had initially responded to a demand from Mr Tony Benn for a British referendum by tabling an ambiguous amendment. Its wording, drawn up by Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary, argued that while the Maastricht text fell far short of Labour's official European Community policy on a number of issues, it also embraced many of its goals. Rather than indicating a clear strategy, the shadow cabinet's line merely insisted that it would be 'improper' for parliament to continue the ratification process until the Community had decided a clear way forward. In consequence, the leadership's amendment fell a long way short of an alternative amendment tabled by Mr Peter Hain, the Tribunite MP for Neath. His proposal, reportedly attracting growing support from many quarters in the party, criticised the Maastricht accord for its narrowly monetarist criteria for economic and monetary union and called for outright Labour opposition to ratification. Urging support for the leadership's amendment, Mr Neil Kinnock, the party leader, praised Mr Hain's goals and in an implicit rebuke for Mr Benn argued that 'the days for semi-detachment' over Europe were over. He went on to warn that parliamentary realities, including the possibility that the Maastricht bill will not be resubmitted, meant it was important not to 'tie the hands of the future leadership', to be elected on July 18. When Mr David Blunkett, campaign manager for Mr Bryan Gould's leadership challenge, argued for the remission of all three proposals he won overwhelming support, although Mr Benn refused to withdraw his referendum scheme. Mr Benn insisted after the meeting that his efforts to win party support for a plebiscite had had 'a good start' and would build before the party conference. Mr Hain claimed that while the parliamentary party clearly opposed the referendum option, it was equally sceptical about the leadership's cautious tactics. Praising the meeting's outcome as a 'unity position', he nonetheless argued that the momentum was now gathering behind his stance of firm opposition to the treaty terms. Radical Labour party members were pro-European but opposed to a 'bankers' vision' of Europe, he said. In Strasbourg this week, Mr John Smith, now all but certain to be the next Labour leader, appeared to be giving some ground to Mr Gould's position by emphasising the need for more democratic accountability in the EC. While repeating his own firm support for Labour's qualified backing for the Maastricht accord, he also made clear that it should pursue with its sister socialist parties an economic strategy 'based on sustainable growth and the highest possible levels of employment.' Nonetheless, Labour is clearly tiptoeing towards a position where it can make common cause with the Tory rebels and vote comfortably against the government without drawing charges of political opportunism. The aim is to maximise Conservative unease without putting its own unity at risk in the process.</p>

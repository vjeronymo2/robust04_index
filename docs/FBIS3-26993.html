			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Political Editor Mary Binks] </F>   [Text] China has dashed hopes of a speedy resolution to  the protracted wrangling with Britain over the financing of the  Chek Lap Kok airport. Beijing yesterday gave its first  indications of dissatisfaction with the latest financing  proposal submitted by the British side more than a week ago.  Britain's fourth funding proposal in a year was believed to  have met China's demand for a bigger equity injection to cushion  debts incurred by the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) and  the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC). But Chinese  sources yesterday said the obstacles to agreement remained  two-fold.    The proposed equity injection of $60 billion is contingent  on  China's approval of an additional land grant. Britain wants 62  hectares of land along the airport rail link sold under a  gradual sell-off. The grant would be in addition to the annual  50-hectare ceiling for land sales stipulated in annexe three of  the Sino-British Joint Declaration. But the Chinese side  remains concerned about the effect of this on the coffers of the  post-1997 Special Administrative Region (SAR) government.  Sources said the Chinese side was reluctant to change the  arrangement under which this land could be disposed of only by  the SAR government.    The other obstacle was the Chinese side's dissatisfaction  with what it regarded as Britain's failure to establish an  independent committee to monitor the cost of the airport  project. It maintained that the British side had persistently  circumvented the Airport Consultative Committee, a body set up  to oversee financing arrangements.    Despite China's concerns over the latest funding proposal,  it  is expected to propose a meeting of the Sino-British Joint  Liaison Group (JLG) Airport Committee next week. Chinese JLG  team leader Guo Fengmin yesterday confirmed that Beijing had  studied the fourth financing proposal, but that there were  problems which needed to be discussed. Mr Guo would not  elaborate. Three rounds of JLG expert meetings are expected to  be held in the next two weeks. Next week, the two sides will  try to resolve the impasse on the future of military sites in  Hong Kong after 1997.</p>

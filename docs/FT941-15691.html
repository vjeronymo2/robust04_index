			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Outlook brightens for New Zealand livestock sector New Zealand's sheep and beef farmers are looking forward to a bonanza year thanks to a happy coincidence of excellent weather, an improving international economic climate and the settlement in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Rob Davison, director of the Meat and Wool Board's Economic Service, yesterday predicted that the average farm's pre-tax profits would rise by about 15 per cent to NZDollars 42,300 (Pounds 15,900), which would be the highest level since the 1984-85 season. Mr Davison said the year's start was 'excellent by all measures'. Cattle were in good condition and the numbers and condition of lambs was greatly improved on last season. He suggested that there could be some rebuilding of the national sheep flock, which fell to 50.3m head late last year, a 30-year low. Over the past decade sheep numbers have fallen by 20m, from an all-time high of 70.3m in 1983, in reaction to a combination of low wool prices and adverse weather conditions that has encouraged farmers to switch to dairying and forestry. Good seasonal conditions were expected to boost the wool clip and provide a 7 per cent rise in production, Mr Davison said. Wool prices had been volatile but were expected to show an underlying upward trend. In a separate report the Wool Board said that the average market indicator, the price of wool per kilogram, was 400 NZ cents at December 30, compared with the board's own forecast 400 to 425 cents. In its review of the first six months of the season the board said it expected prices to continue to improve over the rest of the season to June 30. It said it was sticking with its prediction of an average price this season of up to 425 cents a kilogram. In his report Mr Davison said farmers should expect good prices to continue for lamb and sheep, which should rise by a further 5 per cent on last season. 'The outlook for sheep products is good. Though wool prices are at a low level for the fourth consecutive year, growth in the world economy and lower wool supplies are expected to lift prices over the next few years,' he explained. 'The Gatt agreement provides optimism for the future, though in the current year access problems remain.'. Last week the US confirmed that it was reducing the amount of beef it would buy from New Zealand in the coming 12 months. 'The medium term prospect for meat and wool farmers is for less competition from subsidised producers, which has been leading to surpluses on world markets and lower prices,' Mr Davison said. New Zealand farmers operate without subsidies of any kind. Discussing beef prices, Mr Davison said the outlook was less certain. 'Prices are are expected to ease by 5 to 8 per cent from last season, but will still be at a good level for the fifth consecutive year,' he said.</p>

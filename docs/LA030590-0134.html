			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> 2 SUSPECTED IN WATER-BOMBING  </P> <P> Utah State University police said today that they have at least two suspects in  the water-bomb drenching of Nevada-Las Vegas Coach Jerry Tarkanian and his  Rebels during a game here last week.  </P> <P> "We're pretty sure we know who did it," USU Police Director Larry Arave said.  </P> <P> "It's pretty hard to pull off a caper like this and not leave a trail."  </P> <P> Arave would not identify the suspects or say how they were uncovered, except to  say they are former USU students and that one of them was seen near the UNLV  bench, where the water bomb was believed set before game time.  </P> <P> No arrests had been made, and Arave said no further action is anticipated until  Wednesday. Possible charges could include criminal mischief, trespassing or  intentionally disturbing a public meeting, he said.  </P></p>

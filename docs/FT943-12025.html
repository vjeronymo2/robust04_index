			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Year starts well at Carpetright Sir Philip Harris, chairman and chief executive of Carpetright, told shareholders at the annual meeting that sales in the first 12 weeks of the current year were up by about 30 per cent. This improvement, Sir Philip added, was considered satisfactory by the board, given the weak market for carpets in the UK and the adverse effect of the continuing hot weather. Seven new stores had opened in the current year, all of which were trading successfully. The new openings brought the total number of outlets to 152, and a further 30 new openings were planned for the year, Sir Philip said.</p>

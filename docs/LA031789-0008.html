			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORD  </P> <P> A Nicaraguan delegation will visit Contra camps in Honduras this month to look  into allegations that the rebels are holding Nicaraguans against their will,  the archbishop of Managua announced. Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo spoke after  the National Reconciliation Commission, which he heads, met to discuss recent  peace moves. Obando said that the delegation, made up of members of Parliament,  opposition politicians and a Roman Catholic bishop, will travel to Honduras on  March 28. An estimated 11,000 Contras are in the Honduran camps. Nicaragua's  Sandinista regime alleges that the Contras have compelled thousands of peasants  to serve in their ranks.  </P></p>

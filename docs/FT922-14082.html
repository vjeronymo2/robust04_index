			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Nirex plan for Lakesdrilling rejected THE LAKE District special planning board yesterday refused permission for a 1,000-metre borehole in the Lake District National Park, proposed as part of geological investigations for a Pounds 2.5bn underground repository for nuclear waste. The decision is a second rebuff from the board for UK Nirex, the nuclear waste consortium. In December the board refused planning permission for two 49-metre high drilling rigs on fellsides at Bleng Fell and Whin Garth. Nirex says it needs to drill on the fells to study groundwater flow.</p>

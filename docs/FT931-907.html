			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Unit trust funds at record Pounds 69.2bn THE AMOUNT of money invested in unit trusts increased to a record Pounds 69.2bn at the end of February, as buoyant stock markets and falling interest rates encouraged investors to buy collective funds, Philip Coggan writes. Gross sales of unit trusts in February were Pounds 1.3bn, the highest figure since Pounds 1.7bn in September 1987. After allowing for repurchases of Pounds 738.3m, net investment was Pounds 590.7m, compared with Pounds 509m in Jan-uary. The industry was also boosted by strong sales of personal equity plans (Peps) as the end of the tax year approached. More than Pounds 53m was invested in UK equity income funds. Income and gains within Peps are tax-free. Even more encouraging for the industry was that the number of unit-holder accounts, which had been steadily declining since 1987, has started to increase. At the end of February the number of accounts was 4.4m compared with 4.35m last year. However, institutional investment provided almost Pounds 400m of February's net sales. The Budget change to advance corporation tax has raised fears that life insurance companies will find it less tax-efficient to invest in unit trusts. The industry is lobbying the Treasury to try to prevent the problem. The Budget also reduced the tax advantage of a Pep for a basic-rate taxpayer.</p>

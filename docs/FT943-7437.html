			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: Banesto sees 'positive' result Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) yesterday attempted to reassure shareholders it was on a stable footing, eight months after a summary intervention by the Bank of Spain. Mr Alfredo Saenz, chairman of the group controlled by Banco Santander, said it was already 'a normalised bank' and forecast that the second half would produce 'more positive' results after a first-half loss of Pta21.8bn (Dollars 168m). He said the bank had engaged US lawyers to contest a suit filed this month in New York by Carlisle Ventures, a unit of Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance. Carlisle claims it was misled when it subscribed to a Banesto capital increase in 1993 and is seeking repayment of Dollars 27.5m. The institutional tranche of the Pta94bn rights issue was priced at Pta1,900 a share, compared with yesterday's closing price of Pta1,075. The Banesto shareholders' meeting yesterday approved a motion of censure against the previous management, which was removed by the Bank of Spain in December. Consolidated 1993 accounts published yesterday showed losses of Pta584.6bn, with total non-performing assets for the group increasing to Pta898.1bn from Pta257.4bn in 1992. Mr Saenz said the bank had made 'encouraging progress' in recovering non-performing loans. Revised 1993 losses for the parent bank were Pta577.9bn, compared with a pre-tax profit of Pta23.8bn last time. Mr Saenz said the bank had decided to cancel its contract with accountants Price Waterhouse and entrust its future audits to Arthur Andersen. The meeting marked the completion of a rescue plan involving a Pta180bn capital injection, aid of Pta285bn to mop up non-performing assets, and a Pta315bn interest-free loan from Spain's Deposit Guarantee Fund.</p>

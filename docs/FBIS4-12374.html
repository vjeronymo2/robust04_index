			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Freezing Kashmir?"] </F>   [Text] There has been talk for sometime of freezing the  nuclear programme. But while we are still engaged in trying to  figure out its implications, another trial balloon, this time of  "freezing" the Kashmir issue, whatever that means, has gone up.  In the context of nuclear development a whole new vocabulary of  "capping", putting the brackes on, "freezing", "not crossing the  red line", "rolling back", etc, has grown and come to be  understood. But application of the same vocabulary on human  endeavour for the achievements of their basic rights, is really  hard to swallow. The report that Pakistan has been asked by the  US to "freeze the Kashmir issue", leaves one dismayed. Firstly,  because unlike its nuclear programme, Paksitan is not its sole  motivator or controller. There are two other parties -- the  freedom fighters and the Indian occupation troops -- neither  under Pakistan's control, who are hardly interested in freezing  it. The troops will continue their atrocities and the  freedom-fighters will continue their struggle. Unless Pakistan,  India and the Kashmiris agree to stop all their activities,  Pakistan's unilateral halt to its diplomatic offensive would  mean little. Secondly, the term "freezing" implies that but for  Pakistan there would be no trouble in Kashmir. This reading of  the situation, repeatedly projected by India, is believed by all  that is happening today. Pakistan had, in fact, kept Kashmir  issue on its back burner for nearly a decade, particularly  during General Zia's rule. Pakistani leadership had then been  persuaded by India to believe that the less important  differences between the two countries needed to be sorted out  first. That would, it was said, create the right climate of  confidence-building for solving the major issue of Kashmir. It  was the people of Kashmir who rose against that apathetic  approach. The message they sent to both Pakistan and India was  that they had a voice that needed to be heard. And their voice  continues to ring loud and clear, even as their blood flows  freely in the Valley. How can Pakistan, even if it wants to,  put out a flame that burns in the heart of every Kashmir?    Pakistan was asked by the US not to raise the Kashmir issue  in the UN General Assembly and instead talk to India. Pakistan  complied. India used that full to crush the Kashmiris with even  greater brutality. Then it passed a resolution in its  Parliament to enable it to refile from its own admission of the  status of Kashmir -- that of a disputed territory. Pakistan was  again asked by the US (and others) not to raise the Kashmir  issue at the UNHRC. Again Pakistan complied. India sent in  more troops in the Valley and started killing more people on  this side of the LOC. To keep the US beguiled, India first  despatched its Foreign Secretary and then some non-papers to  Pakistan. Their central theme was: "back to confidence-building  measures". Pakistan has been bitten by that bug before. It is  US's turn to be bitten by it. In a way it is the same approach  as on the nuclear issue. Ask Pakistan to "cap" first then we  will see if India follows. Now, ask Pakistan to freeze Kashmir  first then we will see if India can be restrained from its reign  of terror there. Someone has to be really naive to fall for  that line again and again. Pakistan has learnt its lesson.  Maybe the US will also learn its lesson at India's hands.</p>

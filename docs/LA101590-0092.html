			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK.  </P> <P> MGM/UA, Pathe Sued Over 007 Films: Danjaq S.A. sued MGM/UA Communications Co.  and Pathe Communications Corp. for allegedly violating a distribution contract  involving 17 James Bond films on which Danjaq owns the copyrights.  </P> <P> In the federal lawsuit, the Swiss company says it anticipates Pathe will be  unable to make adequate payments on MGM stock when the two companies are  expected to complete their merger this month. The suit charges that MGM "has  failed to supervise Pathe" in efforts to raise funds by distributing Bond  pictures on foreign markets, which, Danjaq says, violates a 1962 distribution  contract between itself and MGM. (Case No. 90-5498. Filed Oct. 11, 1990).  </P></p>

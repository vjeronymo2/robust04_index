			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Grupo Ibercorp seeks buyers for offshoots GRUPO IBERCORP, a Spanish financial services group, is negotiating with potential buyers for its banking offshoot and for its broking business. The group is seeking to sell some 30 per cent of its bank, Banco Ibercorp, to Banque D'Arjil, a French banking business. It hopes to merge its broking arm with a fellow member of the Madrid Stock Exchange. The search for partners or possible new owners for both enterprises illustrates the extent of the squeeze on margins facing smaller financial institutions in Spain. Ibercorp's broking arm has been hit by the end to fixed broking commissions on the Madrid Stock Exchange. With most of the broking business now in the hands of the big Spanish banks, the operating margins of independent brokers have weakened significantly. Yesterday's developments came amid an allegation by the Madrid newspaper, El Mundo, of possible fraud by Ibercorp's co-chairman, Mr Manuel de la Concha, a former head of the Madrid Stock Exchange. Mr de la Concha last night denied the allegations and said he was taking legal action against El Mundo. According to El Mundo, Mr de la Concha falsified the names of a list of shareholders in 1990, which was subsequently submitted to the stock market regulatory commission following its enquiries into the purchase of Ibercorp shares. Mr de la Concha said buyers of the shares were identified to the commission at the time. Yesterday the Bank of Spain had no comment on the report. Created in the early 1980s, the Ibercorp group was one of the first operations to be set up in Spain independently of the big banks to concentrate on asset management. Known popularly as the 'beautiful people's bank', it was backed by high net worth individuals and top socialites, some of whom were closely connected to senior members of the governing socialist party.</p>

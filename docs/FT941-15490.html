			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Wyko loss grows to Pounds 0.3m Falls in turnover and margins in UK manufacturing and losses in South Africa left Wyko, the West Midlands manufacturer and distributor of bearings and power transmission components, with increased interim pre-tax losses. The board has decided to pass the interim dividend, against last time's 0.5p. Mr Philip White, chairman, warned that although trading was expected to improve during the second half, all of the exceptional costs involved in scaling down the manufacturing operations would be taken in this year's accounts. The loss for the six months to October 31 was Pounds 333,000 against a profit of Pounds 121,000. The group's fortunes slipped during the second half of 1992-93 and the year ended with a deficit of Pounds 20,000. There was an operating loss in UK manufacturing of Pounds 432,000, including redundancy costs of Pounds 116,000. The South African activities, which were sold earlier this month, recorded a loss of Pounds 103,000. In UK manufacturing there has been a drive against costs, including the merger of three businesses into one and a reduction in staffing. The group payroll, 1,120 two years ago, is now 915 and will be down to about 850 by the end of the rationalisation programme next May. The international distribution business, however, is performing strongly and UK distribution is seeing recovery in demand. After a tax charge of Pounds 50,000 (Pounds 145,000) losses per share were 1.19p (0.07p). For the full year there were losses of 0.5p, when total dividend payments came to 1p. Turnover was slightly higher at Pounds 30.4m (Pounds 29m). However operating profits slumped to Pounds 96,000 (Pounds 685,000), which was not enough to cover interest payments of Pounds 429,000 (Pounds 424,000), reflecting gearing of 62 per cent.</p>

The commenters note that section 488A(a)(6) of the HEA provides an option by stating that a guaranty agency ``*&blank;*&blank;* may sue the employer.'' Other commenters recommended that the regulations permit a guaranty agency to decline to sue an employer who fails to comply with the wage garnishment order if the agency can demonstrate that the expected cost and probability of success of the litigation did not justify a lawsuit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The statutory language provides the authority for a guaranty agency to sue the employer. A guaranty agency is not required to garnish the wages of borrowers who owe defaulted loans, but if an agency chooses to do so, it must follow the garnishment procedures prescribed in these regulations. In order to protect the interests of borrowers and taxpayers, the Secretary believes a guaranty agency should make use of the full extent of the statutory authority available to it under the HEA to compel an employer to comply with a wage garnishment order. The Secretary cannot envision any realistic probability that an agency would be unsuccessful in its suit against an employer that was in clear violation of the garnishment order. Given the expectation of such success, the Secretary believes the agency's litigation efforts and costs would be minimal. Accordingly, this would be part of the agency's normal performance of its role of ensuring the maximum collection of defaulted loans, and the Secretary may refuse to make reinsurance payments, or may recover reinsurance payments already made to an agency that fails to sue an employer that was in clear violation of the garnishment order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 71.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Some commenters did not believe that a self-employed borrower should be considered an ``employer'' for wage garnishment purposes. The commenters believed that garnishment should be considered a proceeding to seize the wages of a debtor paid by another party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The Secretary agrees with the commenters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The reference to a self-employed borrower in &sect;682.410(b)(10)(i)(F) has been deleted from the final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.410(b)(10)(i)(G)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 72.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Some commenters were opposed to the qualified prohibition in the regulations that prevents a guaranty agency from garnishing the wages of a borrower whom it knows has been involuntarily separated from employment until the borrower has been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. The commenters believed that the proposed regulations appear to condone garnishment as long as the guarantor is not aware that the borrower has been involuntarily separated from employment and has not been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. They believed that the HEA does not permit garnishment under any circumstances until a borrower who has been involuntarily separated from employment has been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The borrower will be informed of his or her rights with respect to wage garnishment in the notice sent to the borrower at least 30 days before the initiation of garnishment proceedings. That notice will include information about the exception provided for a borrower who has been involuntarily separated from employment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  All garnishments initiated by guaranty agencies on or after March 1, 1994 must comply with the standardized administrative wage garnishment procedures approved by the Secretary on February 1, 1994. As part of those standardized procedures, a guaranty agency must send a notice to the borrower prior to initiating garnishment. The standardized notice fully explains the exception for involuntarily separated borrowers and includes a simple form for the borrower to fill out to request this exception. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a borrower who meets the conditions necessary for this exception wishes to take advantage of it, the borrower will be able to do so quite easily, either before the garnishment proceedings are initiated, or during the hearing available to the borrower. If the borrower chooses not to divulge information concerning an involuntary separation, and there is no reasonable expectation that the guaranty agency should have known about the borrower's undisclosed involuntary separation, the Secretary believes that a resulting garnishment of the borrower's wages should not be invalidated if the borrower later contests the garnishment on those grounds or if the agency later learns that the borrower would have been eligible for the exception. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.410(b)(10)(i)(I)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 73.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Some commenters believed the withholding notice sent to a borrower's employer should inform the employer that the HEA prohibits wage garnishment if the borrower has not been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : All information relating to the borrower's rights will be disclosed to the borrower.

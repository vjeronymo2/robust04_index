			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: MOVIE COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> JUST HOW FAR CAN (OR SHOULD) MOVIES GO?;  </P> <P> DEATH AND DESTRUCTION SEEM TO DRIP FROM THE SCREEN AS NEVER BEFORE  </P> <P> Time magazine's recent cover story is devoted to the way 464 Americans were  killed by guns in a single week, and some of the biggest box-office movies of  the summer are bloodier than ever. The topics don't seem unrelated.  </P> <P> Films, still the most potent message-carriers around, seem to be fostering a  greenhouse effect of violence. They're murderous, they present new, bigger,  more insidious methods of killing people, they do well at the box office and  they come back having to top themselves.  </P> <P> Two of the summer sequels -- "Licence to Kill," a "new" James Bond (the first  not to have come from one of the books and the furthest in spirit from them),  and "Lethal Weapon 2" -- appear hellbent on setting some new high-water mark in  violent death and noisy destruction. "Batman," which gets to create its own  precedents, adds a nasty twist to its brutality. And so the ante is upped  everywhere along the line.  </P> <P> The point about "Batman's" Joker is destruction and mutilation for the sheer  joy of it. He lets the floodgates loose on savagery, Jack Nicholson's spurting  energy pushing the amps higher and higher. The murderees are legion --  co-horts, girl friends, Gotham Cityites at random. When he goes on that  slashing, paint-slashing rampage in a pretentiously named art museum, we're  supposed to get the joke; smile indulgently because these are such frankly  bogus copies of Old Masters, their very fakeness picked up by the museum's  lighting.  </P> <P> But there are audiences who won't get the gag; all they'll pick up on is the  glee with which Nicholson and his henchmen prance through that high-toned  place, turning it into a heap of torn canvas and spray-painted walls. Why  aren't the people who have been wringing their hands and worrying about the  potential effects of "Do the Right Thing" concerned about a scene as  seductively conducive to imitation as this one?  </P> <P> The Bond film, which this time is a revenge vendetta on Bond's part for the  mutilation (there's that subject again) of his close friend, dangles men over  shark pits, indeed has them half-eaten and survive, and blows up others in  decompression tanks, spattering the porthole windows with their blood. I  suppose it's the usual crunch and desperation of every Bond film, but the tone  is more extreme, more sadistic, the blood-letting more torrential.  </P> <P> If these films weren't speaking to their audiences as viscerally as they are,  they'd be laughable. "Lethal Weapon 2" is a joke of a story, a charade on the  subject of apartheid held together by the enormous warmth and likability of Mel  Gibson and Danny Glover, separately and especially together. But when the  excesses of the action make audiences cheer instead of hoot, it's a thermometer  reading, and that thermometer is going up as we sit here.  </P> <P> Were the Lethal Weaponeers dealing in crimes that involved millions of dollars  in the first film? You can feel film-making minds whirring frantically: OK, OK,  this time we'll make it billions. Did people drop from buildings in the  original? So this time, we'll drop whole buildings on them. Or entire cargo  containers.  </P> <P> If one of our heroes was strafed by machine-gun fire and left for dead before,  now the villains blow up very nearly the entire Los Angeles police force's  detective squad, at their homes, at their poker games, whoosh!  </P> <P> Most disturbing of all is "Lethal Weapon 2's" simplistic lesson in political  science: White South Africans are the new Nazis. All of them. Yes, we are told  that the eminently hissible Joss Ackland is not the South African ambassador  but their "Minister of Diplomatic Affairs." But to unsophisticated audiences,  you can bet that he and his staff of blond, snarling henchmen personify white  South Africa.  </P> <P> And they are all sadists, with thick Boer accents, who sneer at "Kaffir-lovers"  the way Helmut Dantine or Kurt Kruger used to sneer when Hollywood had real  Nazis to characterize. To be sure, we have one "good" South African,  </P> <P> a very sweet, white-blond, completely dim young woman who works at this  non-embassy but doesn't exactly agree with her country's policies. Useless to  ask why she then works for them. Agreed that it's getting harder and harder to  find an all-purpose villain for movies these days, one whose constituencies  won't be marching outside your theaters come opening day. It would seem that  the atrocious and heart-rending practices of apartheid would make that  government fair game. Unfortunately, life is not quite that simple. The people  who have been ignored in "Lethal Weapon 2's" rush to fill us in politically are  that core of white South Africans who have doggedly and at no slight personal  risk been working for the rights of South Africans of color for years. (Books  and newspapers aside, did no one see "A World Apart?") To ignore their very  existence is insulting, at the least.  </P> <P> In order to solidify our loathing of these bloody Boers, to make it personal as  well as political, the film makers have gone back to the first movie and  explained that the death of Mel Gibson's beloved but fortunately unseen wife  was also a deliberate act by these very same mega-villains, drug traffickers as  well as sadists.  </P> <P> All this is to pave the way for the movie's unceasing vigilantism, to give  Gibson free rein to invade the South Africans' official offices, rough up their  goons, even shatter their tropical fish tank with rifle fire. (Fish have  politics too?) And finally, to shoot their "Minister of Diplomatic Affairs"  even as he holds up his card of diplomatic immunity. Why is that different from  an American Embassy member showing his papers of immunity in, say, Tehran, and  expecting the protection they provide?  </P> <P> The point is that, trivial as it may seem to complain about a film like "Lethal  Weapon 2," what is at issue are the principles of civilized behavior. By  violating them -- no matter the provocation -- you weaken what separates us  from governments we rightly deplore.  </P> <P> For its part, in addition to frightening youngsters dramatically, a film like  "Batman" teaches them that there is a kick that goes with destruction not  unlike the rush of sniffing glue or a first hit of crack.  </P> <P> What's most offensive about these formidably effective movies, however, is the  way they trivialize life itself. If in a decade or so, we find ourselves in a  society so de-based it is intolerable, we might look back to this summer as one  of the signposts along the way.  </P></p>

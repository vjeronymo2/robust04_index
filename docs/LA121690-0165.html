			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIOTING ENDS IN ALBANIA WITH MILITARY TAKING CONTROL  </P> <P> Security forces Saturday maintained control of towns hit by anti-government  rioting, and Albania's first independent political party sought permission from  the Marxist regime to try to avert new unrest, party leaders said.  </P> <P> There were no reports of fresh violence in the small Balkan nation.  </P> <P> States of emergency remained in effect in at least five towns, and movement  into and out of the towns was prohibited by the military and police, police  sources said.  </P> <P> "According to our activists in those areas, the situation is calm," said Gramoz  Pashko, an economics professor at Tirana's Enver Hoxha University and a key  organizer of the new Democratic Party, which has condemned the unrest.  </P> <P> He said party leaders Friday night requested a dialogue with the regime of  President Ramiz Alia "on how to solve the situation."  </P> <P> Among other proposals, the party wants to send members to trouble spots to  persuade residents to support a peaceful transition to democracy after 45 years  of Stalinist-style police rule, Pashko said.  </P> <P> Party leaders said they believe the rioting was the result of pent-up  frustration and disenchantment with Albania's severe economic problems and  decades of harsh Marxist rule.  </P> <P> Alia agreed Monday -- after three days of student protests -- to permit  independent parties in a gradual loosening of the Communist bonds.  </P> <P> Observers said protesters may have seen the government's decision to allow  individual parties as a signal it would tolerate opposition. The formation  Tuesday of the Democratic Party, which has yet to be legally recognized by the  regime, apparently provided the spark for the disturbances.  </P></p>

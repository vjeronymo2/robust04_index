The ministry will invite representatives of the Cabinet and  officials of the Foreign Ministry and the Defense Ministry to  join the group, which has not got a list of concrete members yet.    The group's foundation may be confirmed in the next Cabinet  meeting, spokespeople said.    As reported, the Baltic presidents endorsed NATO's  initiative  in their Jan. 11 statement. The program offers the East European  countries and the Baltic states a chance to cooperate with the  alliance with a view to eventual membership.</p>

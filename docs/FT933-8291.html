			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Big energy users scorn price-reduction scheme BIG INDUSTRIAL energy users yesterday scorned an initiative by the electricity 'pool' to reduce the cost of power. The Energy Intensive Users Group, which represents companies such as British Steel and Imperial Chemical Industries, said it was bitterly disappointed by the measures. Mr Ian Blakey, the group's chairman, said: 'The benefit which the proposed scheme would bring to the membership was estimated to be a fraction of 1 per cent, and would barely cover the administration costs of participation.' The pool, where electricity is traded on a wholesale basis, approved a scheme which it said would reduce prices by an average of 1.5 per cent and up to 3 per cent. This would enable 'demand-side bidding', where customers could agree not to take electricity if it went above a certain price. Mr Blakey said an alternative scheme that would have brought larger savings had been rejected by the pool members, who consist of the leading power generation and distribution companies. The group intends to appeal against the pool's decision to Offer, the electricity regulator.</p>

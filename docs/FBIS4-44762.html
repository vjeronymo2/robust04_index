The business-customer  section will grow by 12 percent to around 29 billion DM, and  private sales will increase 10 percent to 32 billion, said  members of the board Horst Gellert and Dieter Gallist at the  CeBIT in Hannover    In the future, not only voice, but also images, data, and  video will be transmitted over data lines. "The multimedia  area, in which 300 million DM is now invested in Germany, will  be worth 7 billion DM by the year 2000. Sales will also  increase 24-fold," said Gellert. Telecom wishes to have a  healthy share of this growth.    Among business customers, Gellert is placing special  emphasis  on ISDN in addition to the traditionally largest business area  of telephone services. Telecom can become the world leader in  introducting this future technology with more than 1.2 million  B-channels sold.    ISDN sales rose more than 130 percent to 2.5 billion DM in  1993. An increase to 3.7 billion DM is anticipated for 1994.  In the future, ISDN should become available as a  high-performance data net for communication among personal  computers. To date, few personal computers have been holed up  to the telephone net in Germany.    More and more, telephone connection will become a universal  telecommunication medium, said Gallist. In the future,  stationary and mobile telecommunications will grow together.  "Every customer can be reached through one telephone number even  during this decade, whether he is telephoning from a mobile or  stationary set," says the telephone executive. The most  important customer among private sales is a telephone service  with approximately 30 million customers and with planned sales  of 25.4 billion DM this year.    Telecom also expects good business through interactive  television. The feedback channel of custoiners for program  requests will be telephone connection. The Pay-TV-Market also  offers enormous potential. The number of subscribers will  increase from 760,000 to 3.4 million by the year 2000.</p>

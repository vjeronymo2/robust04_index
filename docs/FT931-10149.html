			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Sapin wants closer German ties: Bonn expresses caution over fast-track union between franc and D-Mark MR Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, pledged his commitment yesterday to closer monetary co-operation with Germany. But finance ministry officials rejected speculation that Bonn and Paris might permanently fix a rate between their currencies. Senior officials at the French finance ministry confirmed that the two countries did envisage closer co-operation on questions such as intervention in the foreign exchange markets, but without specific measures to formalise their ties. At the same time, senior officials in Bonn cautioned strongly against expectations of a 'fast track' monetary union between the D-Mark and the French franc, or between the five inner core currencies of the European Monetary System, before the strict economic convergence criteria of the Maastricht treaty had been fulfilled. They said the Bundesbank and Chancellor Helmut Kohl had repeatedly stressed the need to fulfil the convergence requirements, including lower inflation, sharply reduced budget deficits, and strict control over state debts. Germany faces difficulty fulfilling the first two criteria before 1996. The comments come at a time of persistent speculation, particularly in Paris and Brussels, about the possibility of France and Germany stepping up monetary co-operation if the continued instability of the foreign exchange markets threatens the long-term future of the EMS. The French finance ministry dismissed as 'absolutely without foundation' reports that the two countries might agree a fixed exchange rate between their currencies. Mr Sapin also stressed that the French and German governments did not intend to take monetary measures which would exclude other European currencies. 'The European currency will not be simply a Franco-German one,' he said. 'I would say 'yes' to the idea of Franco-German co-operation being the hard core of the European monetary system, but I would say 'no' to the idea of other countries being excluded.' In Bonn, Mr Rene Monory, president of the French Senate and a leading member of the opposition UDF, called for a fast track to a single European currency to end recent speculative attacks against individual currencies in the EMS. However, the debate is being treated with great caution in the main German government ministries and with virtual disdain in the Bundesbank in Frankfurt. 'The pressure is coming from France, from the French opposition, but they have not given us any idea of the mechanics,' according to one well-placed official. 'The Bundesbank is very reticent about the whole idea. It would seriously limit its room for manoeuvre,' he added. Another senior official said the proposals for a fast track monetary union were 'a crisis scenario, not a government scenario. The French have to say how they would do it.' A German finance ministry official said: 'One can fantasise about things like a fast-track solution, but we have not been asked to.'</p>

In late January, U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher held talks with the French president, prime  minister, and foreign minister in Paris. The two sides,  however, stuck to their own views and the talks failed in  discord. The results of the talks between British Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd and the U.S. secretary of state in  Washington on 3 February again proved that Britain was unable to  change the set U.S. policy on the Bosnian issue. The  differences between the United States and Britain and France  over the Bosnian conflict are difficult to resolve.    So what are the differences between the Western countries  over the Bosnian conflict?    Regarding the question of whether resolving the Bosnian  crisis by force or through talks, it is not only that the  European countries differ from the United States, but that  European countries differ among themselves. France and Britain  argued that the way to resolve the Bosnian conflict is by  greatly enhancing the strength of the peacekeeping troops and  forcing all parties to the Bosnian conflict to come to an  agreement. Therefore, at the NATO summit earlier in January,  France repeatedly urged the United States to send troops, but  the United States has rejected this appeal all along with solemn  statements. On this issue, owing to historical and political  reasons, Germany does not agree to resolving the crisis by  force. Not long ago, German Chancellor Kohl expressed clear  doubts about the feasibility of publicly intervening in the  Bosnian conflict by force.    On the question of whether or not to lift the embargo on  arms  supplies to the Bosnian Muslims, Washington repeatedly has  favored lifting the embargo and has maintained that placing an  arms embargo on the Muslims alone means encouraging the  aggressors. Paris, however, has maintained that this will only  compel the United Nations to withdraw its peacekeeping troops  and allow the Bosnian conflict to spread. On 25 January, French  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said: "The United States will have  to assume responsibility for the `catastrophe.'" The U.S. State  Department immediately retorted, alleging that France's position  on the Bosnian issue was "puzzling." Washington held that the  Bosnian Muslims are victims in the conflict and that pressure  should be exerted on Serbia first.    Europe and the United States have long had contradictions  over the Yugoslav and Bosnian issues. At the very beginning,  without consulting its allies, Germany was the first to  acknowledge the independence of Slovenia and Croatia, and this  compelled other EC countries to acknowledge the two countries.  The United States has criticized this many times, maintaining  that it is because of the recklessness of the Germans that the  Yugoslav situation has gotten as bad as it is today. Moreover,  the Americans hold that the Bosnian crisis should first be  resolved by Europeans themselves, and ask why the Americans  should be implicated now that trouble has broken out in the  backyard of Europe? While the Americans favor launching air  strikes at the Serbs, Britain and France are resolutely opposed,  fearing their peacekeeping troops in Bosnia would be used as  "hostages" and as bargaining chips.    Why are these contradictions and differences between the  Western countries difficult to resolve?    Let us first analyze the U.S. position. We should say that  on the Bosnian issue, the United States has taken a  comparatively aloof position. At first, it warned other Western  countries that they should act prudently. Last year, after  becoming President, Clinton urged that the arms embargo on the  Bosnian Muslims be lifted, and put forward the idea of launching  air strikes at the Serbs, but Britain and France did not accept  this. Since then, the United States has taken a "spectator's"  stance on the Bosnian conflict and has not taken any specific  action. At a time when Britain and France are strongly urging  the United States to send troops, the United States has stated  that it will never send troops to Bosnia because it maintains  that the Bosnian conflict, which involves many complicated  problems, cannot be resolved by force or else it will probably  be aggravated. However, there is an underlying reason why the  United States is opposed to sending troops: First, the United  States sent peacekeeping troops to Somalia last year, got deeply  bogged down, and had 18 U.S. soldiers killed there, leading to  denouncements at home. Second, the Bosnian conflict directly  concerns the security interests of Britain, France, and other  European countries, and does not very much concern the other  side of the Atlantic, so the United States does not want to get  involved in a regional conflict that does not have much bearing  on its own interests, nor does it want to take any unnecessary  risks. That is why France obliquely criticized this U.S.  position, saying that Washington has always taken an  "indifferent [ge an guan huo 7133 1489 6034 3499]" stance.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Technology: Acquiring a taste for innovation / Describing how retail banking in eastern Europe is adjusting to computerisation Until last year the Slaski Bank in Katowice, in south west Poland, was much like any other in eastern Europe: customers queued for so long that they took sandwiches to eat while they watched the drawn out and bureaucratic transactions. These could take so long that people looked on a visit to the bank as a social event. Behind the scenes, things were even worse. Management information that would be considered vital to banks in the west would either be provided late or not at all. Fraud was also a problem. In 1990 the Polish government created nine new regional retail banks and told them to prepare for competition and privatisation. Marian Rajczyk, president of the Katowice-based Bank Slaski, the largest of the nine, took a quick decision based on his knowledge of western banks: to use technology to improve customer service, management information and establish competitive advantage. He invited western computer companies to provide software, hardware and to undertake the project management for the computerisation of the bank's 42 branches. He wanted automated teller machines (ATMs), account management, transaction handling, administrative support, and even signature verification. And he stipulated that it had to be done quickly. As Poland's largest retail bank, and a pioneer in technology, the Slaski project attracted competitive bids. IBM, anxious to establish market share in Eastern Europe, won a fixed-price contract to manage the project, beating off competition from ICL, Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard. The conditions for beginning a project of this kind could not have been worse, says the banking project manager for IBM Eastern Europe, Maciej Borysoglebski. Slaski's managers had seen western banks in operation and they had high expectations of what could be achieved, but little understanding of either computers or western banking procedures. And unlike western banks, they did not have the computer skills, the stable legislative environment or the infrastructure. The Slaski managers were also unprepared for such a large computer project. Although they were highly motivated, they were not used to 'task ownership', says Borysoglebski. 'They were given tasks and dates for completion and found it very frightening.' From the outset, Poland's poor telecommunications system was a problem. Banks in western countries are able to connect their ATMs to central computers using leased telephone lines, but this is not yet feasible on a large scale in Poland. In consequence, each branch operates as a self-contained unit, with the ATMs only able to access data held on the local IBM AS/400 minicomputers in each branch. Only when the telecommunications infrastructure is in place will the machines be linked on a network. The lack of telecommunications support created another problem for Slaski: how to verify that account holders were who they said they were. This led to Slaski's biggest innovation. Using a software package called Infosign from Inform, a German software house, a customer's signature can be called up electronically on the personal computer workstations for immediate comparison. IBM chose to use a banking software package from the German software company Actis in order to avoid costly application development. But this created problems of its own: the Polish banking laws changed by the month, creating a need for repeated changes. The dilemma of how much software to re-write, and when, is continuous. Another problem was that Slaski's offices were not designed for computers. Most branches needed refurbishing, but the quality of the local workmanship could not always be relied upon. Two days before the opening of one branch, the ceiling collapsed. In another branch the walls gave in. Despite these problems, the project has been completed on schedule. Today, staff at the Katowice Bank pose for photographs behind new computer terminals while behind them customers withdraw money in the banking hall. Slaski's banking applications are now being eyed by other banks in Poland and eastern Europe. Buoyed up by its technological leadership, Slaski is planning to expand its operations into other parts of Poland.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Philip Morris in Norwegian move FREIA MARABOU, Scandinavia's leading chocolate, sugar confectionery and snacks group, yesterday accepted a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 870m) takeover from Kraft General Foods International (KGF), part of the Philip Morris group of the US. Hershey Foods of the US, which has an 18.6 per cent shareholding in Freia Marabou, has had several offers rejected by the Norwegian company. The offer is believed to be one of the biggest ever made for a Norwegian company by an international group. It will be made through Jacobs Suchard which is owned by KGF. The deal is conditional on approval by the Norwegian authorities. Freia Marabou had sales last year of Dollars 900m and an operating profit of Dollars 90m. Norsk Hydro, Freia Marabou's biggest shareholder, plans to take up the offer. Together with its pension fund, Norsk Hydro owns 44.1 per cent of Freia Marabou. Jacobs Suchard is putting up NKr450 a share for each of Freia Marabou's A and B shares. Trading in the company's shares was suspended yesterday on the Oslo and Stockholm bourses. Hershey Foods purchased its stake in Freia Marabou at the end of April for NKr1.16bn (Pounds 105m). Yesterday Hershey said it had made an informal offer of more than NKr400 a share for Norsk Hydro's Freia stake. The deal when accepted will yield Norsk Hydro a profit before tax of around NKr2.4bn and Norsk Hydro's pension fund will receive NKr500m. Ms Natalie Bailey, a Hershey spokeswoman, said reports that the company was unwilling to sell its stake in Freia Marabou were premature. 'As I understand it, once the Kraft offer is finalised and extended to all shareholders, we could tender our shares or remain a shareholder.' The deal is relatively small for Philip Morris, whose second quarter revenues stood at Dollars 15.2bn, with the food division contributing Dollars 7.33bn. Mr John Maxwell, managing director at Wheat First Securities, the US stockbroker, said: 'As far as Kraft is concerned . . . this type of acquisition has been their strategy for some years now.' On Wall Street, shares in Hershey hit a 52-week high of Dollars 45 1/2, up Dollars 1 1/8, on news of the Philip Morris bid.</p>

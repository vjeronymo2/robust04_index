			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia intends to undertake an initiative to begin a  new process to promote a Cyprus solution. Foreign Minister  Alekos Mikhailidhis will visit Moscow in early June for further  talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. The  possibility of Russia's undertaking an initiative follows  statements made after a meeting today between Mikhailidhis and  Russian Foreign Ministry envoys Feliks Bogdanov and Pyotr  Dobroserdov.    Bogdanov said that Russia is not indifferent to developments  in the Cyprus issue and added that, on the basis of the briefing  they received during their visit to Cyprus, Russia will  formulate its position to contribute to the beginning of a  process to promote a just solution of the problem. He also  noted that when the Cypriot and Russian foreign ministers meet  in Moscow they will discuss the whole situation in detail.  Mikhailidhis will visit the Russian capital on 5 June.  Bogdanov further said that the basis for a solution to the  problem exists. He said: There are the relevant UN  resolutions, the UN secretary general's set of ideas, and the  confidence-building measures.    Asked about the possibility of convening an international  conference, the Russian official said that this proposal exists  as an idea but that the topics should be considered collectively  together with other ideas and proposals.    At their meeting with Mikhailidhis, the two Russian  officials  conveyed an invitation from Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev to visit Moscow.    Mikhailidhis described the talks with the Russian officials  as very useful and noted that the Cyprus issue and its  developments will prevail at the Moscow talks. At the same time  bilateral relations and other international issues will also be  discussed. Referring to Russia's increasing interest in  strengthening its relations with Cyprus as well as that  country's constructive and positive role, Mikhailidhis said that  he expects there will be some specific agreements during his  visit to the Russian capital.    The Russian officials also had a meeting with acting  President Alexis Galanos. Afterward Galanos described the visit  as very significant and added that it demonstrates the Russian  Government's interest in Cyprus. He said: Russia's interest  and possible thoughts of an international conference give a  broader dimension to the Cyprus problem and stress its  international aspect, namely, that basically it is an issue of  invasion and occupation.</p>

			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KELLY LOSES GRIP, BILLS JUST LOSE;  </P> <P> PATRIOTS: NEW ENGLAND SCORES 20 POINTS IN LAST EIGHT MINUTES OF 33-24 VICTORY.  </P> <P> The New England Patriots have had plenty of practice coming from behind. For  once, they got it right.  </P> <P> Rookie cornerback Maurice Hurst put the Patriots ahead to stay on a 16-yard  interception return with 2:49 left as New England scored 20 points in the last  eight minutes Sunday to beat the Buffalo Bills, 33-24.  </P> <P> "It's probably our largest play of the year," Hurst said. "I thought first  about catching it and then when I saw the end zone I just couldn't believe it."  </P> <P> The Patriots turned two mistakes by Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly into the  decisive points.  </P> <P> Hurst's touchdown on a pass by Kelly gave the Patriots (4-7) a 30-24 lead and  Jason Staurovsky added a clinching 38-yard field goal after New England  recovered a fumble by Kelly at the Patriot 31.  </P> <P> Buffalo (7-4) fell into a tie for the AFC East lead with Miami.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, the Patriots overcame a 24-12 fourth-quarter deficit to take a  26-24 lead over the New York Jets, only to lose, 27-26, on Pat Leahy's  final-play field goal. A week ago, they nearly erased a 28-10 deficit with two  touchdowns in the last four minutes but lost to New Orleans, 28-24.  </P> <P> "We know any time we play them we're in a fight," Kelly said. "We know they can  come back. We know what kind of a quarterback Steve Grogan is."  </P> <P> Kelly completed 21 of 41 passes for 356 yards, one touchdown and two  interceptions.  </P> <P> After Buffalo took a 24-13 lead on Larry Kinnebrew's one-yard touchdown run and  Thurman Thomas' 25-yard scoring pass from Kelly, Grogan began the comeback with  a 14-yard touchdown pass to Hart Lee Dykes with 7:45 left.  </P> <P> Staurovsky's 34-yard field goal made it 24-23 with 3:06 left.  </P> <P> New England snapped a two-game losing streak with a season-best 192-yard ground  attack, led by John Stephens' 126 yards in 23 carries.  </P> <P> The Patriots erased a 10-6 halftime deficit on a 15-yard scoring run by rookie  Patrick Egu on his first NFL carry.  </P> <P> Buffalo took a 7-0 lead on its first series of the game on Thomas' three-yard  run. Staurovsky kicked field goals of 34 and 24 yards, cutting the lead to 7-6  with 7:04 left in the first half.  </P> <P> The Bills' Scott Norwood kicked a 31-yard field goal with 35 seconds left in  the first half.  </P></p>

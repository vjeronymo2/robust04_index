			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / US insurer to take space at Lloyd's CIGNA, one of the largest US insurance companies, is to transfer part of its London operations to the headquarters of Lloyd's. The move underlines growing links between Lloyd's syndicates and insurance companies - Cigna is the sixth company to rent space at the market's headquarters in recent weeks. Cigna's arrival was welcomed by Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, as 'an encouraging sign after our recent difficulties'. Mr Nick Phillips, general manager of property at Lloyd's, hopes Cigna's decision might trigger the entry of between 25 and 30 other companies that are discussing possible moves. Lloyd's agreed last year to seek corporate capital to participate in syndicates alongside some 20,000 Names - the individuals who provide its capital. A number of Lloyd's agencies are examining ways of persuading institutional investors to back the market's business. Cigna is understood to have agreed to occupy 400 sq ft at Lloyd's, at a cost of about Pounds 50,000 per year. It will specialise in insuring casualty and liability business at Lloyd's. Mr Alan May, senior vice-president of Cigna, said the Lloyd's building was popular with brokers and the company hoped to win more business as a result of moving there. In a separate development Syndicate Underwriting Management, an insurance agency owned by the Corporation of Lloyd's, announced yesterday that it has been appointed to manage the 'run-off' - liquidation - of six syndicates that have gone out of business over the last 18 months. Four of the six syndicates involved - 367, 411, 1097 and 1152 - were formerly administered by the Secretan agency, which ceased trading at the end of 1991. The other two - 785 and 786 - were formerly managed by Michael Moss Underwriting Agency. All the syndicates were overwhelmed by claims from US asbestosis and pollution awards. Syndicate Underwriting Management was set up in 1987 by the corporation, which administers and regulates the Lloyd's market, to manage 74 syndicates formerly managed by the PCW, WMD and Richard Beckett agencies. Turnover is expected to be at least Pounds 15m this year, compared with Pounds 5.5m in 1992.</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> New York artist Anna Bialobroda makes painting into theater. In her dark and  brooding glimpses from the aisle, the cast is playing to an empty house.  </P> <P> Each of Bialobroda's paintings catch both a portion of endless rows of vacant  seats and a piece of the illuminated stage or screen. In the most powerful  images the movie screen forms a flat white ground where huge black and white  faces stare out silently into the glowing, empty depths of the movie house. The  canvases are long narrow verticals that compress the pieces of screen and  seating into a tight edge of stacked fragments that frustrate depth and scale.  The work also gives the sensation of peering though a crack in a door, adding a  clandestine feeling to the theater's emptiness.  </P> <P> Less challenging are paintings where appropriated images by Van Gogh and  Rembrandt are collaged onto large movie screens and lightly blended in with  colored paint. Without the shifts in scale or Bialobroda's weird fragmentation  the self portraits amid empty seats go static.  </P> <P> That can't be said about "Spectacle" or "Bluff," two deftly painted  investigations into the psychological vulnerability of the artist/performer. As  Bialobroda shifts the viewer from balcony to orchestra, she firmly grasps a  performer's sense of being at risk from a predatory audience. But surprisingly  she makes that realization seem rooted in the viewer's psyche, not the  artist's. (Saxon-Lee Gallery, 7525 Beverly Blvd., to July 29.)SUVAN GEER  </P></p>

He had just  been elected the ANC candidate for premiership of the new  Western Cape Provincial Government at a special conference held  at the University of the Western Cape. The post of premier will  replace the current provincial administratorship after the April  27 elections.    Dr Boesak beat his only opponent, legal and constitutional  expert Dullah Omar, by 136 votes to 120.    Branch representatives of the ANC, the Congress of SA [South  African] Trade Unions and the SA Communist Party cast their  votes after a number of other candidates withdrew from the race.  Dr Boesak said that in the coming election the Western Cape  would be the test for the ANC's non-racial character. "If we  loose this election the dream for a non-racial democracy, for  the rest of our country as well, will die here. It is our  responsibility to set the tone for the non-racial democracy  which this country must become."    He said the reconstruction and development the ANC had  spoken  of would also be put into practice in this region. "That talk  has not just been for elections," he said.</p>

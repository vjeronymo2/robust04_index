Speaking at a joint news conference in Tbilisi, the capital  of Georgia, together with visiting Russian President Boris  Yeltsin, Shevardnadze said, "a favorable influence of Russia"  will enable Georgians "to resolve these problems very soon."    He described Georgia's conflicts with Abkhazia and South  Ossetia as "most acute and most complicated," noting the  Caucasian nation is interested "in the settlement more than  anyone else because the country is now on the verge of hunger  and poverty."    At the news conference, Yeltsin said, "Russia is proceeding  from the need to respect Georgia's territorial integrity while  fully honoring the interests of Abkhazia and South Ossetia."    "Russia is for the full-scale settlement of the  Georgian-Abkhazian and Georgian-Ossetian conflicts by peaceful  political means, as well as for the mutually acceptable solution  of the problems relating to their state and political systems,"  the Russian president added.    Abkhazia, an autonomous republic of Georgia, declared its  independence in July 1992, while South Ossetia, an autonomous  region of the former Soviet republic, did that in November 1991.    As concerns the Russian troops deployed in Georgia,  Shevardnadze told reporters that the two sides signed a protocol  on Thursday morning to set up a working group to study  thoroughly all aspects of the stationing of Russian troops in  the former Soviet republic.    According to Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev who is  accompanying Yeltsin during the Georgian trip, both sides have  reached agreement to create three military bases for Russian  servicemen in Georgia.    The news conference followed a signing ceremony, in which  leaders of the two nations signed 25 documents including the  treaty of friendship, good-neighborly relations and cooperation.    Praising the treaty, Yeltsin said it laid down a "firm  framework" for relations between Russia and Georgia.    Shevardnadze stressed that the treaty will "facilitate the  strengthening of cooperation not only between our countries but  among all members of the commonwealth of the independent states  as a whole."    Yeltsin, who held a face-to-face summit talks with  Shevardnadze right after his arrival and a welcoming ceremony,  is scheduled to return to Moscow late Thursday evening.    Their talks and their ministers' negotiations held at the  same time resulted in the package of accords on bilateral  cooperation in the political, economic and military spheres.</p>

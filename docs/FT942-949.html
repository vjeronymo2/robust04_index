			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / People (Names in the news): The gospel according to Philip Morris The Marlboro Men have taken over at the top of Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco giant, following last week's resignation of Michael Miles, the erstwhile chairman and chief executive, writes Richard Tomkins. The non-smoking Miles, who came from the food side of the business, seems to have done himself few favours with his low-profile approach to the job and even fewer with his support for a plan to hive off the tobacco operations into a separate company - which plan was subsequently rejected by the board. Now he has gone, his job has passed to a pair of smokers: Geoffrey Bible, the new chief executive, who gets through a good few Marlboro a day, and William Murray, a more occasional puffer, who takes over as chairman. Coincidentally, both men are Australian, and both - in contrast to Miles - have a background in the tobacco side of the business, having started their careers with Philip Morris Europe. They have known each other for 20 years and seem to get on well. Both, too, seem determined to take a much more aggressive stance in promoting Philip Morris's interests. One of the first things they did on taking over was to tell the press about their plans. They also command considerable loyalty from the troops; their first appearance before employees at the New York headquarters last week was reportedly greeted with a standing ovation. In their new capacity as job-sharers, Murray, 58, will focus on strategy and ways of increasing shareholder value, while Bible, 56, gets on with running the business. Widely regarded as one of the tobacco industry's most able executives, Bible has a reputation for toughness - something he is going to need amid the wave of anti-smoking sentiment in the US.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Charter Movement defeats three voting motions Campaigners for greater democracy in the Tory party yesterday said they had given the leadership 'a bloody nose' in the annual battle over voting rights at the central council. The Charter Movement, a Tory splinter group that seeks greater party accountability, defeated three motions by the national union executive that would have deprived rank-and-file members of some voting rights. The first sought to change the rules over the election of members to the Conservatives' main executive body, the board of management. At present, the national union executive - which brings together a cross-section of party organisations - nominates three officials to the board of management. These nominations must be ratified by the central council, the only body on which junior members of constituency party organisations are represented. The motion, which would in effect have deprived the council of its right to vet the nominations, was passed by 273 votes to 178, but failed to achieve the two-thirds majority required for inclusion in the rules. Two other motions, including one which some delegates said would have created 'oppressive burdens' on the right to convene an emergency meeting of the central council, were defeated. The charter group succeeded two years ago in passing a motion to convene an emergency meeting of the central council to discuss party democracy. Sir Basil Feldman, the chairman of the national union, has since claimed that some of the votes in favour of calling the meeting were invalid, and it has not been convened. Ms Sharon Spiers, a leading activist in the Charter Movement, said yesterday: 'Every time delegates come to the central council, they leave more and more angry.' She said 43 per cent of the rank and file favoured more democracy for the party's affairs, and in future years the movement would be able to make far-reaching changes.</p>

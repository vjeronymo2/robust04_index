			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CITY ATTY. HAHN ENDORSES FEINSTEIN FOR GOVERNOR  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn endorsed Dianne Feinstein in her bid for  the Democratic nomination for governor Thursday and announced he will chair her  campaign in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> "Dianne Feinstein proved she was an effective, capable leader while serving as  mayor of San Francisco for nearly a decade," Hahn told a news conference. "I am  proud to enthusiastically endorse (her) for governor and to actively  participate in her election efforts."  </P> <P> Feinstein said she looked forward to working with Hahn "during my campaign for  governor and beyond."  </P> <P> Said Feinstein: "As chief attorney of California's largest city, Hahn has been  on the front line of our state's most threatening problems -- gangs, drugs,  violent crime. I commend his effort to combat domestic violence and his ability  to allocate resources to those who need them the most."  </P> <P> County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, the city attorney's father, has not taken a  stand in the race between Feinstein and her opponent for the nomination, state  Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp.  </P> <P> "He's been helpful in advising Dianne in the past, but there was no endorsement  made by Supervisor Hahn," Feinstein spokeswoman Kim Cooper said.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp has received the endorsement of San Francisco City Atty. Louise  Renne, who was appointed by Feinstein during her tenure as mayor.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp campaign spokesman Duane Peterson said the attorney general had no  comment on Hahn's announcement.  </P></p>

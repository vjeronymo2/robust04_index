			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Grenada hopes to revive nutmeg cartel - Plans to give price support another try THE WORLD'S two largest nutmeg producers are contemplating the destruction of about 10,000 tonnes of stocks as part of an effort to stiffen the market and improve prices. The destruction of the stocks, held by Indonesia and Grenada, will be discussed by both countries in a few weeks when the Grenadians will attempt to interest the Indonesians in the recreation of the nutmeg cartel that collapsed two years ago. The producers will also attempt to cut commodity brokers out of the industry, and try to market directly to consumers. 'The stocks which both countries have are a liability and not an asset, and they are depressing prices,' said Mr Denis Noel, Grenada's junior minister of foreign affairs. 'We will consider using the strategy of major coffee producers, which is to destroy some of the stocks. But any destruction will have to be done jointly.' Indonesia produces 75 per cent of the world's nutmeg and Grenada 23 per cent. World production is about 12,000 tonnes a year at present, while annual demand is for only 9,000 tonnes, according to Mr Noel. The co-operation that the Grenadians are seeking will be outlined to the Indonesian producers when a high-level government delegation from the eastern Caribbean island visits Jakarta. Getting agreement on the destruction of the stocks is one aspect of Grenadian plans to resurrect the cartel, which foundered on changes in the Indonesian government's economic policy involving extensive deregulation of the economy. The subsequent removal of controls on the volumes put on the market has sent prices down. In 1986, before the cartel was established, the world price for nutmeg was about USDollars 1,000 a tonne. The marketing pact, in which both countries set minimum prices for the nut, led to an increase to about Dollars 7,000 a tonne. According to Mr Noel, prices are now about Dollars 2,000 a tonne. In preparing the ground for closer collaboration, Grenada and Indonesia recently established diplomatic relations. But Indonesian officials, saying they wanted to see what proposals the Grenadians will be making before commenting on their own position, have indicated that even if it is revived, the marketing agreement will not be similar to the cartel that existed before. 'In a deregulated economy where market forces are at play, it is out of place for us to embrace any mechanism which seeks to control the market and to fix prices,' one official explained. Strengthening the market is more important for Grenada than it is for Indonesia. Nutmeg is a significant foreign currency earner for the Caribbean island but represents only a part of a larger spice industry in Indonesia. 'The nutmeg industry represents the major foreign currency earner for Grenada,' confirmed Mr Noel. When the Indonesian producers group, Aspin, and its Grenadian counterpart, the GCNA, signed the agreement creating the cartel, there were quick and significant benefits for the Caribbean island. Earnings from exports in 1986 were Dollars 1.85m, but the following year Grenadian farmers received Dollars 5.55m in surplus payments. Under the agreement creating the cartel, the Indonesian producers undertook to sell their high quality nutmeg at between Dollars 6,800 and Dollars 7,000 a tonne and low quality at between Dollars 1,000 and Dollars 1,200 a tonne. For their part, the Grenadians committed themselves to minimum prices of Dollars 6,650 a tonne for their best nutmeg and Dollars 5,575 a tonne for poorer quality. Indonesia's high quality mace, the red lacy substance that surrounds nutmeg, had a minimum price of Dollars 13,500 a tonne, with low quality not being sold below Dollars 6,000 a tonne. The Grenadians agreed not to accept less than Dollars 11,750 a tonne for their premium mace or Dollars 5,750 for the secondary product. The two producers' groups also agreed to control the volume of nutmeg and mace placed on the market in order to maintain price stability. The agreed volumes were determined on the basis of average production and stocks held by both. Grenada's stocks reached 5,500 tonnes, with Indonesia's at 4,000 tonnes, said Mr Noel. The cartel had a short life. By 1989 Grenadians were accusing the Indonesians of reneging on the pact by selling nutmeg and mace below the minimum prices. An attempt to repair the damage had seemed to be successful, with Indonesian and Grenadian officials agreeing to restore the cartel's pricing policy, the Indonesians undertaking to sell their spice at 5 per cent above the agreed minimum and the Grenadians adding 10 per cent to their prices. But when the new economic policies were implemented in Indonesia, Grenada's industry threw in the towel and reduced prices in an effort to hold on to market share. The GCNA dropped the price of its top quality nuts by Dollars 2,300 a tonne, and the price of premium quality mace was reduced by Dollars 4,000 a tonne. 'When we talk with the Indonesians, we will also discuss co-operation in marketing, which will allow us, as the producers, to deal directly with end users,' said Mr Noel. 'This will allow us to bypass the commodity brokers. The previous agreement collapsed, not because it was unworkable, but because of changes in Indonesia.'</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: WHEN IT COMES TO BLIND JUSTICE, UMPIRE'S SIGHT IS ALWAYS  20/20  </P> <P> Dave Hagler, program director for the Los Angeles Sports and the Law chapter,  is a former referee and umpire who tells the ultimate turnabout-is-fair-play  story:  </P> <P> "I was driving too fast in the snow in Boulder, Colo., and a policeman pulled  me over and gave me a speeding ticket. I tried to talk him out of it, telling  him how worried I was about insurance, etc., and he said I should go to court  and try to get it reduced or thrown out.  </P> <P> "The first game of the next baseball season, I'm umpiring behind home plate and  the first batter up is the same policeman. I recognize him, he recognizes me.  He asks me how the thing went with the ticket. I tell him, 'Swing at  everything.' "  </P> <P> Just asking: If the position of catcher is so demanding, how is it that Bob  Boone, Carlton Fisk and Rick Dempsey, all in their 40s, are still playing?  </P> <P> Add Boone: The Philadelphia Phillies gave up on him in 1981 when he was 34. He  will make more money this year with Kansas City, $1.9 million, than he made in  all 10 years in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Trivia time: Nolan Ryan had the most strikeouts of any major league pitcher in  the 1980s. Who was second?  </P> <P> Now-it-can-be-told dept.: Jim Palmer and Joe Morgan, newest members of the  baseball Hall of Fame, were adversaries in the 1977 All-Star game at Yankee  Stadium. Morgan tagged Palmer for a leadoff home run.  </P> <P> Palmer: "I went 3-and-2 on Morgan. I knew -- and this is what made him as great  as he is -- if I walked him, and if he felt good, he'd steal second. If he  really felt good, he'd steal third. A walk to Joe Morgan was a triple, so I  took the stupid way out. I threw him a low fastball, and he hit it about 311  feet."  </P> <P> Deflation: Said Tom Lasorda as he signed baseballs at an autograph show: "This  signature may not be worth much now, but five years from now it will be worth  less."  </P> <P> Roomies: From Burt Graeff of the Cleveland Plain Dealer: "Collectively, San  Antonio rookies David Robinson and Sean Elliott will earn about $5 million this  season. While most NBA players pay the added expense of having a single room on  the road, Robinson and Elliott save about $38 a night by doubling up.  </P> <P> Said Coach Larry Brown: "I think Sean does it because he likes David. David  does it because he likes money."  </P> <P> Dennis, beware: If Loyola Marymount's Hank Gathers fails to make it in the NBA,  it won't be for lack of confidence. He told USA Today: "Whoever gets me will be  very lucky. I'm a scorer -- not a shooter. I can put the ball on the floor. I'm  a Dennis Rodman type, but I'd eat Dennis Rodman alive. I'm a hell of a player  and I know it."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: The Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Dick Vitale, asked the biggest surprise of his life: "When my wife  said, 'I do.' " HARLEY TINKHAM  </P></p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Tiphook Tiphook's statement on the sale of its container business was slipped quietly into the water at 5.41pm yesterday, when all good stockbrokers are already in bed. That is a pity, because it makes such interesting reading. The initial high hopes for the price the container business would fetch had been further shaved, so that now Tiphook can only expect Pounds 690m immediately. The ambitious new-trailers-for-old deals which the company agreed last spring to raise cash and defer problems - at the same time that it was insisting it had no banking difficulties - have had to be expensively renegotiated. Some Pounds 49.7m has been lost as a result. Yet the company still finds itself with the commitment to buy at least Pounds 160m of trailers in 1996, for which it sheepishly admits that it currently cannot pay. Its most recent results have also been prepared, in that chilling accountants phrase, on a 'going concern basis'. Some hopeful assumptions are made about the company's ability to remain that way - including a general economic recovery in Europe which will work to Tiphook's advantage. For a company with a congenitally sunny disposition, such optimism is at least consistent. For shareholders who have suffered the loss of most of their market value as a result of this rosy boardroom view, the wholesale departure of directors is perhaps the only consolation.</p>

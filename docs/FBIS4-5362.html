			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 11 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu leaves for Russia Tuesday to discuss the North Korean  nuclear issue and to prepare for President Kim Yong-sam's visit  to Moscow this summer.    His itinerary includes a meeting with Hans Blix, chief of  the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in Tokyo where they  will discuss the agency's assessment of North Korea's nuclear  capability after the latest inspection and future measures to  ensure safeguards.    After his stopover in Japan, the foreign minister will visit  Moscow April 13-15 to meet his Russian counterpart Andrey  Kozyrev and other government leaders.    He will explain the results of President Kim's trips to  Japan  and China last month, consult on the Korean nuclear crisis and  set down details for Kim's Moscow visit, expected to come in  June.    Han then heads to London where he will stay until April 16.  He plans to meet his British counterpart Douglas Hurd and  attend the South Korea-Britain Forum, delivering a speech on  bilateral relations.    He will stop off in Brussels April 16-17 for a conference of  South Korean mission chiefs stationed in Europe before returning  April 18.    The trip will obviously highlight coordination on the  nuclear  problem that entered a new phase last month with the UN Security  Council's presidential statement urging Pyongyang to allow  additional outside inspections.    Moscow has recently tried to play a more visible role in the  matter, proposing an eight-party conference to solve the problem  among regional powers, the United Nations and the IAEA.</p>

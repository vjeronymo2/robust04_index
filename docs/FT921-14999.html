			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / International Company News: Laidlaw suffers 47% drop in first-quarter earnings EARNINGS at Laidlaw, the Canadian waste services and school bus operator, fell by 47 per cent in the first quarter of fiscal 1992. Much of the decline was due to lower contributions from its two affiliates, ADT, the Bermuda-based security and car auction group, and Attwoods, the UK-based waste management company. Laidlaw is the largest single shareholder in both companies. Laidlaw's earnings dropped to USDollars 40.6m, or 16 cents a share, in the three months to November 30, from Dollars 77.5m, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose fractionally to Dollars 521.3m. The combined contributions from Attwoods and ADT tumbled to Dollars 8.4m from Dollars 24.3m. Laidlaw does not publish separate figures for the two companies. Laidlaw and ADT have yet to finalise the selection of three out of the four independent directors who are due to join ADT's board under a truce between the two companies hammered out nine months ago. The agreement followed serious allegations by Laidlaw about ADT's corporate governance under its chief executive Mr Michael Ashcroft. Laidlaw's US garbage business remains a headache, with margins sinking to 10 per cent from 17.2 per cent a year earlier. Besides the recession, this division is suffering from management problems and the legacy of an unfocused acquisition spree in the 1980s. Despite these setbacks, Laidlaw's share price has moved up sharply in recent weeks, closing at CDollars 11.50 on the Toronto stock exchange on Friday, up from a low of CDollars 8.35 late last year.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Observer: PM in bank note scandal Paul Keating is the first Australian prime minister for years who can safely be cleared of debasing the currency - inflation has fallen to less than 0.8 per cent since he took over from Bob Hawke just under a year ago. But defacing it is a different matter, and the federal police think they may be able to finger him on that score. The alleged crime was perpetrated during a walkabout in North Queensland when Keating unwisely signed two ADollars 5 notes at the request of a local artist. Now the artist is selling the notes for ADollars 3,000 each, and the premier is being investigated under the Crimes (Currency) Act, which provides for imprisonment of up to two years. If the case ever got to court, it could even cost the prime minister his job. Justice minister Michael Tate has promised that the case would be dealt with impartially. Keating plays down the incident as summer nonsense. But there is some evidence that it was as much a political statement as a vote-catching exercise. The notes he signed were examples of the freshly issued ADollars 5 note carrying the Queen's portrait in place of the 19th century pioneer pictured on the earlier design. Keating was one of many republican Australians who unsuccessfully tried to persuade the Reserve Bank to cancel the issue.</p>

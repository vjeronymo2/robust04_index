Roderick] </F>   [Text] Piet Retief, South-Eastern Transvaal, Feb 19 SAPA --  Zulu monarch, King Goodwill Zwelithini, says he hopes all people  in Natal/kwaZulu will accept him as their king. Speaking to a  gathering of Zulus near Piet Retief on Saturday [19 February],  he said he stood firm on his call for an independent Zulu  monarchy.    "I want to give my assurance to all the people of  kwaZulu/Natal that all your needs will be met under a Zulu  monarchy," he said, promising to uphold democratic and  pluralistic values.    "This independent state would offer full protection to all  its people as individuals and members of social and cultural  formations," he said.    The king, at a meeting with State President F W de Klerk  last  week announced his plans for secession from South Africa,  rejecting participation in the country's first non-racial  election in April. Explaining his move on Saturday, he said  South Africa's interim constitution was a "threat" to the status  and institutions of the Zulu kingdom. "The constitution has  reduced you to playing a minimal tribal and administrative role  in the running of your communities," he told the gathering of  tribal leaders and chiefs.    He raised the concern that the constitution did not include  a  provision which would "ensure that a new government will not  take the land the monarchy has held in trust for the Zulu  people".    He said his claim for an independent Zulu state was based on  historical precedent and had been his intention prior to kwaZulu  Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi's "warning" of a deadlock on  the question of federalism in constitution negotiations.    He called on the tribal chiefs and leaders to "stand  together" if they were to survive the threats and challenges he  claimed were being faced by the zulu people.</p>

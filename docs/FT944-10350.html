			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Exchange rate imprisons Burmese economy: Nationalistic devotion to a strong kyat is restricting both investment and exports Fear of persecution is not an emotion normally associated with seminars on financial markets, but then Burma's military junta does not preside over a normal financial system; after 32 years of socialist military dictatorship, it runs one of the world's poorest and least sophisticated economies. 'It is time to take appropriate steps for the formal opening of a stock exchange in Yangon (Rangoon),' declared Brig-Gen Win Tin, the Burmese finance minister, at a recent seminar sponsored by Japan's Daiwa Research Institute. But the Burmese bureaucrats, academics and businessmen attending the meeting were visibly frightened to be asked by a journalist for their views on Burma's economic policies and the prospects of a stock market. They shuffled their feet nervously and said they could not speak without official permission. Particularly unwelcome were questions about the most urgent financial issue confronting the junta - the overvalued official exchange rate of the kyat, the local currency. In theory a dollar buys just under six kyats, but on the black market it will fetch 115 kyats. The exchange rate policy of the State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) - as the junta calls itself - restricts both inward foreign investment and Burmese exports. Investors and exporters would receive far too few kyat for their dollars if they ran their businesses in a conventional manner, and they have been forced to avoid the obstacle by engaging in complex joint ventures or barter arrangements involving the export of beans and other agricultural produce. Slorc's obsession with an artificially strong currency would also block the disbursement of funds from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank, if such funds were not already blocked by western protests against Slorc's many human rights abuses. Slorc generals, trained as soldiers rather than economists, talk vaguely of an eventual 'convergence' between the official and unofficial rates. They argue that the exchange rate is not a problem because they tolerate dealings on the black market, but the policy distorts the Burmese economy in several ways. The armed forces and state-owned enterprises, for example, are allowed to import weapons and raw materials at the official rate, which means they pay unrealistically low amounts of kyats for their imports. And the official exchange rate is used to calculate all import tariffs, depriving the government of much-needed tax revenue. 'They are always talking about a market-oriented economy,' says Mr Ho Chin Beng, chief representative in Rangoon of the Development Bank of Singapore. 'But the one main stumbling block remains the official exchange rate of the kyat.' The Slorc's reluctance to tamper with the exchange rate is based partly on its collective respect for Gen Ne Win, the 83-year-old former dictator who, from his retirement, is believed to exercise considerable control over younger generals. He is adamantly opposed to devaluation on nationalistic grounds. Slorc generals also fear that a devaluation will boost inflation - already running at an estimated 40 per cent - and anger the poor by increasing the cost of basic products such as cooking oil. These are sold by the state enterprises that currently enjoy a hefty exchange rate subsidy. In the past few years, Burma's generals have embarked on a series of economic reforms. They have encouraged foreign investment, eased restrictions on tourists, liberalised agriculture, legalised the vigorous border trade with China and Thailand and allowed the establishment of private banks and private hotels. Foreign companies, particularly from Singapore and Thailand, have responded enthusiastically. Twenty big hotels are under construction in Rangoon. Seventeen foreign banks have been licensed to open representative offices. Newly-imported second-hand cars are creating the first traffic jams for a generation. Consumer goods such as televisions are on display in the shops, and economic growth last year is estimated at 6 per cent. In its efforts to revive the economy, the Slorc has even risked incurring Gen Ne Win's wrath by introducing currency notes in sensible decimal denominations such as 10 and 100. For years the Burmese had to count their money laboriously in notes of 90 and 45 because nine was the general's lucky number. Slorc ministers have also tentatively begun to raise the cost of basic services for the country's 43m inhabitants towards more realistic levels. Last year, Rangoon bus fares were doubled to two kyat (about two US cents at the free market rate); the price of electricity has just increased fivefold, except for government employees; and the cost of petrol rations (often resold on the black market) has risen from 16 to 25 kyat per imperial gallon in the last few weeks. Reforms implemented so far have encouraged construction and consumer spending and attracted hoteliers and crafty foreign commodity traders to Burma. But many Japanese and western companies are reluctant to invest in a country where the regime is unpopular with its subjects, the banking system remains primitive, corruption and bureaucracy are rampant and repatriation of profits depends on the ability to export beans or lentils. 'Things are changing on the surface, but there's no structural change,' says one Burmese businessman. Rangoon-based diplomats agree, pointing out that other south-east Asian economies such as Thailand and Indonesia have been able to succeed despite corruption and military influence because trained economists and technocrats control macro-economic policy. This is not the case in Burma. 'The problem is that sooner or later, as all these niche opportunities created by the reforms are taken up, the whole system will hit the ceiling and be held back by the structural impediments,' says one diplomat.</p>

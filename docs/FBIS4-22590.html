			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, governor of Maritime </F> Kray, by Yelena Belykh: "Extricating Ourselves From the  Captivity of Dead Schemes"]    [Text] Despite all of life's burdens which fall to  the lot of the "average" Maritimer, one virtue of existence in  the province by the sea is indisputable--things are tranquil  here. The political battles in the capital roll down to us in  gentle waves, fortunately. But the social peace is fragile.    In terms of per capita income the Maritime area is in last  place in the region. The gap between rich and poor is growing. A  bank employee receives 2.5 times more than a worker, three times  more than a teacher, and four times more than a peasant. The two  minimums--wage and subsistence--differ from one another tens of  times over. How to beat back the wave of growing social tension  and prevent the eruption of a "rebellion senseless and  pitiless"? Our correspondent took this question to a surgery on  personal matters at the residence of Ye. Nazdratenko, governor  of the kray.    [Belykh] Yevgeniy Ivanovich, on her resignation Ella  Pamfilova, minister of social protection, told the press that  she could not deceive people. The government was adopting  another decree, as a result of which a quantity of watermarked  notes would be printed. They are distributed to the poor, but  frequently only when prices have exceeded the posted price many  times over. What is there for needy Maritimers to hope for?    [Nazdratenko] The realism of government decrees is a painful  subject. Is there, say, a decree on privileges for the  casualties from the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power  Station? Yes, and very handsome it is. Has the government  allocated the region money? Not one ruble. People are coming to  us, to the administration, for help--there is no money. Is there  a decree on officers discharged into the reserve, on apartments  being built for them? Yes. And there is inflation, which is  devouring the funds which were at one time allocated. One  apartment instead of five--that's the arithmetic. The list could  be continued ad infinitum. Take if only the first edict of the  president on education and the way it has been fulfilled.    All this cannot fail to stoke the people's exasperation.  This  runs counter to my inner convictions, incidentally. Remember one  of the numerous promises of Gaydar--the favorite of young people  and the West, the personification of progressive thinking? "Only  bikers will feel the increase in the price of fuel." It has been  felt by retirees--the most defenseless group of society. We, the  kray, have been able to cover them, reduce the prices, and allow  gasoline benefits. We are posting the militia, we are posting  the Special Militia so that the elderly individual may fill up  in peace and not be humiliated by the "leather" boys. And? He  rides away, and half a kilometer further on that same junior  mafioso stops him and siphons off the gasoline. Who is to blame?    [Belykh] Nazdratenko, naturally. When people voted for the  new constitution, for continuation of the reforms, they voted  for you also.    [Nazdratenko] I am not sure that if a ballot were conducted  now, I would collect as many white balls. But I would ask people  to believe in one thing--the sincerity of my motives when I  attempt to do something. We are working on a decree on the  economic status of the kray. We are not demanding direct  financial infusions into a moribund economy. But release us from  the captivity of dead schemes born of anonymous government  officials somewhere in Moscow! Afford us an opportunity to  manage preferential quantity regulation and licensing! The  Yaroslavskiy Mining and Concentrating Works is at a  standstill--people have no earnings, the community is dying.  Grant it the opportunity to sell products in a profitable  manner, and people will have money. Money, not "compensation  payments." The infrastructure would be restored, the social  sphere would revive.    [Belykh] The same hopes were placed in Government Decree  1001.    [Nazdratenko] True. But who torpedoed this decree? It was  buried here, in the Maritime region, by Bytov and Cherepkov. I  was accused of blackmailing the government. The same thing will  probably be repeated with the decree. According to the  principle: "If a man exists, you can pin something on him." The  business of the tanker filled with radioactive waste.  "Nazdratenko is lobbying a Japanese company!" Very well, you  don't want a cleanup by the Japanese for free, within 20 days?  Accept the alternative--18 months of construction for over $2  million. But the kray would not pay this. I have no intention of  taking crumbs from pensions and children's compensation to pay  some firm in Moscow for secretaries and private residences.    Yes, I am a lobbyist. I lobby for the interests of the  Maritimers. Only not those who roll around in Mercedes and talk  with competitors in the language of lampoons and grenades. The  interests of normal working people, who bring their troubles to  my surgery. Whom we, the authorities, are required to provide  with a normal peaceful life.</p>

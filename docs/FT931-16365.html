			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Letter: Kenyan elections a significant move towards genuine, multi-party politics (2) Sir, In your editorial of December 31, you appear to stand alone in your conclusion that democracy lost in Kenya's first multi-party poll for 26 years. On December 29, Kenyans patiently and peacefully cast their votes to choose their leader and party. All the observers have, with minor reservations, accepted that this process is a significant step in Kenya's transition to genuine multi-party democracy. You may not agree with the choice or the margins by which the winner won, but that is what democracy is all about. President Daniel arap Moi and the Kenya African National Union won. The democratic thing for the opposition to do is to take their seats in parliament and make their contributions from there. As you must have observed, defections and counter-defections affected all the political parties, but it seems to me that when candidates defect from Kanu it is acceptable to you, while the reverse is not. In this particular election, civil servants have not been involved. However, a few individuals, though they are civil servants, made compromising political statements. In these cases, and in accordance with the code of regulations governing the civil service, appropriate action was taken. M Ngali, acting high commissioner, Kenya High Commission, 45 Portland Place, London W1N 4AS</p>

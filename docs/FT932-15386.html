			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Collor denies role in attempted bribery BRAZIL'S former president, Mr Fernando Collor, has denied involvement in an alleged attempt to bribe the attorney general into dropping criminal charges against him, according to Brazilian television, Reuter reports from Braslia. Mr Collor gave a 15-minute deposition before a federal judge on Monday, the O Globo television programme reported. A businessman, Mr Wanderley de Oliveira, has been charged in the case. 'I've never even seen the man', O Globo quoted the ex-president as saying outside the hearing room. The proceedings were closed to the press. Mr de Oliveira is alleged to have attempted to offer Dollars 50m to Mr Aristides Junqueira, attorney general, last November to drop criminal charges against Mr Collor while he was still president. Mr Junqueira has charged Mr Collor with passive corruption and forming a criminal group as part of an alleged influence-peddling scheme. He faces trial before the Supreme Court. The attorney general has claimed in interviews that Mr de Oliveira had told one of his aides the money was being put up by 'persons employed to defend Collor'. Mr Collor, 43, resigned at the start of his Senate impeachment trial in December and was replaced by his vice-president, Mr Itamar Franco. Mr Collor's wife Rosane had also been due to make a statement to the hearing on Monday about charges that she used government money in 1991 to pay for a lavish party for her personal secretary.</p>

Robinson broke the record of 294 set by Nolan Cromwell of Kansas against  Oregon State in 1975.  </P> <P> Chris Gardocki kicked a school record-tying four field goals, from 47, 25, 30  and 25 yards, in Clemson's 34-3 victory over Georgia. It was the largest margin  of victory by Clemson over Georgia since 1905, when the Tigers won, 35-0.  Clemson's Doug Brewster set up a field goal in the second quarter when he  blocked Scot Armstrong's punt, the first block against the Bulldogs since 1984.  </P> <P> John Langeloh kicked an extra point in Michigan State's 12-7 loss to Iowa,  tying him with Morten Andersen as the Spartans' career scoring leader with 261  points. Langeloh missed field-goal attempts of 19 and 42 yards.  </P> <P> David Klingler, the nation's total offense leader, completed 35 of 68 passes  for 405 yards in Houston's 31-15 Southwest Conference victory over Baylor.  Klingler was one short of Andre Ware's school and conference record for pass  attempts.  </P> <P> Mississippi defeated Kentucky, 35-29, for its third consecutive victory and  improved its record to 4-1, the best start for the Rebels since quarterback  Archie Manning led the 1970 team to a 4-1 record after five games. The victory  was Billy Brewer's 100th as a college coach.  </P> <P> The Colorado State defense made the difference in a 22-13 victory over Utah.  The Rams sacked Utah quarterback Jason Woods seven times, intercepted three of  his passes and recovered two fumbles.  </P> <P> Illinois' 31-20 victory over Ohio State was its third in a row, the first time  the Illini have beaten the Buckeyes three games in a row since 1927-29.  </P> <P> Phillip Doyle's six field goals tied a Southeastern Conference record in  Alabama's 25-6 victory over Southwestern Louisiana.  </P> <P> Bill Musgrave became Oregon's all-time offense leader in the No. 22 Ducks' 52-7  victory over Utah State. Musgrave completed 15 of 23 passes for 187 yards and  increased his career offense total to 6,878 yards. He surpassed the previous  school record of 6,841 set from 1983-86 by quarterback Chris Miller.  </P> <P> </P> <P> STREAKS  </P> <P> Penn State's 48-10 victory over Temple was the Nittany Lions' 16th consecutive  win over its intrastate rival since the teams played a tie in 1950.  </P> <P> Colgate's Dave Goodwin, who passed for three touchdowns in a 30-7 victory over  Yale, has thrown touchdown passes in nine consecutive games, breaking the  school record of Steve Calabria set in 1983.  </P> <P> Michigan's 41-3 victory over Wisconsin was the Wolverines' ninth in a row over  the Badgers since 1981.  </P> <P> HOW THE TOP 25 FARED  </P> <P> Rank: 1  </P> <P> Team: Notre Dame  </P> <P> Record: 3-1  </P> <P> Synopsis: Lost to Stanford, 36-31;

The Georgia Tech defense, which has not  allowed a touchdown this season, sacked quarterback Scott Zolak seven times in  the first half and 11 times in the game, bringing the four-game total to 23  sacks and 12 interceptions. Zolak, sacked for losses totaling 65 yards, passed  for 192 yards, almost 100 yards below his average, was intercepted once and was  removed in the fourth quarter. Georgia Tech has won 11 of 12 and eight in a  row.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BIG PLAYS  </P> <P> Tommy Vardell's fourth one-yard touchdown run, with 36 seconds left, gave  Stanford a 36-31 victory over No. 1 Notre Dame. Quarterback Jason Palumbis kept  the Cardinal's game-winning drive alive when he ran for two yards and a first  down on a fourth-down play.

Iowa  State's all-time scoring leader is Dexter Green with 228 points.  </P> <P> Oklahoma's freshman quarterback, Cale Gundy, came off the bench and completed a  52-yard pass play to Adrian Cooper as time ran out in the first half to bring  the Sooners into a 14-14 tie. Oklahoma went on to win, 31-17.  </P> <P> Iowa linebacker Melvin Foster had 20 tackles, an interception that the Hawkeyes  turned into a touchdown and made a key fourth-down stop in the fourth quarter  in a 12-7 victory over Michigan State.  </P> <P> </P> <P> IN QUOTES  </P> <P> Stanford Coach Dennis Green, on running back Tommy Vardell, who scored on four  one-yard touchdown runs in the Cardinal's 36-31 upset of No. 1 Notre Dame: "We  call number 44 Touchdown Tommy. We know he's going to get the ball, you know  he's going to get the ball, and we want to see you try to stop him."  </P> <P> Said Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz: "I don't know if I've ever been in a loss this  difficult."  </P> <P> Maryland Coach Joe Krivak, on the 31-3 loss to Georgia Tech: "That is as  probably as good a licking as we have taken all season. I think it was in every  phase of the game. They ran the ball, they threw when they wanted to and we  couldn't handle their pass rush."  </P> <P> Houston's David Klingler, after completing 35 of 68 passes in a 31-15 victory  over Baylor: "I throw 300 balls a day and this was a good warmup for me. Still  I was dragging there late. I was hoping I'd get hooked."  </P> <P> Louisiana Tech linebacker Myron Baker, after a 16-14 loss to Auburn: "It's hard  to tell how good Auburn is, but if they're a top-five team then we should be  right behind them."  </P> <P> Georgia Coach Ray Goff, after a 34-3 loss to Clemson: "I don't think I could  tell you all my feelings right now. Obviously, I am disappointed. We just got  whipped. You can write all the ifs, ands or buts you want, but the bottom line  is that Clemson lined up and whipped us."  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> BY THE NUMBERS  </P> <P> A look at some of the day's top

And on fifth down.  </P> <P> The final sequence, according to the official play by play, was an incomplete  pass on first down, a short run on second, no gain on a run on third and  another incomplete pass on fourth. Fourth down, Part II: Charles Johnson runs  into the end zone. Seems everyone forgot about the first incomplete pass. By  the time everyone realized that Missouri had been Buffaloed, it was too late.  Officials said they could not reverse the decision once the play had taken  place.  </P> <P> WHAT I MEANT WAS...  </P> <P> Terrell Buckley, a sophomore cornerback for previously undefeated Florida  State, dismissed the talents of Miami quarterback Craig Erickson when  interviewed before the CBS telecast of Miami's 31-22 victory. Buckley said he  hadn't seen anything in Erickson's performance that would qualify him as a  Heisman Trophy candidate and said he considered the Miami quarterback only an  "average" player. Good thing for Buckley Erickson's an only average  quarterback. Erickson passed to Buckley's side with effectiveness, including a  10-yard scorig pass to Lamar Thomas in the second quarter on which Buckley was  beaten by at least a couple of steps.  </P> <P> INJURIES  </P> <P> Army running back Willie McMillian left the game against Duke in the fourth  quarter with a pulled right hamstring.  </P></p>

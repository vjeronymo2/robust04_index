			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> 700 EVACUATED, AIR WARNINGS SPARKED BY BLAZE IN EVERGLADES  </P> <P> Runaway Everglades brush fires sent thick black smoke across the Miami area  today, prompting health warnings and an order to evacuate 700 aliens from a  detention camp.  </P> <P> "I thought my garage was on fire this morning, the smoke was so heavy," said  Anna Nasher, who lives in suburban Coral Gables.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service advised people with asthma, emphysema and other  respiratory problems to stay indoors.  </P> <P> "It's very serious. We've got an emergency," said Perry Rivkind, district  director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  </P> <P> Rivkind this morning ordered the evacuation of aliens from the Krome Avenue  Detention Center on the edge of the Everglades as a brush fire advanced to  within a mile. But by early afternoon, the aliens were still awaiting buses.  </P> <P> Rivkind said the immigrants would be taken to the Bobby Maduro Baseball  Stadium, which recently was used as a home for Nicaraguan refugees. But City  Manager Cesar Odio suggested that they might be transferred to a facility in  Texas.  </P> <P> Smoke from fires about 20 miles away, including 3,000 burning acres of  dried-out saw grass, blocked the subtropical sun and slowed traffic.  </P></p>

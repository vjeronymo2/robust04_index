			<p>BFN     [Text] President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has said, as a  result of sound economic policies adopted by the present  government, the climate for foreign investment in Pakistan has  become lucrative. The president was addressing Pakistanis in New  York. The president said the response of foreign investors to  the government's incentive package has been very positive. As a  result of macroeconomic management, foreign investment in  several sectors -- particularly in the sector of power  generation -- will increase in the days to come.    He said Pakistan's nuclear program is not weapon-oriented.  We have taken a conscious decision not to use our nuclear  capability for weapon production unless our security is  threatened. The president said Pakistan has told the United  States that no unilateral solution could be imposed on Pakistan.  Any solution to the nonproliferation problem in South Asian  region has to be evolved in the regional context. He said  Pakistan had proposed in 1974 that the South Asian region be  declared a nuclear-free zone. Since then, Pakistan has made six  more concrete proposals to achieve nonproliferation in the  region, but India has rejected all of them. Under the  circumstances, the United States or the world at large could not  expect realistically that Pakistan would accept any unilateral  obligation.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Bosnian Serbs reject land deal Bosnian Serb leaders again quashed hopes for a settlement by yesterday rejecting a previously agreed arrangement which traded land for peace. Referring to EU plan for Serbs to keep 49 per cent of Bosnia and Moslems and Croats to control 51 per cent, Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the Bosnian Serb assembly, said: 'Moslems and Croats do not have the moral right to such a percentage of territory since they never have controlled such an area.' Earlier, Mr Douglas Hogg, British foreign office minister, in Belgrade to meet President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, stressed the importance of the 'land for peace' deal. Mr Hogg said: 'The allocation of 49 and 51 per cent is very firm. We do not want to see firm points shifted.' In Sarajevo, another earlier arrangement was buckled. Mr Yasushi Akashi, UN envoy, agreed to allow seven Serb tanks to pass through the 20km exclusion zone around the city despite Bosnian government protests. Laura Silber, Belgrade.</p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Perspectives: A little something for the weekend - Letter from Lagos / In Nigeria, the police use roadblocks to ensure motorists pay their Christmas bonus How's the weekend?' said the policeman as I wound down the window of my car in a dark slip road lit only by the waving torches of the officers flagging me down. It was not the weekend, it was a Tuesday, and the policeman was not interested in how I spent my spare time, he was asking for money. In the month before Christmas in Nigeria this question comes any day of the week from people who stop your car, ranging from a gate man at a carpark to a soldier on patrol with a Kalashnikov rifle. In many parts of the world, you can see from the tinsel in shop windows that there are fewer than 30 shopping days to Christmas; in Nigeria you can tell from the number of roadblocks. Officially, the roadblocks are to stop crime. In practice, the roadblocks are also a prime source of income for security forces whose basic salaries are below subsistence level, that is if they have been paid at all. Surprisingly for a military regime, even the armed forces get no pay for two or three months at a stretch. If confronted by armed police or soldiers, it is risky not to stop. If it is late at night, it can be risky if you do stop: a friend was recently attacked by a drunken policeman at a roadblock. In the daytime the police are on the look-out for traffic offences and will jump into the car and seize the keys or insist on being driven to 'the station' which usually means a quiet corner where he can negotiate the 'fine'. At most roadblocks a joke and a few words in pidgin English or a local language, even from a foreigner, can often do the trick. Demanding your rights gets you nowhere at all. The seasonal message sometimes comes with as much humour as menace. 'It's December, time for Christmas bonus,' a jovial policeman told us at a roadblock between Lagos and Benin recently. 'We haven't had our salaries and we have to eat,' said another. They searched a jerry can in the car, thinking that we were illegally carrying petrol, but found it contained water, then demanded to see the car documents. 'No. They are all in order,' said the driver. They gave up and we drove off. 'They are rogues, thieves,' said the driver. 'They do not stop criminals. They take money from them as well and let them go.' Not only professional drivers are hardened against the police. Many Nigerians regard the spate of roadblocks with contempt. But the police do not always get their way. Last week a friend came to see me unusually late, even by African time. 'I'm sorry,' she said. 'I had to go to my home with the police. They wanted the originals of my car documents. They know that no one here carries originals, just the copies, in case of armed robbery. 'It would have been easier just to give them money, but they were so rude and arrogant I decided not to give them anything. I told them the originals were at my house. They got into my car, we went home and I showed them the papers. Then they said they had no transport to get back to work and I told them that was their own fault. I gave them nothing,' she said. In Nigeria, cheques and credit cards are often useless: people need to carry cash, sometimes large sums of hard currency since foreign exchange controls were imposed this year. A businessman taking a taxi to the airport to go on holiday was recently stopped by the police in a dark street. 'They ordered me out of the cab and frisked me,' he said. 'In my top pocket I had Dollars 2,000 in cash. I refused to open the pocket so they said we would have to go to the police station. They knew that if they delayed me long enough I would miss my flight. 'The taxi driver and I got back in the car and as the policeman walked around to the other side to get in, the driver put his foot down and left him standing. I ducked my head just in case but they did not shoot at us,' he said with a grin. Officially, the roadblocks are increased to deal with the higher rate of crime which is part of the run-up to Christmas. 'Our people are working overtime and we have put administrative staff out on patrol to curb crime and we have been successful - the crime rate is much lower than this time last year,' said a spokesman for Lagos state police. They are fighting an uphill battle. Last week, the spare wheel was prised off the underside of my car in full view of six security guards outside a 'secure' block of flats. Recently, the chief of security at the British High Commission had his car hijacked by three armed robbers. The police are powerless to deal with these gangs, who roam Lagos at night and attack private homes and cars, often with military precision and automatic weapons. Sometimes the military are the source of the weapons, particularly disgruntled soldiers returning from the war in Liberia. In some cases, the robbers are soldiers. A senior Lagos police officer recently told a local magazine that he had appealed to the state governor to curb crime among the army. A sergeant earns N800 a month (worth Dollars 36 at the official exchange rate, but much less in real terms). This is less than half the pay of many domestic servants. Yet the police can see military personnel driving new cars that it would take more than a lifetime's salary to buy. The police say that they do not tolerate extortion and bribery. 'If a policeman demands money, you should report it to us. Members of the public are our mirror,' says a police spokesman. But the public know that the victim of a crime can find himself arrested when reporting it if the criminal has squared the police. Corruption in the security forces, as in most services and professions in Nigeria, has become a way of life.</p>

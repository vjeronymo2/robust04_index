			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In summary, the rulemaking record contains ample evidence regarding the price and availability of feeds which the agency reviewed when making its decision. However, these factors, as well as all other supply and demand factors, continued to be automatically reflected in the M&hyph;W price, which has long been the moving factor in the Class I (and also Class II and III) prices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Class I Price and Class I Differential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Class I price in each order contains two components. The largest component is the M&hyph;W price, which applies in all orders. The smaller component is a Class I differential that is specific to each order. Consequently, through the M&hyph;W component the Class I price in each order automatically reflects the price and availability of supplies of feed and all other economic factors that affect the supply and demand for milk and dairy products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Raw milk is a bulky product and is more expensive to transport than the equivalent amount of milk used to produce concentrated manufactured dairy products. There is a direct link between weight and the cost of moving milk across geographic areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Class I differential part of the Class I price is intended to partially reflect the cost of transporting milk. The differential portion serves as a price incentive to draw milk from supply areas toward metropolitan demand centers. One of the statutory objectives of the Federal milk order program is to provide a sufficient amount of fluid milk for consumers. The differential serves as an incentive to move milk from supply areas to demand centers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In economic terms, a spatial pricing structure for milk evolves when it traverses geographic space. The structure is characterized by a price at the area of supply. Such price increases proportionally as the distance to the area of demand increases. It is noted that there does not need to be a single defined supply area. Furthermore, it is not necessary that prices be identical at all recognized supply areas. Many different supply areas could be considered. However, distance and the cost of transportation implicitly and efficiently link demand areas to the nearest and/or least cost area of supply. The spatial Class I milk pricing structure recognizes these economic relationships.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Court's opinion appears to misconstrue the Secretary's description regarding the Class I differential and transportation cost. The Court observed that:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [T]he Secretary expressly states in his final decision that the differentials are no longer meant to reflect the cost of transportation *&blank;*&blank;* (Opinion, p.7).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> In fact, the final decision pointed out that ``the Class I pricing structure does not cover the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> total <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  cost of moving bulk fluid milk from one area to another.'' (58 FR 12648, emphasis added).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In short, the relevant factor that establishes a limit for Class I differentials is the cost of transportation. Class I differentials partially reflect the cost of transportation at a level that will insure an adequate supply of milk pursuant to statutory objectives. Because some milk is produced just about everywhere, the mix of milk produced near consumption centers with milk shipped from distant areas varies among orders. If no nearby milk is produced for a particular consumption center, the Class I differential would have to more fully reflect the cost of transporting milk from the nearest alternative surplus milk-producing area. However, because some milk is produced just about everywhere, the Class I differential in any particular marketing area merely has to be high enough to bring forth adequate supplies of locally produced milk together with supplemental supplies from other areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the mobility of milk increased, a transition necessarily occurred from considering only isolated local markets to considering a system of regional markets that are linked through class price coordination. Individual markets that previously set class prices based on local supply-demand conditions now are part of larger regional markets whose prices are coordinated through the  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> M&hyph;W price as the price mover in federal milk marketing orders. Once the M&hyph;W price was adopted, there was a common mechanism for coordinating market price movements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

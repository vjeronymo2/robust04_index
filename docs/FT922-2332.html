			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Sperryn adds his voice to London chamber It took Simon Sperryn, chief executive of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, only two weeks to complete the negotiations which led to yesterday's announcement that he is to become chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Sperryn who, apart from one short break in industry, has spent his entire working life working for a chamber, was approached at short notice to replace Malcolm Stephens, who is leaving the London chamber in September after 10 months. (See Observer, Page 21.) Although the London chamber is larger than its Manchester counterpart - 3,500 members against 2,800 and 115 staff compared with 75 - many of the problems are the same. Greater Manchester, like London, has no strategic planning body, so the Manchester chamber has had to deal with 10 local authorities just as London has to deal with 33 local boroughs. The chamber and Training and Enterprise Council movements are also fragmented in both metropolitan areas; Greater Manchester is served by no fewer than seven Tecs and seven chambers. Attempts to rationalise this splintered business support network have had some success in Manchester. The 10 chambers of commerce in the north west of England and Wales are forming a federation with the ultimate prospect of a merger. This may prove more difficult in London where there are strong traditional rivalries between the local chambers. Asked about the most significant achievements of the Manchester chamber during his six-year tenure, Sperryn highlights the forging of links between schools and industry in a local 'compact' and the creation of the Greater Manchester visitor and convention bureau to promote the area. An amateur singer, Sperryn, 46, has also been chairman of the Manchester Camerata, a freelance chamber orchestra. He also lists drawing, riding and reading among his leisure interests. ***** David Tiplady (right), one of the leading solicitors acting for Lloyd's Names, has been made a partner at DJ Freeman, the City law firm. Tiplady, 45, originally qualified as a barrister in 1974 and spent several years in academe, teaching commercial law at the universities of Pennsylvania, California, Oxford and Nottingham, before joining DJ Freeman in 1989. He requalified as a solicitor in the same year and now represents over 3,000 Lloyd's Names, from the Pulbrook, Poland and Gooda Walker action groups. ***** Harry Brown has been appointed md of CREDIT AND GUARANTEE INSURANCE. ***** Robert Van Gieson, an md of Chubb &amp; Son Inc, has been appointed chairman of CHUBB INSURANCE COMPANY OF EUROPE. ***** Tom Carpenter is promoted from deputy chairman to become chairman of E W PAYNE, part of Sedgwick. Jonathan Gilbert is to become chairman of SEDGWICK ENERGY, and Derek Ford, its deputy chairman, is also md.</p>

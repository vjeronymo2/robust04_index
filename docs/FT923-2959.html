			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Dalgety Contrary to the uglier market rumours, Britain's food manufacturing sector does not appear to have collapsed in recent months. Like Cadbury and United Biscuits before it, Dalgety yesterday painted a picture of undeniably tough trading conditions - growing retailer power, choosy consumers and the like - but not of an environment in which good companies with decent brands and low costs cannot continue to thrive. A 5 per cent increase in profits and dividends for the 12 months to June certainly underlines Dalgety's growing claim to a place in that league. Most impressive is the progress in consumer foods, where solid gains in market share more than offset a slight dip in petfood demand and Golden Wonder asserted its position as the number two in crisps. The difficulties in milling and baking are hardly of Dalgety's making, while the lower gearing figure should be seen in the context of a net Pounds 42m outflow for acquisitions. Better working capital controls saved Pounds 23m - and there is the promise of more to come. Dalgety's shares have outperformed the sector by 15 per cent this year, an achievement which can largely be justified on superior earnings. The question is whether the stock deserves better than a forward multiple of just over 10 and a 6.7 per cent historic yield. Having approved the transformation from erratic, commodity trader to reliable plodder with predictable profits growth, the market remains rightly cautious. But once the management succession is sorted out and the strategic direction refined, the shares should attract new support.</p>

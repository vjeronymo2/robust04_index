			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SPARKS IN EXTREME SHAPE THE MUSIC  </P> <P> Band: Extreme.  </P> <P> Personnel: Gary Cherone, vocals; Nuno Bettencourt, guitar; Pat Badger, bass;  Paul Geary, drums.  </P> <P> History: When Bettencourt first encountered vocalist Cherone, it was animosity  at first sight. Cherone's band, the Dream, was headlining a show and his  then-guitarist haughtily kicked the openers -- Bettencourt's group -- out of  the communal dressing room. A couple of years later, in 1985, when Bettencourt  and Cherone ran across each other once again, sparks flew -- but they were  sparks of inspiration. "We hit it off as writers," recalled Cherone in a recent  interview. "We were the missing link for each other." Bettencourt's sense of  musical adventure fit perfectly with Cherone's wild lyrical ideas and a tightly  knit songwriting team was born. Cherone pulled Geary, the Dream's drummer, into  the project and a few months later they recruited Badger. The members' combined  reputations on the local scene gave Extreme immediate drawing power in  Boston-area clubs. By November '87, when the group was signed to A&amp;M  Records, Extreme had been named Outstanding Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Act at the  Boston Music Awards for two years straight -- an honor that the band earned  again in '88.  </P> <P> Sound: Extreme's frolic through the hard rock arena is winsome and colorful.  Its self-titled debut album contains a jumble of moods, from the goofy and  childlike "Mutha" and "Play With Me" to the classically inspired "Rock A Bye  Bye," which pensively tackles the issue of abortion. On several other numbers  it spends time exploring blues-based rock, but with a funky beat that's  appealingly different. The group is tightly orchestrated, which gives its songs  a complexity rare in its musical genre. Bettencourt's array of psychotic  noodlings and noises should satisfy most guitar aficionados, but his secret  weapon is his strong sense of rhythm playing. Cherone's brazen vocals can bump  and grind through the rougher tunes, then turn around and become hauntingly  emotive. Extreme's well-rounded understanding of rock 'n' roll and  well-developed imagination bring a fresh edge to the tried-and-true form.  </P> <P> Show: Wednesday at the Roxy. JANISS GARZA  </P></p>

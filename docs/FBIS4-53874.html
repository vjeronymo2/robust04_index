			<p>BFN     [Text] On 20 May, Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel  Development Corporation (Donen) publicly disclosed for the first  time that a large amount of plutonium had adhered to equipment.    As much as 70 kilograms of plutonium stuck to equipment at  Donen's plutonium fuel plant (located in Tokaimura, Ibaraki  Prefecture).    There are 17 airtight containers, called glove boxes, in the  fuel plant. To prevent possible radiation contamination,  operators wear rubber globes and operate the equipment installed  in the containers while standing outside.    Plutonium adhesion occurred inside the glove boxes. Blackish  plutonium reportedly could be seen stuck to pipes and other  equipment. Of the 17 containers, large amounts of the  plutonium, 60 percent of the total amount, was accumulated in  two containers containing equipment to harden powder plutonium  into fuel pellets, and another container which contains machines  to grind the pellets to a unified, standard size.    Currently the container which contains the largest amount of  adhered plutonium is not in use. However, because of strong  radiation, observers studied the containers through a thick  glass wall. As a result of this, no plutonium inside the  containers was visible to the naked eye.    The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) asked the fuel  plant to reduce the amount of adhered plutonium. Measurement  error is within plus or minus 10 percent and 70 kilograms of  plutonium is involved in this case. Therefore nobody would  notice even if enough plutonium to produce an atomic bomb was  missing. Many other countries are concerned about the case and  foreign media from nine countries sent representatives to see  the containers.</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / People: Vereker moves to ODA The game of musical chairs at the top of the education department has produced another surprise move, with the appointment of John Vereker, formerly the department's head of schools, to become permanent secretary of the Overseas Development Administration. He succeeds Tim Lankester, who is moving to head the education department following the controversial departure of Sir Geoffrey Holland to become vice-chancellor of Exeter university. Vereker, 47, cut his teeth in the education department's more controversial jobs, serving as the first chairman of the Student Loans Company, established to start the gradual replacement of student grants with loans. He also defies Whitehall stereotypes by being a graduate of Keele university, albeit one who was previously educated at Marlborough college. Vereker graduated with a combined honours degree in English and political institutions. He now becomes one of Whitehall's youngest permanent secretaries, and presumably has a chance of moving eventually to be permanent secretary of the education department - both Lankester, and Sir Geoffrey's predecessor Sir John Caines moved to that job from heading the ODA. Sir Geoffrey remains sphinx-like about why he left the education department after less than a year. He moved there after five years as permanent secretary at Employment, and favoured merging his old department's responsibilities for training with the education department.</p>

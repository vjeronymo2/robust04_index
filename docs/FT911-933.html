			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tin prices forecast to rise strongly TIN PRICES will rally to Dollars 6,500 a tonne in the next six months, correct and gradually rise to Dollars 7,500 a tonne 'within the next 12 months,' according to a special report from Rudolf Wolff, the London trader, writes David Blackwell. Yesterday cash tin on the London Metal Exchange closed at Dollars 5,770 a tonne, a rise of Dollars 15 on the day. In the short term, says Wolff, any significant rally is likely to be met by a knee-jerk reaction from lower cost producers. But trade buyers willing to take a longer view will in the end force the consumer's hand, provoking forward buying. 'This will provide the market with a solid floor until confidence is restored and producers find an application for strategic hedging, which has been unnecessary for so long in the tin market.' On the supply side, Wolff expects the market imbalance to be redressed quite quickly. At present price levels Wolff estimates about 60 per cent of production is uneconomical.</p>

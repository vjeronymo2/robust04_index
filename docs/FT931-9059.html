			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bank of Osaka plans to reduce payroll by 20% THE BANK of Osaka, a leading Japanese regional bank, yesterday announced plans to reduce its workforce by about 20 per cent over the next three years in an attempt to cope with a large bad-loan burden inherited from an affiliate. The bank's difficulties are similar to those of other regional banks that rapidly expanded property lending during the late 1980s, and are now finding that they have growing problems with non-performing loans. Speculative property development was particularly frenetic on the fringes of Osaka, leaving several banks, including Hyogo Bank, based in a neighbouring prefecture, with deep financial wounds. Bank of Osaka's biggest problem has been the loose financial management at Daigin Finance, a so-called non-bank affiliate at which an estimated 40 per cent of the property loans are non-performing. The bank said that the restructuring, through which it hopes to cut expenses of about Y3bn (Dollars 24.8m) a year, would enable it to make a 'smooth rescue' of Daigin Finance. In addition to reducing its 2,100 employees through retirement and reduced recruitment, the bank is to close or consolidate eight branches and cut executive salaries and bonuses for the year to the end of March. Hanshin Bank has asked creditors not to call in loans extended to its affiliate non-bank financial institution Hanshin Sogo Finance, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Hanshin is asking about 30 financial institutions - including Sakura Bank, Industrial Bank of Japan and Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan - to maintain their loans outstanding to Hanshin Sogo over the next five years or so in order to help it improve asset quality. The bank will also increase its loans to Hanshin Sogo to Y10bn from the current Y3bn, and cut the interest rate on the loans to zero, it said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Air Force Chief of Staff Adelchi Pillinini </F> by Carlo di Risio; place and date not given: "The Odyssey of  the Air Bases"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Di Risio] How do the Armed  Forces think they can secure their priority task -- namely, with  regard to manned interceptor aircraft?    [Pillinini] The manned component of the air defense consists  today of seven squadrons of E-104S aircraft. This aircraft is  still able to provide optimal performance as a pure interceptor.  However, there is a need for an aircraft which can oppose new  generation aircraft and which has a sufficient flying range,  including via inflight refueling, and is able to operate  internationally. The arms system able to meet this requirement  has been identified in the form of the Eurofighter 2000, the  fruit of cooperation of the aircraft industries of Italy, Great  Britain, Germany, and Spain. In the program, the Air Force has  made provision for a total of 130 aircraft. And it should be  pointed out that 130 aircraft are the minimum number which are  essential in order to secure the defense of our national  airspace, compared with an "optimal" demand originally put at  165 aircraft.    The first two prototypes (the German and the English) flew  early spring, but the line can be operational only from 2002  onward. From the need to secure the continuity of the manned  aircraft defense system, where we risk a crisis of continuity  between the E-104-ASA and the E.F.-2000, there arose the demand  for a transitional solution which makes operational sense within  the new strategic context and which is feasible in our country's  present situation. We had to assess the possibility of having  aircraft available at short notice, taking account also the  effects of involving the Armed Forces with a new model of  aircraft, with its subsequent impact on equipment and all the  technical-logistical and financial repercussions. At the same  time, the Air Force and the government remained firmly resolved  to continue the Eurofighter program.    From among the solutions assessed, which involved leasing  quotas of F-15's, F-16's, and Tornado ADV's, we went for the  solution of leasing 24 Tornado ADV's from the RAF [Royal Air  Force] for 10 years (1995-2005), and operating them alongside  around 100 modified E-104-ASA's. These modifications involve  work to extend the life and improve the technical reliability of  the aircraft and the engines, and adding certain avionics  subsystems. I believe the Tornado ADV/E-104-ASAM solution,  which is the fruit of a careful and realistic examination of the  situation, is the optimal answer for the Armed Forces, from the  viewpoint of acquiring the E.F.-2000 at the beginning of the  next decade.    [Di Risio] There is a recurrent demand for economy and the  need to restructure the military instrument without delay,  making it smaller but more flexible and effective. How has the  Air Force confronted this problem, in particular in terms of air  bases?    [Pillinini] The air bases are a key element in the ability  of  the Air Force to operate. The restructuring of the Air Force,  which moreover is already under way with the scrapping of  obsolete aircraft, which have not been replaced, appeared to be  leading possibly to the closing of certain bases with obvious  potential management savings.    In fact, after careful examination, this proved impossible,  given that the majority of our airports lack sufficient  reception capacity for the units which continue to exist.  Increasing such reception capacity would require considerable  resources for expropriating land, the construction of new  infrastructures, and so on, involving investments which today  are certainly not possible. Moreover, certain of our airports  are open to civilian traffic.    Despite this, we are working to transfer the combat units  from certain airports (Brindisi, Rimini, and Treviso) which are  now completely enclosed by residential areas. However, we have  to continue to keep the structures and services in these  airports operational. Finally, we decided that the 24 air bases  in operation today can be reduced to 20, but we will not achieve  any savings unless we can close and abandon the installations  for good.    [Di Risio] The 46th Airborne Brigade, stationed at Pisa, is  being committed more and more frequently during operations,  often very far from Italy, in ever less safe operating theaters  (Somalia, Mozambique, Yemen, Rwanda). Within this delicate  operating sector, which is seeing Italy involved in the  international arena, what is the present situation of Air  Transportation and what are the programs for confronting future  needs?    [Pillinini] The importance of transport aircraft has been  recognized unambiguously in the New Defense Model itself which,  against a background of general cuts in personnel and resources,  provides for a significant increase in the transportation fleet.    Right now, however, we can count on a line of G-222's which,  even though available in sufficient number and ideal in certain  climatic conditions, does not meet the demands of medium- to  long-range transport, and on a series of C-130 "Hercules,"  available in a fairly limited number but which is also able to  meet long-range needs.    In the short term, there are no plans for acquiring new  aircraft and we will therefore continue to operate with the same  craft, which will, however, require technical work in the form  of a midlife modernization.    Work is going ahead on a new aircraft, the "Future Large  Aircraft" (FLA), in which Germany, France, and the other  European countries are also interested, and which ought to  respond to our global transportation demands. Assuming the  program is continued, the aircraft will not, however, be  available before the second half of the next decade. In the  intervening period, a buffer solution will perhaps have to be  sought in this area as well.    [Di Risio] Why is compensation slow at being imposed in the  case of aerial incidents involving the civilian population?    [Pillinini] Compensation for damage in the case of aerial  incidents involving the civilian population involves extremely  delicate and difficult themes. It is true, right now there are  people who have suffered damage who have not been compensated,  or only partially.    In the present state of affairs, the complexity of the  administrative procedure in force for defining compensation for  damages by means of individual settlements renders pointless the  considerable amount of committed work undertaken by the Defense  Ministry's Directorate General for Disputes, generating a large  number of disagreements and polemics, including suits for  damages. The time periods involved are considerably lengthened  if the damaged parties, instead of respecting the proposed  settlements, prefer to take recourse to the Civil Judicial  Authorities, or if the families of the victims put in private  claims for damages, alongside the prosecution.    In this direction the Air Force General Staff has since 1986  been committed to promoting Law No. 424 of 27 October 1993  which, as from 1 January 1986, provides, within a relatively  short time frame, for intervention to assist citizens and  victims of incidents occurring during operational and training  activities.    We believe that it is now necessary to align our legislation  without delay with that of the most advanced nations, through  organic reform of the legislation governing the consequences of  such incidents, with provisions for a procedure for paying  compensation for damage within a shorter time frame. In this  respect we are undertaking certain detailed examinations in  order to make operating proposals. At the same time, it would  be a good thing to provide better legal aid and assistance to  the military personnel involved in carrying out activities  connected with the Armed Forces institutional tasks.    In this regard it would be desirable, within the present  legislative period, to approve an initiative, presented in 1979  and proposed again during the present legislative period by  Senator Savio, based on which -- while maintaining the principle  of compensation by the state for damage to private individuals  -- the responsibility of military personnel involved in  incidents to pay compensation out of their own pocket be limited  to cases of intent to cause damage or serious fault, with  military personnel defended free-of-charge in court by the State  Attorney's Office or by a freely chosen attorney of confidence,  subject to recourse by the administration where liability for  malicious incident is ascertained.</p>

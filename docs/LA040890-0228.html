			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS '90;  </P> <P> PROFILING THE NEWCOMERS  </P> <P> MARK EICHHORN  </P> <P> Age: 29  </P> <P> Position: Pitcher  </P> <P> Major league experience: Three years, 112 days  </P> <P> How obtained: Signed as free agent, Dec. 19, 1989.  </P> <P> Pertinent stats: Was successful at triple-A Richmond last season, going 1-0  with a 1.32 ERA and 19 saves, but struggled at Atlanta.  </P> <P> Comments: Eichhorn has had a history of shoulder problems but when healthy, the  right-hander who has a side arm, Kent Tekulve-like delivery, can be effective  against right-handed hitters. He had two good seasons at Toronto in 1986 and  '87 but has spent most of his 11-year professional career in the minor leagues.  He will be used as a set-up man in late-inning situations.  </P></p>

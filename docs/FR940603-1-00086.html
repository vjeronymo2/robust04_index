			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> TM&hyph;12. The unit is 1,000 feet in length and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) feet in width (to be measured  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) feet on one side of pole line or centerline of structures) of actual clearing of right-of-way. This includes clearing of underbrush, tree removal, and such tree trimming as is required so that the right-of-way, except for tree stumps which shall not exceed  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  in height, shall be clear from the ground up on one side of the line poles carrying conductors. (See Detail A, Drawing TM&hyph;12&hyph;2A). The length of actual clearing shall be measured in a straight line parallel to the horizontal line between poles or centerline of structures and across the maximum dimension of foliage cleared projected to the ground line (See Detail B, Drawing TM&hyph;12&hyph;2A). All trees and underbrush across the width of the right-of-way shall be considered to be grouped together as a single length in measuring the total length of clearing (See Detail C, Drawing TM&hyph;12&hyph;2A). Spaces along the right-of-way in which no trees are to be removed or trimmed or underbrush cleared shall be omitted from the total measurement. All length thus arrived at, added together and divided by 1,000 shall give the number of TM&hyph;12 units of clearing. The Contractor shall not remove or trim shade, fruit or ornamental trees unless so directed by the Engineer in writing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TM&hyph;12 (1). This unit is identical with TM&hyph;12, except the full width of the right-of-way to be cleared shall be  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) feet wide (to be measured  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) feet on each side of the pole line or centerline of structures) (See Detail D, Drawing TM&hyph;12&hyph;2A.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TMC&hyph;12, TMC&hyph;12 (1). These units are identical to the respective TM units except that chemical treatment of stumps is required in addition to the clearing of underbrush, tree removal and tree trimming.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TM&hyph;13. The unit, for purpose of quoting, is 1,000 feet in length of clearing off the right-of-way. The Engineer will select those trees of the right-of-way that he deems to be a hazard to the line and will designate them to the Contractor in writing as danger trees. When so designated, the Contractor shall remove or top such trees at his option except that the Contractor shall trim and not remove shade, fruit or ornamental trees unless otherwise directed by the Engineer in writing (See Drawings TM&hyph;12&hyph;2A and TM&hyph;13 for examples of danger trees).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The measurement of length of right-of-way to be cleared shall be considered as a straight line parallel to the horizontal line between poles or centerline of structures, such measurement of length to be based on maximum dimension of foliage (not trunk) projected to the ground line (See Details E, F, G, and H, Drawing TM&hyph;12&hyph;2A). Dead trees having no foliage shall be measured across the maximum dimension and multiplied by two. (See Detail F, Drawing TM&hyph;12&hyph;2A). Each tree so removed shall be added together to determine the total length of clearing. All length thus arrived at, added together and divided by 1,000 shall give the number of TM&hyph;13 units (Example: Details E, F, G, and H, Drawing TM&hyph;12&hyph;2A, total .1 of a TM&hyph;13 unit).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TM&hyph;14.

Trees and underbrush should be cleared from the ground up within 10 feet of any structure location. The Engineer will mark the trees and brush to be cleared to provide ``undulating'' boundaries. Low growing trees and brush are to be left in the right-of-way to the extent it will not be hazardous to the line or will not interfere with the access road.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The length of actual clearing shall be measured in a straight line parallel to the horizontal line between poles or center line of structures and across the maximum dimension of foliage cleared projected to the ground line (See Detail B, Drawing TM&hyph;12&hyph;2A).

Trees and underbrush should be cleared from ground up within 10 feet of any structure location. The Engineer will mark the trees and brush to be cleared to provide a ``feathered'' appearance in the right-of-way.

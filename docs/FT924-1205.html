			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Malaysian sultans may have scored own goal: How a bad-tempered hockey match threatens to lead to a constitutional crisis LIKE an approaching tropical storm, the early rumblings of a constitutional crisis are being heard in Malaysia. At issue is the role of the sultans - Malaysia's royalty - in the nation's life. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the country's tough-talking prime minister, seems determined to tackle the privileged world of the country's nine sultans, who take turns as king. The present problems were originally caused by a hockey game. A son of the Sultan of Johor, one of Malaysia's richest states, was playing against another state team. He is alleged to have assaulted the opposition goalkeeper and as a result, was banned from playing for five years. Johor hockey teams were then withdrawn from various tournaments, apparently on the orders of the sultan. A Johor hockey coach, Mr Douglas Gomez, spoke out against the ban and was summoned to the sultan's palace in Johor. There, he told police, he was given a lecture by courtiers on royal etiquette and how to ask the sultan's forgiveness. He was then ushered into the sultan's presence and surrounded by a group of men, including military police. Mr Gomez said the sultan became angry and assaulted him. The coach later underwent medical treatment. Malaysia's sultans have little political power, but they are one of the symbols of Malay and Islamic identity in the country and as such still have influence, particularly in rural, mainly Malay, areas. Under Malaysia's constitution, the sultans cannot be brought before a court of law. Dr Mahathir says sultans should not be above the law in cases where people have been beaten up or murdered. The government says constitutional amendments doing away with the royalty's legal immunity will be tabled within a month. However, any such amendments have to be approved by a Council of Rulers  - consisting of the sultans themselves. If the sultans refuse to adopt the changes a constitutional crisis will be the inevitable outcome. Yesterday Mr Abu Talib Othman, attorney general, was quoted as saying he was confident the sultans would support the move to end their immunity. Earlier this year the government tried to make the royals agree to a code of conduct which forbade their interference in business or political affairs. But the code is not legally binding and a number of sultans, the Sultan of Johor included, have not signed it. Ten years ago a constitutional crisis was provoked by the king's refusal to give the royal assent to constitutional amendments introduced by Dr Mahathir's government. The changes would have limited royal power but increased that of the prime minister. In the event both sides were forced to find a compromise. Dr Mahathir now feels in a stronger position. Malaysia, with its strong economic growth, is becoming a more urban society. The sultans have little influence in the towns and cities. People are perhaps becoming more cynical about their erstwhile rulers. Many of the sultans are very rich. Some have thousands of acres of valuable timber concessions. The Sultan of Johor not only owns industrial development land in his own fast-developing state, but is also one of the biggest landowners in neighbouring Singapore. In addition to their private wealth, the sultans receive handsome government stipends. The Johor Sultan even has his own small army - paid for out of central government funds. While the various business dealings and marital affairs of the sultans are the subject of much private gossip, any open criticism of the royalty has in the past been very carefully regulated. Suddenly the palace gates have been thrown open. Government ministers, led by Dr Mahathir, have unleashed a barrage of criticism against the Johor Sultan. The media, given the green light by the government, have joined in. Earlier this year the sultan of one state imported an expensive Italian sports car. It was impounded at customs, pending payment of MDollars 2.1m (Pounds 560,000) in import duties. The sultan concerned went to the customs, told the officials he was taking the car for a test drive - and drove it back to his palace. Though the government says the matter has now been settled, the sultan has insisted he has not paid, and does not intend to pay, any of the import duties. The national news agency says a taboo on the reporting of royal abuses has been lifted. 'Malaysia's rulers are living in absolute luxury even by the standards of the British royal family, whose members are not only generally more well-behaved but also lead a less lavish lifestyle and are more conscious of the money they are taking from the privy purse,' said the agency. Some years ago one of the sultans said Malaysia's royalty had to maintain its credibility or the day might come when it would be condemned to the museum. A bad-tempered hockey game may have brought that day considerably closer.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Observer: Talent time-bomb South Africa's President F. W. de Klerk may make many boasts about his country. But one thing that should bother him is the surprisingly large numbers of ex-South Africans now holding positions of influence and power in the City of London. Their loss to South Africa represents a time bomb that won't be defused until it properly develops the talents of its majority population. Its 5m whites compare with Australia's 17m and Canada's 25m. Yet neither of the other two anywhere near match South Africa in supplying UK institutions with senior abilities. Besides the famous Sir Michael Edwardes, they include Sir Sydney Lipworth (chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission) and Sir Mark Weinberg (former chairman of Allied Dunbar). The latter pair, both lawyers, are old boys of Johannesburg's King Edward VII school. Among the next generation are Eurotunnel's Sir Alastair Morton, Morgan Grenfell's chairman John Craven, and Schroders' Win Bischoff. If one counts Zimbabweans as well, there is Andrew Tuckey, chairman of Baring Brothers. Simon, his elder brother is a QC and chairman of the the review panel of the financial reporting council, and younger brother James, is managing director of MEPC. There are numerous reasons, political besides financial, why such people come to the City. But why South Africans make better businessmen than Canadians or Australians would call for a doctoral thesis.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> That is, the Iowa proposal retains the provision of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(b)(2) that requires the regulatory authority to notify the involved parties of its decision on the bond release application ``[w]ithin 60 days from the filing of the bond release application *&blank;*&blank;*'' However, under the proposed revision, once an application is submitted, and allowance is made for: (1) The permittee obtaining a notice of completeness; (2) the permittee's 30-day time frame for placing the newspaper advertisement; (3) the running of the advertisement of four successive weeks; and (4) the permittee's 30 day time frame for submitting a copy of the advertisement to the regulatory authority, it would be virtually impossible for the regulatory authority to ever comply with the 60-day notification requirement of 30 CFR 800.40(b)(2). Therefore, the Director finds Iowa's proposed rule at 27&hyph;40.51(7) is less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(a)(2) and is not approving it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  23. IAC 27&hyph;40.63(207) and (2), Contemporaneous Reclamation, Backfilling and Grading Time and Distance Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Iowa proposes, at IAC 27&hyph;40.63(207), to incorporate by reference the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 816 as they were in effect on July 1, 1992. This would include the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 816.101 concerning backfilling and grading time and distance requirements. The Federal regulation at 30 CFR 816.101 was suspended on July 31, 1992 (57 FR 33874), in compliance with a Joint Stipulation of Dismissal dated April 16, 1992, entered by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Coal Association and American Mining Congress  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. Department of the Interior, et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Civil No. 92&hyph;0408&hyph;CRR. The impact of this suspension is that all coal mining operations are subject to the State-specific contemporaneous reclamation rules currently in effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, Iowa, at IAC 27&hyph;40.63(2), proposes to delete the last sentence of 30 CFR 816.100, concerning contemporaneous reclamation, from its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR Part 816, and replace it with the requirement that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Contemporaneous reclamation shall not exceed 180 days following coal removal and shall not be more than four spoil ridges behind the pit being worked, the spoil from the active pit being considered the first ridge. The regulatory authority may grant additional time for rough backfilling and grading if the permittee can demonstrate, through a detailed written analysis under 30 CFR 780.18(b)(3), that additional time is necessary. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the Federal provision at 30 CFR 816.100 only contains one sentence, the Director interprets Iowa's intent to be a complete deletion of the Federal provision at 30 CFR 816.100. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: J. P. Morgan raises Dollars 1bn for private equity fund J. P. MORGAN, the US banking group, announced yesterday it had raised more than Dollars 1bn for its Corsair Partnership, a new private equity fund that will make strategic investments in banking companies in the US and worldwide. The blue-chip New York bank has invested Dollars 100m of its own money into the fund, giving it the largest single stake. The rest of the Dollars 1bn has come from 46 different partners, including financial institutions, pension funds, public and private companies, wealthy individuals and small investment partnerships. Mr Nick Paumgarten, a J. P. Morgan managing director and chairman of Corsair, said the fund planned to invest minority stakes in undervalued banks that have an existing management team and business plan, but which need of fresh capital. Each investment will be made with the full support of bank managements, and Corsair will not seek to control or acquire the banks in which it invests, although it will offer access J. P. Morgan's banking expertise. J. P. Morgan may be taking a gamble with Corsair, because it is entering a relatively crowded market. Other similar investment partnerships, run by such big guns of investment banking as Goldman Sachs, Lazard Freres and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, have been taking private equity stakes in banks for several years. Many of these partnerships have enjoyed large returns from their investments, primarily because US banks reached a trough in terms of performance and capital strength more than two years ago, and the industry has been steadily recovering ever since. Mr Paumgarten admits that Corsair is arriving late on the scene, but believes there are 'incredible' investment opportunities outside the US, particularly in parts of Europe and the Far East.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Manchester United plans to expand stadium Manchester United yesterday confirmed plans to expand the capacity of its Old Trafford stadium by 22 per cent to 54,000. The company refused to reveal how it would finance the expansion or how much it would cost, saying the application for planning consent was only a preliminary step. It is expected to use part of its Pounds 13.6m cash reserves to fund the development and acquisition of adjacent land. Shareholders, however, will be asked to reconfirm the directors right to launch a rights issue, according to the annual report published yesterday. The accounts also showed that Mr Martin Edwards, chief executive, received a 23 per cent pay increase from Pounds 174,000 to Pounds 214,000 in the year to July 31.</p>

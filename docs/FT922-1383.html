			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Company News: OMV facing sharp drop in earnings OMV, the Austrian oil company, is facing a sharp drop in 1992 earnings following a loss in the first five months of the year. The company, which is majority-controlled by the state holding group Austrian Industries (AI), is said to have suffered a Sch100m (Dollars 9m) shortfall in the January-May period, mostly because of losses at its plastics subsidiary PCD. The fiscal year's poor start could cut the full-year operating profit to about Sch1bn from Sch1.7bn last year, which would damage AI's chances to undertake its scheduled initial public stock flotation in 1993, industry sources say. OMV generates nearly half of its parent company's annual earnings. An OMV spokesman declined to confirm the figures, which were reported in the Austrian press. For the first quarter, OMV reported a loss of Sch300m, but the company's results usually improve in the course of the year. Industry sources say OMV still aims for an operating profit of Sch1.5bn for 1992, which would permit the company to keep its dividend at Sch20 a share.</p>

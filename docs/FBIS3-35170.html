			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nasim Barhum: "A Slight Security Setback"] </F>   [Text] Unidentified people have sent two shocking messages  to Jordan, in Beirut and Amman respectively. It is unlikely,  however, that the country will be engulfed in a cycle of  violence.    Only a few weeks ago, Jordan was one of the most stable Arab  countries, despite isolated events over the past two or three  years. But early in February, Jordan was hit by a cycle of  violence that had disturbed some Arab countries. In just one  week two explosions rocked two movie theaters: in Amman on 27  January and in al-Zarqa', the second-largest city, on 1  February. Also, unidentified gunmen assassinated 'Umran  al-Ma'ayitah, first secretary at the Jordanian embassy, in  Beirut.    What has given rise to fears in Arab and Jordanian circles  is  that the security problems have been the result of two factors:  first, the emergence of a crisis in Jordanian-Iranian relations,  when Amman asked Tehran to withdraw 21 Iranian diplomats from  the embassy in Amman. And, second, the official Jordanian  announcement that the perpetrators were "Jordanian Afghans"  [reference to Jordanians who fought in Afghanistan]. The  connection between the security problems and the crisis with  Iran and the Arab Afghans gives the situation a political  dimension that triggers fears.    Although Jordan has not officially announced that there is a  crisis with Iran, and Tehran radio has denied any crisis between  the two countries, the Jordanian request for the withdrawal of  21 Iranian diplomats could reflect Jordanian indignation,  according to political circles in Amman. They say that the  Jordanian authorities accuse Iranian diplomats of meeting with  Jordanian Muslim extremists.    Western sources in Amman say that Jordan is not happy with  the presence of Iranian ambassador in Amman Ahmad Dastmalchian,  who is a former Iranian Revolution guard and played a  significant role in establishing Lebanon's Hizballah. However,  this has not yet been confirmed.    At any rate, the diplomatic crisis between the two countries  is not the only explanation for the outbreak of violence in  Jordan. Other circles link these acts to the big strides that  Jordan has made on the road to peace. The events occurred a  week after King Husayn announced in Washington that he is ready  to meet in public with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.  Other circles, however, believe that the incidents were linked,  that is, the crisis with Iran coincided with the Jordanian  monarch's announcement.    The question is: Are these isolated events transient or are  they a prelude to an era of violence in Jordan? This is a  particularly important question after the strongly worded  statement by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' that  Jordan's political options could affect its internal stability.    It is difficult to answer this question. However, it is most  unlikely that the situation in Jordan will become as serious as  in some countries, such as in the Arab east or Arab Maghreb.  This is because the acts of violence in Algeria, and in a less  critical degree in Egypt, are prompted by difficult economic  conditions and unemployment. This, however, is not the case in  Jordan because the economic situation there is not that bad.  Some people even say that the Jordanian economy has improved  over the past two years. This is explained in the retreat of  the Islamic movement in the recent legislative elections, when  it won only 18 out of 81 seats in the parliament. The movement  had 32 seats in the past.    Furthermore, the Islamic movement in Jordan is different  from  that in Algeria or Egypt. It is a movement that has never  resorted to violence and has accepted functioning in accordance  with the democratic game. The Islamic movement in Jordan has  continuously maintained good relations with authorities.    Hence, perhaps this cycle of violence is a transient wave  linked to specific tactics by certain regional and local forces,  unless there are plans to involve Jordan in the acts of violence.    It is premature to assess the events in Jordan. It is also  difficult to say that the storm is over or that it will assume  different shapes. What has happened should alert us, but it  does not require us to reconsider our stances. What has  happened cannot be more than a slight setback linked to certain  tactics that are not aimed at sabotaging the strategic stability  of Jordan, which represents an important link in the peace  process.</p>

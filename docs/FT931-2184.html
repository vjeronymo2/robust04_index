			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Tokyo market shines out of the gloom: Experts are at a loss to explain the surge EVEN Mr Hidenobu Sasaki, the eccentric but popular stock market analyst, is at a loss to explain it. Surrounded by an array of astrological charts at Nikko Securities, Mr Sasaki, famed in Japan for his Buddhist-inspired analysis of the stock market, admits he cannot explain the surge in the Tokyo market over the past three weeks. Stockbrokers return to work this morning amid an atmosphere of nervous anticipation. For more than three years the market had slid, with trading volumes contracting. If the rally of the past few weeks continues unabated this week, Tokyo could move above 19,000, touching levels it has not reached for months. The backdrop for the rally could hardly be gloomier. Companies are preparing to announce what for most will be their third consecutive year of declining profits. Last week the government announced that the economy grew by only 1.5 per cent last year, the slowest rate of growth for 18 years, largely because domestic demand is still feeble. Meanwhile, Japan's political leadership is again under the shadow of a political scandal, involving tax evasion by Mr Shin Kanemaru, until recently godfather of the ruling Liberal Democratic party. Yet the stock market has thrived in the face of this economic and political adversity. The index has risen by 10 per cent over the past two weeks to close last Friday at 18,537.17. Just as significantly, trading volumes have surged to levels unseen since the late 1980s. A daily average of 550m shares were traded over the fortnight, 2.3 times higher than last month's average figure. But if the facts are clear, the causes are not. Mr Sasaki and more conventional analysts cannot agree on whether the market's revival is the product of clever government intervention or whether prices have ended their three-year slump. Could the surge be a long-awaited harbinger of a revival in the rest of the economy? Politics has had a huge impact on the market. The government is steering banks and life assurers away from selling shares. It has also pumped in money from public pension funds. The passage of the 1993 budget through the lower house of the parliament cleared the way for the LDP to begin work on another stimulatory package for the economy. All the signs are that it should be larger than the Y10,700bn programme introduced last summer. Some LDP officials have suggested a further Y6,000bn could be devoted to stock buying. In addition, the performance of one stock, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the partly state-owned telecommunications group, has driven the market higher. The LDP has suggested that NTT may be allowed to raise its charges, which should boost its profits. The company is also cutting costs with an aggressive restructuring programme. The Bank of Japan has also played its part with a cut in its official discount rate to an historic low of 2.5 per cent. This is benefiting equities; as Mr Yuichi Kohashi at Daiwa Securities says: 'Low interest rates are pushing liquidity into the markets.' Brokers say the government's support may have sparked genuine buying. Foreign investors, scared of missing the recovery, have rushed in. For the week ending March 19, overseas investors bought a net Y304bn, the largest net purchase since the second week in February 1991. How long will the rally last? Mr Hideo Sakamaki, president of Nomura Securities, at the weekend told 400 of his managers the stock market surge was anticipating a recovery in the economy as a whole. Many analysts are not so sure. The economy still looks weak. Projections for corporate profits suggest that earnings will fall for the year to next March, the fourth consecutive year of decline, which would be a post-war record. Once companies close their books at the end of the month, they will not need higher stock prices to boost the value of the securities holdings on their balance sheets. Many analysts expect that after that the stock market will shed some of its recent gains, mainly because of the political timetable. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, must convince the US government, which is unhappy with Japan's surging trade surplus, that the package will stimulate the economy's demand for imports. The package, due to be announced before Mr Miyazawa sets off to Washington in the middle of next month, could mark the end of the good news on economic policy for a while, so some analysts are telling clients to be ready to sell. As Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel, puts it: 'Sell as Mr Miyazawa steps on the plane.'</p>

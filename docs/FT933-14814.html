			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Thai air force sees chance for power at airline THE THAI air force has been given an unexpected opportunity to try to reassert control over Thai International Airways, the country's flag carrier following the sudden death last week of its chairman, Mr Pandit Bunyapana. Thai's vice-chairman, Air Chief Marshal Gun Pimarntip, has clearly signalled that the air force which he heads should decide who replaces Mr Pandit as chairman. Air Chief Marshal Gun threatened to resign in February because the air force was being given little say in running the company. Thai International was an air force fiefdom until the military's fall from grace last year following its unsuccessful but bloody attempt to maintain control of the government. Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, who had been chairman until then, was replaced by Mr Pandit, permanent secretary at the Finance Ministry which is the majority shareholder. Mr Pandit apparently died in his sleep of a heart attack last Thursday while on a Thai International flight from London to Bangkok. Manoeuvring to replace Mr Pandit has been complicated by the retirement this year of Air Chief Marshal Gun himself and the airline's respected president, Mr Chatrachai Bunya-ananta. Joining the faction-ridden management, the Finance Ministry and the air force in the tussle for control of Thai has been an ambitious deputy transport and communications minister, Mr Thawee Kraiupti, who has led a crusade for the carrier to be brought under his ministry's jurisdiction. One airline analyst in Bangkok said: 'It's a four-way fight for control which - by the end of the decade - the management will have won because Thai will never be competitive in the long run without independent professional management. The question is how painful the process is going to be.' A minority of the airline's shares was floated in July 1993. It has struggled in recent years under the weight of previous management mistakes and over-optimism. Profits for the latest half-year were Bt568.4m (Pounds 14.85m) compared with Bt1.31bn in 1992. Many brokers say full year profits will be little more than Bt2bn - around a third of the company's original forecasts. Thai International's share price has risen 22 per cent over five days, hitting its 10 per cent daily limit rise over each of the last two trading sessions, to close at Bt49.75 yesterday.</p>

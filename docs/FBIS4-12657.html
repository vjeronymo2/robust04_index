			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, April 11 (AFP) --  Another 10 Palestinians deported by Israel are set to return to  the occupied territories next week, a PLO official told AFP on  Monday [11 April].    "Our delegation in Cairo told me Israel was going to allow  10  deportees to come back next week," said Rashid Abu-Shibak.    Israel, which has expelled about 1,700 Palestinians since  1967, allowed 49 Palestinians to return to the territories last  week.    Abu-Shibak was sent back to Gaza by the PLO last week to  oversee the handover of official buildings as the Israelis  pull-back.    Israeli military officials said they were unaware of any  decision to allow another group of deportees to return.</p>

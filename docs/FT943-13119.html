			<p>940721 FT  21 JUL 94 / Malaysia to lift trade ban The Malaysian government is poised to announce a lifting of the ban on UK participation in government contracts, Robert Peston writes. The ban was imposed in February partly because of Malaysian government fury with British press coverage of the Pergau dam affair. 'We believe the embargo could be lifted tomorrow,' said a banker close to the Malaysian government. UK businessmen with Malaysian interests are convinced the embargo will be removed by the end of July. The Malaysian government yesterday refused to comment.</p>

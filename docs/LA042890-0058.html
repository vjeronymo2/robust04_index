			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND AT AFI FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> SUNDAY  </P> <P> Following are The Times' recommendations for today's and Sunday's schedule of  the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival, with  commentary by the film reviewing staff.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 480-3232 or (213) 520-2000.  </P> <P> Highly recommended:  </P> <P> "LARKS ON A STRING"(Czechoslovakia, 1969; Director: Jiri Menzel; Fairfax, 8:45  p.m.). The most famous banned film in the Hollywood Glasnost section, "Larks"  surfaced after two decades to share the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film  Festival. I prefer it to his 1966 Oscar-winner, "Closely Watched Trains."  Deceptively light and sunny, buoyant and dangerously lyrical, it's a romantic  comedy about a group of bourgeois Czechs and their postwar political  re-education in a wildly picturesque scrapheap. It's a movie that sings.  (Michael Wilmington)  </P></p>

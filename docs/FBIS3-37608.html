To quote Filatov, in individual regions strong efforts are  being made to preserve the Soviet system of authority.  Moreover, the local executive bodies are under the pressure of  the representative ones.    Asked about the possibility of postponing elections to local  bodies, Filatov told Interfax that the presidential decree on  reorganizing the local authoritative and self-government bodies,  according to which local elections must be held in the first  quarter of the year, should be made more flexible.    The implementation of this document demonstrated, said  Filatov, that individual regions should work out their own  election schedule. If the local conditions demand that elections  be held in June or in autumn, such elections should be held  during these periods. He expressed hope that the most vitally  important problems arising in society would be analyzed by the  Public Chamber and recommendations would be given to the  president and government on ways of adjusting their work and  taking more reasonable decisions.    He said no one should fear lest the Public Chamber, a  consultative body, might juxtapose itself to the Federal  Assembly. This is a normal international practice whereby public  forces gather at a round table and express their views on the  most essential state problems. This is going to be the  president's public relations agency, he said.</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Germany In its predictably sniffy way, the Bundesbank was quick to stress the distortion in January's 2.3 per cent fall in M3 money supply. It has a case. The base on which the figure rests is the average money supply for the final quarter of last year when it was bloated by currency intervention. In January, some of that excess drained out of the money market. That creates a ready excuse for not bringing forward any official rate cuts. Equally, though, the bank is running out of reasons for holding tight much longer. The year has started off with such a fall that money growth will probably be below target for two or three months at least. Excessive growth of M3 was a useful justification for tight money when the Bundesbank was also worried about the budget deficit and wage growth. Its anxiety about the former is unlikely to abate much in the foreseeable future, but with the real economy weakening rapidly, pressure for lower rates is increasing. One by one, the arguments against are falling away. The threat to German import prices of a stronger dollar looks less after yesterday's congressional testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan. He showed no sign of putting up US interest rates again. Next week could see German consumer price inflation drop as February figures become available from the regions. Even so, the Bundesbank may wait to see a trend. To emphasise its caution, it also chose to downplay January's sharp year-on-year deceleration in bank lending to the private sector. Instead, officials point to total bank lending growth of 8.5 per cent in the six months to January. They seem determined to hold out till the last.</p>

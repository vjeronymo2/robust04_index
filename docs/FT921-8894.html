			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers move to prevent register  -Council tax THE POWER of local author-ities to canvass residents will be restricted by the government in amendments to the council tax bill to be published today. The move reflects government concern that the council tax should not be accompanied by a register as the poll tax was. Though some local authorities have warned that a register will be needed to enable them to administer the largely property-based tax, the decision to limit the ability to question residents was taken after consultation with the local authority associations. Mr Michael Portillo, local government minister, said the amendment would stop authorities setting up a council-tax register by using their existing powers under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976, which enables them to survey owners and occupiers in their areas. Instead, they would be able to seek information only about who in each household was the person liable to pay the tax and ask households to say if they qualify for discounts. Ministers emphasised that local authorities would not necessarily need to make both inquiries of every household, since they would already have a good deal of information. They suggested that many councils might wish to make the inquiries only where they had to pursue non-payment. Proposed changes in the bill will also enable the government to make regulations putting beyond doubt the use of computer evidence in cases of non-payment of the poll tax. The bill will be discussed by the Lords at the beginning of next week and is expected to become law early in March. Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, brushed aside protests from opposition MPs yesterday at the government's decision to impose a guillotine on the local government bill which extends compulsory competitive tendering and sets up a commission to review the structure of local government. The move will ensure that the bill can become law within the next few weeks.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 25 (CNA) -- The domestic money supply  grew at a faster-than-expected pace in May, causing concern  among senior finance officials. The annual growth rates of the  three major indices measuring the domestic money supply M1A, M1B  and M2 reached 11.45 percent, 16.5 percent and 15.73 percent  respectively in May, all higher than the April levels, according  to statistics released by the Central Bank of China (CBC)  Saturday [25 June].    The M1A and M1B growth rates reached three-month highs,  while  the broadly-defined M2 growth rate was at its highest level  since April 1993, when the rate hit 16.5 percent. May's M2 and  M1B growth rates also exceeded the CBC-set 15 percent ceiling.    CBC Governor Liang Kuo-shu said the central bank has begun  open-market operations to control the growth of domestic money  supply. "We believe that through our open-market operations, the  M2 annual growth rate will fall below the 15-percent ceiling in  June," he said.    CBC Deputy Governor Chiu Cheng-hsiung attributed the high  money supply growth rate for May in part to increased bank loans  to manufacturers during the month. As local banks still have  huge excess reserves, Chiu said, the central bank will intensify  open-market operations to retrieve idle funds from the banking  system to staunch money-supply growth. "We'll continue  monitoring the domestic financial situation closely and will  take necessary steps to keep the M2, M1A, and M1B growth rates  within 10 to 15 percent," he added.    M2 is the broadest measure of a country's total money stock,  comprising currency in circulation, checking and demand deposits  as well as quasi-money (including time deposits and Treasury  bills). The narrowly-defined M1A comprises cash in circulation  and deposits in demand and checking accounts, while M1B  comprises M1A plus passbook savings deposits.</p>

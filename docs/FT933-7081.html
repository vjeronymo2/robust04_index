			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Marking the French test France's decision first to cut and then suspend its overnight lending rate shows its markets are returning to normal after the ERM crisis. With luck, it may now be possible to complete that process by cutting the five-to-10 day lending rate. But France will only be breaking new ground when it starts cutting its intervention rate, which sets an effective floor for the money market. For that, the authorities will probably still keep at least half an eye on developments beyond the Rhine. August inflation figures for Baden-Wurttemberg will today give an indication of the Bundesbank's room to cut interest rates this week. A monthly price rise of 0.2 percentage points or less might prompt a small cut in the German discount rate. That could allow France to cut its own intervention rate without jeopardising the franc. But with year-on-year inflation above 4 per cent, the Bundesbank may yet do nothing at all. As long as France clings to the vestiges of its strong currency policy, that would be awkward. All the more so since the change at the top of the Bundesbank, and a money supply bloated by intervention, means a period looms when further German rate cuts will be difficult. Thus far, exchange markets have welcomed successive cuts in France's overnight rate. Any interruption to the process may see them again worrying about economic recovery. If the franc is to be weak anyway, the French economy might as well enjoy lower interest rates as well.</p>

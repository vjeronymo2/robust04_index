			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Reduced offer for Coats offshoot AN INTERNATIONAL investor group has reduced its bid for Consoltex, the Montreal-based fabric maker, from CDollars 38 to CDollars 33 per share and Coats Viyella, which has owned 81 per cent of the Canadian company for the past decade, has said this was fair value and it would accept. In February, Consoltex reported 1990 profits of CDollars 9m (Pounds 4.54m), or CDollars 3.14 per share, on sales of CDollars 169m, up slightly from 1989. At that time the investor group was willing to pay CDollars 38 per share. Coats stood to collect to well over CDollars 110m. However, in the first quarter of this year, Consoltex incurred losses of CDollars 596,000, or 20 cents per share (profits of CDollars 2.7m, or 95 cents per share). Sales dipped 25 per cent to CDollars 34m. Federal and Quebec sales taxes were applied to apparel for the first time on January 1, causing a deep decline in clothing sales and thus fabric sales. Consoltex expects some improvement in the rest of the year as interest rates come down and the economy picks up steam. The old offer was withdrawn and 'a revised investor group' made the new offer, subject to 90 per cent acceptance, said Coats and Consoltex. Details will be mailed early in May. Consoltex would not reveal the principals behind the investor group.</p>

The selection of a grantee institution will depend on program substance, cross-cultural sensitivity and ability to carry out the program successfully.

Preference will be given to the most competitive budget proposals. Qualified organizations with less than four years of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are limited to grants of $60,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A comprehensive line item budget should be submitted with the proposal by the application deadline.

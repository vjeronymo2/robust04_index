			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following are summaries of media  reports on economic developments in Hong Kong monitored by Hong  Kong Bureau between 20 January and 8 February 1994. Source  information is given in parentheses at the end of each item or  is provided in the body of the item.  <H3>  HONG KONG INVESTMENT IN THE PRC:  FEATURE: More Mainland Companies Prepare To List in  Hong Kong </H3>   At a seminar in Wuhan, representatives of the second batch  of  mainland companies to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and  officials of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC)  met to discuss listing procedures, according to an article by  Christine Chan on page 1 of the 27 January edition of the SOUTH  CHINA MORNING POST (BUSINESS POST). Among those listing is the  Wuhan-based steel giant Wuhan Iron and Steel (Wugang), which is  expected to be the largest listing of a Chinese company thus  far, eclipsing Maanshan Iron and Steel's HK$3.93 billion (Hong  Kong dollars) listing in November 1993. Maanshan's chairman,  Hang Yongyi, was invited to speak at the conference to pass on  his experience of listing in Hong Kong.    Of those expected to list, four are power supply companies:  Huaneng International Power Development, Huaneng Electricity  (Shandong), Datang Power Plant, and Shandong Power Plant. In  addition, Harbin Power Plant Equipment and Northeast Electric  Transmission and Transformation Equipment make power plant  equipment, cables, and transformers for the electricity supply  industry. Airline and transportation companies are also  represented by China Eastern Airlines and China Southern  Airlines, as is the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway, which is  expected to raise up to HK$400 million.    In a series of articles on pages one and two of the 28  January edition of the BUSINESS POST, Barry Porter and Foo Choy  Peng examine several issues arising from the increasing numbers  of mainland companies seeking to list on the Hong Kong Stock  Exchange through either direct or indirect means. Barry Porter  quotes the chairman of the Hong Stock Exchange, Charles Lee,  saying that nearly all of the 22 companies listed would float  shares in Hong Kong, although some could obtain secondary  listings in other exchanges, notably New York. Mr. Lee, who  attended the Wuhan seminar, said that the first of the new batch  of PRC firms to list in the territory could be ready to make  public offerings by June 1994. However, Mr. Lee also said that  this may be "wishful thinking."    Foo Choy Peng cites a CSRC official who draws attention to  several drawbacks encountered by mainland firms who had decided  to obtain access to the Hong Kong stock market by the  acquisition of Hong Kong-listed shell companies. Mr. Nie  Qingping said that the CSRC was unable to supervise such  companies effectively, which could lead to problems with  investor protection. Mr. Nie added that such "back-door"  listings also raised the possibility of state-owned assets  flowing out of the country. Mr. Nie said that fund-raising  through direct listings was the preferred method, with Hong Kong  as the major venue for such exercises.    In another article on page one of the same issue, Foo cites  Henry Tsang, a director of investment banking with Merrill Lynch  in Hong Kong, who says that a shortage of market professionals  could affect Hong Kong's ability to meet the requirements of  those Chinese companies seeking to list in Hong Kong. According  to Mr. Tsang, lawyers, bankers, and accountants in the territory  were all operating at "full capacity." "We just don't know how  much this market is able to cope in terms of more and more  transactions." Mr. Tsang said that it took a lot of effort from  many people to deal with just six public offering by mainland  companies last year. "It is important to note that Hong Kong  investors are probably not enough to satisfy all China's  requirements," Mr. Tsang said, adding that it would not be easy  for the Hong Kong market to absorb an issue substantially larger  than $100 million  <H5>  Listing of Wuhan Steel Firm To Fund Expansion Plans </H5>   Wuhan Iron and Steel (Wugang) plans a major expansion using  the proceeds expected from its launch on international  securities markets. The company aims to produce up to 11  million tonnes of steel in 1994. Sales are expected to hit  17.6 billion yuan, with pre-tax profits of 3.45 billion yuan and  foreign exchange earnings of $120 million. The company's  expansion plans are expected to require capital expenditure of  22.5 billion yuan and $850 million in foreign exchange. Wugang  plans to build a third steel mill, a cold- rolled steel plant,  and a 400-megawatt power plant.

The computer distributor and  manufacturer is raising $29 million by issuing 168.75 million  shares. Trading will begin on 14 February. According to  company Chairman Liu Chuanzhi, the cash raised will be used to  develop and market new products and for additional working  capital. Legend has three design centers in Hong Kong,  Shenzhen, and San Jose, California, and has an annual production  capacity of 1.68 million motherboards. The company also  distributes personal computers in mainland China through a  network of 22 distributors. (Beijing CHINA DAILY in English 26  Jan 94 p 2)   <H5>    Mainland Chemical Firm Plans Hong Kong Listing </H5>   Yizheng Chemical Fibre Company, the world's fourth largest  manufacturer of polyester and one of the biggest chemical  companies in China, plans to issue H shares on the Hong Kong  Stock Exchange in March. According to the Jiangsu-based  company's agenda, the H shares will be issued in mid-March and  listed by the end of that month. Shares for domestic investors,  A shares, will be listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in May.  The company is presently engaged in a $421 million investment  program which will raise the company's annual production  capacity to 1 million tonnes by 1995. Last year, the firm  produced 545,000 tonnes of polyester with total sales of 4.94  billion yuan, profits of 1.05 billion yuan, and export earnings  of $37.2 million. (Beijing CHINA DAILY (BUSINESS WEEKLY) in  English 30 Jan 94 p 1)  <H5>  Guangzhou Investment Placement To Raise HK$1 Billion </H5>   Guangzhou Investment is raising HK$1.03 billion in a share  placement to expand its interests in cement manufacturing in  Guangdong. The placement is being arranged by Peregrine  Brokerage and will dilute Yue Xiu Enterprises' controlling stake  from 64 percent to 53 percent. Merchant bankers expect this to  be the first of many issues in the territory to Hong Kong and  international investors this year. Using the proceeds of the  placement, the company plans to take interests in three cement  operations in Guangdong: 51 percent of Zhujiang Cement Plant,  which has an annual production capacity of 1.8 million tonnes;  50 percent of the Huadu Cement Plant in Huada City, which will  have an annual capacity of 400,000 tonnes on completion in 1995;  and 51 percent of Xinqing Cement Plant, which had an annual  capacity of 170,00 tonnes in 1993. The placement is the first  major issue of its kind by the mainland group since its listing  as the property arm of Yue Xiu in December 1992. (Hong Kong  SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST (BUSINESS POST) in English 1 Feb 94 p 1)  <H3>  PRC INVESTMENT IN HONG KONG:  FEATURE: Mainland Investors Return to Surging Real  Estate Market </H3>   Both the commercial and residential property markets  continued their upward surge in January, and the reappearance of  large-scale purchases by PRC-funded firms emerged as a major  factor driving the real estate market to new heights.    In an article on page 7 of the SUNDAY MORNING POST (SUNDAY  MONEY) on 30 January, Kennis Chu examines the renewed influence  of investors from mainland China in the Hong Kong property  market. According to Chu, Chinese investment has risen  noticeably since November 1993, when credit controls imposed in  July of last year by Vice Premier Zhu Rongji to cool inflation  were relaxed. Property prices have reached record highs,  particularly for Grade-A office space and luxury apartments.  The article states that Chinese participation in the real  estate market can be divided into three types: central  government enterprises, such as CITIC and China Merchants  Holdings; companies owned by provincial governments like  Guangdong Investment and Sichuan's Jianling (HK); and city and  village-owned companies, such as Foshan's China Weal, Huiyang,  and Pripenic.    In a front-page article in the 2 February issue of the SOUTH  CHINA MORNING POST (BUSINESS POST), Barry Porter cites a report  by real estate consultant First Pacific Davies which puts the  volume of recorded transactions in January at HK$17.32 billion  and estimates an additional $5 billion in private transactions.  The article points out that this exceeds the previous monthly  record of HK$12 billion set in May 1993, a month in which there  was an "unprecedented surge in buying by mainland corporations,"  a spree which Porter asserts was "partly responsible" for Zhu  Rongji's July austerity program. The article goes on to state  that mainland corporations are buying Hong Kong property as a  hedge against a further devaluation of the yuan. However, most  of the major publicly recorded purchases have been by completed  by listed Hong Kong-based firms, such as Hong Kong China,  controlled by the Lippo group, which paid HK$2.2 billion for an  apartment block in the Mid Levels area; Lai Sun Group, which  bought a Tsimshatsui office building for HK$1.4 billion; and  Great Eagle, which paid HK$2 billion for the Ramada Renaissance  Hotel, also in Tsimshatsui.    The SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST (BUSINESS POST) on 29 January  reports on page one that, in an effort to reduce its exposure to  the residential property market, the territory's leading lender  has further tightened its policies on the provision of mortgages  for "luxury" apartments costing more than HK$5 million.  Hongkong Bank announced that from 29 January, the mortgage  lending ratio for properties worth $5 million or above would be  reduced to 50 percent from 60 percent. The ratio for those  priced below $5 million remains at 70 percent. However, a  report carried by the Hong Kong-based PRC-affiliated news agency  ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE in Chinese at 0912 GMT on 30 January states  that the Bank of China (BOC) Group had no intention of following  Hongkong Bank for the moment. The report said that the BOC  would closely watch the market's reaction and developments in  the field. An official with the BOC Group said that they would  not require their 13 subsidiary banks to follow the same rules  in arranging mortgages; instead, the banks would be allowed to  decide their own policy according to their particular financial  resources.  <H5>  Mainland Tourists To Supplant Taiwanese in 1994 </H5>   According to estimates from the Hong Kong Travel Association  and the China Travel Service, mainland China is expected to  replace Taiwan as the source of the greatest number of visitors  to Hong Kong. During the first 11 months of last year, the  number of mainland tourists visiting Hong Kong rose to 1.58  million, just behind arrivals from Taiwan. Last year, Hong Kong  attracted 9 million visitors, a 13-percent increase on two years  ago. Booming tourist arrivals have given Hong Kong's hotels an  average occupancy rate of 85 percent. (Beijing CHINA DAILY in  English 24 Jan 94 p 3)   <H5>    Bank of China Chief on Operations in Hong Kong </H5>   Mr. Wang Qiren, chairman of the board of directors of the  Bank of China, has said that in transforming specialized banks  in the mainland into commercial ones, the mainland should refer  to experiences in bank management overseas, especially that of  Hong Kong and Macao. Mr. Wang said that since the  implementation of reform and opening to the outside world,  financial circles in the mainland have set up increasingly close  ties with their counterparts in Hong Kong. At present, 13 Hong  Kong-based banks have set up 35 branches, 24 representative  offices, and six jointly funded financial institutions in  mainland China, and mainland banks, including the Bank of China  and the People's Construction Bank of China, have also set up  branches in the territory. Mr. Wang said that the Bank of China  would develop its business in the territory in an active and  steady way. (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in English 1020 GMT 3  Feb 94)  <H5>  CITIC Pacific Takes 50 Percent of Lantau Development </H5>   Hong Kong Resorts International (HKR) is selling half of its  wholly owned subsidiary Hong Kong Resort Company to CITIC  Pacific, a subsidiary of the Beijing-controlled China  International Trust and Investment Company, for HK$3.4 billion.  Hong Kong Resort's main asset is its Discovery Bay residential  development on Lantau island, which has a population of 9,500.  HKR Managing Director Payson Cha Mou-sing has been lobbying the  Hong Kong Government to build a tunnel to link Discovery Bay  with the North Lantau Expressway, which is part of the new  airport project. At present, Discovery Bay is only accessible  by ferry, but if linked to Kowloon by road, land values on  Lantau Island would be likely to appreciate. (Hong Kong SOUTH  CHINA MORNING POST (BUSINESS POST) in English 8 Feb 94 p 1)  <H3>  OTHER ISSUES:  Record Volume of Air Cargo in 1993 </H3>   Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd. (HACTL) handled a record  1.1 million tonnes of air freight in 1993. Final year-end  figures show that HACTL passed the 1-million-tonne mark for the  first time in November. December saw a further 99,134 tonnes  carried, up 19.6 percent on 1992. For the year, HACTL handled  550,167 tones of export cargo, up 17.1 percent on 1992; 432,429  tonnes of import cargo, up 22.1 percent; and 116,203 tonnes of  transshipment goods, up 22.9 percent.    HACTL is one of three bidders for airport cargo handling  franchise at Chek Lap Kok. However, the Provisional Airport  Authority is unwilling to grant any franchises for Chek Lap Kok  until the Sino-British disagreement over airport financing is  resolved. The other bidders for the franchise are the Hong Kong  Airport Services consortium, comprising Singapore interests,  China Merchant Holdings, and Kerry Holdings, and DHL. (Hong Kong  SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST (BUSINESS POST) in English 25 Jan 94 p  2)  <H5>  Growth in Imports, Exports Slows in 1993 </H5>   Hong Kong's trade deficit fell last year, but growth in  exports and imports slowed and some analysts believe the  territory is heading for a period of stagnant growth in external  trade. Exports grew 13.1 in the year to December, while  imports rose 12.2 percent, leaving a total trade deficit of  HK$26.3 billion. Miron Mushkat, chief economist at Lehman  Brothers, said that China's economy was unlikely to be a  "particular source of strength" to Hong Kong. China's austerity  program was said to have affected re-exports while domestic  exports continued to be affected by the relocation of  manufacturing industry to the mainland. (Hong Kong HONG KONG  STANDARD (FINANCIAL REVIEW) in English 29 Jan 94)  <H5>  End of Vietnam Embargo Boosts Shares of Hong Kong Firm </H5>   The share price of Luks Industrial jumped 21 percent on 3  February as prospects of an end to the U.S. embargo against  Vietnam became apparent. Luks was one of the first local  companies to invest in Vietnam despite the U.S. ban on trade  with Hanoi. Luks owns 71 percent of a plywood plant with an  annual production capacity of 40,000 cubic meters and has 80  percent of a cement works which will have an annual capacity of  500,00 tonnes a year on completion. The company also has an  interest in a 500,000-square-foot commercial property in Ho Chi  Minh City. (Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST (BUSINESS POST)  in English 4 Feb 94 p 2)</p>

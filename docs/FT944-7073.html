			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / MPs reject brewers' call for cut in duty A committee of MPs yesterday rejected on economic and health grounds a call by brewers for beer duty to be halved to curb cross-Channel imports and stimulate flagging UK sales. The Treasury select committee said imports of alcohol and tobacco were 'not seriously undermining receipts of excise duty'. But it cautioned Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, against widening the differential between UK and Continental duties. The MPs' report on cross-Channel shopping expressed doubt about the brewers' case. They had argued that the loss of UK beer sales was damaging pubs and off-licences. A cut in duty would revive sales, they argued. Cross-border shopping is 'clearly having a serious impact on the activities of legitimate traders,' the MPs said. But 'changing consumption patterns, however, make it exceedingly difficult to isolate the loss of sales directly attributable to cross-border shopping'. Claims that there is a link 'have to be treated with considerable caution'. Moreover, brewers' costs and margins have driven up the price of beer, the MPs said. 'Until it addresses these issues, the industry cannot expect the taxpayer to subsidise its operations by reducing excise duties.' On health grounds, a government could never consider a large cut in duties if they led to increased consumption of alcohol and tobacco, the MPs said. They recommended, instead, that the government seek to persuade Continental governments to raise their taxes to make cross-border shopping less attractive. The report drew an angry response from Whitbread, one of the brewers which has been leading the campaign. Mr Peter Jarvis, chief executive, said: 'They're a set of wishy-washy recommendations from a rushed inquiry which failed to get the facts.' The government has already said it is unwilling to cut excise duties. The chancellor indicated in last year's Budgets that alcohol duties were unlikely to rise faster than inflation. The MPs found a closer link between tobacco imports and damage to the domestic industry, most particularly in tobacco for hand-rolled cigarettes. Tobacco accounted for the 'vast bulk of smuggled goods' and the high profits had attracted 'serious criminals'. The MPs recommended that the Customs service deploy 'substantially increased' staff to try to stem the illegal import of alcohol and tobacco. The National Union of Civil and Public Servants warned yesterday, however, that the Budget on Tuesday would include proposals to cut 4,000 jobs out of Customs service's 25,000.</p>

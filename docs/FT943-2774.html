			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Man in the News: The one who knows where he's going - Kenneth Clarke Something strange happened this week. The government looked like it had recovered its grip. Mr Kenneth Clarke took the credit. Yes we do have a new style of chancellor. There was the inevitable blip. Mr Jeremy Hanley, installed as Conservative party chairman because he is telegenic, discovered that an avuncular personality is not enough in today's television studios. But Mr Hanley's slip-ups over yobbery and interest rates were a sideshow. At centre stage stood the solidly self-confident figure of Mr Clarke. The government can still field someone who knows where he is going. We should not get carried away. Nor should Mr Clarke, who by all accounts ended the week in pretty exuberant spirits. Remember that Budget last November with the biggest tax hike in history. The pundits loved it. The voters hated it. Were the economic recovery to falter, this week's rise in interest rates would not look quite so shrewd. Even if the latest opinion poll is right and Mr Tony Blair's honeymoon as Labour leader is coming to an end, this government is sitting at the bottom of a deep hole. The punters are not thrilled about picking up the bill for its mistakes. There is more to come. From next month they will be paying new insurance and travel taxes. Next April the value added tax on their heating bills will double. Nor will higher borrowing costs and the extended freeze on public sector pay bills have the voters singing in their baths this weekend. If you are paying a mortgage or are selfless enough to be a public service worker, the feel-good factor in this economic recovery is going to be a long time coming. So why the plaudits for the man in No 10 (whoops, that should read No 11) Downing Street? It's simple. After two years of what Lady Thatcher used to call wobble, Mr Clarke has defined a strategy which looks further ahead than next week. His game plan has as its starting point the simple but not uncontroversial premise that sensible economic policymaking and good politics are not mutually exclusive. He came back from his summer holiday with two thoughts uppermost in his mind. To have any chance of winning another election, the government must remove the deep insecurity caused by the recession and by the pace of economic change. It has also to re-establish a track record for doing what it promises. Mr Clarke's people, the middle classes of middle England, are in desperate need of reassurance. The chancellor assumes (rightly) that after the broken promises of 1992, the voters don't believe a word this government says. The only way to change that is to deliver the steady growth and low inflation it has promised - and to clear up the mess in the public finances. If the Tories fail this credibility test, they may as well not bother. That was the context into which Mr Clarke slotted his decision to call an abrupt halt to the cycle of falling interest rates. Inflation is not expected to pick up in the near future, but he is thinking 18 months to two years ahead. The message was that here was a chancellor who will act before he is pushed. Perhaps it was no coincidence that this particular demonstration of decisiveness coincided with the second anniversary of the event which shredded this government's reputation for economic competence: the ejection of sterling from the European exchange rate mechanism. The same strategy lay behind Mr Clarke's decision to rule out tax cuts in the Budget this November: and to warn colleagues it may be impossible also to deliver a substantial electoral bribe in 1995 or 1996. Of course he hopes to be able to combine fiscal prudence with a demonstration of tax-cutting intent. But if it comes to a choice, he will opt for sound finance. The voters want tax cuts that will last. No one noticed, but Mr Clarke did something else this week. He quietly buried the monetarist ideology which lay at the heart of the Thatcher revolution. Look at the reasons he gave for raising interest rates. Buoyant growth in output, sharp rises in exports and an upturn in investment pointed to a shrinking level of spare capacity in the economy. The Treasury press release did mention the narrow measure of the money supply and allude to the recent weakness of the exchange rate. But the chancellor is not interested in excursions along the fog-bound monetary motorways on which his predecessors found themselves lost during the 1980s. As befits a chancellor self-consciously proud of his roots in the industrial Midlands, he intends to watch the real economy. Mr Clarke would say that nothing that has happened in the past few days should surprise us. His first act as chancellor was to tackle public borrowing. It was he who decided to inject transparency into interest rate decisions by publishing the minutes of his monthly meetings with Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. And anyone glancing at his record at health, education and the Home Office could have guessed his attitude to public sector pay. The trouble is not everyone in the Conservative party - or for that matter the cabinet - shares all his inner certainties. One or two noticed that the Bank had not anyway left him much choice this week on interest rates. Ken and Eddie may be getting on famously, but what happens when they fall out? Colleagues on the Tory right detect in Mr Clarke a politician whose convictions are too close to the social democracy of Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader. The obvious mutual respect between the two men does not help. Others harbour still darker suspicions. The chancellor has been quiet lately about his enthusiasm for Europe. But the Tory sceptics fear that, once the economy is in suitable shape, he will again take up the cause of economic integration. He has after all admitted he would back a single currency. Then there is the small matter of Mr John Major. Close aides in both camps insist gossip about rows between the prime minister and Mr Clarke are unfounded. Sure, the prime minister gets irritated when the chancellor will not stop talking (Mr Clarke should watch for the moment when Mr Major starts tapping his fingers on the table). It would be odd also if the prime minister were thrilled by Mr Clarke's cheerful public admissions of his long-term ambitions to succeed him. But the two men are agreed on the central planks of economic policy. That could change. It was Mr Major who promised, during the 1992 campaign, tax cuts 'year by year'. His enthusiasm for fiscal prudence may fade as the next election approaches. There will be plenty of colleagues telling him to put some money back into the voters' pockets; that Mr Clarke has gone native at the Treasury; and that he, Mr Major, should set the government's electoral strategy. The prime minister should ignore them. Mr Clarke reminded us this week that a clear sense of direction is everything in politics.</p>

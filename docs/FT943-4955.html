			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU moves against Asian garlic The image of the French peasant with a string of garlic around his neck could be threatened by a huge surge in imports of the pungent bulb from China, Vietnam and Taiwan to the European Union. French farmers have complained that the livelihood of many small producers and family growers is at stake. The European Commission has revoked garlic import licences from Taiwan and Vietnam until May next year. Licence requests from Vietnam increased by 680 per cent between the beginning of June and August 19 compared with the same period last year. Over the same period, Taiwanese producers raised their demands for licences by 4,611 per cent. The French farmers' union has called on the Commission to impose a total ban on imports until the middle of next year. The French are backed by Spanish growers which between them represent the bulk of garlic produced in the EU. European producers believe that Taiwan and Vietnam are being used as conduits for Chinese garlic following the placing of restrictions on Chinese imports in June. Last year China sent 40,000 tonnes of garlic to the EU - almost 20 per cent of the entire market. This year shipments have been restricted to 10,000 tonnes. Growers complain that the Chinese garlic is of a low quality and has undercut EU prices.</p>

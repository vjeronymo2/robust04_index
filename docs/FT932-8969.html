			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / How to Spend It: Green shoots in Africa - Lucia van der Post invites readers to join her on a special trip to Africa I THOUGHT I had hung up my (professional) safari hat. With small groups of FT readers I have canoed down the Zambezi, camped in the innermost reaches of the Kalahari, walked through swamps in Botswana, looked for Bushman paintings in the Tsodilo hills, skirted hippos in the Okavango Delta, watched the eagles fly and the lion hunt . . . happy, happy days in the company of lots of smashing readers. That Africa could still have further delights to offer seemed unimaginable. But that was before I met Iain and Oria Douglas-Hamilton. Anybody who knows anything about Africa knows that there is scarcely another soul who knows as much about elephants, who has spent as many hours right in among them, as Iain and Oria. Ever since Iain went out to Africa as a young Oxford zoology graduate to complete his Ph. D thesis on elephant behaviour, and met Oria at a party in Nairobi, elephants have been their lives. They have studied them on the shores of Lake Manyara, charted their falling numbers up and down the width and length of Africa, fought for them, lobbied for them and written about them. 'Nobody,' said Desmond Morris recently, 'has done more for elephants than the Douglas-Hamiltons.' So a chance to go in among the elephants with Iain and Oria as our guides seemed special enough to make me look to my safari hat. This will be the first time the Douglas-Hamiltons have taken a group on this kind of safari. There are places for just 16 people in all. The Douglas-Hamiltons will accompany the group from beginning to end. They will take you among the groups of elephants they have got to know so well in Lake Manyara, in Tsavo East National Park and along the Tarangire River where in September (the time of our safari) huge herds gather to drink among the baobab trees. You will stay in private camps, most of them set up specially for the group in areas where the game viewing is best or where the herds are known to be gathering. There will be picnic lunches in the bush, evening meals on the banks of rivers, nights spent with nothing but slivers of canvas between you and the African darkness. Iain and Oria, however, will not be the only experts. After seven days the group flies (with the Douglas-Hamiltons as well) to the ottoman-style camp of Roland Purcell in the Mahale Mountains on the eastern shores of Lake Tanganyika. Here among the palm-nut vultures, the fish eagles, the goliath herons you will stay for three nights, with Roland on hand to illuminate the experience. Roland is to chimps what the Douglas-Hamiltons are to elephants. He has studied them, knows their families, has given them names and is a world-renowned expert on primate behaviour. There, in the tropical rainforest, is the largest known group of chimpanzees in the world, some 100 strong, which Roland will take you to. From the Mahale Mountains another private charter flight takes you to your own camp in a private part of the Masai Mara Reserve to search for the wildebeest migration, one of the great sights of Africa. The trip ends with three days in the Douglas-Hamiltons' own home on the shores of Lake Naivasha with more local treats such as lunch among the flamingoes of Lake Nakuru and a flight round Mount Kenya (designed to make sure you come back to climb it). The safari starts at Heathrow on Friday, September 3 and finishes back at Heathrow on Monday, September 20. It has been orchestrated by African Explorations of Holwell Manor Barn, Holwell, Burford, Oxon OX18 4JS. At Pounds 5,499 per person it is not cheap - (time perhaps to say sod the recession?) - but I believe that what you will be getting is unbeatable: world authorities on elephants and chimpanzees, private camps in secluded parts of the bush and private charter flights from one area to another. Anybody wanting more information and a detailed itinerary should write to me at The Financial Times, No 1 Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL, marking the envelope 'Safari'. To book a guaranteed place a deposit of Pounds 1,000 will be required (non-returnable except in cases covered by holiday insurance). It should be made payable to Africa Explorations but sent to me. As I have learnt from past experience that readers in far-flung parts feel rather disadvantaged by distance and postal services, I will allow a full fortnight for letters to arrive and itineraries to be sent out. After that it will be first come, first served. 'Even today, to visit Africa is a feast for the senses,' says Bartle Bull in his splendid tome on the history of the safari. I believe he is right. We cannot know what Africa must have looked like to those first explorers a century and a half ago but I do know that conservation policies are beginning to show some results. Iain Douglas-Hamilton tells me the elephant herds in Kenya are healthier and more numerous than they were ten years ago. Everywhere a sense of the treasures that we so nearly lost - and might yet lose - has brought a heightened sense of care and awareness. At present we are lucky. The Africa we yearn for is still there to be discovered.</p>

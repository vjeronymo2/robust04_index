			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN CONTINENTAL'S OFFICERS ARE NAMED IN SUIT  </P> <P> Bondholders of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan's parent company have sued directors,  officers, outside accountants and law firms associated with the company,  alleging fraud and deceit in the apparent loss of more than $250 million in  funds.  </P> <P> The class action claims that American Continental Corp. in Phoenix and others  perpetrated a "massive" scheme that wiped out substantial amounts of savings of  thousands of people.  </P> <P> More than 22,000 bondholders may have lost their investments in American  Continental bonds after the company filed for bankruptcy on April 13.  Regulators seized Lincoln the next day, alleging it was being operated in an  "unsafe and unsound" manner.  </P> <P> Bondholders, who are parties in other lawsuits in Orange County and Phoenix, in  general have complained that they were led to believe that their investments  were safe. Many contend that they transferred funds from insured deposit  accounts into the bonds under the mistaken impression that their new  investments were also insured.  </P> <P> The effort to persuade depositors to buy bonds "was aimed at people who were  not sophisticated in understanding the risks of this investment," said Ronald  Rus of Orange, one of the lawyers who filed the class-action suit in Orange  County Superior Court.  </P> <P> In talking to 450 bondholders, Rus said, he and Burlingame lawyer Joseph W.  Cotchett found that the vast majority were more than 60 years old and stood to  lose from $25,000 to $40,000 each.  </P> <P> With interest rates only slightly higher than rates on certificates of deposit  -- 9.5% for 1-year bonds and 10.5% for 2-year bonds -- the offering was  "designed to attract this kind of depositor," Rus said.  </P> <P> "It would never fly with sophisticated investors," he said. Savvy investors  would have demanded a higher interest and would have known the bonds were risky  investments, he said.  </P> <P> The lawsuit does not name American Continental or Lincoln because of the delays  and hurdles the suit would encounter in Bankruptcy Court and in U.S. District  Court in Phoenix, where a tangle of litigation has already tied up the courts.  </P> <P> Instead, the suit goes after the company's chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr.,  and other officers and directors. It also names the Big 8 accounting firms of  Arthur Young &amp; Co., Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and Touche, Ross &amp; Co.  for their auditing statements on American Continental and Lincoln.  </P> <P> In Phoenix, meanwhile, several dozen lawyers attended hearings Friday in  Bankruptcy Court and, later, in U.S. District Court in regard to various issues  in the cases. One of those issues -- whether American Continental's attorneys  should be disqualified because they once represented regulatory agencies -- was  not decided by the federal judge.  </P> <P> The bankruptcy judge, however, issued a temporary order allowing American  Continental to keep its attorneys but appointing new attorneys for 11 of  Lincoln's subsidiaries, which also were put into bankruptcy.  </P></p>

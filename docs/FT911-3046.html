			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Brazil scraps broker system THE Brazilian stock exchanges yesterday scrapped their exclusive broker system, moving closer to the auction system of the New York Stock Exchange. Following a ruling by the National Monetary Council, buyers and sellers of equities can now close deals without broker intermediation. 'The new rules will add flexibility to the stock exchanges by putting an end to the brokers' trading monopoly,' said Dr Elizabeth Garbayo, superintendent of market development at Brazil's stock market watchdog, the Commissao de Valores Mobiliarios (CVM). Brazilian investors welcomed the change in rules. 'The broker system has created an insiders' club at the exchanges,' said Mr Antonio Carlos Molina, head of the fund manager company Brasilpar Servicos Financeiros. 'This in turn fostered a shallow market, the sort of environment in which scandals can abound.' It is hoped the move will spawn a 'specialist' system similar to the one operating on the New York Stock Exchange. The specialists would guarantee liquidity in certain stocks. But Mr Alvaro Vidigal, president of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, was sceptical. 'This just won't catch on, because the market won't let it,' he said.</p>

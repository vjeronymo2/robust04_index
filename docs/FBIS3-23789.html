			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Lashkevich, IZVESTIYA: "Lithuanians Will </F> Calculate Incomes and Declare Them for the State"]    [Text] Possibly, as early as next year, all of the  residents of Lithuania will begin to declare their property and  incomes. This is the aim of a draft law that Lithuanian  President Algirdas Brazauskas has submitted for consideration to  the Lithuanian Seimas.    Thus, in Lithuania, perhaps, for the first time in the  legislative practice of former republics of the USSR, it is  planned to fundamentally change the system of taxation, which  will be the most radical decision in the reformation of the  socioeconomic life of the republic.    According to the presidential draft, all adult residents of  the republic will be obliged to declare property acquired and  incomes received in the course of a calendar year by submitting  special declarations to state tax inspectorates according to  place of residence. It will be necessary to submit them there by  1 March of the next year for the past year. So that each  resident of Lithuania, whether he wants to or not, will have to  become a domestic bookkeeper who scrupulously gathers all  records, forms, checks, tickets, receipts, and other payment  account documents that are of use to him in filling out the  declaration. If it is filled out incorrectly then, according to  the draft law, the tax inspectorate first reports this to the  taxpayer and, in the event of insufficient payment of taxes, he  is obliged to pay them now with an added fine. Its sum will  increase in that progression in which the taxpayer tries to  deceive his own state. Moreover, for evading submission of a  declaration, and for indicating incorrect data, he can end up in  court.    Members of the ruling parliamentary faction and the  Democratic Labor Party decided to work to support the  presidential draft law--they announced their intentions to  declare their incomes that they received this year. President A.  Brazauskas earlier also declared his readiness to fill out such  a declaration and to publish his incomes. The president and his  team thereby let it be known that the presidential veto of the  law on mandatory declaration of incomes and property by state  employees, previously adopted by the Seimas, is explained not by  a desire to please corrupt bureaucrats, of which the rightist  opposition accused the president, but by an urgent need to  defend the constitutional rights of citizens. A. Brazauskas  decided: If incomes are to be declared, then this is for all  residents, and not for an individual category of workers.    This kind of reform of the taxation system will undoubtedly  require large resources and a radical breaking of the  consciousness of the people.    The foundation for a Lithuanian-style tax revolution has  been  laid. Lithuania has already adopted the law on the declaration  of incomes of residents and on expensive property that was  acquired or is being acquired. The Seimas will soon consider the  draft of a new law about a single income tax, according to which  it is proposed to summarize all incomes and to give the state 35  percent of the aggregate. If such a document is adopted, then it  will not be necessary to rack one's brain over the compilation  of a declaration--in fact, a single tax standard will be in  operation. In addition, it is planned to introduce 16 types of  taxes in Lithuania: on real estate, land, natural resources,  patents, notary services, and so on. It is planned to complete  the Lithuanian tax system as early as 1996.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Zhi (3769 1807), affiliated with the PBC's </F> Financial Studies Institute: "A Brief Discussion of a Policy  Bank"]    [Text] While academics and industrialists have conducted  widespread discussions on how to convert specialized banks to  commercial ones, with all press organs carrying many articles on  this subject, which of course is an essential one still needing  further discussion, it seems that relatively speaking, they have  not paid enough attention to ways of establishing a policy bank.  So this article is presenting certain views on the matter, as  food for thought for those studying it.  <H5>  I. The Necessity of Policy-Related Business </H5>   Banking policy-related business is specifically the granting  of low-interest, concessional loans to certain industries and  enterprises in line with national economic policy. It can be  said to be an international practice, existing in all countries  throughout the world. This is due to:    1. To ensure that socio-economic and industrial structures  are balanced and national economic policy is implemented, all  countries grant low-interest, concessional loans to industries  and enterprises needing support, most commonly to agriculture.  As agriculture is not only seasonal, which limits its  production and commodity fund turnover rates, but also  restricted in its production process by natural changes, such as  weather, the state must support it. Moreover, as foreign trade  involves factors, such as international competition, how a  country's products can occupy world markets, and a country's  standing and prestige in the international family, all countries  provide concessional loans to export firms and export-commodity  bases.    2. Low-interest, concessional loans are a feature of a  market economy per se. While many comrades have held in recent  years that a market economy equals competition and the  enterprise operating target is profits, this is in fact a great  misunderstanding. On market economy terms, there are two types  of enterprises, one competitive and the other not. The  competitive type targets its operations at profits, while the  noncompetitive type does not, acting rather in the interests of  the public welfare of the whole society. These two types of  enterprises are interdependent.    While the competitive type of enterprise is factories,  stores, and service trades (including commercial banks), the  noncompetitive type is mostly public welfare enterprises. The  state's administrative policy and method differ for these two  types of enterprise. Competitive enterprises can be pushed  toward markets, allowing market competition itself to determine  prices, product quality, and variety. But for noncompetitive  enterprises, the state first needs to set prices, to keep them  from asking exorbitant prices due to the lack of competition.  This price-setting is aimed at 1) stabilizing living standards  for the whole society and 2) spurring better operating  management to lower costs. But premised on set prices, if  temporary losses are sustained due to unpredictable factors,  what is to be done? The state can adopt two methods, one being  to rationally adjust prices. But as this leaves prices unable  to change normally, only going up, and being very hard to lower,  it should generally not be adopted. The other method is to take  from the fat to pad the lean, by granting low-interest,  concessional loans to this type of enterprise, to help them  regain their strength and improve their operating management.  It is thus obvious that policy loans are granted mainly to  enterprises that cannot aim at profitmaking, while being saddled  with the missions of meeting the public welfare needs of the  whole society and implementing state macroeconomic policy. And  the emergence and existence of this type of enterprise are  inevitable consequences of market economy conditions.  <H5>  II. The Features of China's Policy Loans </H5>   The current reality for China's specialized banks is that  making policy loans is synonomous with running a business at a  loss. Term deposits of longer than one year with annual interest  of about 10 percent at prevailing interest rates make up 80  percent of current specialized bank savings deposits, while the  four types in 21 categories of low-interest, concessional loans  averaging only 6.68 percent interest account for one-third of  all specialized bank loans. It has been calculated that the  ICBC's current deposit-loan interest difference is only 0.82  percent which, under normal conditions should be 2 points, and  that the AB loses 28 yuan for every 1,000 it lends.    So do low-interest, concessional, policy loans truely mean  that losses are certain? No!    First, theoretically, low-interest, concessional, policy  loans are certainly not tied inevitably to losses. All  enterprises must strive for their own fund balance, which is a  market-economy demand.    Second, macroeconomically, enterprises that target their  production operations at profits seek mainly immediate  interests, while enterprises supported by policy loans focus on  the future, sacrificing some immediate profits for greater  future ones. This is because as long as the subsistence and  welfare needs of all residents are met, and the society's  industrial structure and product mix are rationally adjusted,  the whole society's economy will be bound to be consolidated  quickly and grow in a sustained way, which cannot generally be  achieved by profit-targeted enterprises. In China specifically,  policy loans have the following features:    1. China's policy loans are needed for market-economy  development. While the main reason for this was noted above, it  needs to be emphasized here that enterprises whose production  operations are based on policy, or those that cannot compete or  whose production operations cannot be targeted at profits, are  not necessarily all in the ranks of those that receive policy  loans. The main features of China's policy loans are too many  and too indiscriminate. By now, China's low-interest,  concessional, policy loans come in four general types in 21  categories, mainly such as grain, cotton, and edible oil loans,  export purchasing loans, civil administration welfare factory  loans, development loans to old, minority-nationality, border,  and poverty-stricken areas, bullion loans, anti-poverty discount  loans, and specific-item loans. In addition, we grant  differentiated interest-rate loans, actually also low-interest,  concessional ones, to sectors, such as agriculture, coal, crude  recovery, power, transportation, and iron and steel. While  Western countries also grant low-interest loans, they do not  grant as many as we, with the ones they do being handled not by  banks, but rather by the government sector.    2. A conscientious analysis of China's current low-interest,  concessional, policy loans shows that many of them seem  irrational, being the aftermath of a planned economy, which  should be gradually adjusted as our market economy is perfected.    3. As policy loans do not equal losing ones, enterprises  need  to strive for their own fund balance.  <H5>  III. Policy Loan Funding Sources </H5>   As policy loans are determined by the existence of  enterprises of two different types on market-economy terms,  their funding sources should depend mainly on taking from the  fat to pad the lean, not on capital financing. This means that:    1. Policy loan funding sources should depend mainly on state  revenue. While the difference between policy and ordinary loans  is apparently higher or lower interest rates, it is actually a  matter of strategy and tactics. Without long-range objectives,  immediate goals lose direction, becoming unchecked and  unsustainable; and without immediate goals, long-range  objectives are also unattainable. So policy-loan funding  sources should depend mainly on taking the fat from profitmaking  enterprises to pad the lean of policy enterprises.    2. Might we draw on postal savings or central bank funds?  Generally speaking, we should not. This is because what postal  savings absorb is surplus funds from residents' daily lives, in  which the cost of absorption is too high, with demand deposits,  as well as term deposits with certification, being withdrawable  at any time. Using such funds to grant policy loans is buying  high and selling low, as well as being too risky. Central bank  fund sources are mainly the five of enterprise deposits, revenue  deposits, organizational deposits, residents' savings deposits,  and self-owned funds, with the first four being unmoveable. This  is because that is money that is deposited there temporarily to  be withdrawn before long. If we took it out to do discount  business, leaving us with less of the people's money, how could  we accout for this? As to the central bank's own funds, while  these are theoretically moveable, they have been used up through  overdraft borrowing since our huge fiscal deficits appeared in  1981. Of course, while they may be slightly employable for  adjustments, this would be limited as to both time and amount,  leaving very little room for maneuver.  <H5>  IV. Who Should Run the Policy Bank? </H5>   On market-economy terms, commercial banks can act only in  accordance with the law, having to observe all central bank  legal regulations, but no longer having a higher authority as to  daily operations. But a policy bank differs, in that it is not  an enterprise, but rather a state tool for implementing economic  policy, meaning that it should have a higher authority. But who  should this higher authority be? While this has generally been  determined to be the State Council, which is of course most  ideal, the concern is that the State Council has too many  subsidiaries, leading to the fear that it will follow the past  practice of entrusting a ministry or commission with delegated  management, thus causing more problems.    As a policy bank is called a "bank," it should be held in  trust by the central bank. But we hold that China's policy  bank is certainly not a bank in the traditional, internationally  recognized sense. It is not a banking enterprise that  independently transacts deposits, loans, and exchange, but  rather actually a department that handles appropriations.  Overseas, most policy bank functions are handled by the treasury  sector or other agencies, with no central bank meddling.    China's central bank should not hold our policy bank in  trust, as we have learned the following lessons: 1) In the last  decade, centralized management of working capital has turned  into centralized guarantee of working capital, with loans  replacing appropriations. 2) Since the founding of the PRC, the  credit funds allocated to banks by state revenue over the years  have evolved from allocation shortages to basically no  allocations. These lessons illustrate in a concentrated way a  problem: that financial allocations are unreliable. While some  might say that policy bank funding sources are financial  allocations, but policy bank business is held in trust by the  central bank, the central bank could absolutely not agree to  this easily. This is absolutely not due to sectarian bias, but  proceeds rather from economic stability. In China, where our  monetary base and monetary-multiplier principles still cannot  play a full role in controlling currency issue, currency  stabilization still depends on administrative force for  restraint. China's central bank is in a state of on the one  hand, being the only organ of currency issue, and on the other  still having very weak macroeconomic control might. These two  features mean that if our central bank meddled in our policy  bank, in times of extreme fiscal difficulties and allocation  inabililty, the central bank could overcome its difficulties  only by issuing currency, which would cause inflation, which in  turn would infringe on the interests of the people throughout  China, so would be absolutely unacceptable.    So if our policy bank must be held in trust, then this  burden  ought to be shouldered by state revenue [the treasury]. The  treasury is not an organ of currency issue, being able to act  based only on the amount of money that it has. If it overspends  in one area, it must economize in another. Of course, the  central bank must not just look on unconcerned either, but  rather should do all possible to assist the treasury in  overcoming difficulties.</p>

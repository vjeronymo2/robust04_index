			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Heavy demand likely for BSkyB The British Sky Broadcasting flotation is expected to be heavily oversubscribed ahead of next week's announcement of the offer price and share allocation. Apart from strong institutional interest, more than 300,000 people registered to receive details of the flotation, expected to value the company at between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 4.6bn. Keen interest in the float has come despite valuations ranging from Pounds 2.6bn to Pounds 3.6bn from some analysts. The price has not yet been fixed. Because many of the shares offered through shareshops are likely to go to BSkyB subscribers, there will be a strong incentive to try to ensure the price does not fall after unconditional dealing begins on December 15. The price is, however, expected to reach at least the mid-point of the valuation range of 233p-268p. Meanwhile, stockbrokers James Capel yesterday published a note arguing that the Pounds 4bn-Pounds 4.6bn valuation 'looked expensive' and instead suggested Pounds 3.6bn - or 210p a share. Analyst Ms Lucy Broke identified the potential risks as: the dish market maturing as cable developed; BSkyB losing its stranglehold on key programming or having to pay more to keep rights; and changes in the technological or regulatory environment. County NatWest has retained its valuation of Pounds 3.3bn set earlier this year and Smith New Court, co-managers of the deal, have gone for Pounds 3.7bn. Henderson Crosthwaite, at the low extreme, has valued BSkyB at Pounds 2.6bn, while other stockbroking firms are in the range of between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 4.6bn. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a 17.5 per cent stake in BSkyB.</p>

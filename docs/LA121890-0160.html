			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ABOUT-FACE ON SCHOLARSHIPS;  </P> <P> U.S. EASES ITS BAN AGAINST RACE-BASED AID  </P> <P> The Education Department today backed away from a total ban on financial aid  targeted for minorities. It said colleges and universities will be allowed to  award scholarships based solely on race as long as federal funds are not used.  </P> <P> Assistant Secretary Michael Williams, who heads the department's Office of  Civil Rights, announced a six-point policy regarding race-exclusive  scholarships at a news conference today.  </P> <P> Williams said the new policy should "prevent disruption to the efforts of  colleges and universities to attract minorities to their campuses and to  reassure students that no scholarships that have already been awarded . . .  will be affected in any way."  </P> <P> Central to the policy is the Education Department's decision to let  universities that receive federal funds administer scholarships funded entirely  by private persons or organizations where the donor restricts eligibility for  the scholarships to minorities.  </P> <P> Under past Administration policy, public and private universities could set  aside public or private funds for scholarships targeted to minorities.  </P> <P> Under the new policy, public schools will be able to offer only non-federally  funded scholarships for minorities. Private schools that receive federal funds  will be prohibited from offering any scholarships based on race.  </P> <P> There are no restrictions on scholarships offered by private schools that  accept no federal funds.  </P> <P> Most minority scholarship programs already are privately funded.  </P> <P> The policy announced today is less restrictive than a proposal made last week  by Williams under which schools would have been barred from administering any  scholarships based solely on race.  </P> <P> The department also said:  </P> <P>  -- Universities will have four years to review their programs under Title Six  of the Civil Rights Act and to assure that students do not suffer from the  changes.  </P> <P>  -- During the four-year transition period, the Administration will investigate  any complaints it receives but it will not make a broad review of whether  schools are complying with the policy.  </P> <P>  -- The Administration will encourage state legislatures, local governments and  private universities receiving federal funds to review the legal restrictions  on minority scholarships. The goal of the reviews will be to ensure that  minorities and other needy students get the maximum possible amount of  assistance.  </P> <P> President Bush called Williams on Monday to discuss his concerns, said an  Education Department source who spoke on condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> In early drafts of the ruling that was announced today, Williams had wanted  merely to soften the department's decision by giving colleges two years to  comply. But that relaxation was dropped in favor of a complete retreat.  </P> <P> On Monday, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that  Bush was "very disturbed" about Williams' decision. The President ordered a  quick review with advice from lawyers in the White House and the Justice  Department.  </P> <P> Williams acknowledged last week that he had not consulted with anyone at the  White House before issuing the ruling.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Jacques Joachim Yhombi-Opango, prime minister  and head of government today addressed officers of the  Brazzaville Garrison. At the center of that address, which took  place in the conference room of Hydro-Congo company, was the  restructuring of the Congolese Armed Forces and their  integration into development. Other issues were also examined at  the meeting, in particular problems of security and keeping  order. [passage omitted] Let us listen to the prime minister as  he talked about the restructuring of the public security force  and its present challenges:    [Begin Yhombi-Opango recording] On the domestic field, our  public force was not effectively prepared to face the new  dangers that faced us, such as the massive distribution of  weapons and of war munitions to the civilian population; the  destruction and sabotage of public infrastructures and  buildings; looting; barricades; dastardly assassinations; armed  robberies; raping; and narcotics. All these crimes constitute  for the public force and for the authorities challenges that  must be met. Taking into account the [word indistinct] of the  problems raised, the government was of the view that the  reorganization of the public force, in view of the present  constitutional and political situations, constitutes a decisive  step towards the objectives we want to attain. This is why a  document relating to this reorganization has been drafted and is  currently being examined by the parliament. [end recording]    The prime minister, Jacques Joachim Yhombi-Opango, also  spoke  about the recruitment of Congolese youths into our Armed Forces,  a recruitment exercise which became a reality today as the  president of the Republic, Professor Pascal Lissouba, signed the  order for the recruiting of a contingent of 2,000 youths.  Concerning this recruitment exercise, the prime minister  informed the officers of the Brazzaville garrison about the  objectives of this exercise. Listen to Jacques Joachim  Yhombi-Opango:    [Begin Yhombi-Opango recording] This recruitment will enable  us to reduce or to solve the staffing problem and will also  contribute to raising the number of junior officers within the  public force. The Congolese Armed Forces alone will receive  about 33 percent of the recruits. Any military force draws its  ability from the enthusiasm, the spontaneity, and the commitment  of the youths. The mission which the head of state has  entrusted upon us is to replace our public force considerably  with younger blood, in order to make it an efficient and  result-oriented tool in the service of the nation.

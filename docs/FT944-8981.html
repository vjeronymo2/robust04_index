			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Soft commissions Soft commission is something of a misnomer. Commissions are normally paid by the investor to the stockbroker, not the other way round. The practice of paying institutions 'in kind' in return for a commitment to deal looks suspect, even if it is not illegal or necessarily unethical. The obvious question is who benefits from the strange practice. Fund managers clearly do, as the benefits they receive reduce the costs of running an investment management business, and hence increase profitability. The benefits do not necessarily feed through to the client, who bears the dealing costs and the consequent impact on investment performance. It is likely that unnecessary deals are done on the client's behalf, at a higher cost than if orders were placed directly with a market-maker. New proposals from Imro, the fund management industry's watchdog, try to make a distinction between acceptable and non-acceptable kinds of 'softing'  -the latter of which would be banned. But this approach is likely to run into definitional problems. It also looks heavy-handed. Fund managers are already required to reveal their soft commissions to their clients, giving them an opportunity to object. Responsible fund managers are increasingly likely to boycott the practice, as Mercury Asset Management has done this week. If trustees of pension funds and their advisers fail to put pressure on managers to abandon soft commissions, they have only themselves to blame.</p>

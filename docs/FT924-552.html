			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC asked to revoke agreement on banana sales The presidents of eight Latin American banana-producing nations have asked the EC to revoke an agreement restricting their banana sales to community countries from next year, reports Reuter from San Jose, Costa Rica. 'We urge the European Community to revoke the decision taken, in order to renew dialogue and negotiate with our countries the new conditions of access for Latin American bananas in accordance with the norms and commitments of the Uruguay round and Gatt,' the presidents said in a joint statement handed to the British Embassy in San Jose. Latin American nations expect to export some 2.7m tonnes of bananas to EC countries in 1992.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Sagasco rejects ADollars 760m Boral offer SAGASCO, the owner of South Australia's suburban gas network and various production assets, yesterday said that the ADollars 760m (USDollars 495m) bid from Boral, the building materials group, was 'not fair and reasonable'. In support of its bid defence, the company released a valuation by Grant Samuel, the merchant bank, which suggested that Sagasco was worth between ADollars 3.02 and ADollars 4.29 a share, in contrast to the ADollars 3.50 which Boral is proposing to pay. Boral said later that it had not considered raising its offer and still believed that the offer was fair. The South Australian state government retains a 32 per cent interest in Sagasco, having sold a 19.9 per cent stake to Boral at ADollars 3.40 a share. It said yesterday that no decision had been taken over its holding, but that it would seek to maximise its return. 'We will go for the best possible price that somebody will actually pay,' commented the authorities. TNT, the troubled transportation group, yesterday insisted that its plans for some form of capital-raising exercise had not yet been finalised. The stock market has been awash with rumours of a ADollars 300m preference share issue, and the expectation that an issue was being finalised sent TNT shares up by four cents to ADollars 1.36 yesterday. The issue is being lead managed by County NatWest and Macquaries Equities, and is expected to be presented to the TNT board later this week. The R&amp;I Bank of Western Australia plans to change its name to Bank of Western Australia and to reduce its staff by 12 per cent, or 400 people, Reuter reports. The bank is owned by the Western Australian state government. Mr Warwick Kent, managing director, said the jobs would go as a result of an operations review, although no branches were expected to close.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Dobson attacks level of electricity profits ELECTRICITY privatisation will mean at least an extra Pounds 800m in profits to the electricity generation and supply industry this year but gives no real benefit to consumers, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, said yesterday. In a letter to Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, Mr Dobson estimated that the electricity industry would make Pounds 3.4bn profit this financial year, compared with Pounds 2.6bn last year and Pounds 1.4bn in the year to April 1988. He accused the government of failing to provide real competition or regulation. Mr Wakeham said his department had no forecasts for the electricity industry's profits. 'In any case, it is right that companies should be able to increase their profits as they become more efficient.' What really mattered, Mr Wakeham added, was that prices to consumers had fallen 2 per cent in the past 7 years. Mr Dobson has also accused Mr Wakeham of starting rumours that he was about to announce agreement by the electricity industry to buy 40m tonnes of coal a year from British Coal. National Power and PowerGen denied they were close to a deal, saying that volumes had been discussed but not price. The 12 regional electricity companies of England and Wales, which buy power from the generators and sell it to customers, said earlier this week Mr Wakeham had asked them to put pressure on the generators to agree an accord with British Coal. In the past he has insisted that any deal should be negotiated without government involvement.</p>

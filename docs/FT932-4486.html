			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Management: Finding the right Touche - Tim Dickson looks at Henderson's strategy for integrating a fund management rival Budding empire builders in the City of London must be heartened by stock market reaction to the Pounds 42.5m acquisition of Touche Remnant by fund management group Henderson Administration. Henderson shares, after all, have outperformed the FT-A All-Share index by 20 per cent since the merger was first proposed in October. There is more to takeovers in the financial services sector, however, than sound timing and a good strategic fit (the aspects of the deal which have gone down well with investors). Combining businesses with more than their share of highly paid egos, reconciling different computer systems and physically transferring furniture and other equipment to tight timetables represents a large organisational challenge and demands a particular blend of management skills. 'The process of integration is complex,' said Ben Wrey, Henderson's chairman, with, no doubt, deliberate understatement, as he announced the group's 1992/93 financial results on Monday. Wrey and colleagues acknowledge that this process is not complete. But they believe that the smoothness of the transition so far augurs well for the future of the enlarged group (combined funds under management Pounds 11.5bn, including a wide range of investment trusts, unit trusts and pension funds), and contains valuable lessons for others. Certainly the vacating of Mermaid House - Touche's riverside offices - and the relocating of Touche personnel inside Henderson's headquarters in the Broadgate complex, look to have been achieved with enviable speed and efficiency. More questionable is whether Henderson can be equally proud of the way it handled the human resources issue. To be fair to Henderson, the long gap between the first public announcement of talks on October 13 and completion of the deal on December 22, followed immediately by the Christmas break, inescapably heightened tension. Moreover, when all is said and done, defections of key staff were minimal (and non-existent in the case of fund managers). Any scope for criticism lies in the time taken to inform employees about their personal futures. More than half of Touche's 160 staff, and 10 of Henderson's pre-merger total of 400 employees, were made redundant, albeit after free counselling and additional compensation for those with long service. Henderson obviously thought it reasonable in the circumstances to set a deadline of January 19 for talking to each employee. Inevitably perhaps, others disagree. One executive who has since left the group voluntarily - and therefore with no axe to grind - believes better planning was possible in the weeks leading up to completion. 'There was nervousness for longer than was necessary, particularly among senior Henderson staff, and I think some people who might have stayed didn't do so because of the uncertainty. I know hindsight is a wonderful thing but the lesson for me is to communicate, communicate and communicate. Then to do it again.' Henderson's personnel director Michael Robinson insists two-way communication was a priority from the start. 'Studies show that 50 per cent of takeovers ultimately do not meet their commercial objectives because of a failure to win the hearts and minds of the acquired staff,' he observes. 'People invent information if kept in the dark.' Henderson's decision to enlist the services of a third party - the consultancy People in Business - can be seen as a sign of this commitment. The brief was to talk to key staff in both companies to establish their perceptions and their expectations of the merger. The resulting comments - unexpurgated if unattributable - were apparently pretty robust but by all accounts Henderson responded to the criticisms. 'It made us aware of a number of misconceptions about ourselves, our business, and how we operate it,' is how Robinson puts it. Henderson mentors - known internally as 'pilots' or 'shadows' - were assigned to each Touche employee to help speed up the process of assimilation. But Robinson says this could take a year. If cultural adaptation inevitably takes time, the physical transfer of Touche staff and their systems was achieved a week ahead of schedule. Henderson, though, had the perfect incentive to get cracking, expiry at the end of March of a three-month, rent-free period negotiated with Touche's previous owners, the French bank Societe Generale. Nevertheless, recalls the managing director of administration John Hughes, 'Two firms of outside consultants told us that transferring all the systems and converting them in the timescale couldn't be done in businesses of this size.' Advance planning was clearly crucial. Even before talks between the two sides were publicly announced, the bidder had decided to make integration a joint exercise - with Henderson and Touche staff working together. Joint Integration Groups (JIGs) were established for nine main business areas, each of which was given simple control and management guidelines. Flexibility was maintained, though, so that the approach of each JIG could be varied. 'It is easy to overplan these things,' observes corporate finance manager Mark Lund. 'In many instances a one-page plan is sufficient, but in others a more detailed plan is required.' Good communications - vertically between JIGs and the overall steering group and horizontally between JIGs - ensured that operational problems were mostly resolved as they cropped up. There was also a strong emphasis on motivation, ensuring that good work was recognised and rewarded. Fred Kinahan, Henderson's facilities manager and the man ultimately responsible for co-ordinating the 15,000 man-hours (nine man-years) of relocation effort, believes the achievements of properly motivated people cannot be over-estimated. 'One of the major motivational factors for our team was when senior management took the time to thank them for doing a good job (and not just at the end of the project).' The unplanned-for invariably happens, as when the crane company due to remove Touche's four, one-tonne Kardex Lectriver mechanical filing machines let Henderson down. 'Our team showed great ingenuity,' says Kinahan. 'They dismantled each machine into several hundred parts, manhandled them out of the building and reassembled them at our office. What's more they still work and the cost worked out at 70 per cent less than the outside contractor.'</p>

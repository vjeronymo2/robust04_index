Tsiolkovskiy  Academy of Cosmonautics and the Russian Federation of  Cosmonautics, and chief of the head department of the Central  Scientific Research Institute of Machine Building of the Russian  Space Agency, under the rubric "Differing Opinions": "Where  Should the Spacecraft Be Sent?"; first two paragraphs are source  introduction]    [Text] These days, even the most deep-seated of  principles are being reexamined in every area of life. And that  goes for the space program, too -- a sector that has always been  the most important component of the domestic military-industrial  complex. Have the huge sums of money spent for the development  and launch of space gear been warranted? Do we need that gear  now? In what direction should the space sector in Russia be  developed, and should it be developed at all? The articles  printed here reflect two substantially different points of view  with regard to certain of those problems. And one must believe  that there are yet other points of view...  <H5>  `The Aim -- To Keep the Russian Space Program Intact' </H5>   Answering the questions of KHIMIYA I ZHIZN is the  vice-president of the K. E. Tsiolkovskiy Academy of Cosmonautics  and the Russian Federation of Cosmonautics and chief of the head  department of the Central Scientific Research Institute of  Machine Building of the Russian Space Agency, Professor V. P.  Senkevich, a doctor of technical sciences.    Khimiya i Zhizn: The space program is one of the  most expensive areas of human activity. The country has spent  vast sums of money on "space" over a period of decades. How  efficient and justified can one regard that spending?    Senkevich: First of all, I'd like to say that  those sums haven't been as great as one would think. In recent  years, the former Union spent about 1 percent of the gross  national product on the space program. When you consider that  the workers in the sector, along with their families, also make  up 1 percent of the country's population, then it turns out that  the same amount of money has been spent here, "per capita," as  in the country as a whole. Here are the figures for 1989, a year  that can be considered representative because there was none of  the current inflation back then: 6.9 billion rubles [R] were  spent on the space program; of that, 1.7 billion went for space  hardware for the national economy and science, 1.3 billion went  for reusable systems, and 3.9 billion went for space-based  military information systems. That is much less than the  unthinkable losses recorded in many other sectors of our  economy. Annual grain losses, for example, were R20 billion that  year; meat losses, 6 billion; and above-norm remainders of  material values, 247 billion. In that same year, by the way, the  United States spent $29.6 billion on space, $22.8 billion of  which went for "military" space.    As for efficiency, that's certainly not always measured in  rubles. It all depends on what kinds of goals are set for the  space program, and those goals have changed more than once over  the period of the space program's existence. During the cold  war, for example, space-related advances were regarded primarily  as the realm of the technical and military-political competition  of two systems. That situation existed until the early '70s,  when preeminence and prestige both for us and for the United  States began, by and large, to retreat into the background. Now  the principal criterion is, To what extent does this or that  advance satisfy the customer: defense, science, etc. The space  race has moved into the realm of technology.    By the way, our space hardware was built with a strictly  domestic component and instrument base: the Western countries  placed severe restrictions on the transfer to us of any advances  that could be used in space or other programs. Nevertheless, our  designers have almost always been able to satisfy the  requirements of the customers.    Be that as it may, we now have a strong inventory of  aerospace hardware. We have broad inventory of launch vehicles  capable of lifting 0.5-100 tons; we have built spacecraft for  various uses, and orbital stations; and there are in space  160-180 of our spacecraft, linked in some 30 systems. Their  operation is supported by a strong ground-based infrastructure  -- launch facilities, flight control centers, regional centers,  and receiving stations for space-derived information.    Unfortunately, the economic difficulties of recent years  have  also affected the space program. Operational scales in many of  its areas have been cut back appreciably. A system of production  cooperation decades in the making has been disrupted -- a system  in which more than a thousand enterprises were directly involved  in space activity and more than 2,000 enterprises and  organizations throughout the entire former Union were indirectly  involved. Spending for the space program in 1991 was cut back by  35%; in early 1992, before the state order was approved,  the  entire sector was actually frozen, and to pay wages (the average  current wage, by the way, is about 1.5-fold lower than the  average for all of Russia), almost all the enterprises had to  take out loans from commercial banks at enormously high interest  rates. Just a little more of this, and Russian will no longer be  among the greatest of space powers.    That's why recently we've been thinking seriously about cost  recovery of advances and about the possibilities of getting a  commercial return for the use of space hardware.    Khimiya i Zhizn: Does that mean that the space  program is also entering the age of market relations -- with  denationalization of property, privatization, and other facets  of market economics?    Senkevich: Phrasing the question that way would  probably be wrong as it relates to the space program. It would  be better to speak of commercialization, that is, about  attracting private capital, with state control, to economic  activity. That's what has long been done in the leading Western  countries -- there they strive to comprehensively expand the  market for the sales of aerospace industry products and for  services based on space systems. But even with that, it's the  opinion of foreign experts that a necessary condition for the  survival and growth of a space program remains the financial  support of its government.    We also see the future of our space program in the joint  activity of the state and private capital. True, we still have  many unresolved problems here -- specifically, there is  virtually nothing of the legal basis that is needed.  Nevertheless, we can at this point name the principal directions  being taken in the commercialization of our space program. They  involves things like, for example, the proffering of  communications services, the study of natural resources, the  monitoring of the environment and weather, the lofting of  various kinds of satellites into orbit, and the leasing of space  hardware.    Of course, it's still too early to be talking about billions  in profits from the space program -- right now we have to be  talking about, primarily, the cost recovery of individual types  of operations and about their commercial prospects. And those  prospects will depend on how vigorously and successfully Russia  enters the world space market. Right now, more than 130 states  are either directly or indirectly participating in it, and that  is the criterion by which the overall scientific-technical  potential of a country is assessed, and it would be worse for us  to fall behind here.    Khimiya i Zhizn: But do we have anything to enter  the market with?    Senkevich: According to American experts (and  we're generally in agreement with them), Russia has the lead  right now in roughly half of the areas involving space hardware.  We have today the most powerful rocket with a rather advanced  first stage -- the Energiya; we have what is for the time being  the only orbital station in the world, a unique compact nuclear  reactor for use in space, and extremely precise engines for  changing the orbit of a space vehicle. The U.S. Department of  Defense is very interested in many of our advances, and they  feel that the use of those advances would make it possible to  accelerate the implementation of the American SDI program by  about five years and save almost $2 billion. In other words,  that is the actual value of just those of our advances.    Thus, even the most developed countries are interested in  collaboration with Russia in the field of space technologies.  But on the other hand, they are, of course, guided primarily by  their own interests -- political and commercial. The United  States, for example, will obviously try to use the situation to  purchase more cheaply everything of value that Russia has, in  the process getting as far ahead as possible of Japan, Europe,  India, and China, but at the same time not allowing the  appearance of a serious competitor on the world space market in  the person of Russia.    Khimiya i Zhizn: But how about our internal market  -- will space products or space services appear on it in the  foreseeable future?    Senkevich: The space program is itself, above all,  a part of the internal market, and it is a big customer for many  other sectors. Building space vehicles requires metals,  plastics, ceramics, optics, communication systems, power  supplies, life-support systems, various kinds of gear, onboard  and ground-based computers, and many other things. Of course,  part of the budget appropriations earmarked for space goes to  pay for all that. In that context, it's very important that the  space program, more so than any other sphere of activity (save  for the nuclear sector), use the latest scientific and  technological advances and thereby serve as a powerful catalyst  for progress.    At the same time, the space program this very moment is  filling orders from the economy. That involves, primarily,  things that have already become customary -- space-based  communications, television broadcasting, navigation, and  monitoring of the Earth's surface for various consumers. In  space, we're already producing, on a semiindustrial scale,  single crystals, superconducting materials, and ultrapure  biomedical preparations. For example, single-crystal cadmium  telluride can be used for making x-ray sensors in medical  tomographs. As many as a thousand sensors can be made from one  crystal 20-25 mm in diameter. On the ground, it is extremely  difficult to produce high-quality single crystals; but several  kilograms of those kinds of materials have already been brought  back to the ground from orbit. By the way, a gram of  single-crystal cadmium telluride is worth nearly $1,800 on the  world market.    Finally, a third area in which we're active on the internal  market, one that is extremely important for the survival of the  Russian space program and for the entire economy as well, is the  transfer of space technologies to other sectors. For example,  the development of the reusable Buran spacecraft and the  Energiya launch vehicle involved the development of nearly 500  new designs and more than 100 new materials. Only 20 percent of  those advances have a narrow, specialized application; many of  the other advances are already being used in the nuclear,  aviation, and electronics industries, in the light and chemical  industries, in medicine, and so forth.    Khimiya i Zhizn: The representatives of your  sector have made those kinds of pronouncements more than once.  But I don't recall anything like ever being able to buy anything  made with space technology in a hardware store.    Senkevich: Suit yourself, there are plenty of  instances like that. Our enterprises and our technologies are  used to make refrigerators and cutters, televisions and  samovars, juice makers and electric shavers. Our sector is  offering the housing construction industry structural and  insulation materials, sealants, and so forth. We're offering the  power-engineering industry catalysts for removing the flue gases  at heat and electric-power plants. We're offering metallurgy  various kinds of refractories, and the auto industry, engine  valve seats made of aerospace materials (this technology was  used to make rocket nozzles). Permanent magnets with high-level  magnetic features are making it possible to greatly reduce the  sizes of various electric motors, electromechanical converters,  and so forth. Articles made of the carbon-carbon composite  material argolon are much stronger than the usual graphite  materials, and in an aggressive medium they withstand  temperatures of up to 500C and can be used in metallurgy,  chemistry, and petrochemistry. The antifriction,  self-lubricating material phenan, which is based on porous  bronze with special pore-filling polymer additives, remains  efficient in aggressive media of up to 600C and can be  successfully used in transportation, in farm machinery, and so  forth. And I could go on: I could talk for a very long time on  the possibilities for the use of space materials and  technologies in the economy. By the way, a special system is  being created in our sector now to facilitate that kind of  technology transfer.    Khimiya i Zhizn: From the very outset, the space  program in our country was under the strict control of  party-and-governmental organs in the context of a  command-administrative system. What does the structure of the  sector and the control of the space program's growth look like  these days?    Senkevich: Our space program, in fact, has always  featured a high degree of state centralization in its  management. But that's typical of the leading Western countries,  too. It is only because of the immense concentration of efforts  and resources that we have been able to achieve such tremendous  advances in going after our main goals.    And those advances would have been even greater if, in  approving principal directions to be taken and long-term space  programs and plans, the officials at the top had taken full  measure of the recommendations of the head institutes and  independent experts. What also hindered things considerably were  the excessive secretiveness, the lack of departmental  coordination among the consumers and the developers, and the  extraordinary monopoly that existed.    Nevertheless, the positive aspects of such an organization  of  operations managed to predominate. Virtually all the large space  projects (with the exception of the mission to the Moon) were  completed, although in the process deadlines were not always met  and budgets not always adhered to, and the specifications of  some items sometimes turned out to be below what was called for.  But one mustn't forget that the deadlines were often  unnecessarily strict, and the requirements, exaggerated:  aerospace systems, especially in the early days, were built at  the leading edge of what was technically possible, and no  command-administrative measures could have produced better  results back then.    As for today, the government of Russia recently made some  important decisions aimed at preserving and developing the  Russian space program as a sector important to the state. In  1992, the Russian Space Agency was formed, to develop and carry  out state policy in the exploration of space and to serve in the  role of general buyer of national-economy- and science-related  space systems and, with the Ministry of Defense, buyer of  dual-purpose systems. The agency has already prepared a draft of  the State Space Program for Russia for the Period Leading Up to  the Year 2000, the execution of which will preserve Russia's  position as a leading space power. The program has gone through  interdepartmental appraisal and is being examined in the state  commissions and in the government.    Khimiya i Zhizn: What areas in the Russian space  program today have been pronounced the most necessary?    Senkevich: The program is based on the need to  preserve and develop virtually all the main areas in today's  space sector.    In the field of national-economy-related space hardware,  that  pertains to the setting up of information-dissemination systems  (communications and radio and television broadcasting),  navigation, environmental monitoring, weather prediction,  warning of possible natural disasters, the study of the Earth's  natural resources, and, finally, the continuation of work to  perfect new space technologies and produce valuable materials in  orbit.    Science-related space hardware will be used to conduct  further systematic basic research in astrophysics, planetology,  geophysics, and other fields of science. Our plans to study Mars  and the asteroids are evoking a great deal of interest in the  world science community. Most of our science projects will be  performed in the context of programs of international  cooperation, including commercially based programs.    Space systems will also be used for purposes of defense. The  main job here, in accordance with the new defense doctrine of  Russia, consists maintaining the strategic stability that  exists. In that context, it is important to know that many  military space systems, complexes, and means are expected to be  used simultaneously for the national economy.    The program-specified operations for insertion systems and  reusable systems will be aimed at the technical retooling in  that area, one task of which is to preclude the use of toxic  fuel components and to give back to the national economy some of  the land that was taken out of production before to serve as a  drop zone for spent components. The Proton and Soyuz rockets  will be updated, and new rockets will be created. Considerable  attention will be devoted to choosing efficient configurations  of reusable systems and to the completion of the flight tests of  the Energiya-Buran system. Russia is performing joint work in  the space program with 18 countries. Some of the services  involving international programs will be proffered on a  commercial basis.    We hope that in the course of this program, our space  program  will soon assume again a place befitting it and will further  benefit hundreds of millions of people.

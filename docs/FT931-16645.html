			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: ECC selling Haul-Waste to South West Water IN THE latest move in its strategy to sell non-core businesses, English China Clays, the world's largest producer of china clay, is selling Haul-Waste, its waste disposal operations, to South West Water for a total Pounds 27.5m. The initial consideration is Pounds 25m cash, payable on completion, expected in early February. Mr Peter Elliott, company secretary, said that the payment of part or all of the balance would be triggered by the further availability of landfill sites. ECC announced in August that it intended to sell Haul-Waste, a waste management company which operates landfill sites and collects and disposes of dry and liquid wastes in the south-west of England. The August announcement prompted a 24p rise in ECC's shares to 481p. Yesterday they slipped 4p to 453p, while SWW's eased 2p to 487p. The disposal programme will enable the group to concentrate on its core industrial minerals and construction materials businesses. Mr Ken Hill, SWW finance director, said that SWW was buying 18 of 20 Haul-Waste's sites, giving nearly 12m cu m of void space, and that there were another 10 potential sites that ECC was excavating. He said the initial Pounds 25m was being raised by a private placement. Northumbrian Water Group has bought the Burnhills Quarry landfill site from Tilcon. It will use the site for the disposal of hazardous and restricted wastes. See Lex</p>

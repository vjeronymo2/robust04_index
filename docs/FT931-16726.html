			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Volksbank shares suspended TRADING in the securities of Swiss Volksbank was halted before the opening in Zurich yesterday at the bank's request in advance of an 'important announcement' tomorrow. Swiss stock market analysts said the troubled bank, Switzerland's fifth largest in terms of assets, was probably negotiating some form of collaboration with another bank, possibly even a merger or takeover. The bank itself would only say that the announcement would be positive. Last October, Volksbank said it would convert its capital structure from that of a co-operative into a joint stock company. Mr Rolf Beeler, the chairman, said the move would remove obstacles to co-operative agreements. The bank's fortunes have plunged in the past few years because of its excessive dependence on domestic customers, especially small and medium Swiss companies that have been hard hit by the current recession. Its net profit peaked in 1989 at SFr136.5m (Pounds 62m) and bank officials said in November that this year's result would be below last year's SFr68.4m because of the need for higher provisions against bad loans. Transfers from hidden reserves would exceed last year's SFr100m. The 1991 dividend was cut from SFr75 to SFr40. IBCA, the European rating agency, and Moody's Investors Service have both downgraded its debt in the past two months. Volksbank shares peaked in 1987 at SFr2,655, dropping to a recent low of SFr610. At that level, the market capitalisation of about SFr950m was well below 1991 year-end book value of SFr2.2bn. Last week, the shares rose from SFr680 to SFr755 in unusually active trading which may have led Volksbank to seek an early trading suspension. Mr Bernard Tschanz, head of investment research at Credit Suisse, said any of the big three Swiss banks would face heavy rationalisation costs to eliminate duplication of branches if it took over Volksbank. However, one of them might become interested in a defensive way if a foreign bank attempted a takeover. Swiss national TV news reported last night that Credit Suisse was interested in Swiss Volksbank, and that there had been board-level contacts between the two, Reuter reports from Zurich.</p>

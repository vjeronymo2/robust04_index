			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / People: Daks departure Harry Kuiper, a director of Daks Simpson, the clothing manufacturer and retailer, has resigned from the company after 19 years for 'personal reasons'. Kuiper, 55, was managing director of production at Daks' Larkhall factory in Scotland, and joined the board in 1981. Daks says it does not know Kuiper's plans. His resignation was 'quite unconnected' with other departures this year, including that of Johnny Mengers, the pony-tailed chief executive who had been with the company for 40 years. There was speculation that Mengers' departure resulted from friction between him and Sankyo Seiko. But the company insisted that the new Japanese owner had honoured its promise to preserve the management's autonomy.</p>

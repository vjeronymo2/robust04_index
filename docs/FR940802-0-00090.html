Further, the Department will not make such a determination unless the plan contains a written statement, signed by an authorized officer or other agent of the HA, certifying that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The dwelling units proposed to be allocated to Officers are situated so as to place the Officers in close physical proximity to other residents;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) No resident families will have to be transferred to other dwelling units in order to make available the units proposed to be allocated to Officers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The dwelling units proposed to be allocated to Officers will be rented under a lease that contains the terms described in &sect;960.509 of this part; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The number of dwelling units proposed to be allocated to Officers under the plan does not exceed the limits set forth in &sect;960.507(c) of this part or, in the alternative, any units so allocated in excess of the applicable maximum number are vacant units for which there are no Eligible Families. This certification on the part of the HA satisfies the requirements of &sect;&sect;960.507(a)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unit allocation table.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of the certification required by &sect;960.507(b)(4) of this part, the following table sets forth the maximum number of units to be allocated to Officers as a function of the total number of units under management by the HA:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,i1,s100,10 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Unit Allocation Table  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Total units under management  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Units to be allocated  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> &blank;&blank;500&hyph;999  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;1000&hyph;4999  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;5000&hyph;9999  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 15  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;10,000+  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 20  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The maximum number of units to be allocated by HAs with less than 500 units under management will be determined by the Field Office on a case by case basis.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=4 --> (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 2577&hyph;0185.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=4 --> &sect;960.509  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=4 --> Special rent requirements and other terms and conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The HA shall lease units to Officers under a lease agreement that is consistent with the requirements of this section and 24 CFR part 966. The requirements of this section shall take precedence if there is any inconsistency between them and 24 CFR part 966.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reasonable rent.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The lease shall provide for a reasonable rent, which may be a flat amount not related to the Officer's income. The HA should attempt to establish a rent that will provide an incentive to Officers to reside in the units but that is also consistent with the limited loss of income requirement of &sect;960.507(a)(4)(ii) of this part. As required in &sect;960.507(a)(1) of this part, the plan must state facts and circumstances (such as, the rent that would ordinarily be charged for the unit, the HA's annual maintenance cost for the unit, the degree of difficulty in attracting Officers to reside in the unit, the extent of the crime problem in the development, and the anticipated benefits of the Officer's presence) that demonstrate the reasonableness of the rent amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Continued employment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The lease shall provide that the Officer's right of occupancy is dependent on the continuation of the employment that qualified the Officer for residency in the development under the plan. The lease also shall provide that the Officer will move out of the leased unit within a reasonably prompt time, to be established by the lease, after termination of employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;960.511  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Applicability of the annual contributions contract; effect on the Performance Funding System.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Annual contributions contract.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except to the extent that eligibility requirements are exempted under &sect;960.505 of this part, public housing units occupied by Officers in accordance with a plan submitted and approved under this subpart will be subject to the terms and conditions of the annual contributions contract (ACC) between the HA and the United States of America. This subpart does not override any of the terms and conditions of the ACC except insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Performance funding system.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of the operating subsidy under the Performance Funding System (PFS) described in part 990, subpart A of this chapter, dwelling units allocated to Officers in accordance with this subpart are excluded from the total unit months available, as defined in &sect;990.102 of this chapter. Also for purposes of the operating subsidy under the PFS, the full amount of any rent paid by Officers in accordance with this subpart is included in other income, as defined in &sect;990.102 of this chapter. HAs may receive operating subsidy for one unit per housing development to promote economic self-sufficiency services or anti-drug programs, including housing police officers and security personnel. An HA may request consideration of such units in its calculation of operating subsidy eligibility through the appropriate local HUD Office.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Date: July 20, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Michael B.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sana' al-Imam from Damascus] </F>   [Excerpts] Syrian Information Minister Muhammad Salman has  said Syria is worried about an anti-Clinton campaign steered by  Israel and the Zionist lobby in the United States to pressure  the U.S. president into backtracking on understandings he  reached with President al-Asad in Geneva and preempting a  development in bilateral ties.    In remarks to foreign journalists, the minister emphasized  that Zionist pressure had neutralized the positive signals sent  by the Geneva summit. Clinton, according to Salman, has one of  two choices--either defend U.S. interests in the region and thus  put his career on the line, or give in to Zionist pressure and  so forfeit America's credibility.    Salman charged that Israel was out to exclude the United  States from the region by convincing it that its interests are  best served by Israel. He produced an American document titled  Syrian-American Cooperation to Combat Drugs in Lebanon, in which  the United States applauds Syria's anti-drug measures over the  past few years. Syria, Salman said, was bewildered by the drug  charges, especially seeing that it has been coordinating with  the Americans in the fight against these poisons. The pressure  on Syria, he maintained, is calculated to undermine its  negotiating position and split the Syrian and Lebanese tracks at  the talks with Israel. Salman contended that drug abuse and  trafficking in Syria are virtually nonexistent. He explained  that drug traffickers in Syria receive the death sentence and  abusers receive at least three years in prison. In contrast,  the minister said, drug abuse and trafficking were widespread in  the West, in particular in the United States. [passage omitted]</p>

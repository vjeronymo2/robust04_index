			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Installment No 141 of the serialized memoirs of Xu Jiatun: </F> "Xu Jiatun's Hong Kong Memoirs"]    [Text] From Hopes to Disappointment (Part Four of  Four) -- Jiang Zemin Opposes the Suggestion for the Leasing of  Hong Kong, With Lu Ping Actually Complaining About My Telegram    The subsequent continuous economic dispute was something  that  I had not guessed at the time would occur. At the time, I was  working to organize visits north by Hongkongers, in an attempt  to improve China-Hong Kong relations, give Hongkongers a better  impression of the new Central leadership, and restore  Hongkongers' confidence. So the general secretary's frequent  statements on particular Hong Kong matters, which were out of  line with Hong Kong's realities (at least not in line with them  completely), and which left no room for maneuver, had  deteriorated my image among Hongkongers to the point where I  could hardly understand it and was in great pain.    After 4 June, certain prominent figures in the mid- and  upper-levels of Hong Kong's Chinese-foreign financial  consortiums acted out of a lack of confidence in the CPC and the  Chinese Government to secretly brew up a so-called plan for the  "leasing of Hong Kong" from the Chinese Government for a decade  after 1997. This idea was actually a remake of Britain's plan  to "exchange sovereignty for administrative authority" that had  come up in the early Sino-British negotiations over the Hong  Kong issue. It differed on the return of sovereignty over Hong  Kong to China, with the idea of local Hong Kong financial  consortiums being for Hongkongers to "lease" Hong Kong, for  "rule of Hong Kong by Hongkongers," which would no longer be the  "rule of Hong Kong by Hongkongers" as provided by the Basic Law,  but would rather be the "rule of Hong Kong" by Hongkongers hired  or chosen by financial consortiums that put up the money for the  "leasing." The idea of certain foreign-invested financial  consortiums was for them to put up the money to "hire" or choose  certain people to "run Hong Kong." The second difference was  that this administrative authority was "priceless" at the time,  with some "offering" $100 million a year, and others $100  million pounds sterling.    They streamed to see me to explore this. The Hongkonger  financial consortiums acted mostly through their middle-aged  delegates, not coming out directly themselves, which was at  least my impression. For instance, when Mr. and Mrs. Su  Hai-wen [5685 3189 2429] came to see me together to talk about  the "leasing" matter, they had already openly published an  article in the paper, proposing a plan to "lease" Hong Kong from  the Chinese Government for a decade for $1 billion pounds  sterling. As to this couple's "proposal" to me, I guessed that  they had probably either been sent to me by Su Hai-wen's  father-in-law Pao Yu-kang, or had obtained his endorsement.  Certain figures from U.S. Japanese, and French business  circles also came to see me on this matter, making similar  "proposals." What differed here was that they were concerned  that the people to be "hired" by Hong Kong Chinese financial  consortiums to run Hong Kong would be Britains or of British  ancestry. But when I asked them who they would favor "hiring,"  they would not say, and talked evasively.    But whether they were Chinese or foreigners, I told them  that: 1) I would agree to report their requests to the Beijing  authorities. 2) This is an extremely sensitive matter, with  "very litle" possibility of being accepted by the Chinese  Government. 3) They should not continue to spread this,  particularly not discussing it further in the media or with the  press. (I was concerned about the public aversion.) When Jiang  Zemin became general secretary at the Fourth Plenary Session of  the CPC Central Committee, he came to talk with me, whereupon I  reported the situation to him. I saw that he was listening  with great interest so, after my report, I asked him: Should I  give him a report on it in writing? To which Jiang Zemin  replied very frankly, "yes, send a telegram." I then asked him:  "Should I also report it to Comrade Deng Xiaoping?" To which  Jiang Zemin noded his head and said "alright." Which was how I  returned to Hong Kong and sent a telegram to "the Central  Standing Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping."    During the Fourth Plenary Session, I neither went to the  Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Office, nor discussed this matter with  them. Before long, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office held a  meeting to discuss its Hong Kong work. Before the meeting had  started, Ji Pengfei bought up the telegram about this matter  during a chat in his office, which Lu Ping criticized harshly as  "the same old formula of turning traitor for personal gain!"  When Zhou Nan responded in kind, Ji Pengfei had nothing to  say. After the meeting, I happened to be walking along with Lu  Ping, so told him that I had sent the telegram because after my  oral report, Jiang Zemin had agreed that I should.    A few months later, Jiang Zemin again stated publicly in a  meeting with certain Hong Kong figures that he opposed this  idea. I was quite surprised, wondering why he had not responded  for so long. As Hong Kong interest in this matter had slackened,  why was the general secretary publicly responding to it again?  But I later learned that Lu Ping had complained about it to  the Central Committee, misreporting what I had said, by saying  that I had sent the telegram because Jiang Zemin had endorsed  the proposal. Which is why Jiang Zemin made this public  clarification.    So agreeing that I should send the telegram was turned into  an endorsement of the proposal per se, leading Jiang Zemin to  readily believe Lu Ping's one-sided account without  verification, and leaving me quite disappointed.    At the Fifth Plenary Session, Jiang Zemin gave a political  report, and Li Peng also gave a so-called important speech.  They raised high the flag of "improvement and rectification,"  in an attempt to obstruct reform and opening. Jiang Zemin's  political report "targeted" a new thing that had appeared in the  course of reform and opening--household operations, suggesting  the need to ensure that the so-called illegally rich "lose their  family fortunes." And township enterprises must be sharply cut  back.. with the majority at a group meeting of the Central  Advisory Commission taking a stand "in support of" the reports  by the new general secretary and premier, while others took  another stand, emphasizing the need to observe the law of value.  When the group director asked me to speak, I merely reported  on the situation in Hong Kong, without taking a positive stand.  But as to the "new policy" on household operations, I said  that since reform and opening, there had been only policy  provisions but no legislation on how to distinguish legal from  illegal, so suggested accelerated legislation. There was much  private discussion among those in attendance at this meeting,  with many holding that the formula favored by Jiang and Li was  out of line with current realities, so it would be hard to  implement. When someone asked my view, I responded that: "I  guess that it will not do, with possibly both local and public  resistance. But while it may cause many problems in local work,  things will get back to normal after a while."    This series of words and deeds by Jiang Zemin and Li Peng  left me more disappointed that I could say. I was worried  about both Hong Kong and the CPC!</p>

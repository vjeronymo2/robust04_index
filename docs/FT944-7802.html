			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Bigger and better?: Nato should be enlarged in step with the EU and WEU Just over a year ago, when the Clinton administration still hoped to discover a unifying theme for its foreign policy, Anthony Lake, the president's national security adviser, came up with 'enlargement'. Soviet expansionism had been successfully contained. Now was the time to 'enlarge' the circle of free-market, liberal democracies. That sounds good, but it gets trickier when applied to specific institutions. The thought that Poles or Ukrainians are enjoying freedom of speech is heart-warming. What is not so easy is to sign a treaty giving them the right to export cheap steel to western Europe, or to expect automatic military support in a war with Russia. The US is all in favour of enlarging the European Union, except that it is not a candidate for membership. It is more ambivalent about enlarging Nato, which would require the US Congress to approve military guarantees to central and east European countries. As for the Western European Union, few people in the US have heard of it. But then, few Europeans have heard of it either. WEU is a subject only for the cognoscenti, because until now its function as a military alliance has been subsumed in Nato. All full members of WEU are also members of Nato, which includes the US and has a military organisation to implement its guarantees. The question of what WEU would do if one of its members were attacked has therefore been academic. The Nato guarantee would be invoked first. But since the Maastricht treaty came into force a year ago, WEU has had another role as a 'defence component' of the European Union. Any member of the EU has, on paper, the right to full membership of WEU. It is not specified that the country in question must also be a member of Nato. So far that has not mattered because Ireland, the only present EU member not in Nato, has contented itself with observer status in WEU. But in six weeks three more non-Nato members - Austria, Finland and Sweden - will join the EU. They too will settle for observer status in WEU in the first instance, but are likely to take a keen interest in the EU's security role in central Europe and the Baltics. If WEU becomes a 'fourth pillar' of the EU in 1996, charged with implementing a common defence policy, some or all of these countries will want to be involved. That will be even more true of the central European countries in the next wave of EU enlargement, and of the Baltic states whose right to join that wave will be championed by Sweden and Finland. That means that, perhaps as soon as the end of this decade, west Europeans will be asked to guarantee the security of countries that were formerly Warsaw Pact members; perhaps even countries that were within the Soviet Union. It is no secret that these countries' interest in such guarantees arises from their experience of Soviet rule, and their fear that a Russian threat might reappear. In the case of the Baltics that fear is not far-fetched. Russian sensitivity about Nato enlargement is well-known. It was restated with vigour on Monday by Russian speakers at a Paris symposium on the proposed 'stability pact' between the EU and its would-be members in central and east Europe, better known as the Balladur plan. The idea of the plan is to use the central and east Europeans' eagerness for EU membership as a lever to get them to resolve their bilateral problems. That means recognising each others' frontiers as permanent, and undertaking to treat national minorities properly - something they are all prepared to do on paper, though getting some of them to implement their commitments may not be so easy. What is interesting is that the leverage appears to have worked in reverse. Edouard Balladur, the plan's author, declared in opening the symposium that 'everyone can see this (EU) enlargement is for us an imperative'. Not everyone would have seen that as an imperative of French policy before the plan was launched. Such statements make the prospect of eastward EU enlargement much more real. At the same time Mr Balladur warned against being over-hasty in enlarging 'security institutions, such as Nato or WEU'. The 'brutal inclusion of new countries in these alliances,' he suggested, 'could provoke more instability than stability on our continent.' Music to the Russians' ears. Eventually, though, the problem will have to be faced. The further east the EU expands, the more important its security dimension will become. To deny its easternmost members the right to participate in common security arrangements will prove an untenable position; and it would be dangerously incoherent to have a European defence union with some members allied to the US and others not. If Nato is to retain any credibility, it should be enlarged in step with the EU and WEU. One Russian speaker on Monday, Sergei Karaganov of Moscow's Europe Institute, seemed fairly relaxed about this prospect. He argued against expanding Nato now, on the grounds that an excluded Russia would cut off co-operation with the west and adopt a wrecking attitude to European security arrangements. But he was happy to let EU expansion take its course, even if it brought WEU and Nato expansion in its wake. Why? Because it will take time. By the time the terms and extent of EU enlargement are worked out, he implied, the struggle between westernisers and nationalists in Russia will have been decided one way or the other. I wonder. That struggle has been going on for three centuries at least. Can we really expect it to be decided within the next five years?</p>

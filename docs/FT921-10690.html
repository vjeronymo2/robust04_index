			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Letter: UK regulatory practice a poor example Sir, The past year has seen a number of regulatory disasters in the financial sector that do not speak well of British regulatory policy: BCCI, Lloyd's, and the Maxwell pension funds, to name but three. It makes a striking contrast that, in the US, regulatory systems intervened (or, in the case of Lloyd's, are in the process of intervening through legal and administrative action in New York and in Washington) to prevent and to remedy the worst of the abuses. One has to recall the Thalidomide tragedy, where, in its rush for profits, Distillers was allowed to market in the UK an unsafe drug while, in the US, sale of the drug remained blocked due to safety concerns on the part of the regulators. BCCI's directors, of course, did evade controls to the degree that they succeeded in buying control of two American banks. Yet American deposits were not put at risk; and, had they been lost, Federal deposit insurance would have protected depositors up to the realistic level of Dollars 100,000. If Maxwell tried to get at the Daily News pension fund he did not succeed; and even if he had, the Federal pension guaranty fund would have protected pension holders. Is America a less competitive nation because of these regulatory controls and investor and consumer protection? I doubt it. It is simply that in Britain there is a clubby atmosphere in which certain arrogant individuals and groups have influence in government and in parliament and are left do pretty much what they want. The problem is compounded by libel laws that stifle investigative journalism. Due diligence on the part of individuals could not reveal the risks and misdeeds: it must be the role of the state to level the playing field and in so doing to try to prevent ruined lives and personal tragedy on such a scale.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 12, BNS -- Estonia has done, is doing  and will do everything it can to apprehend the men who killed a  Russian border guard, Tarmo Kouts, director general of the  Border Guard Department, told BNS.    A Russian border guard was shot dead and two wounded on  April  1 in a skirmish near the Pechory (Petseri) railway station on  the Russian side of the temporary borderline. The two  assailants fled.    The tracker dog brought to the scene failed to pick up the  assailants' trail, so it is not known whether they came from or  fled to Estonia.    The two wounded border guards said the assailants spoke  Russian without a foreign accent and claimed to be former  Russian servicemen. The shots were fired from a TT pistol.    Kouts said Estonia has done everything it could and  everything "Russia asked for" to find the assailants.    "Russia hasn't lately informed us about the results of their  investigations, although we know they continue looking for the  men," Kouts told BNS. "We've been checking out our own theories,  and we've established a certain circle of people we'll go over  with a fine-tooth comb."</p>

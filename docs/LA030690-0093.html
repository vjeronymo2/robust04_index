			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UP TO 6,000 LAYOFFS SEEN AT SHEARSON;  </P> <P> WALL STREET: THE AILING COMPANY MAY CLOSE UP TO 50 RETAIL BROKERAGE OFFICES AS  PART OF A RETRENCHMENT, SOURCES SAY.  </P> <P> American Express Co. is expected to order a significant number of layoffs --  perhaps two or three times the 2,000 already announced -- at its troubled  Shearson Lehman Hutton brokerage unit in an attempt to stem losses, insiders  and securities industry analysts said Monday.  </P> <P> In the wake of American Express' announcement Sunday that it will buy all  shares of Shearson that it doesn't already own, the firm is expected to move  swiftly to streamline the unit. Definitive plans will await the outcome of a  strategic review of all of Shearson's business lines, announced last week by  Shearson's new chairman and chief executive, Howard L. Clark Jr.  </P> <P> But American Express is expected to deal with several obvious problem areas at  Shearson, including a real estate lending unit with big exposure to losses. The  unit, Balcor Co., which specializes in commercial real estate lending and  property management, has more than $110 million of non-performing loans on its  books but has reserves to cover losses of only $10 million. In the short term,  Shearson will probably have to make much larger reserves, while perhaps looking  for a buyer for the unit or winding down its loan portfolio.  </P> <P> The firm also has a $500-million short-term bridge loan to Prime Computer Inc.  that it has been unable to convert into marketable junk bonds. Shearson will  inevitably have to undertake some kind of refinancing of the loan. Lawrence W.  Eckenfelder, a securities industry analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, also  speculated that Shearson may soon substantially curtail unprofitable or  marginally profitable operations in Europe.  </P> <P> Sources also said Monday that Shearson is planning to close between 45 and 50  retail brokerage offices nationwide as part of a retrenchment that has been  under way since the firm acquired E. F. Hutton &amp; Co. two years ago.  </P> <P> The definitive word Sunday that American Express had abandoned longstanding  plans to reduce its stake in Shearson sent American Express' stock price  tumbling Monday as investors anticipated a continuing drag on the parent  company's earnings. American Express shares closed Monday at $27.50, down  $1.875, in heavy New York Stock Exchange composite trading of more than 3.4  million shares. It was the second most active issue on the NYSE. Shearson's  stock ended the day at $11.875 a share, down 62.5 cents.  </P> <P> Perrin Long, a securities industry analyst with Lipper Analytical Services  Corp., said the price that American Express is paying to public shareholders  appears to be fair. He said the transaction probably will be approved without  difficulty by a special independent committee of Shearson's board set up Sunday  to review the deal.  </P> <P> American Express currently owns about 61% of Shearson. The merger, through a  tax-free exchange of stock, was valued at $350 million. This will be in  addition to a cash injection of $750 million that American Express had already  announced and $250 million that it contributed to Shearson's capital in  December.  </P> <P> Shearson currently has slightly more than 35,000 employees, and the firm said  last week that it would lay off 2,000. Sources said the number inevitably will  be much higher, perhaps reducing Shearson to 30,000 employees by the end of the  year. "It's a logical conclusion that if you're going to be streamlining, you  don't just lose assets," one Shearson insider said. "You'll be losing people as  well."  </P> <P> The precise areas to be cut remain to be seen. While speculation continued that  American Express still might wish to sell Shearson if an attractive offer came  along -- or make some other dramatic move such as splitting up the retail  brokerage and investment banking units and selling one of them -- Eckenfelder  and other analysts said such steps are unlikely. They said Shearson could  probably return to profitability by concentrating on attractive operations in  both the retail side, which sells stocks and bonds to individual investors, and  the investment banking side.  </P> <P> Overall, the firm's retail brokerage business and certain aspects of its  investment banking business -- including, at least until recently, mergers and  acquisitions -- remain profitable. Eckenfelder predicted that Shearson's  management will examine each product and line of business separately, paring  selectively rather than making dramatic wholesale cuts.  </P> <P> He estimated that, taking into account a large writedown associated with  cost-saving measures, Shearson will post a pretax loss for its first quarter of  between $400 million and $500 million. Eckenfelder said that, even with  aggressive trimming of assets, it would probably take a year for Shearson to  return to profitability if the current downturn in the entire securities  industry continues.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Wang Yadong (3769 0068 2639), Li Houzhi (2621 </F> 0624 1807), and RENMIN RIBAO reporter Liu Shuiming (0491 3055  2494)]    [Text] Khartoum, 22 Jan (XINHUA) -- Sudanese President  Bashir said: Between Sudan and China, there are special  friendly ties that are different from the others and are growing  day by day.    Bashir made these remarks during an interview with Chinese  journalists at the Friendship Hall of the capital Khartoum this  afternoon.    He said: Sudan and China support and respect each other in  political issues. With China's support, Sudan has constructed a  number of projects and the Chinese people offer their support to  Sudan without attaching any conditions. China has never  interfered in Sudan's internal affairs; the recent friendly  visit of Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier and foreign minister,  has promoted bilateral relations to a new stage.    Bashir noted: Sudan has drawn up a long-term program for  economic development and it will face the Orient and open up to  Asian countries to develop its economy and overcome current  difficulties. Sudan welcomes investment from Chinese  entrepreneurs and hopes to expand its cooperation with China in  the economic field.    Speaking on Sudan's southern problem, Bashir stressed: The  southern problem is a political issue, which can only be solved  through political negotiations. As soon as the National  Salvation Revolution Command Council took power, it convened a  national meeting with participation of people from various  parties, seeking appropriate ways to solve the southern problem.  Following this meeting, it held peace talks with the opposition  forces of the south in Addis Ababa, Nairobi, and Abuja. The  protracted civil war in the south has harmed the interests of  the Sudanese people. The Sudanese Government has paid great  attention to the settlement of this problem through peaceful  means and has made unremitting efforts toward this.</p>

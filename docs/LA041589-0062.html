			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MAN HELD IN BEATING OF TWINS MAY BE RETURNED TO S.D. SOON  </P> <P> A 27-year-old man, arrested in Laughlin, Nev., Wednesday in connection with the  brutal beating last month of twin 2 1/2-year-old boys abandoned at a Del Mar  hotel, could be turned over to San Diego officials by next week, authorities  said.  </P> <P> Charles Thomas McCoy remained in Clark County Jail in Las Vegas on Friday  without bail on a felony child abuse warrant while San Diego County Sheriff's  Department detectives were interviewing him, authorities said.  </P> <P> If McCoy waives his right to a formal extradition hearing, he could be in San  Diego to face charges of felony child abuse within a week, said Linda Miller,  spokeswoman for the San Diego County district attorney's office. If he doesn't  waive the right, extradition takes about 30 days, Miller said.  </P> <P> McCoy, the former boyfriend of the boys' mother, Dorothy Denise Desimone, was  arrested at the Edgewater Hotel in Laughlin on Wednesday night by Las Vegas  Metro Police, who received a tip from Phoenix police that he was believed to be  in the area.  </P> <P> After the arrest, officers found a .38-caliber semiautomatic handgun and a  pound of a powdery, white substance believed to be methamphetamine in McCoy's  room, authorities said.  </P> <P> McCoy had been a fugitive since March 25, when the boys were found battered and  wandering in the halls of the Del Mar Inn by hotel employees.  </P> <P> Both of the boys suffered severe bruises to their stomachs and sides and  cigarette burns. They also suffered facial injuries from being slapped.  </P> <P> Desimone, 25, of Oceanside, was arrested March 27 by sheriff's child abuse  detectives at Children's Hospital when she tried to visit her twins.  </P> <P> Desimone denied any role in the incident at her arraignment March 29 on charges  of felony child abuse, child abandonment and inflicting corporal punishment on  the boys. She is being held in the County Jail at Las Colinas on $100,000 bail.  </P></p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Management: Jumping on the bandwagon The system of management and economic teaching which Russia inherited from the Soviet Union was at once narrowly technical and specialist and highly disciplined. Managers were taught little other than their specific skill - but mathematical economists were taken to very high levels of proficiency and theoretical abstraction. Missing between these two was a holistic view of the economy and an all-round conception of management. A large number of organisations have appeared to address this gap in the market in the past three years - ranging from national institutes to 'schools for survival' organised in hotels and even private flats. Indeed, the skills required by today's business people are, as Igor Bunin, director of a think tank specialising in management issues, says: 'More to do with finding one's way around a human and bureaucratic jungle than with profit and loss accounting.' The big institutes - such as the Institute of the Economy, the Central Mathematical Institute, the Institute of the Economy of the World Socialist System and the Institute of Economics and Organisation of Industrial Production - used to dominate the academic scene. In the last years of communism, smaller think tanks sprang up, where the young men and women who staffed the first wave of reform thrashed out their ideas. At the same time, often with western assistance, business schools were established on the base of an existing university department. Italian institutions seem to have been first in the field: in 1989, the Bocconi University Business School of Milan in association with Leningrad University formed the Leningrad Management Institute (now the International Management Institute of St Petersburg); and the Nomisma Institute of Bologna founded Mirbis, the Moscow International Business School. According to research by the Judge Institute of Management Studies at Cambridge University, most of the world's big business schools now have links, run courses or have formed joint ventures with Russian counterparts: a group of US colleges has begun a consortium for teaching Russian executives. The Russian Academy of Sciences, reeling from the cuts in its budget and constitutionally unable to respond rapidly to change, has been so slow to react that, in September, the Economics Ministry together with the committee on higher education said it was by-passing academia to set up or extend a Higher Economic School and an Academy of Contemporary Economics - both assisted with grants from the European Union. Alexander Shokhin, then the deputy prime minister for economics, said that Russia must quickly get into the position of offering 'the same level of education in economics as other leading countries'. Professor Yevgeny Yasin, a presidential adviser on the economy and something of a doyen of reform, will be dean of the new academy. He says: 'The initiative that we academics and professors are starting is not for us and our generation; it is for the students of today and tomorrow.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by B.I.W.: "Ready For a `Strike Until Victory'"] </F>   [Text] The Presidium of the National Committee [KK] of  "Solidarity" ["S"] stated that "the success of the 9 February  demonstration, the social support that was achieved, must not be  wasted." Today the KK will make a decision concerning further  action of the trade union. "Marian Krzaklewski stated that a  strategic strike would be possible; such a strike would force  the authorities to make decisions favorable to employees.  Nothing seems to show that this demonstration has made any  impression on the government, which we expected: There are no  preparations for talks or any serious corrections of the  budget," we learned from KK Press Spokesman Piotr Zak after the  Tuesday [15 February] session of the Presidium.    On Tuesday, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak replied to  Krzaklewski (who proposed negotiations in order to "avoid the  escalation of social tension") that "a bad tradition, inherited  from the former years, is the transferring of each conflict to  the central level." This is why their meeting "should be  preceded by a debate on the scope of the problems that may be  discussed in a different mode and that call for an official  meeting." He added that difficult problems should be resolved  "in a working mode" and that such talks are already being held  by the Labor Ministry.    For "S," Pawlak's letter is no answer, as it were. He  already proposed that they resume negotiations on social  guarantees, but, in this matter, "they presented their opinion  and submitted conditions that have so far been impossible to  implement."    What can a "strategic strike" be like? "We realize that it  is no longer the time or not yet the time for us to be able to  "galvanize to action" the entire country. However, we are a  well-organized and strong union and we are able to continue a  strike until we win. One can imagine, for example, the strike  of several branches or several regions of great importance to  the country, or a progressive strike in all the regions of "S."  Or merging all these three strike forms and demonstrations,"  says Zak.</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Green lobby appeals for Gatt reform UK environmental groups heading for the Earth Summit, which opens in Rio de Janeiro this week, launched at the weekend a series of attacks on free trade and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), the world's main trade watchdog, writes David Dodwell, World Trade Editor. Reports from the World Wide Fund for Nature, Friends of the Earth and the Green party argue that free trade encourages unsustainable development and serves the short-term business interests of multinational corporations, potentially at the environment's expense. They call for reform of the Gatt, with environmental protection being given higher priority than free trade. Trade liberalisation should be conditional on 'environmental impact assessments', and raw commodity prices should be raised to take proper account of environmental costs.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 26 (XINHUA) -- China is taking a  series of vigorous measures to boost employment of former  convicts, so as to give them equal opportunities to work.    Preferential policies will be granted to short-term firms  which mainly employ ex-convicts, according to a senior official  of the Labor Ministry.    Those enterprises will be entitled to priorities and  government support in terms of loans, sites, bidding, as well as  leasing of other firms, said Zhang Xiaojian, director of the  ministry's Employment Department, in an exclusive interview with  XINHUA here today.    The move highlights China's bid to care for ex-convicts --  in  work and living conditions -- and it will also help to maintain  social stability. The Chinese Government has always urged that  ex- convicts should be provided equal opportunities in  employment.    Zhang stressed that on no account should any enterprise  discriminate against ex-convicts in employment, adding that  those which violate the regulations will be prosecuted.    According to Zhang, China has established a unified and  coordinated system in creating jobs for ex-convicts, including  job- training and unemployment insurance provided for them.    China has already achieved marked results in this endeavor,  said the official. On average, over 90 percent of the  ex-convicts in Beijing are employed every year. In the cities  of Shanghai and Guangzhou, the employment rates of ex-convicts  are 64 percent and 72 percent respectively.</p>

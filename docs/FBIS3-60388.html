			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Paul Brown, Environment Correspondent: </F> "Sellafield Nuclear Discharges `200 Times the Levels Stated'"]    [Text] Plutonium 239, the most dangerous radioactive  substance, has been showered over the Cumbrian countryside for  the past 40 years in far larger quantities than previously  admitted, according to a report compiled by British Nuclear  Fuels.    The report, produced for BNFL last year but kept secret,  shows that in some years the people of Cumbria have unknowingly  had more than 200 times the quantity of cancer-causing plutonium  vented into the atmosphere around them than previously  acknowledged.    Scientific knowledge about the reasons children contract  leukaemia is still uncertain, but the only known cause is  plutonium, which when ingested, even in tiny quantities, is  attracted to bone and attacks the bone marrow.    The report detailing the excessive discharges is revealed  today in a Granada Television drama documentary Fighting For  Gemma, the story of Gemma D'Arcy who died just before her  seventh birthday of chronic myeloid leukaemia. The programme  traces her story and the so far unsuccessful fight by the small  team of solicitors who took on the state-owned company to gain  compensation.    The plutonium has been discharged routinely through a large  number of stacks on the Sellafield site while the company  reprocesses spent fuel to extract the metal for nuclear weapons  production and for future use as reactor fuel.    Calculations made for the company by scientists, using soil  samples from Cumbria and BNFL's own data from chimney filters,  show that in the 1950s and early 1960s more than 200 times the  previously revealed level of plutonium was routinely put into  the atmosphere.    Until now the amount of plutonium in mud samples and in dust  in Cumbria has been attributed to the half ton or so of the  metal which the company discharged into the sea over the same  period. It now appears that some of it at least has been  fall-out from the plant's chimneys.    The programme will embarrass the company and the Government  at a time when the decision on whether to go ahead with the new  Thorp re-processing plant at Sellafield is still awaited.

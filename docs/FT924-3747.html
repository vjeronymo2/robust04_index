			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Markets: Societies head for minefield on rates - Serious Money HOW WOULD you like your building society to judge your life style? That became a real possibility this week as the Bristol &amp; West revealed it was considering plans to charge different rates for new mortgages depending on the applicant's age and family status. This could make a difference of up to 4 percentage points in the mortgage rate paid by borrowers. In a move that might have been designed by Vice-President Dan Quayle, Bristol &amp; West's criteria are likely to favour the traditional nuclear family with two children over young, unmarried adults. The reason behind the possible change is the society's bad debt problem. B &amp; W has found that unmarried couples are 50 per cent more likely to fall in arrears than married ones. Couples without children are a future risk because their finances deteriorate quickly once they start a family. Older people are thought to be a better risk because they have had time to demonstrate a sound repayment record and also, perhaps, because their attitude differs from the young - of whom B &amp; W's chief executive, Tony FitzSimons, says: 'There is a generation that does not have the thrift mentality and does not fear losing their homes.' There is already some differential pricing in the mortgage market. Some societies offer lower rates to those borrowing over a certain amount; others restrict special offers to loans representing less than a given percentage (say 80 per cent) of a house's value. The amount you can borrow is, of course, linked to your income level. Such 'social' discrimination that has occurred to date has been only to exclude certain borrowers (those with a poor credit record, or lack of a steady job) rather than to charge differential rates. The principle is commonplace in the small business market, though. Other things being equal, a bank would much rather lend money to Tesco than to Fred the Grocer. Fred has to pay a higher interest rate to the bank to compensate for the greater risk involved in lending to a small business. And, in a free market, it might seem entirely reasonable for B &amp; W to adopt whatever lawful lending practices it desires. Indeed, it has a responsibility to its members to lend money prudently so that the rates paid to savers are not depressed unduly. It also sounds reasonable that those borrowers who do pay promptly and regularly should not be forced to subsidise those who are not so reliable. But these are murky waters. Discriminating between the married and the unmarried is one thing - but what if analysis of lending patterns were to show that Baptists were poorer risks than Anglicans? Or if one national group (let us say, Andorrans, to reduce the potential for hate mail) were found to be poorer payers than another? Would building societies then charge a higher rate on the basis of religious preference or geographical origin? Good free-market principles would state that lenders ought to be able to charge what they like. But the law would simply prevent any building society from discriminating on these grounds. So, we can dismiss the free market argument; it does not really exist in this area. Instead, we should consider whether a system such as that proposed by B &amp; W would, in fact, be discriminating against groups which the law does not protect. One obvious example is homosexuals. B &amp; W's references to young, unmarried adults sounds suspiciously, to an outsider, as code for this group. The society says it has no such intention and that, whatever scheme it eventually devises, it would have to be 'broadly acceptable in the mortgage marketplace.' It is, however, easy to see how apparently pure financial criteria could have discriminatory overtones. If, for example, single-parent families were to have poor repayment records (for understandable reasons), a lender might feel justified in charging such people more. But more women fit into this category, so such a policy would have the effect of discriminating on grounds of sex. This might not be too serious if B &amp; W were the only lender operating this system; those who felt excluded could simply move to another building society. But if differential pricing were to spread across the mortgage market, this could create a significant civil liberty issue. John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, feels that some form of differential mortgage pricing will appear in the 1990s. Building societies have had so many problems with bad debts that it is the logical course. 'I will forecast, quite confidently, that discounts for larger loans will vanish within a year because they have proved more risky,' he says. The societies will need to be very careful, however. Pricing a loan on the basis of a customer's credit record is fair enough; pricing on the basis of social stereotypes drawn from generalised statistical analysis is another matter, with many disturbing moral and legal implications.</p>

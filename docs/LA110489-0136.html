			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SIMPLE TRIBUTE TO SCREEN LEGEND BETTE DAVIS ON STAGE 18;  </P> <P> MOVIES: FRIENDS GATHER AT BURBANK STUDIOS TO HONOR STORMY ACTRESS WHO "REVELED"  IN HER STARDOM.  </P> <P> Bette Davis was in a class by herself, and so was the invitation-only memorial  tribute to her Thursday evening at the Burbank Studios on Stage 18. It was the  sound stage where she filmed six of the pictures she made for Warner Bros.  during a long tenure marked by legendary battles with Jack Warner over the  worthiness of material he chose for her.  </P> <P> It was, as David Hartman announced, a "no frills" occasion and in perfect  keeping with Davis's no-nonsense, let's-get-on-with-it Yankee spirit. Stage 18  was barren except for neat rows of folding chairs for the guests, some old  props, a camera and a couple of spotlights, and was all the more moving a  setting for being so unmistakably a workplace. No photographers were permitted.  </P> <P> Above a platform where Hartman, James Woods and Angela Lansbury spoke of their  friend and colleague, hung a screen for projecting film clips prepared for last  April's Lincoln Center tribute to Davis. To either side of the screen were  suspended three blowups of stills from some of her Warner films: on the left,  "Hollywood Canteen" and two from "All This, and Heaven Too"; on the right,  "Now, Voyager," "Jezebel" and "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"  </P> <P> Several superstars previously announced as attending were nowhere to be seen,  but that was all right too. Most of the people there actually knew and worked  with Davis and cared enough about her to come and pay their final respects.  Among those from Warner's -- and Davis' golden era -- were writer Julius  Epstein, director Vincent Sherman, editor Rudi Fehr, actresses Janis Paige and  Joan Leslie.  </P> <P> Clearly, those involved in the one-hour-plus tribute staged by director George  Schaefer were concerned with trying to live up to the high standards Davis set  for herself. There was none of the easy, impersonal sentimentality or the  self-congratulation that marks so many Hollywood tributes to its own.  </P> <P> Hartman observed that Davis unabashedly loved being a star: "She reveled in it,  she trumpeted it and she celebrated it." She admitted that to accomplish her  goals she had "to have the guts to be hated," he added. He noted that a wise  man once said that the most a person can hope to say of himself or herself is  that "I was here, and I mattered." There could be no doubt that Bette Davis was  here and that she mattered. Lansbury spoke briefly and informally of Davis'  "bravura acting of the first order."  </P> <P> Woods recalled the transforming impact of seeing "Now, Voyager" for the first  time and of experiencing the "naked emotion" that Davis brought to her acting.  He spoke of her compulsion to go beyond the horizon, of her ability to touch  "the fat lady in the fourth row" -- a borrowing from J. D. Salinger's "Franny  and Zooey" -- and make her -- and us -- say to ourselves, "I thought only I  felt that." He surmised that her "great power was that she knew who she was."  </P> <P> In a sense, Woods invited those who knew Davis to look beyond the  often-imitated trademark mannerisms -- the clipped speech, the punctuations  with cigarettes, the nervous gestures, the popping eyes -- and to respond to  the sheer honesty and unapologetic intelligence of Davis' portrayal of such  diverse characters as the middle-aging Broadway star Margo Channing, the hearty  but merciless Queen Elizabeth I and "Dark Victory's" ill-fated, gallant Judith  Traherne. Never before have Davis' heroines seemed so timeless.  </P> <P> The tribute climaxed with that enormously touching silent montage of Bette  Davis' face from countless films prepared for her 1977 American Film Institute  Life Achievement Award. It was followed by a recent color still of Davis,  accompanied by her off-key half-singing, half-talking of "I Wish You Love," the  one mawkish note she herself might have edited out. As the recording ended,  Robert Wagner got up and turned on a work light, signaling the conclusion of a  worthy celebration of an unforgettable woman.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Georgiy Sharonov: "Poor People's Party Is Being </F> Created"]    [Text] It was difficult to look at those who arrived  at the Forum motion-picture theater in the capital without an  aching sense of pity and empathy: elderly women in decrepit  clothing, old men with dried-out faces, disabled people on  crutches, blind people with guide dogs...    It would seem that the rosy-cheeked "reformers" have done  everything to crush these people, to take away from them their  last strength and their will to live. But those people, thrice  deceived, lied to, and robbed, nevertheless have preserved their  hope of getting a better share. They stood in line waiting to  sign the petitions, in order to support the idea of creating a  new party -- the Russian Poor People's Party (PBR). That idea  had been proposed by Nikolay Ayvazyan, leader of the Charity  movement.    What tasks does the PBR intend to resolve? First of all, the  task of uniting the efforts of all Russians, two-thirds of whom  have proven to be at the poverty line, in their search for the  quickest way out of the economic and political crisis. Secondly,  the task of defending the interests of the indigent and socially  unprotected segments of the population -- the workers, peasants,  and intellectuals -- who have become the victims of the woeful  experimenters. Thirdly, the task of consolidating the poor  people to carry out planned and persistent actions to defend  their legal rights and freedoms, and to strive for the  development and implementation of a state program to protect the  indigent. And, obviously, to render specific psychological and  material assistance to those who need it.    The first PBR congress will be held in May. But already it  has been announced that the payment of dues is not mandatory. If  this is the case, how will the party exist? In response to this  question, N. Ayvazyan answered, "There are a rather  large number of businessmen who are ready to take on the expense  of maintaining homes for disabled people, boarding homes for the  elderly, hospitals, and orphanages, to supply food products, and  give grants in aid for the downtrodden. But the exorbitant taxes  that are going basically into the maintenance of the apparatus  of officials who are no less rapacious than racketeers are  killing people's business initiative and stifling production.  The PBR will take actions to reduce and even abolish the taxes  for those entrepreneurs who take close to their hearts the  misfortunes of their compatriots and who engage dynamically in  philanthropy. People like this are already expressing today the  desire to provide material support to the Poor People's Party  and even to enter its ranks. And I understand them well: with  the situations that exist, they have the threat of ruination  hanging over their heads constantly. Where should they be, if  not in the PBR?"    The Poor People's Party is not planning to seize the power  or  carry out a revolution. But if it truly becomes a mass  organization, figures both in the legislative and the executive  structures will be forced to listen attentively to it.    The creation of low-level PBR cells has begun.</p>

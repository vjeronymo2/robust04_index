			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / UN tries to fix Angola talks date LUANDA was without mains water for a second day yesterday after rebel sabotage of the supply system left the Angolan capital of 2m with only bottled supplies, Reuter reports from Luanda. Diplomats said United Nations peace observers were trying to bring the military commanders from the MPLA government and Unita together in Addis Ababa later this week to discuss tattered May 1991 peace accords, but nothing firm had been set. One official said Unita had been hedging on a date. In Cape Town, South African foreign minister Pik Botha reported that Mr Jonas Savimbi, Unita leader, planned to send a delegation to the Ethiopian capital and was ready to sign a ceasefire. Mr Botha said Mr Savimbi had told him yesterday that he was ready 'to participate in the political process in Angola in a peaceful manner'.</p>

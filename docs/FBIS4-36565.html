			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 6 Jun (INA)--The Iraqi National Assembly  has appealed to the world parliaments and the international and  Arab organizations concerned with the health, environment, and  development affairs, as well as to popular gatherings, world  environmental parties, and the forces which love good and peace  to pressure their governments into playing an effective role to  lift the blockade imposed on Iraq.    In a statement issued today on the world environment day,  the  assembly pointed out that the Iraqi people are denied the  simplest requirements of life; namely, food and medicines, with  the full knowledge of the UN organizations. It also pointed to  the practices pursued by such UN institutions on the pretext of  protecting human rights.    The statement added that safeguarding the world environment  should emanate from curbing the U.S. policy which is hostile to  the world states and people. In this regard, the statement  pointed to the aggressive war against Iraq which destroyed  drinking water purification stations, sewage disposal stations,  fuel tanks, and oil wells. This resulted in the worst  environmental disaster in the world.    The statement stressed the need for consolidating and  continuing the efforts to safeguard both the environment and  public health as a prelude to lifting the unfair economic  blockade on the Iraqi people because it would be another  environmental and health gain on the international level.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Trans Dnestr embroiled in an ethnic tug-of-war: The disputed industrial region ON THE outskirts of the town of Bendery a member of the Trans Dnestr National Guard has put down his Kalashnikov to strum a guitar and take a swig of vodka. His post displays the old red and green flag of the Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic, complete with hammer and sickle. A crudely painted sign proclaims: 'Bendery is, was and will be a part of the Trans Dnestr Republic.' Less than a mile of fertile fields separate him from a dozen lightly armed members of the Moldovan National Guard patrolling concrete barricades. They fly the tricolour Moldovan flag, distinguishable from neighbouring Romania's only by the cross at its centre. The spray paint on this side says flatly: 'The Trans Dnestr Republic is not a state.' Over the past month the two sides have stepped up their struggle for control over the Trans Dnestr - an industrial region on the banks of the Dnestr river - with intermittent fighting which has claimed more than 50 lives. The Trans Dnestr, whose 730,000 inhabitants are 60 per cent Slavic Russians and Ukrainians and 40 per cent Romanian, is situated within Moldova, a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Moldova was part of Romania until the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop pact under which Stalin and Hitler carved up eastern Europe, and some 65 per cent of Moldovans are ethnic Romanians. In 1990, the Trans Dnestr authorities, fearing that the Moldovan government would soon seek unification with Romania, declared independence in the hope that this would force Moldova to adopt a federal structure that would afford Trans Dnestr the right of secession. This is unacceptable to Moldova, which is willing to grant the region wide political, economic and linguistic autonomy but is determined to oust the ruling Trans Dnestr authorities, viewed in Kishinev, the Moldovan capital, as 'bandits' who should eventually be put on trial. The skirmish threatens to escalate now that Moldova has hinted at its readiness to call on Romania for military support and Trans Dnestr leaders have appealed for help to Russia and to the Russian-controlled 14th Army stationed in the region. After a meeting earlier this week, the foreign ministers of Moldova, Romania, Russia and Ukraine called for a ceasefire. According to Ukrainian television reports, Mr Adrian Nastase, the Romanian foreign minister, said that if the ceasefire did not occur all four countries should deploy observers to the region. He also suggested that the Ukrainian military could be called on to maintain peace rather than the 14th Army whose sympathies for the Trans Dnestr forces made it inappropriate for this role. In the Trans Dnestr separatists have been bolstered by signs of support from Russian conservative politicians and the Commonwealth of Independent States' military command. Romania and Russia have supplied weapons to their respective sides. The Trans Dnestr forces procure their guns from the 14th Army using a novel technique - Trans Dnestr women storm 14th Army barracks demanding Kalashnikovs for their fathers, husbands and sons. Less than 70km from the fighting, the only hardship in the Moldovan capital of Kishinev is that restaurants close at 8pm, in compliance with the state of emergency declared by the Moldovan president. But Mr Ion Botnaru, a senior official at the Moldova foreign ministry, warned: 'Our former nomenklatura has moved to the Trans Dnestr. They say: 'From here we will begin the rebirth of the great Russian state.' 'If they win, they will set up a domino reaction of anti-democratic uprisings throughout the CIS.' In the Trans Dnestr capital of Tiraspol, which has dissolved into an anarchic city under siege where daily funerals of victims of the fighting are a sober counterpoint to the gay, occasionally drunk, roving bands of colourfully garbed Cossacks, a different view is favoured. Many Cossacks, mostly from southern Russia, see themselves as protectors of Russians living throughout the former Soviet Union, a task they would like the Russian government to assume. 'Who is going to defend the Russians in the Baltic, in Moldova?' asked Mr Nikolai Mastrykov, a Cossack leader from the Russian city of Krasnodar. 'We will defend them. (Russian President Boris) Yeltsin is not defending them.'</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Sterling trade quiet AFTER A busy period in the sterling money market dominated by the Bank of England's  1/2 percentage point base rate cut on Tuesday, dealing resumed a much calmer tone yesterday. The volume of futures trading was exceptionally small. The combined trade in both the June and September short sterling contracts hovered around 16,000 lots yesterday. 'On a normally quiet day, trading in a front month contract would never be less than 18,000 to 20,000 lots,' commented Mr Nick Parsons, head of the Treasury Advisory Group at CIBC in London. 'But the general mood is that this level of base rates will be here for some time to come.' June short sterling ended the day at 89.93, implying that interest rates in June will be at 10.07 per cent. Traders believe that the floor for short sterling is now 89.88, indicating an interest rate of 10.12 per cent in June. 'The knowledge that interest rates will not go up means that nobody will sell it any way below that,' said one trader yesterday. In the interbank market there was only a little movement in period rates. Most of them, in the immediate aftermath of Tuesday's cut, were at 10 1/8 per cent. Yesterday, rates for everything from two months money to six months firmed up to 10 3/16 per cent. One week money was at the easier rate of 10 per cent, after forecasts of a much smaller shortage in the discount market for the first half of next week. Yesterday morning, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of around Pounds 1.05bn in the discount market. In early operations, the Bank purchased bills totalling Pounds 275m for resale to the market on May 27 at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent. In further operations, the Bank purchased bills totalling Pounds 262m, of which Pounds 200m were Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 62m were for resale to the market on May 27 at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent. The bank operated in the market in the afternoon, purchasing Pounds 147m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 10m of Band-2 bills at 9 7/8 per cent. In the German money markets, attention focused on the Bundesbank's decision to sell DM19.3bn of 28-day funds and DM7.8bn of 56-day money at 9.65 per cent, a rise of 5 basis points on previous rates.</p>

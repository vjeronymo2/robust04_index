			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Izzat 'Abd-al-Mun'im and Fatimah Mahmud Mahdi] </F>   [Text] Every year, the State allocates millions for the  Public Service Project despite its many negative aspects. In  particular, the project fails to make good use of the inductees,  assigning them to locations unbefitting their specialties. It  is also deceptive and superficial and the graduates who run it  lack conviction. A whole government agency was created to  administer the project. A High Commission for Public Service  under the chairmanship of the minister of social affairs has  been formed of the undersecretaries of the Ministries of  Planning and Local Administration, as well as of representatives  of the Central Agency for Mobilization, the Supreme Council on  Youths, and other agencies concerned with Community Service and  with implementing Public Service Law in the districts and  governorates.    Because Public Service is considered a "prerequisite" for  employment, graduates view it as a year to waste for no purpose  except to secure another job credential. Even though there have  been calls to improve the project or abolish it altogether, and  even though proposals have been submitted to that effect,  nothing has changed and the project continues to exact funds and  costs with no tangible benefit.    We solicited opinions from a group of female graduates who  have been required to perform Public Service.    Suha Muwafi, BA in English Literature, said that "the  newspapers reported that Public Service applications were being  accepted for a limited period of time. I reported to the Public  Service Bureau in my bailiwick where I was given an identity  card and referred to their main office. I encountered several  problems of red tape before I was assigned to a charitable  health clinic. Such work, of course, does not fit in with my  qualifications but, what can you do?"    She added that based on her experience, the year of public  service should be considered as a year out of work. "I neither  benefit my place of work nor do I benefit by it. It is my view  that the system should be amended in order to match the  assignment to the college major."    Ghadah Muhammad 'Ali, a College of Commerce graduate, who  said that she was assigned to work at a cooperative society,  described being in the service as a very difficult period and  called for an amendment to the law that would help realize the  purpose of the plan.    Muna Sayyid Muhammad, BS, advocated termination of "this  system which lacks any redeeming value."    'Afaf Yusif, BA in history, pointed out that she was taken  by  surprise after she was drafted when her period of service was  extended an extra month because she never reported to the Public  Service Bureau to collect her remuneration of four pounds. Her  failure to do so meant an extra month of service.    'Ubayr Hamdi, a law school graduate, demanded that the plan  be rendered voluntary and not compulsory. She said that she  secured an exemption from public service because it would have  meant the loss of a suitable job opportunity at an attractive  salary.    Suhayr Husayn, a 1993 Commerce graduate, added that she has  no desire to do public service work because her friends have  told her many stories that discourage any such inclination. She  said that she would seek an exemption, which she heard could be  obtained by submitting a request to the Ministry of Social  Affairs. The ministry no longer makes things difficult and  readily agrees to grant exemptions in order to save the funds it  pays female graduates for going into service. She called for  abrogating the project.  <H5>  No Discernible Value </H5>   'Alya' 'Abd-al-Mun'im, BA, said that her service at a  cooperative society was incompatible with her degree. She  believes that the service has no discernible value and merely  delays female graduates from realizing their aspirations.    Classmate Wafa' Mustafa, with a degree in literature, added  that people in service do not get paid enough to cover their  cost of transportation to their places of work, and public  service therefore imposes an additional financial burden on  women graduates, who must pledge in writing not to accept other  employment when in public service.    Hanan Radwan, BA in Arabic literature, said that she was  performing public service at a charitable health facility, even  though the assignment is a hardship on her family. She is  married and has a child that must be looked after. Serving at a  charitable clinic means working a night shift that sometimes  extends to midnight, making it difficult for her to perform her  maternal duties. She added that she did not wish to perform  public service, but had to because she would be required to  produce service or exemption documentation before she can secure  employment.    She said that exemptions could be secured through patronage,  which she lacked, and consequently could not obtain the release.  <H5>  Useful Projects </H5>   Graduate Usamah Zuwayl advocates that the year of public  service be spent on useful endeavors such as assigning a  graduate to reclaim a tract of desert land which he or she would  then get to own for a reasonable price.    Amal Fu'ad, a commerce graduate, said she was frustrated by  mistreatment and repeated insults and threats by those in charge  of the service who insisted that she do all the work.    Manal Hasan, BA in cooperative agribusiness sciences,  believes that the existing public service system is a failure  and pointed out that she gained no benefit or skill from her  assignment, even though she is nearing the end of her term. She  calls for amending the system and abolishing the prohibition on  employment during the period of service, since it pays very  little and is not considered a real job. She suggested that the  skills of inductees be utilized in a manner that would increase  productivity and therefore raise their income.  <H5>  Dearth of Planning </H5>   Thurayya Fahim, a public service specialist, believes that  public service inductees are considered to be from the ranks of  the unemployed and those to whom they are assigned sometimes  refuse to allow them work. The solution would be for the female  graduate to show up merely to sign in and no more. This reflects  a lack of seriousness and control and the absence of necessary  planning and coordination. Inductees are often assigned to  locations teaming with employees without regard for major or  field of study.  <H5>  Patriotic Duty </H5>   Dr. Ahmad 'Umar Hashim is vice chancellor of al-Azhar  University and chairman of the People's Assembly's Religious  Committee--one of the committees that debated the public service  issue. He believes that "public service is required of every  citizen, be he an employed youth or otherwise, since it is a  patriotic duty. The Service should focus, in my opinion, on the  fields of health, public safety, social work, and rural  development. These, as well as the eradication of illiteracy,  are areas where public service could play an important role,  provided that they are fruitful and of benefit to society."    When we asked for comments on the manner in which public  service is being implemented, Mr. Sayyid 'Abd-al-Hadi, director  of the Public Service Administration at the Ministry of Social  Affairs, first requested the permission of ministry officials  then begged off after those officials refused to allow him to  talk.    The question we now pose to Dr. Amal 'Uthman, minister of  insurance and social affairs, is why all this secrecy about  ministry operations, which are for the most part social in  nature? Experts with specialized national councils point at a  number of negatives and impediments that surfaced with the field  implementation of public service. Most significant among those  is that local public service committees in the governorates are  not serious enough and therefore are not implementing the plan  with the required integrity. In most cases, the authorities do  not control the inductees, making them carry out their  assignments with due diligence and, thereby, properly utilizing  their energies and contributions. Then there is the problem of  over-induction in certain governorates, but not in those most in  need. Cairo, Alexandria, and al-Jizah governorates account for  nearly 60 percent of all inductees, but this ratio drops to 3.2  percent in al-Minya, 2.3 percent in Asyut, and 1.2 percent in  Suhaj[this one is correct, I know that this has been spelled a  million ways, but go with this one], which is one of the most  densely populated governorates of Upper Egypt. Isma'iliyah  governorate accounts for only 0.8 percent of, Suez for 0.6  percent, and Matruh for 0.1 percent.    Experts point a finger at the lack of funds to remunerate  inductees and issue them incentives, at insufficient allocations  for athletic and social activities, and at inadequate  appropriations for training and for incentives to Public Service  Administration workers.    Public service agencies also suffer from not having defined  their needs of inductees, forcing them to mete out assignments  without previous planning. The result is that some inductees  complain of being assigned to units where they have no real  work. Certain public service units complain of the overabundance  of assigned inductees, while others suffer from dearth.  <H5>  Evaluating the System </H5>   The public service issue was studied by two commissions--one  organized in 1978 by the Central Agency for Organization and  Administration, and the other formed of the Committee for Social  and Religious Affairs and Endowments and the bureaus of People's  Assembly committees for Youth, Defense, National Security,  National Mobilization, and Labor Force. Their purpose was to  evaluate the Public Service system and identify the problems  that prevent it from realizing its objectives. They set out to  do that by evaluating the most important aspects of the Public  Service system, such as those dealing with drafting and  qualifying graduates, with working conditions at their places of  assignment, their remuneration, and other matters relevant to  identifying the extent to which units have need for, and benefit  by, the inductees assigned to them.    Those studies, which included some field trips to the  governorates of al-Minufiyah, Isma'iliyah, and Port Said,  concluded that the Public Service System, as it now stands, is  in need of improvement and enhancement.    Experts with specialized national councils proposed a link  between the Public Service System and the placement of surplus  graduates on the basis of their level of education. That would  help utilize those with intermediate and higher education in  areas and spheres that match their disciplines or in fields  where society needs more workers than it can attract, such as  police work, nursing, and teaching. The majority of inductees  would be assigned to help in the eradication of illiteracy  within the framework of a comprehensive national illiteracy  eradication strategy that would be implemented over a specific  period of time in cooperation with the Ministry of Education.  <H5>  The Failure to Eradicate Illiteracy </H5>   Ms. 'Inayat al-Fiqi, director of the Ministry of Education's  General Administration for Adult Education and the Eradication  of Illiteracy, spoke about the role of Public Service inductees  in eradicating illiteracy, one which many believe could be  fruitful. She said that Public Service inductees are accused of  having a lack of seriousness about their work and of a lack of  adequate commitment. "Consequently, we now exclude Public  Service inductees from our illiteracy eradication programs. We  used to seek their help in the past but that proved to be  futile."  <H5>  The Wrong Method </H5>   Dr. Sawsan 'Uthman, dean of the Social Services Institute in  Shubra, believes that the methodology of the Public Service  draft is faulty and accomplishes no positive results. She  proposed that public service "target once every year a specific  national goal, much as China did for the eradication of  illiteracy and Cuba did about the sugar crop. Public Service  performance should be characterized as being diligent, and  controls should be instituted to guarantee that goal. We find  that 40 percent of public service inductees are exempted [from  service] by the Minister of Social Affairs. Another 40 percent  register on paper only. Those who actually go to work and  produce account for no more than 10 percent."    Dr. 'Ali-al-Din Muhammad, the Institute's assistant dean,  emphasized that planning is important, in order to identify  those with more need for inductees and to ensure that the latter  "are assigned in accordance with their fields of study because  the current method of assignment simply turns them into idle  capacity."</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Economics Notebook: Aux armes, consumers - France wants its people to spend France's consumers are being called to arms to help lift the country from recession. But measures to boost household spending to be presented to the cabinet this week as part of next year's budget would be more persuasive if consumers were not still digesting the effects of earlier tax increases and if the continued rise in unemployment was not sapping confidence. A recovery in household spending is certainly necessary if France's escape from its economic slump. Household consumption suffered a sharp fall of 0.7 per cent in the first quarter. It rose by 0.4 per cent in the second quarter, but most economists describe this as an unsustainable correction rather than a rally. The zero rate of inflation in August and a series of gloomy surveys of the retail sector indicate the fragile state of domestic spending. 'An increase in demand, particularly from households, is now an important means to aid the economy,' says an official at the French finance ministry in Paris. Economists are blunt. 'Consumer spending is the only hope for economic recovery,' says Mr Paul O'Brien, economist at Morgan Guaranty in Paris. 'Investment won't recover without it, and external demand remains weak.' The response of the French government has been to reach for the fiscal levers. The budget measures will include a FFr19bn (Pounds 2.16bn) cut in income taxes, aimed principally at the middle classes. The reduction, says the government, will be achieved through a reform of the country's complex system of tax bands and will apply to income earned this year. Officials indicate that half of income tax payers will see their bills reduced by at least 10 per cent after the reform. At the same time, the government plans to allow private investors to withdraw early from eight-year personal savings plans while maintaining the tax advantages and interest payments of the scheme. The measure will be included in the budget, but is expected to be retroactive from the end of this month. The finance ministry says such savings plans currently hold about FFr300bn. The reform will apply to individual investors who do not pay income tax. But with more than 40 per cent of French households included in this category - because the bulk of French taxes are raised through indirect means - about one-quarter of the total amount in PEPs would be covered by the measures. 'This is a potentially powerful way of shifting the balance of household funds towards consumption,' says one Paris banker. Already, the government has sought to ease the pressure on consumers by one-off measures. At the beginning of this month, for example, the state increased from FFr400 to FFr1,500 the payment to families with schoolchildren to help cover the costs of the return to classes. The increase, for lower and middle income families, is estimated to have involved an additional FFr5bn of government expenditure. The government is not alone in wooing French consumers. The Caisse d'Epargne de Paris said last month that it would reduce its minimum borrowing rate for consumers by three percentage points to 9 per cent from the beginning of October. Credit du Nord and Credit Lyonnais have since followed suit. The banks are acting in anticipation of lower interest rates, despite the government's glacial pace in reducing borrowing costs since the European currency crisis forced the effective flotation of the franc at the beginning of August. 'They expect interest rates will come down, and they are seeking to gain market share in advance,' says one French banker. But despite this array of appetisers, consumers may not be tempted, either by the banks or by the government's exhortations. Part of the problem is that French consumers are still coming to terms with an increase, from 1.1 per cent to 2.4 per cent, in the Contribution Sociale Generalisee, a special tax on all revenue. This increase took effect at the beginning of July, along with an increase in taxes on petrol, alcohol and tobacco. 'These items are fairly price inelastic' says Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, French economist at Salomon Bros. 'Households are therefore likely to spend less on other items to compensate. Nor are lower interest rates entirely good news for consumption. A study published last month by the Bank of France estimated that a 1.5 percentage point cut in long term interest rates and a 3 percentage point cut in short term rates would cut household income by FFr50bn, leading to a 0.5 per cent fall in consumer spending in the first year and a 0.2 point fall in the following year. Economists, however, still believe lower rates are necessary to revive consumption and the French economy. 'The most important function of interest rates is as a relative price between savings and consumption. A reduction will therefore boost spending,' says one economist at a Paris-based bank. Perhaps more importantly, reduced interest rates could ease the root problem facing French consumers - the relentless rise of unemployment, currently at 11.7 per cent, and the resulting loss in economic confidence and increased precautionary savings. According to the Bank of France study, the effects of their notional reductions in interest rates would knock FFr40bn off companies' annual interest payments. By easing pressure on the balance sheet, it would also ease pressures on their payrolls. Without an improvement in unemployment, few economists expect a rapid recovery in consumer confidence. 'If you think your job is in danger then you are reluctant to consume,' says Mr Mercier at Salomon Bros. In addition, the depressed labour market has kept real wage increases, and hence purchasing power, flat. If the French monetary authorities can guide real interest rates lower, cutting the key intervention rate a few percentage points below its current level of 6.75 per cent, then economists forecast a revival in spending. Until then, however, consumers may be reluctant to take their hands from their pockets.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Dutch government accepts terms of Fokker takeover THE DUTCH government has accepted the terms set by Deutsche Aerospace for its planned takeover of the Fokker aircraft manufacturer, the German company said yesterday. The final hurdle was overcome after Dasa, a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, apparently offered a compromise proposal to its earlier plans for redundancies and capacity and production cuts. The deal, which must be approved by the companies' supervisory boards and the European Commission's competition authorities, concludes a negotiating round dogged by last-minute complications. Most of the problems stemmed from Dasa's insistence that a provisional agreement to take a 51 per cent stake in the Dutch group, signed last October, should be renegotiated in the light of dete-riorating market conditions. Fokker shares lost a quarter of their value 10 days ago after the group asked the state-owned Nationale Investeringsbank for a loan of up to Fl 1bn (Dollars 534m), in case the takeover fell through. 'With this agreement almost 80 per cent of the funds made available immediately by Dasa will go directly to Fokker,' the German company said in a statement. 'The injection of more than Fl 900m into Fokker puts its financial future on a secure foundation'. However, the statement gave no details of the weekend offer on capacity and job cuts which clinched the deal. Mr Koos Andriessen, the Dutch economics minister, said last week that he could not accept Dasa's earlier demands for 'open-ended support' for redundancy programmes. Under the terms of the deal approved in the Hague yesterday, Dasa will pay Fl 30 each for 13.4m new Fokker shares. Meanwhile, the Dutch government's 31.8 per cent stake will be bought in two stages. The first tranche will be bought immediately for Fl 30 a share, raising Fl 156m, and the second after three years. The price for the second tranche will depend on Fokker achieving certain profit targets. Under the original agreement, Dasa undertook to pay Fl 37 a share for its stake. Yesterday's statement said the acquisition of the controlling share in a new Fokker holding company was an important step on the way to building a competitive regional aircraft business in Europe. While the German group is anxious to develop a European consortium specialising in regional and commuter aircraft, it has bargained hard to avoid reliving the embarrasment it suffered when it bought the Dornier business only to have to refinance it shortly afterwards.</p>

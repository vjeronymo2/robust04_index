			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVABLE FEASTS: UNEVEN TAKE-OUT PALACE IN WEST HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> A small cafe with quite a few selections, El Abasto has a checked floor so  glossy you could set a Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth tango scene there. And,  the fact is, it does have a handful of things that could make you get up and  dance. But it's the blacks and whites of the menu that stay in my mind when I  think of El Abasto, the little Argentine take-out palace in West Hollywood --  those that are wonderful dishes and those that I'd banish from my door. Named  for famed tango musician Carlos Gardel's hangout in Buenos Aires, El Abasto is  owned by the same people who run the more elaborate Argentine-Italian  restaurant, Gardel's, on Melrose Avenue.  </P> <P> As at Gardel's, the most fully realized offerings are the appetizers and the  desserts. Lovely empanadas, the traditional hand-worked pastries with braided  edges, come filled with a cumin-scented mixture of either chicken or beef with  olives and chopped hard-boiled eggs. They're $1.50 apiece. The deep-fried  calamari is another good way to begin and, even when re-heated (which it really  needs to be), remains crisp and light. Grilled sweetbreads set on a bed of  spinach fettuccine were notably tender and, for $4, could make a full and very  cheap meal. Yellow, red and green roasted peppers, also $4, are the best way to  eat your vegetables here. Grilled chicken wings are plainer than plain, even as  a foil to the chimichurri herb sauce.  </P> <P> The salads are the nadir of the menu. Too many use canned pimentos, artichoke  hearts or hearts of palm which impart that unmistakable and awful citric-acid  edge. The vegetable and the meatball soup (which is really the vegetable soup  with a great big juicy meatball plopped into it) both have too much cooked  green pepper for my taste.  </P> <P> There are seven pasta selections: Canelones salsa blanca, handmade canelloni  stuffed with beef, spinach and ricotta ($7) was particularly delightful and  cloudlike. Noquis al tomate, the South American gnocci equivalent, come wrapped  in a clean marinara sauce. Dumpy as can be, they are, charitably, a filling  dish for a rainy day.  </P> <P> The meat is, well, you won't think you got your takeout from the Palm. I would  skip most of the chicken and beef: This is tough protein territory. Pollo con  ajo tastes as if it were mainlined with garlic and, even for the garlic-lover,  it's just one, long, uninteresting note. One dish, the parrillada, the "typical  Argentine barbecue," is a more welcome parade of meats. The lively peppery  sausage and the meaty, chewy, seared ribs are the best things on this $10.95  platter (really for two, unless you're a black-belt carnivore). For the  adventurous, there's a dark, fat blood sausage tucked in. French fries  accompany many of the entrees, arriving home in a fairly soggy state but  tantalizingly absorbing the fragrance and juice of the meats.  </P> <P> El Abasto's sandwiches are simple, delicious and made on the crustiest breads.  That yummy meatball (encountered first in the soup) and that peppery sausage  (of parrillada fame) are both fine tucked between slices of bread. The  prosciutto sandwich ($6), on a crunchy baguette, is also tasty but beware:  Unless you like your prosciutto with butter or mayonnaise -- I don't -- let the  staff know in advance.  </P> <P> You could have a fine meal with the appetizers and desserts alone. In any case,  do not miss the lush Argentine sweet, panqueques con dulce de leche. El Abasto  makes the real thing: crepes bathed in caramelized milk. The very light,  not-too-sweet flan is also a good choice. It comes flooded with pure caramel  and fresh whipped cream. After that, it might not be a bad idea to put on  "Tango Argentino" and dance off those South American calories.  </P> <P>  El Abasto, 809 N. Palm Ave., West Hollywood. (213) 652-1251. Monday-Saturday,  noon-9 p.m. Closed Sundays. No credit cards. Personal checks accepted. Street  parking. Dinner for two, food only, $20-$43.  </P> <P> </P></p>

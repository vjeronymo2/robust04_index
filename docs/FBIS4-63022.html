			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Not on the List Again"] </F>   [Text] ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA readers have been surprised by  the absence of any official reports on the appointment of  Democratic Party of Russia leader Travkin as a Russian  Government minister.    We have established why the editorial office has not  received  the official text of the Russian Federation president's edict.  It was explained to us at the relevant President's Staff organs  that our newspaper was not on the distribution list for this  document.    Unfortunately, this is not the first instance of the  editorial office's failing to receive certain official  documents. We would like to recall once again that a procedure  has been laid down whereby publication of Russian Federation  presidential and government acts in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA is an  official basis for the documents' coming into force. Just which  negligent civil servants should be reminded of this?</p>

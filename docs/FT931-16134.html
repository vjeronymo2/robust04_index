			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Capel survey suggests shares may be underrated A FORECAST of 6 per cent per annum dividend growth in the medium term suggests that UK equities are currently under-rated, says James Capel. However, in its report, entitled Dividend Growth - the Key to Outperformance, the stockbroker goes on to say that if dividends rise by less than 5.5 per cent on average, the stock market could fall. The report, based on a survey of 200 leading companies and institutional investors, produced a consensus that UK dividends would grow by 6 per cent a year in the 1990s. The survey also suggested that investors were more concerned about companies' available cash when they set dividends, while companies were more concerned with prospective earnings growth. Dividend growth, the broker says, is the basis for long-term returns from equities, with equity market returns tracking the rise in dividends over the last 70 years. However, in the 1980s dividend growth in real terms ran ahead of economic growth, a trend reversed by the onset of recession. Although a number of dividend cuts have been made, the level of earnings cover for dividends has dropped. For the level of cover to return to the longer-term average of 2.3, and dividends to rise by 6 per cent, earnings would have to grow by 9.5 per cent a year to 1999. James Capel forecasts dividend cuts from 19 companies, but says 24 should see growth above 12 per cent and 87, including 27 utilities, should achieve between 6 and 12 per cent growth.</p>

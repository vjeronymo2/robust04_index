			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo, of the  Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], has reiterated that the  UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] should be blamed if war  resumes in the country. Ngonhamo, who was speaking to  Mozambican journalists in Nampula yesterday, accused Lelio  Goncalves, former commander of Unomoz forces, of having been an  office general.    [Begin Ngonhamo recording] This simply means that in all the  12 months he has been in Mozambique, he was an office general.  He did not know, administer or control his soldiers. He does  not know what the Unomoz soldiers in Mozambique did. First of  all, the Unomoz soldiers are involved in a generalized sexual  corruption with minors and this is a crime against humanity.  Mr. Lelio Goncalves was never able to halt this situation. The  Unomoz soldiers are using helicopters in their corrupt actions,  they take girls wearing only bikinis by helicopter to the beach  in Ponta do Ouro and Inde in Cabo Delgado and other beaches in  Mozambique. The Unomoz soldiers even abuse the code of roads of  our country, they frequently run over Mozambican citizens. The  United Nations directorate in Mozambique has nothing to do with  the Mozambican population. So, my words are valid for the  Mozambican people who are tired of war, but for a Unomoz soldier  who is here today and tomorrow leaves for his country, this does  not mean anything, whether Mozambicans die or face difficulties,  it does not matter for them. [end recording]    Lt. Gen. Mateus Ngonhamo went as far as to accuse a Russian  Major (Lopes), who is part of the Unomoz, of being an  infiltrator, working for the Mozambique Liberation Front  [Frelimo], and of inciting war to maintain the weapons business.    [Begin Ngonhamo recording] For instance, during the  investigation of the Nihia issue regarding area number two, when  soldiers were found in the area, a Russian Major came along who  is part of the Unomoz, named (Lopes). When they were drafting a  document to confirm the existence of soldiers in the area number  two, he said the government might be right because it presented  area number two as an assembly area. Our officials told them  that this is not possible because Frelimo has 29 assembly areas  and area two has not been mentioned as one of the 29 areas. If  Frelimo has 30 assembly areas, why is area number two a secret?  It has not been mentioned by the government in its assembly  area lists. There is no doubt that this is intended to create  confusion, this is a Russian officer in the Unomoz who does not  want to see Frelimo condemned for its mistakes. My assessment  of the situation is: I believe a number of soldiers infiltrated  Unomoz and want the war to resume in Mozambique to facilitate  the weapons business with Frelimo, and such is the case of this  Russian officer. This is a dangerous situation. How can this UN  officer maintain peace in this way, since he is encouraging  people to violate the peace process so that the war resumes in  the country.

			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Rescue aircraft, taking advantage of a break in a severe Arctic snowstorm,  managed to land at the North Pole where eight explorers had been briefly  stranded. The team, led by Robert Swan of Britain, reached the roof of the  world after a 600-mile, 56-day journey. The rescue planes flew the explorers to  their base at Eureka on Ellesmere Island on their way home. Because of poor  weather conditions, the three Twin Otter aircraft had been unable to pick up  the group as scheduled, and all of the team members suffered frostbite on their  feet and faces. Members of the expedition, launched to draw attention to global  pollution, planted a U.N. flag at the North Pole on Sunday, organizers of the  Icewalk organization said.  </P></p>

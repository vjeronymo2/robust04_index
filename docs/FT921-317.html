			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / International Company News: Italtel raises net profits ITALTEL, the Italian state-owned telecommunications equipment maker, raised net profits to L132.5bn (Dollars 106.94m) last year from L120.9bn in 1990, despite continuing falls in telecoms equipment prices, writes Haig Simonian. Part of the earnings increase stemmed from sharply higher group turnover, with a 24 per cent surge in volume terms. However, the effect of continuing price competition was reflected in the fact that group sales rose by only 17.4 per cent to L2,760bn from L2,350bn. Earnings were again boosted by productivity increases. However, Italtel said 1991 profits had been hit by extraordinary costs related to an early retirement scheme. It gave no details about the size of the extraordinary item.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> These new statutory provisions in many ways reflect the programs begun by the RTC in the spring of 1993 to enhance opportunities for individual and small investors. On April 13, 1993, the RTC announced the establishment of the Small Investor Program on an interim basis to ensure that RTC's assets are available for sale individually to small investors with moderate levels of capital. By memorandum dated April 15, 1993, entitled ``Individual REO Sales,'' the RTC adopted a marketing policy for REO similar to the procedure outlined in section 21A(w)(2) of the FHLBA. That policy required the active marketing of most REO for 120 days prior to its inclusion in any multi-asset sales initiative. The procedures adopted in this interim rule replace the previous policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Small Investor Program Offices have been established in the RTC's Washington, D.C. headquarters and in each of the RTC's six Field Offices with staff dedicated to addressing the needs of small investors. The Small Investor Program targets individual investors and small investor groups, including Minority and Women-Owned Businesses (MWOB) with the capacity to purchase: (i) REO assets and portfolios valued up to $5 million, (ii) loan pools up to $10 million, (iii) subsidiaries valued from $5 thousand to $30 million, and (iv) equity investments from $4 million to $9 million in joint venture transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Small Investor Program was instrumental in the implementation of two ``Equity Partnership'' Programs designed to increase opportunities for the small investor: the Judgments, Deficiencies, and Charge-Offs (JDCs) Program and the ``S-Series'' Program. These loan disposition initiatives have encouraged greater participation from small investors by reducing asset pool sizes and lowering equity requirements and other fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The RTC frequently conducts non-performing loan auctions to achieve broad market exposure and obtain the best price through the competitive bidding process. However, the average size of portfolios has been decreased and are more geographically limited to allow small investors a greater opportunity to compete for these assets. In addition, the overall required bidding deposit has been reduced from $100,000 to $50,000 to increase the participation of small investors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Loan portfolio offerings available through the Small Investor Program have become smaller, more geographically segmented, and the pools of assets are structured by specific asset type to appeal to small investors. For each loan offering, a comprehensive and specifically targeted marketing campaign is implemented to promote the offering and attract a sufficient number of potential purchasers to the sale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Localized real estate auctions are held more frequently and are more geographically focused to increase opportunities for small investors to purchase assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sealed Bid offerings are available through the Small Investor Program which allow investors to value independently an individual asset or package of assets and submit a confidential bid along with other interested parties. Comprehensive sales brochures are available which provide detailed property and bidding information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seminars are conducted frequently to inform potential small investors of the goals of the Small Investor Program and the opportunities available to purchase assets of the Resolution Trust Corporation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Initiatives such as these fulfill the new legislation's goal of providing opportunities to a broad range of qualified bidders and will be continued throughout the remaining life of the RTC. In addition, these initiatives undertaken by the Small Investor Program are consistent with the original duties mandated by section 21A(b)(3) of the FHLBA, (i.e., to dispose of assets from failed savings associations, obtain the maximum value for those assets, and minimize the cost of resolutions to taxpayers.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Description and Explanation of the Interim Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> Subpart A_Marketing and Selling Real Property on an Individual Basis for 120 Days <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 1640.1 describes the purposes and scope of Subpart A of the interim rule, implementing section 21A(w)(2) of the FHLBA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Subpart requires the RTC to comply with new individual marketing and sales requirements for real property assets held by the RTC on or after December 17, 1993, unless they were the subject of a contract to sell or other disposition contract on that date. The RTC is relying on the effective date of the RTC Completion Act to determine the property affected by this new provision; nothing in the legislation suggests that such contracts should be abrogated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1640.2 contains the definitions of significant terms used in this Subpart. Consistent with the requirement that the RTC has an undivided or controlling interest in the asset subject to this provision, the definition of ``real property'' expressly excludes a time share interest, a space lease, or a security interest in property, including a mortgage or deed of trust.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

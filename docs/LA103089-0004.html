			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH VETOES ABORTION FUNDS  </P> <P> Since the Supreme Court decision Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services  earlier this year, I have read scores of articles in both lay and legal  publications on its significance. Nothing I have read was as sweeping in scope  and penetrating in analysis as Assemblyman Friedman's article.  </P> <P> With tacticians as brilliant as Friedman leading the pro-choice movement,  anti-abortionists may come to regret that they overturned the status quo.  </P> <P> REP. HENRY A. WAXMAN  </P> <P> D-Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Philips buys Grundig paper for DM250m Philips, the Dutch electronics group, is to spend DM250m (Dollars 147m) on buying up convertible securities in Grundig, its 31.6 per cent-owned German consumer electronics company, from a consortium of German and Swiss banks. The transaction, expected on March 14, follows a decision by the three banks  -Dresdner Bank, Bayerische Vereinsbank and Union Bank of Switzerland - to exercise their 10-year-old option to sell the securities to Philips. Philips said it had no immediate wish to convert the securities into ordinary shares, which would raise its stake in Grundig to just over 50 per cent. Instead, the group is negotiating with Grundig and the Grundig family foundation to extend the life of the securities. The convertible debentures currently carry a coupon of 9 per cent, but if the negotiations are successful, this level is expected to be lowered to bring the coupon more into line with prevailing interest rates. Although Philips owns less than one-third of Grundig's ordinary shares, it already has complete management control over the company and fully consolidates the Grundig results in its own accounts. Continued losses at Grundig, which is currently undergoing a restructuring programme, have helped keep the results of Philips' consumer electronics division in the red.</p>

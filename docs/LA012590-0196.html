			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BRUCE, CYPRESS EASILY HANDLE RANCHO SANTIAGO  </P> <P> Alan Bruce of Cypress College made a lot of new friends Wednesday night as he  helped the Chargers to a 75-60 victory over Rancho Santiago in an Orange Empire  Conference men's basketball game.  </P> <P> Bruce had six points, a team-high eight rebounds, four steals and two blocked  shots. Cypress Coach Don Johnson called Bruce, a 6-foot-5 sophomore forward,  the hero of the game.  </P> <P> "That's quite a compliment coming from a man I respect so much," Bruce said. "I  don't even know half of these people, but I'm happy they're talking to me. This  was my dream game."  </P> <P> The contest was billed as a matchup of teams with nearly equal talent. Rancho  Santiago was ranked second in the state and in Southern Califorina; Cypress was  the fifth-ranked team in the state and third in Southern California.  </P> <P> The teams were tied for first place in the conference, but Cypress (20-3  overall, 6-0 in conference) moved a game ahead in the standings with the  victory. Rancho Santiago fell to 22-2, 5-1.  </P> <P> Cypress led, 33-30, at the half, then outscored Rancho Santiago, 11-1, in the  first eight minutes of the second half to take a 44-31 lead. The Dons got as  close as five, 51-46, with 5:21 left, but Cypress dominated the rest of the  game from the free throw line.  </P> <P> Cypress' Mike Renaud was nine of 11 from the line in the second half, and six  of six in the final 50 seconds. Cypress was 27-of-36 in the game. Rancho  Santiago was 19-of-30.  </P> <P> Andre Lamoureux led Cypress with 15 points, scoring 10 of the points in a row  in the first half. Vince Hizon had 12 points, Renuad had 11 and Brian Kenny  added 10.  </P> <P> John Guerrero was the only Rancho Santiago player in double figures with 13.  Gene Altamirano, who is shooting 57% on three-point attempts this season, made  only two of seven three-point baskets and was held to nine points.  </P> <P> "They (Rancho Santiago) play hard," Cypress Coach Don Johnson said. "But we  hung in there. I really don't know what else to say." STEVE KRESAL  </P></p>

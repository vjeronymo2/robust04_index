			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Ulster Unionist blow to talks: Molyneaux rules out return to multi-party discussions Attempts by the British and Irish governments to forge a durable settlement in Northern Ireland were dealt a serious blow yesterday when the Ulster Unionists, the province's largest political party, ruled out a return to round-table talks with Dublin and other constitutional parties. Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, said multi-party talks under the old formula of nothing being agreed until everything was agreed were 'a recipe for disaster and failure.' He said the party was prepared to continue with bilateral discussions co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister. The party's stance was condemned by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who said any attempt to reach an internal settlement in Northern Ireland was 'unacceptable'. Mr John Major also reaffirmed his support for the so-called three-stranded approach, covering relations within the province, between the province and Dublin, and between London and Dublin. The prime minister, who last night held talks on Northern Ireland with US president Bill Clinton, said Britain was anxious to draw a line under its dispute with Washington over the visit to the US of Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president. Launching new UUP proposals for devolved government in Ulster, Mr Molyneaux attacked Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, for 'to some extent torpedoing' the Ancram talks process by sending Dublin a checklist of ideas. There seemed to be 'a dichotomy if not worse' within the Northern Ireland Office, the UUP leader said. If Sir Patrick had not intervened, 'we might have been today in possession of a single document setting out the common ground of the four constitutional parties' in the north. Calling for the introduction of internment as part of an immediate clampdown on terrorism, he warned Mr Major that the UUP's special relationship with the Conservative party would be jeopardised if the government was not prepared to press on with restoring accountable democracy to the province. The centrepiece of yesterday's proposals was a call for the establishment of an 85-member Ulster assembly, elected by proportional representation. A separate three-member panel to oversee the assembly would also be elected. Its powers might include protecting the rights of the minority community. On relations with Dublin, the party said it would 'develop co-operation on matters of mutual interest and concern.' In the US, Mr Major emphasised that last December's joint declaration was not designed to provide a 'quick fix' in the province. It would stand to provide the foundation for a permanent settlement. The prime minister is thought to believe that the internal assembly sought by Mr Molyneaux would be vetoed by Mr John Hume's mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. This could wreck prospects for a durable settlement. Joe Rogaly, Page 20</p>

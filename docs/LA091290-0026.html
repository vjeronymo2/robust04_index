			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SLOPPY PLAY COSTS CSUN IN VOLLEYBALL LOSS TO UCSB  </P> <P> UC Santa Barbara middle blocker Julie Pitois expected to go five games with Cal  State Northridge on Tuesday night. But the Matadors weren't up to the task.  </P> <P> A combination of poor serve-receiving and attacking on the Northridge side led  to a 15-10, 15-8, 7-15, 15-5 Santa Barbara win. The Gauchos, ranked No. 7 by  Volleyball Monthly magazine, improved to 8-1 and the home team fell to 7-4.  </P> <P> Northridge made a season-high 35 attack errors.  </P> <P> "We took their outside hitters out of the game with a good block," UCSB Coach  Kathy Gregory said. "They have a very good setter and one of the best middle  attacks I've seen. Their middle is so good that we decided to leave only one  blocker on the outside."  </P> <P> The ploy worked on the outside, but CSUN setter Beth Welch and middle hitters  Kathleen Dixon and Marianne Dixon dazzled the Gauchos with quick hits,  off-balance dinks and tomahawk spikes. Welch had 47 assists and Kathleen Dixon  put away a season-high 18 kills. Sister Marianne had nine kills.  </P> <P> "You need a setter, that's the driving force and they have that," Gregory said.  "They're not ranked, but they can play with any Top 20 team."  </P> <P> The Matadors fell behind, 7-2, in the first game, but after a timeout and an  exchange of points, they pulled within 11-10. Following a CSUN error, Tina Van  Loon took over the serve for UCSB and the Gauchos scored three straight points  on kills by Maria Reyes and Kristie Ryan and a CSUN hitting error. After four  consecutive sideouts, UCSB won, 15-10, on a dink by Ryan off the serve.  </P> <P> CSUN kept pace with the Gauchos in the second game -- to a point. With the  score tied, 7-7, UCSB scored the next seven points en route to a 15-8 triumph.  </P> <P> In the third game, CSUN built a 9-4 lead, reeled off three straight points for  a 12-4 advantage and finished with a flurry of three straight points on a UCSB  error, an ace by Welch and a kill by Kathleen Dixon for a 15-7 win.  </P> <P> UCSB built an 8-3 lead in the fourth game and after a CSUN timeout, scored six  more for a 14-3 advantage. CSUN managed two points, then lost match point.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to BELAPAN, Colonel General Pavel  Kazlowski, Belarusian defense minister, signed an order  activating on 25 April the statute defining conditions for  contract service by privates, sergeants, sailors, and master  sergeants in the Belarusian Armed Forces. Thus, all Belarusian  citizens under 35 years of age who have already been on active  military service and are still subject to call-up, can sign a  contract with the Defense Ministry for two years and serve in  the Army according to their military or civilian profession.  The same applies to privates and sergeants who are currently  awaiting transfer to the reserves. Experts estimate that the  monthly salary of a contract serviceman this April will be about  390,000 rubles, while a sergeant will make around 509,000  Belarusian hares.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / WH Smith backs net book deal WH Smith, the UK's biggest bookseller, has decided to put its weight behind the defence of the net book agreement as long as the main publishers do the same. The company, which has 23 per cent of the market through its main retail outlets and the more specialist Waterstone chain, wants to preserve the NBA in the interests of maintaining an orderly market in the publishing of new books. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of Fair Trading, has asked the Restrictive Practices Court to look again at the agreement which allows publishers to set the retail prices of most books. The last time the court looked at the issue in 1964 it concluded that without the agreement fewer titles would be published, a narrower range of titles would be available in bookshops and some independent bookshops might go out of business. The Publishers Association will decide later this month whether it will defend the agreement in the Restrictive Practices Court - a long process that could cost pub-lishers and retailers as much as Pounds 1m according to some estimates. There are growing signs that a majority of the council of the Publishers Association will come out in favour of retaining the NBA. The question then will become whether they are prepared to meet the cost of defending it in court. Earlier this month Sir Malcolm Field, managing director of WH Smith, spelt out the implications of ending the NBA at a meeting of senior publishers in London. He said: 'The NBA is, and always has been, a publishers' agreement. If the publishers want to retain it, then we expect them to defend it. As a group we will support them. But we will not shoulder the burden ourselves.' If the NBA went, they would have to 'take an axe to the slower-moving titles'. Sir Malcolm predicted that the end of the NBA would result in the serious book buyer subsidising discounts at the popular end of the market.</p>

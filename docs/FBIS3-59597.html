			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed S.D.: "Computer-Aided Design: JESSI </F> Program Produces Tangible Results"]    [Text] Many computer-aided design (CAD) tools developed  within the scope of the Joint European Submicron Silicon  Initiative (JESSI) are already being commercialized, mostly by  European companies.    During the presentation of JESSI's mid-term results at the  "Componic" fair, J.-P. Tual (Bull) provided a status report of  the electronic CAD subprogram. "All targets have been met," he  concluded, stressing that JESSI-developed CAD tools "have  reached industrial quality and are actually being  commercialized."    The CAD subprogram has four major goals: To develop CAD  tools for specific applications which meet industry's  requirements and for which no commercial systems are available;  to foster the development of a European CAD industry by  strengthening the (scarce) existing potential and by developing  new market segments; to supply methods and tools for libraries  development and modeling; and to promote the use of standards  (VHDL [very-high-speed hardware description language], EDIF  [Electronic Data Interchange Format], Frameworks) and European  participation in standards development. The CAD subprogram  operates according to the following major principles: no exotic  tools, but tools that are compatible with commercially available  ones; libraries that can be used for the development of various  CAD systems; and the effective dissemination of tools developed  under the program. With this, Tual emphasized, European  manufacturers seek to counter "the U.S. tools syndrome,  according to which only the Americans produce good tools."  <H5>  Some 20 `Major' Tools Already on the Market </H5>   Further expanding on the results to date, Tual mentioned CAD  tools developed for specific telecommunications applications,  some of which are being commercialized by the companies  Racal-Redac (card design tools) and by Anacad (mixed  analog-digital design tools). In the area of automotive  applications, he mentioned the commercialization of retiming  tools by Philips and of a synthesis tool for field-programmable  gate arrays (FPGA) by the Grenoble company Innovative Synthesis  Technologies. Various JESSI-developed tools are also being  marketed by other companies, including SNI [Siemens Nixdorf] and  the French Aster Ingenierie [Aster Engineering] company, which  is offering a testing tool obtained through a technology  transfer from Bull. Another Bull technology (a formal testing  tool) is being marketed via a partnership with the U.S. company  Compass. Mentor/EDC, another U.S. company, is marketing a DSP  (digital signal processor) developed under JESSI. Tual stressed  that the industrialization and commercialization of  JESSI-developed CAD tools is expected to gain even more momentum  during the second half of the program, which will be completed  in late 1996.</p>

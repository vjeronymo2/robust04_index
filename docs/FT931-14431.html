			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Haiti military yields to UN over talks HAITI'S military rulers have yielded to growing international pressure and say they are willing to discuss the restoration of democracy in the country. Until now, they have resisted efforts to restore the Caribbean republic's elected president since a coup nearly 16 months ago. The change in the military's position, indicated in a letter from General Raoul Cedras, the army chief, to Mr Dante Caputo, a United Nations special envoy, still leaves unclear whether the army leaders will agree to retire. Their departure from the army is one of the persistent demands of Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's exiled president. The military has made its apparent concession in response to the UN's increasing role in trying to have Fr Aristide restored to the presidential palace, following a year of failed efforts by the Organisation of American States. Diplomats in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, said yesterday that Gen Cedras's decision - over the objections of Mr Marc Bazin, the army-appointed prime minister - was the result of a growing realisation that the UN would adopt stronger measures against the country, including the tightening of the economic embargo. Mr Caputo said Gen Cedras had agreed to the deployment of an international observer force in Haiti, and to the start of discussions on ending the crisis. Those discussions are likely to deal with the appointment of a mutually acceptable interim prime minister and the conditions under which Fr Aristide can return to the country. Army leaders have previously insisted privately that Fr Aristide would not be allowed back into Haiti 'under any conditions.' Aides of the deposed president have said he wants the Haitian military to accept an agreement brokered just under a year ago for the appointment of an interim premier, which was scuttled when soldiers threatened legislators before they could ratify it. A solution of Haiti's political crisis will be high on the foreign policy agenda of US President-elect Bill Clinton, who is concerned about a flood of refugees. Both he and Fr Aristide have told Haitians to stay at home and the US coast guard has tightened its cordon against refugees from Haiti. Said one diplomat: 'To get the army to go along with any plan which will put them out of effective control while restoring Mr Aristide will take some doing.'</p>

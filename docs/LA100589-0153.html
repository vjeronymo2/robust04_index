			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOTH SIDES REST IN MCMARTIN TRIAL  </P> <P> Prosecution and defense attorneys rested their cases Wednesday in the marathon  McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, setting the stage for closing arguments  to begin next week.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders, who often expressed fear  that the case would end in a mistrial, said he now expects the matter to be  placed in the hands of jurors by Nov. 1.  </P> <P> The trial, now in its third year, is the longest criminal proceeding in U.S.  history. At a cost of $15 million, it is the most expensive case ever tried in  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Raymond Buckey 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, are charged with  64 counts of molestation and a shared count of conspiracy involving alleged  molestations of 11 children at their family owned school.  </P> <P> The case, which began in 1983, soon became the largest child molestation  prosecution ever. Seven teachers at the prestigious McMartin Pre-School in  Manhattan Beach were arrested, and it was alleged that hundreds of children had  been molested over a five-year period.  </P> <P> But after an 18-month preliminary hearing, charges against five defendants were  dropped by Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, who said there was insufficient evidence.  The number of children allegedly involved also has dropped.  </P> <P> Since the trial began in April, 1987, the jury of 12 with six alternates has  dwindled because of illness and employment problems. The last alternate was  used recently to replace an ailing juror.  </P></p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE At BICC, the cables and construction group, the impact of recessions in North America, Australia and the UK was previously softened by the resilience of the continental cables market. Last year that stronghold began to weaken and pre-tax profits are expected to have fallen to about Pounds 100m (from Pounds 183m). The range of estimates ahead of Wednesday's announcement is quite wide because of uncertainty about exceptional charges for property write-downs and reorganisation. General Accident, the Perth-based general and life insurer, reports its 1991 results tomorrow. Like Commercial Union and Royal Insurance, GA is expected to post losses. However, the company's exposure to mortgage indemnity losses, which contributed heavily to Royal's disastrous performance this week, is limited. Even so, underlying trading performance is weak and losses for 1991 are expected to be in the region of Pounds 160m, against Pounds 121m last year. GKN, the motor components and industrial services group, is expected to show on Wednesday pre-tax profits virtually halved from Pounds 172m in 1990 to between Pounds 85m and Pounds 90m last year. With most of its continental European markets turning down alongside the UK and US, the few cushioning factors have included its involvement in new models. GKN is credited with good cash conservation and the dividend is thought to be safe, if uncovered. Cadbury Schweppes' premium rating among food-processing shares will be put to the test when it reports full-year results on Wednesday. Though last year's overall growth in UK confectionery and soft drinks volumes was unexciting, the company is thought to have benefitted from a last-minute, pre-Christmas buying surge and from steady price increases on the drinks side. Forecasts range from Pounds 310m to Pounds 316m pre-tax, up from Pounds 279.6m in 1990. Ladbroke, the leisure group, is expected to report on Thursday a one-third fall in pre-tax profits to about Pounds 210m (Pounds 305m). Three of its four divisions will be worse off. Trading profits from hotels, bearing first-quarter Gulf War damage, will be about Pounds 128m (Pounds 149m); those from betting, reflecting poorer punters, will be about Pounds 82m (Pounds 91.7m); and property could drop to a loss of Pounds 17m after interest (Pounds 45.2m profit). Only Texas, the DIY chain, will be ahead from Pounds 39.7m. Abbey National, the retail banking group, is expected to announce tomorrow pre-tax profits for 1991 between Pounds 610m and Pounds 630m, up from Pounds 582m a year ago. This would make it the second most profitable bank in the UK, a whisker behind Lloyds (Pounds 645m) but comfortably ahead of Barclays (Pounds 533m). Provisions against loan losses will be sharply up from last year's Pounds 55m. Rolls-Royce, the aero engine manufacturer, is expected to report a sharp fall in profits when it publishes its 1991 figures on Thursday. The range of market forecasts is between Pounds 60m-Pounds 80m, down from last year's figure of Pounds 176m, with the slowdown in delivery of new engines and spares and redundancy costs blamed by analysts for the reduction. Analysts believe the company will maintain an uncovered final dividend of about 4.7p, making a year's total of 7.25p. PARLIAMENTARY DIARY TODAY Commons: debate on asylum and immigration.

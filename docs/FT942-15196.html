			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nothing clear-cut about exporters' agents Sir, Your article concerning the new commercial agents regulations ('Representative selection', April 5) suggests that from January 1 key exporters have reason to fear that their overseas agents may challenge them in the British courts. Unfortunately this situation is far from being as clear-cut as the article makes out. The reason for this lies in a particular provision inserted almost at the last moment into the regulations which were made last December. This change provides that the regulations apply in relation to the activities of agents in Great Britain. At the same time, it is stated that the regulations do not apply if the parties have agreed that the agency contract is to be governed by the law of another member state. What is to happen where a UK exporter appoints an agent in, for example, Greece under an agency contract subject to English law is unstated. It would appear that the regulations will not apply and the English courts will not be able to entertain actions based on them. On this basis, UK exporters have little to fear. The difficulty arises where local law in the agent's country seeks to supersede English law in order to provide protection to the agent in a situation where the regulations do not provide it. This is not a new situation for UK exporters. We have for many years been faced with this difficulty in certain European countries, particularly Germany. UK exporters now have a choice. They may take advantage of this lacuna in the regulations and hope that local law cannot intervene to protect the agent. Alternatively their agency contracts may expressly adopt the regulations. This would be on the basis that it is possible by contract to avoid the excesses of the protection which the regulations give to agents.

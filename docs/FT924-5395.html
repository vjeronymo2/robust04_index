			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Petrol for Yugoslavia is stopped A BRITISH-led customs team trying to help enforce United Nations sanctions against the rump Yugoslav federation over six weeks have halted 950 trucks, barges and trains, most carrying petrol, at the Hungarian border, UK officials said yesterday. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, yesterday appealed under Britain's presidency of the European Community for the enforcement of sanctions by Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania. These countries have taken steps to improve enforcement along the River Danube and over land but more had to be done. Mr Hurd yesterday spoke to the ambassadors of the three countries and asked them to press on their governments the need to keep up the pressure. So far, sanctions had produced a 50-70 per cent drop in Serbia's trade, unemployment of about 60 per cent and inflation running at 50 per cent a month, according to British officials. Teams of customs officers from the UK, US, Netherlands, Sweden and Germany are working alongside local officials to help enforce the embargo. On the Hungarian border, British customs officers are leading a team of 10, backing up local enforcement. Reuter adds: A UN relief convoy reached the Moslem town of Gorazde yesterday.</p>

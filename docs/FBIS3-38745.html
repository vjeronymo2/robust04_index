			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Michael Smith report: "BNF Urges Government to Guarantee </F> Costs"]    [Text] British Nuclear Fuels [BNF] has told the government  that it will be unable to secure 19bn pounds of reprocessing  contracts without a government guarantee against unexpected  costs.    The state-owned fuel reprocessing company has been trying  for  four years to conclude long-term deals to treat waste fuel from  the UK's two nuclear power utilities. But Nuclear Electric and  Scottish Nuclear are refusing to agree unless the government  protects them against unforeseen cost increases.    The contracts hold the key to the future of BNF, which  recently received the government's go-ahead to start up its  controversial Thorp reprocessing plant in Cumbria.    BNF's auditors, Ernst and Young, said in the company's  annual  report yesterday that the company "regards government financial  support in the form of underwriting to be a prerequisite to the  completion of these contracts." The accounts were drawn up on  the assumption of a government guarantee.    The Department of Trade and Industry, which a year ago  withdrew an earlier commitment to underwrite the contracts, said  yesterday that it was considering BNF's request.    Greenpeace, the environmental group, said it may challenge  BNF's accounts on the basis that the government may not agree to  the underwriting.    The accounts also revealed that the year-long delay in  approval for Thorp helped depress BNF's 1992-93 profits to less  than half their previous year's level. BNF reported profits of  76m pounds for the year to March 31, against 161m pounds for the  previous year. Turnover was marginally down at 1.05bn pounds  from 1.08bn pounds. The results were at the lower end of  analysts' expectations. The dividend to the government was  halved to 26m pounds.    Mr John Guinness, chairman, said he expected profitability  in  1993-94 to be similar to that of last year, with the Thorp delay  playing an even greater role in the result. He said the Thorp  effect last year was 18m pounds but this year it would be about  90m pounds.    Mr Guinness said next year's profitability would rebound  significantly as Thorp would play a full role.    BNF said Thorp was not the only reason for the profit  downturn. Profits had been depressed by 30m pounds as a result  of the nine-week shutdown in 1992 of Magnox reprocessing at  Sellafield, Cumbria. A further 40m pounds depressant was an  advance writedown of costs associated with the merger of BNF's  enrichment assets at Capenhurst, Chester, into a company, Urenco.    The company put restructuring costs, including staff cuts,  at  20m pounds.</p>

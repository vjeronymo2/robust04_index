			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHEMICAL SPRAYED ON PRICELESS REMBRANDT PAINTING; MAN HELD  </P> <P> An unemployed man, described by police as confused, sprayed Rembrandt's famous  painting "The Night Watch" with an unidentified chemical Friday, but museum  officials said damage was minimal.  </P> <P> It was the second attack on the priceless art work in nearly 15 years, and the  third this century.  </P> <P> Dutch television said the spray was concentrated sulfuric acid, but museum  officials would not confirm the report.  </P> <P> Immediately after the attack, a museum guard applied a neutralizing agent, and  the damage to the 1642 masterpiece appeared limited to surface veneer, said  Piet van Thiel, the Rijkmuseum's director of paintings.  </P> <P> Museum guards seized the attacker and handed him over to police, according to  another museum official. The painting is guarded round-the-clock by an unarmed  security company worker.  </P> <P> Police said they did not know what prompted the attack.  </P> <P> Museum spokesman Klaas Wilting said the 31-year-old suspect is a Dutch national  from The Hague. The man was not identified by name in line with police policy  and is being held on suspicion of vandalism.  </P> <P> "He is confused and not telling us anything at the moment," Wilting said  shortly after the attack.  </P> <P> Van Thiel said the painting will be taken to a secret location for restoration  but would probably be on display again in about two weeks. He said a new veneer  layer would take several months to dry.  </P> <P> He said there were no plans to put the painting, which yearly attracts hundreds  of thousands of visitors from around the world, behind a protective shield.  </P> <P> "The Night Watch" measures 12 feet by 14.5 feet and shows a gathering of  17th-Century militiamen. It is considered a prime example of Rembrandt's  skilled handling of light and dark.  </P></p>

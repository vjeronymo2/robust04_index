			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITAN WRESTLERS EDGE OKLAHOMA ON FINAL MATCH  </P> <P> David Jones scored a major decision victory in the heavyweight division to give  Cal State Fullerton a 20-19 nonconference wrestling victory over Oklahoma  Friday night at Fullerton.  </P> <P> Fullerton (3-3) had a 16-13 lead going into the 190-pound match, in which  Fullerton's Derrick Brown was disqualified when he bit Andy Foster to get out  of a painful hold.  </P> <P> The disqualification gave Oklahoma (1-2) a 19-16 lead, but Jones' 12-2 victory  over Joe O'Mara was worth four points and the victory.  </P> <P> In the first five individual matches, Titans Michael Grubbs, Jeff Maes, Lyndon  Campbell and Marty Kouyoumtjian all won by decision, and Donnie Kiernan  wrestled to a 7-7 draw with William Gay in the 142 class. But Oklahoma won  three and had a draw in the next four weight classes to set up the deciding  heavyweight match.  </P></p>

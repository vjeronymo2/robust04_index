			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From Office of the President official statement, 10 January </F> POSTIMEES, p 1]    [Text] Monday, January 10 -- President Lennart Meri made a  TV and radio statement Sunday [9 January] evening. The  government reshuffle has run into difficulties, but there is no  crisis, he stressed. The president described his actions as  "usual in Germany, Austria or any other parliamentary state" and  regretted that an internal crisis has broken out in Estonia.    President Meri announced that he had discussed a possible  change of some ministers in September already, but the prime  minister had not considered any changes necessary then. The  local elections proved that the balance of power had changed and  the prime minister did start preparations for a cabinet  reshuffle. The president had recommended to postpone the  changes until late February so as to consider the changing  powers in Europe. The government failed to listen and the  government restructuring regrettable coincided with major events  in foreign politics.    The president further provided his interpretation of the  constitution, explaining that while the prime minister presents  the candidates, the president has the right to accept or reject  them.    As for the background of the decision, the president  stressed  that the government's activities must be understood by the  people and the Riigikogu [parliament]. However, the prime  minister's assurances that Toomas Sildmae had lost the  confidence of the government, was not borne out by statements of  other cabinet members, President Meri stressed. Accepting all  changes proposed by the prime minister would have been  irresponsible, Meri declared in the statement. He further  pointed out that the efficiency of the prime minister's  decisions must be clear to the nation, the Riigikogu and the  president. "When making any political decisions, we have to  consider the state's interests first and subordinate them to any  party interests," the presidential statement read.    The president concluded by appealing to the Riigikogu to  contribute to the completion of the cabinet changes.</p>

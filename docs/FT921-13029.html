			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Chancellor says recovery 'not yet established' - Autumn Statement Debate MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, told the Commons last night that recovery from the recession 'had not yet become firmly established'. His insistence that foundations for recovery 'are in place' and that consumer spending was set to increase, was cheered by government supporters but derided by the opposition in another pre-election slanging match. Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, condemned 'bogus forecasts' made by Mr Lamont in his autumn statement, and again called for enhanced capital allowances to be included in the Budget on March 10 to 'move out of recession to investment-led recovery'. The autumn statement - approved by a government majority of 90 (317-227) - was said by Mr Smith to have contained 'rubbish' forecasts drawn up as part of a mythical economic scenario designed for a November general election which failed to materialise. He insisted: 'The fact is that the economy is stagnant and, at the very best, is bumping along the bottom'. Mr Lamont underlined his disappointment that the signs of recovery which he highlighted last summer had not been sustained. 'There remain good grounds for believing that recovery will become firmly established in the course of 1992,' he said. The chancellor said the rapid fall in inflation and the consequent increase in real incomes for those in work meant there was 'very considerable pent-up demand in the economy'. He emphasised the significance of the response being made by manufacturers and retailers to weak demand - cuts in prices and costs. Mr Nick Budgen (C Wolverhampton South West) and Mr Tony Favell (C Stockport) criticised the decision to include sterling in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Mr Budgen contended that if the Conservative party lost the general election it would be because of policies initiated by Mr Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor, in 1985 and which culminated in the decision to join the ERM. Mr Tony Benn, MP for Chesterfield and one of 25 Labour backbenchers who backed a parliamentary motion (not debated) which attributed the recession to 'the uncontrolled operation of market forces', feared a slump comparable to that experienced in the 1930s. Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, claimed that 96 per cent of families would be better off as a result of the overall effect of Labour's commitment to extend the coverage of national insurance contributions and increase the top rate of income tax. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, questioned whether autumn statements represented a serious attempt to forecast future economic trends and said that they usually appeared to have been massaged in a bid to instil the economic confidence ministers understandably sought.</p>

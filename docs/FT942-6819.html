			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Meat men pack in voters for City fight Smithfield meat market traders and leaders of the Corporation of London, in dispute over market rents, are exploiting the City's medieval electoral system in a battle to win extra votes. Both sides are trying to pack the rolls with their supporters before the June 15 closing date for this year's City elections. In one ward 360 traders have registered to vote though they are technically resident in an office building while BP has given staff car parking spaces for a fee making them technically resident and therefore able to vote. In January two Smithfield meat traders won election to the Corporation's general council, after a high turnout by Smithfield traders in one ward. Yesterday, a market trader, Mr Peter Martinelli, submitted nomination papers to become the next sheriff of London. He appears to have a good chance of victory. If successful, he would appear next to the Lord Mayor at ceremonial occasions, and would have the right to sit at the Old Bailey law courts. Mr Michael Cassidy, the Corporation's head of policy, appears to be the meat traders' prime target. He said yesterday that 360 market tenants had registered to vote in his ward. All of them are technically resident on one rented floor of an office building. Only residents, partnerships and sole traders can vote in City elections. To be resident, an individual needs only to rent property with a rateable value of Pounds 10 or more. The government has refused requests to increase this sum. Private companies - which pay about 99 per cent of the City's rates - are excluded. However, civic leaders are now encouraging companies to stretch the franchise by granting employees tenancy of their buildings. British Petroleum, one of the Square Mile's largest employers, has already boosted its representation on the electoral register by allocating car park spaces to employees, for a small fee. Technically, they are now resident and are able to vote. Mr Cassidy believes that meat traders will take about a third of the seats on the general council if more private companies do not follow the example set by BP before the June 15 dead-line. The government refused to introduce a bill to change the council franchise when the Corporation last requested it two years ago.</p>

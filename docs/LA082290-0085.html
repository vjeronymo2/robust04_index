			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: THE COSTS AND DIVIDENDS OF KEEPING PEACE  </P> <P> As the crisis deepens and we look to be tied down in the Persian Gulf for more  than a few weeks, it's time to start calculating the cost to the American  taxpayers -- and to ask what they're getting for their money.  </P> <P> The answer is that the cost may be less than gloomy predictions are saying, and  the payoff will be in more than oil. The great multinational military  expedition against Iraq may involve what the experts call "oil geopolitics."  But lots of other things are involved, too: the balance of power in the Middle  East, the safety of countries in the region, the world economy and world  leadership.  </P> <P> Beside such grand purposes, the immediate cost estimates seem small. Defense  Department and military analysts say the Gulf buildup will cost $6 billion to  perhaps $12 billion a year, which is not such a big number in a $300-billion  defense budget.  </P> <P> The larger costs have been paid: The tens of billions of dollars worth of ships  and planes in the Persian Gulf, and the sophisticated radar and firepower, are  all part of the $8 trillion (in current dollars) that the United States has  spent over four decades to "maintain peace and stability in the world," says  Lawrence Korb, former assistant secretary of defense and now a scholar at the  Brookings Institution.  </P> <P> To be sure, a shooting war could destroy a lot of that equipment and be  extremely expensive. And even without shooting, the Gulf expedition will  diminish the peace dividend from the end of the Cold War.  </P> <P> But predictions that it will throw the U.S. economy into recession could be off  the mark.  </P> <P> "Guns come at the expense of butter -- provided you have the butter," remarks  Albert Wojnilower, senior economist of First Boston Corp. He means that if the  economy is already running in high gear, with no spare capacity, the extra cost  of a military venture comes at the expense of the civilian economy. But if the  civilian economy is sluggish, as is the case today, a military buildup can  provide acceleration.  </P> <P> So in the short term, neither cash outlays for the Gulf nor its economic  effects look that bad.  </P> <P> Longer term, the surprising prediction is that U.S. forces will be in the Gulf  for years. For even if Saddam Hussein is killed or removed from power, Middle  East experts say, Iraq's military power will continue to dominate the oil-rich  countries of the Gulf. So Korb and others predict that the United States will  keep a military presence to maintain stability -- as it did for decades in West  Germany and South Korea.  </P> <P> Behind such predictions is the fact that the stakes in the Middle East go far  beyond oil. To be sure, maintaining a stable flow of oil, the biggest energy  source for the world's economies, is important. But ownership of the oil hasn't  mattered much in traditional military thinking. Remarking years ago on Saudi  Arabia's vulnerability to attack, a U.S. Army officer at the Pentagon put it  this way: "'The only reason someone seizes an oil field is to pump oil and sell  it to get money. Well, we're a customer for oil."  </P> <P> But when Saddam Hussein seized Kuwait, the U.S. response was not so casual.  Why? One reason was that Hussein threatened also to take Saudi Arabia and thus  a monopolist's control of 25% of the world's current oil production and more  than half the world's reserves.  </P> <P> There were more important reasons as well. "We didn't want the Iraqis to get  too rich," says William Niskanen, a member of the council of economic advisers  in the Reagan Administration and now chairman of Washington's Cato Institute.  He means that the United States didn't want Hussein to grow in power and to  pursue his intent to build nuclear weapons. A nuclear Iraq would have  threatened Israel, which is acknowledged to have nuclear weapons, and a nuclear  war could have begun.  </P> <P> So the United States as world leader led a military expedition to preserve the  peace. "It's for the public good," says Niskanen, because Hussein's violation  of the principle of national sovereignty threatened many nations.  </P> <P> Which is noble, but brings us back to the question: How much does world  leadership cost U.S. taxpayers and what do they get for their money? The direct  cash cost might be the $300-billion U.S. defense budget. The payoff is in a  relatively peaceful world in which many economies can raise their living  standards and the world's largest economy can enjoy the highest living standard  of all.  </P> <P> Other nations share the payoff; do they also share the cost? Yes and no. In the  past decade, foreign buying of U.S. government bonds, which helped fund the  federal deficit, was said to allow Americans to "live beyond their means." But  those foreign investors got a cash return on their money and, as their  investment financed the U.S. military buildup that now protects the Persian  Gulf, they got a payoff in security as well.  </P> <P> The point is that after the present Iraqi crisis is over, the United States may  have 50,000 troops stationed long term in Saudi Arabia to maintain stability in  the region. Paying for those troops should be the oil-rich states of the Middle  East (it would take $7 billion a year to quarter 50,000 troops, according to  Pentagon calculations in the current crisis), as Germany and Japan have helped  pay for the stationing of U.S. troops since World War II.  </P> <P> That way U.S. taxpayers can have financial partners as well as military allies  in defense of world peace.  </P></p>

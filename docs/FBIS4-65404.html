			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Otmar Lahodynsky: "Unfulfilled Wishes in EEA"] </F>   [Text] Brussels -- At the first joint ministers' meeting  of the 17 European Economic Area (EEA) member countries in  Brussels, Economics Minister Wolfgang Schuessel on the one hand  praised the EEA as an "important intermediate step" for  Austria's accession to the European Union [EU]. He said the EEA  has been able to dispel a number of fears. Thus, the freedom of  movement for persons within the EEA has not burdened the  Austrian labor market, and the introduction of common standards  for food products has not reduced quality.    But Schuessel also mentioned several "unfulfilled wishes"  Austria has in the EEA. Talks between the EU and EFTA [European  Free Trade Association] on a common zone of origin for the EEA  and the Eastern European reform states have come to a halt.  This means that a compensatory duty is put on goods exported to  the EU that consist of Austrian primary material that is  processed in Hungary. In the same way, Austrian textiles are  discriminated against over EU material in the so-called  "passive, across-the-border processing." Schuessel fears that  the problem "cannot be settled before Austria joins the EU."    The EU was also asked to reduce duties for certain food  products. The industry that is hardest hit by this delay are  Austrian jam producers, who still have to pay a 30-percent duty  on exports to the EU, while jam from EU countries is exported to  Austria at the reduced 10-percent rate.    The 17 ministers also reviewed the implementation of EU  documents in the five EFTA states participating in the EEA.  Schuessel rejected recent criticism by the EFTA Supervisory  Authority, which had blamed Austria for delaying the  implementation of EEA regulations. Apart from two EU regulations  on textile fibers and sewage sludge, Austria has "completely  implemented" all EU regulations relevant to the EEA, Schuessel  said. In connection with transition periods for environmental  impact assessments of industrial plants and traffic- related  projects, Schuessel said that all projects will be subject to  such evaluations as of 1 July 1994.</p>

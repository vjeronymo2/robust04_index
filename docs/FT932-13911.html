			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: EDS signs biggest European IT contract ELECTRONIC Data Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of General Motors of the US, has reached agreement in principle to supply information technology services to Sweden's KF co-operative conglomerate over 10 years in what it said would be the biggest IT services contract ever signed in Europe. Under the deal, which both companies hope to complete by June, EDS would take over running Apiron Information, KF Group's IT services company which has assets of Skr240m (Dollars 32m) and annual revenues of about SKr600m. EDS said this gave the deal a minimum value of Dollars 1bn over the 10 years. However, both EDS and KF executives declined to detail the full finances of the agreement, saying they had yet to be finalised. The companies said the partnership nature of the so-called co-sourcing deal, in which KF would retain an interest in Apiron, was unique. Typical IT services agreements involve 'outsourcing', in which the IT company takes over all the IT functions and assets of the client. EDS has had such a contract with Saab of Sweden since 1991. EDS, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, last year had total revenues of Dollars 8.2bn, with pre-tax income of Dollars 1bn. It has been growing fast in Europe in recent years, where its revenues last year were Dollars 1.4bn. As part of the KF deal, it plans to set up a European centre for servicing the retail industry in Stockholm. KF is the national umbrella organisation of 120 Swedish co-operatives. It is undergoing heavy restructuring, posting a pre-tax loss in 1992 of SKr1.75bn on sales of SKr59bn. KF is the fifth-largest Swedish conglomerate. However, it is seeking to slim down from a sprawling range of businesses to concentrate on the retail sector where it is Sweden's second-largest operator, holding an 18 per cent market share through chains such as the Konsum supermarkets and the Obs] and B&amp;W superstores.</p>

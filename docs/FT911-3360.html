			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Book Review: To the best of his belief GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY: IN SEARCH OF A NEW WORLD ETHIC By Hans Kung SCM Press Pounds 12.95, 158 pages This is a small mountain of a book. Its sides are steep and climbed only with frequent pauses for breath, but the view from the top is worth the exertion. The difficulty of the climb stems from the author's ambition. Hans Kung, the prolific Catholic theologian whose teaching licence was withdrawn by the Vatican in 1979, uses this short work to outline his plan to spend the coming years examining the history and theology of Christianity, Judaism and Islam in pursuit of a secure, ethical basis for world peace. The spirit of the enterprise is captured in the book's German title: Projekt Weltethos. What a project] But this is not a book for a closed theological fraternity. Dedicated to a former Bundesbank president, one chunk of the thesis was shared with a momentous meeting of the Davos World Economic Forum in February 1990. In style, the book swerves between brilliantly compressed summaries of, for example, theories of world history (Hegel to Toynbee) and slideshow slogans. Its final words read: no human life together without a world ethic for the nations; no peace among the nations without peace among the religions; no peace among the religions without dialogue among the religions. Kung's thesis states that 'our new, post-colonialist, polycentric age, in post-modernity' needs an agreed ethos which only religion can provide; post-modernism, in his view, set in about 1918. Among its identifying features are technologies capable both of drawing people together (telecommunications) and destroying the planet (nuclear weapons and environmental mis-management). And yet in this world of information overload, there is a simultaneous tendency for old individualisms, cultures, nationalisms and religions to re-assert themselves, most powerfully and obviously in the Islamic world. Kung accepts that 'those who have no religion can also lead a life which is authentically human and in this sense moral', but he argues that without religion there is no absolute or unconditional reason to adhere to or to require adherence to religion's essential tenets: don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, respect parents, love children and avoid immorality. Only religion, he says, has shown itself capable of leading and influencing whole populations, regardless of background and education. Although Kung's unmistakably central European timbre betrays a hint of the evangelist, he makes a specific pitch for unbelievers to join this great dialogue on the grounds that even if you resist the claims of belief, you cannot deny the political and social importance of the fact that millions do believe. Kung thus seeks at once to be open-minded, but loyal to his own creed: steadfastness and self-criticism are the essential qualities he identifies for the task ahead. What, though, is the common threat which binds the great religions? For Kung, the answer is 'the humanum', or basic human values. 'Religion,' he writes, 'is true and good to the degree that it serves humanity, to the degree that . . . it advances men and women in their identity, sense of meaning and sense of dignity, and allows them to attain a meaningful and fruitful existence.' The thread is thus clearly aspiration rather than achievement, and perhaps even as aspiration it is too much the work of a post-Englightenment European mind to carry the weight the author gives it. It would be wrong, however, to imply that Kung is unaware of the Eurocentricity of his intellectual heritage. He rejects both Hegel's and Spengler's seminal theories of history partly on the grounds that they ignore or marginalise Judaism and Islam. Arnold Toynbee, the British historian, is viewed more favourably, but still found wanting in his groping for some synthesised 'world religion'. Kung is surely right to recognise that religions will remain stubbornly factional; the best that can be hoped is that they learn to love dialogue more than they enjoy militancy. As we look from Prof Kung's mountain top, it is not surprising to see patches of haze. In his opening survey of the state of the world, for example, he dismisses Japanese moral and spiritual life with a superficiality which seems over-influenced by newspaper stories about recent scandals in politics and business. But mostly, we should be thankful for Hans Kung and his motivating judgment, that religion remains decisive in human affairs and that peace, if it is to be found anywhere, lies along the road of intelligent and well-researched dialogue. Kung, an antidote to the conservatism of the current Vatican, is the kind of intellectual the late 20th century needs; thorough, engaged and with a global perspective. Towards the end of the book, he mentions in passing the great protestant theologian, Paul Tillich, who gave a lecture in Chicago in 1965, recognising the need to re-work a lifetime of systematic theology in the light of his emerging understanding of world religion. Ten days later, he died. As Kung approaches his mid-sixties, with Projekt Weltethos before him, we can only wish him a long and active old age.</p>

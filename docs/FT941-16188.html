			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Neste and Statoil link Neste of Finland, and Statoil of Norway, struggling to cope with worldwide overcapacity in plastics manufacture, yesterday signed an agreement to merge their petrochemical and polyolefin industries. The merger by the two state-owned groups creates a new company called Borealis, which is one of the largest petrochemical groups in Europe. There will be cuts in overlapping parts of sales, marketing, administration and research and development. Neste's Mr Juha Rantanen, who becomes chief executive of Copenhagen-based Borealis, said he did not plan to close any of the company's plants. Assets in Borealis, which will be owned 50-50 by Neste and Statoil, will be about DM4bn (Dollars 2bn), and equity capital in the opening balance sheet will be about 40 per cent of assets, said Statoil's chief executive, Mr Harald Norvik. Borealis' annual turnover will also be about DM4bn.</p>

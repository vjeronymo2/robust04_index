			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MYSTERY WRITERS LEAVE CLUES FOR NOVICES PLOTTING WHODUNITS  </P> <P> One mystery about mystery writing is where the creators of Sherlock Holmes and  Sam Spade get their plots.  </P> <P> Sara Paretsky, author of five novels featuring the Chicago private investigator  Vi Warshawski, including "Bloodshot," says she has no problem.  </P> <P> She gets her plots from the Wall Street Journal and the Chicago Tribune.  </P> <P> "What I'm on the lookout for always is political or financial or industrial  fraud on a scope or scale that might lead one to commit murder in order to  prohibit this fraud from coming to light," Paretsky said recently at the  Mystery Writers of America annual convention.  </P> <P> The message from mystery writers this year is that industrial fraud is in  vogue, along with environmental disaster.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sex it Out  </P> <P> Sex, however, is out.  </P> <P> "People who want sex should read romances," said Matthew Sartwell, an editor at  New American Library. "Mysteries are going to more contemporary settings,  dealing with the environment and health."  </P> <P> Warren Murphy, looking at ease in a tweed jacket and knit tie, refrained from  chewing his bushy mustache when he told a group of would-be mystery writers,  "Plot is the simplest part of this business."  </P> <P> Murphy, who has written more than 100 novels, including "Too Old a Cat," upon  which the television series "Murphy's Law" is based, told the group: "God  either made you a writer or God made you not a writer. But if you are a writer,  then I or anyone else in this business could probably help you become a  novelist."  </P> <P> His two main pieces of advice: come up with a title, and summarize the novel in  one sentence.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Map Out Plots  </P> <P> Unlike Paretsky, who confessed to having tossed out several false starts of 60  or 70 pages, Murphy warned writers to carefully map out their plots before  putting pen to paper.  </P> <P> "I never throw out 60 pages," he said. "I hate to write. And it would be a  shame to waste that material."  </P> <P> While the pair did not come to blows -- she didn't slip him any poison; he  didn't take out a knife -- they agreed on little and revealed even less.  </P> <P> Nor did Donald Westlake, whose latest works are "Trust Me on This" and "Sacred  Monster," or Lawrence Block, the author of "Eight Million Ways to Die" and  "When the Sacred Gin Mill Closes," reveal his secret to creating characters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'An Intuitive Process'  </P> <P> "How do I do it?" said Block, who looks like an aging hippie. "It's an  intuitive process. I really don't know," said the creator of Matthew Scudder, a  former alcoholic detective, and Bernie Rhodenbarr, a private eye and  gentlemanly thief.  </P> <P> Looking like an unassuming English professor in his best navy blue blazer,  Westlake revealed with a twinkle in his eyes that he could never write about  someone being presented to the Queen of England, because he had never had that  experience.  </P> <P> "But I can write about a man driven by a desperate need for money, because,  once or twice, I've been driven by a desperate need for money."  </P> <P> Priscilla Ridgeway, the group's executive secretary, said the market for  mysteries is booming.  </P> <P> "Mysteries are on a roll. Whether you're talking spy or cozy (in the tradition  of Agatha Christie), they're hot. We get requests all the time for mystery  cruises, mystery weekends. I'm holding out for the one up the Amazon."  </P> <P> The mystery writers and their fans, an eccentric looking group complete with  the occasional ascot, wide-brimmed hat and trench coat, were in town for the  organization's annual convention, called Edgar Allen Poe Week, which culminated  in a black-tie gala for the 42nd annual bestowing of the Edgars, their version  of the Academy Awards.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Best Mystery  </P> <P> The Edgar for best mystery of the year went to Stuart Kaminski's "Cold Red  Sunrise"; and Hillary Waugh was named a grandmaster of the mystery writers'  craft.  </P> <P> Waugh said he finds his plots everywhere. "You read a story and that gives you  an idea. Or I see a newspaper headline and I think was what a great starting  place.  </P> <P> "If you are really having a hard time, read true murder cases and get an idea  from them. When all else fails, sit down or lie down and let your mind roam and  find things coming to you from your own life."  </P> <P> Block says he gets his ideas from just hanging out in the city, "listening to  what people say. There are so many crazy things going on you can always find  something."  </P></p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Fading breed takes on 'grain barons': Small farmers are seeking a bigger share of EU funds Mr John Thompson works an 80-hour week on his dairy and sheep farm on the North Yorkshire Moors near Whitby. The holding is not big enough to make it worth employing another pair of hands, and the 56-year old farmer is fed up with the hard graft - he is considering giving up his cows and developing a bed-and-breakfast business. The long hours and poor income for Britain's 150,000 small farmers make them a fading breed - 2,000 a year are leaving the business or taking part-time jobs. Today a group of small farmers will visit Westminster to press Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, to agree to changes in the Common Agricultural Policy that would favour small producers. Mr James Mulford, chairman of the Small Farmers Association, says: 'The public agrees to support agriculture because they think the money is going to small farmers like us. But 80 per cent of CAP spending goes to 20 per cent of the biggest farmers: it's wicked.' Mr Mulford does not want any additional cash, he wants CAP funds spread more evenly by setting a cut-off point after which large holdings would fail to qualify for aid. This would stop hundreds of thousands of pounds in subsidies going to the 'grain barons'. 'These subsidies are just pure profit to some of my larger neighbours, but every pound of aid I get goes to pay for food for my family,' says Mr Mulford, who farms 200 acres in Suffolk. If Mr Mulford's ideas were adopted there would be more funding to spread among the whole farming population, with a greater proportion going to smaller producers. A small farmer typically has fewer than 200 acres and 80 per cent of family income is generated on the farm. Under this definition almost half of Britain's farmers can be termed small, but Mr Mulford argues that their voices are never heard. Smaller producers also say they are caught in a vicious circle - if large farmers are enjoying a good year, as at present, their desire to expand pushes up land prices and the cost of agrochemicals is increased, making it harder for small farmers to compete. Many large farmers hope to buy up their smaller neighbours in an effort to cut costs and compete with lower-cost operators overseas when the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal comes into force next year. Mr Thompson's farm could well be swallowed by a bigger landowner. It will not support a full-time living when he retires, as on 30 of his 80 acres he has only a life tenancy which cannot be passed on. But the bed-and-breakfast business is also uncertain as fewer people choose to spend their main holiday in Britain. Mr Mulford says diversification by farmers has not been a big success - he believes only two in every 10 projects prove successful. Farmers closest to towns gain most by diversifying as there is a ready market for them, he says, but this does not help those in more remote areas. 'There is increasing pressure on us to diversify, but if you're a small farmer you are working flat out anyway and have no time to devote to a new business,' he says. Mr Mulford is hoping to convince Mrs Shephard to take notice of the interests of the small producers. 'The large producers dictate the agricultural debate in the UK and also in the European Union, but a small mixed farm is what the public think of as a traditional holding and they want to keep it that way,' he says.

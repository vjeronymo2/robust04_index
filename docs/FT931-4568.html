			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Turkey may place Netas shares abroad THE Turkish government might consider placing shares in Netas, the Turkish telecommunications group, with foreign institutions following the failure of a local share issue. The government's sale of shares in Netas direct to the Turkish public has attracted applications for just 35 per cent of the offer. The poor response is a blow to Turkey's privatisation programme, and a measure of the immaturity of the local share market. Brokers say that at an offer price of TL8,250, the company is on a price earnings ratio of 2.6, markedly lower than others in the sector. However, fewer than 5,000 applications were received, 1,000 of which were from Netas employees. Netas is 51 per cent owned by Northern Telecom of Canada. The government was hoping to reduce its share stake in Netas from 49 per cent to 29 per cent via the offer. To attract local institutions, the government is raising the ceiling for a single application from 5,000 to 30,000 shares, an investment of Dollars 27,000.</p>

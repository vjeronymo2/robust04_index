			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALL-STAR GAME;  </P> <P> THOSE SHADOWS PROVED TO BE NO HELP TO NL PITCHERS  </P> <P> Here's the pitching lineup National League Manager Tom Lasorda tossed --  underhand, it turns out -- to the American Leaguers during the first three  innings of Tuesday night's All-Stargame:  </P> <P>  -- Rick Reuschel, San Francisco Giants. Lasorda didn't exactly specify how  many innings Reuschel would remain on the mound, but the conventional wisdom  had him lasting awhile. "I knew it was going to be one or two (innings), but I  didn't know which," Reuschel said.  </P> <P> Now he knows; it was one.  </P> <P> AL leadoff man Bo Jackson hit a ball that sailed far beyond the Anaheim Stadium  center-field fence and into the dusk, followed soon by a more modest homer by  Wade Boggs. Not long after that, Reuschel was seated permanently on the NL  bench.  </P> <P>  -- John Smoltz, Atlanta Braves. All you need to know about Smoltz's stay is  that he said this afterward: "Thank God I don't pitch in this ballpark."  </P> <P> Smoltz's inning was highlighted by more Bo antics, two hits and another AL run.  "Hey, I faced five, got three out, so that's the way I look at it," Smoltz  said.  </P> <P>  -- Rick Sutcliffe, Chicago Cubs. Sutcliffe wasn't even supposed to be here. He  spent Monday fishing and golfing with friends when he learned National League  president Bill White was looking for him to replace Houston Astro pitcher Mike  Scott on the All-Star roster. "I thought it was a joke at the beginning," he  said. "My buddies are always trying to get one up on me."  </P> <P> Less than 24 hours later, Sutcliffe, who had already pitched twice in the last  five days, was on the mound getting waxed by greedy AL hitters. Four hits and  two runs later, the third inning was mercifully over for the tired Cub.  </P> <P> "My arm's kind of dead right now," he said. "I'm going to have to find a way to  comb my hair first."  </P> <P> Three pitchers, three innings, a second consecutive AL All-Star victory.  </P> <P> It was supposed to be a game affected by the long shadows that creep across the  field during late afternoon and early evening. Balls would dart in and out of  the sunlight, enough so to baffle the best hitters in both leagues.  </P> <P> Yes, well, it didn't quite work out that way. AL starter Dave Stewart  discovered that much in his half of the first when he allowed two runs. But it  was the trio of Reuschel, Smoltz and Sutcliffe who suffered the most. Reuschel  served up those two home runs. Smoltz was named the losing pitcher. And  Sutcliffe has to learn new grooming methods, what with a right arm that wasn't  planning to do anything more strenuous this All-Star break than plucking beers  from a cooler.  </P> <P> First, Reuschel, who said the pitch that Jackson deposited in the center field  seats was low, way low, a claim later supported by NL teammates.  </P> <P> "It was on top of the plate," said Dodger reliever Jay Howell.  </P> <P> So low was the pitch that when Jackson connected, "it looked like a Jack  Nicklaus drive," Howell said.  </P> <P> Reuschel didn't bother looking at Jackson's hit, mostly because he expected it  to land in a glove, not the cheap seats. "He showed me something," Reuschel  said.  </P> <P> Next came Boggs, whose homer traveled considerably less, but counted the same.  </P> <P> "I was just trying to throw a strike," Reuschel said.  </P> <P> Smoltz took his place in the second inning, which is to say, he struggled at  times. First pitch . . . a single by Texas Ranger Ruben Sierra.  </P> <P> "That wasn't fair," Smoltz said. "He's not supposed to swing at the first  pitch."  </P> <P> An out later, Terry Steinbach singled, bringing up Jackson, who beat out what  would have been a sure double play with most runners. Sierra scored on the  play, sticking Smoltz with a run and ultimately, an All-Star loss.  </P> <P> "Hey, facing some of those guys, it was kind of a dream come true," he said.  </P> <P> Sutcliffe didn't know how to explain his appearance. One moment he's on the  links, the next he's on the mound. His arm didn't know what hit him.  </P> <P> "My arm's not used to pitching three times in five days," he said. "I guess I  better stick to starting."  </P> <P> Sutcliffe knew he was in trouble during his warmups. One version of his  fastball did nothing, so he tried another. Even worse. Little changed when he  trudged out there for the third inning.  </P> <P> "It was the best I had," he said. "I knew I didn't have much."  </P> <P> Turns out he wasn't alone.  </P></p>

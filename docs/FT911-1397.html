			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Minding Your Own Business: The only system that worked - Computing 'I'M A chartered accountant and in my practice I have 400 clients. About 200 of them are on computer. I have been an auditor for 20 years and in all that time I can honestly say that I have only ever found one computerised accounting system which worked.' My old friend Godfrey was talking about the problems facing businesses that do not have qualified accounting staff to do the books  - in fact, most businesses turning over less than Pounds 1m. 'Hold on. Half the businesses in the UK have got their accounts on computer. There must be thousands of them. Surely you can't be saying that none of the computerised accounting systems works?' 'Oh, the computer works all right; it's simply that the users cannot operate it with the level of accuracy required for financial accounts. I would say that whenever one of my clients gets a computer, the cost of my audit fee goes up. 'You see, with a manual set of books, mistakes are easily discovered and corrected. But with a computer, the posting has gone automatically through the system in all directions. If I find an error it is a terrible job to find where it has gone and reverse it out. Between you and me, when I produce accounts for my smaller customers I just ignore all the computer print-outs they give me and start from scratch with the bank statements and the paying-in books. It's quicker.' 'What about the one system that did work?' 'It was an accounts system for a hotel. It did a self-contained job and the people were able to reconcile it. Let me tell you: if you ever find a computerised accounts system which works it will not be comprehensive.' The source of most of these businesses' problems is the nominal ledger. In computer terms, a nominal ledger package is the simplest accounting package of all. Most of the different accounts postings take place within the nominal and that is why it holds so many terrors for the non-accountant. To illustrate the problem, let us look at just one of the standard accounting entries  - wages and Paye. Imagine a typical small business which employs five full-time staff and three part-time. The full-timers are on Paye and each earns Pounds 200 gross per week. The part-timers are not on Paye and each earn Pounds 70 gross per week. An accountant is running the books and wishes to post this week's wages to the nominal ledger. He has to prepare two journals. First he must write up the wages book in order to calculate deductions of tax and employee National Insurance for the five staff on Paye. Their gross wages combined comes to Pounds 1,000. Suppose deductions come to Pounds 300, leaving net wages of Pounds 700. The company also has to pay employer's NI, say 10 per cent of gross wages. So his first journal to the nominal will be as follows: debit Pounds 1,000 to gross wages and Pounds 100 to employer's NI in the profit and loss account. Credit Pounds 700 to wages control and Pounds 400 to Inland Revenue in the balance sheet. When the week's wages of Pounds 910 (Pounds 700 to the full-time employees and Pounds 210 to the part-timers) are actually paid, the accountant posts his second journal entry. He credits Pounds 910 to the bank account, debits Pounds 700 to wages control in the balance sheet and Pounds 210 to part-time wages in the profit and loss account. In both journals the debits balance the credits, and he has used a control account, one of the tricks of the accounting trade, to make sure he doesn't mix up the wages of the part-timers with those of the Paye staff. (Correct postings to wages control will always balance themselves out to zero. If he had posted the whole wages bill of Pounds 910 to wages control by mistake, the resulting balance of Pounds 210 would tell him he had made an error.) That is the way Paye works for any business that employs people. When it comes to posting wages and Paye to the nominal ledger, the typical nominal ledger package gives no help. All it does is ask which accounts you want debited and which credited. The user is left to work out which accounts are involved; whether they are in the profit and loss account or in the balance sheet; which is to be debited; which credited, and so on. There are many accounts packages on the market, all trumpeting themselves as ideal for the non-accountant user, but when it comes to such accounting systems the gap between theory and reality is vast. Many doubt whether the small businessman could ever produce his own accounts, and his right-hand person, the experienced book-keeper, is almost extinct. Certainly there is a great deal more that the software companies could do to help. The clue lies in asking why it is that, although they cannot handle a nominal ledger package, non-accountants are quite happy with a sales or purchase ledger. Suppose you are using a sales ledger package and you want to record a sales invoice for Pounds 115. When the 'invoice entry' screen appears you put Pounds 15 in the 'Vat' box and Pounds 100 into the 'Net' box. You don't have to work out which accounts are involved. In fact you don't see any mention of debits and credits at all. This is because the invoice entry option is a pre-defined journal where all the accounts and the debits and credits have been pre-programmed in advance. The computer automatically credits Pounds 15 to Vat, Pounds 100 to sales, and Pounds 115 to debtors. All you have to do is to fill in the boxes. Pre-defined journals in the sales ledger allow the user to make correct accounting entries for quite complex accounting transactions such as the taking of settlement discounts or refunding cheques. A pre-defined wages/Paye journal would make any nominal ledger package much more 'user-friendly'. Closing stock adjustment and depreciation are two other candidates, as are accruals and prepayments. When a nominal ledger arrives with pre-defined journals for every difficult accounting entry, then for the first time the market will see a true business accounting package.</p>

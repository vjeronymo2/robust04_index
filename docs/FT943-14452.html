			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Cray 10% down on lack of exceptional gains The absence of exceptional gains resulted in a 10 per cent decline in pre-tax profits at Cray Electronics Holdings from Pounds 29m to Pounds 26.2m in the year to April 30. Strong underlying growth at the operating level saw the contribution from continuing operations advance by 53 per cent to Pounds 25.8m (Pounds 16.8m). However, the comparable pre-tax result was swollen by Pounds 8.05m profits on disposals and Pounds 3.43m of foreign exchange gains. Turnover in the period under review from continuing operations increased by 50 per cent to Pounds 244.1m (Pounds 162.2m). This included a full-year contribution from the Dowty IT business, which was acquired in August 1992, and an initial Pounds 38.3m contribution from the P-E International business, which was acquired for Pounds 16.2m in September. Discontinued operations added another Pounds 27.7m (Pounds 38.6m) to total sales. Earnings per share fell from 13.8p to 8.6p. An increased final dividend of 1.5p (1p) is proposed, making a total for the year of 2.25p (1.5p). Profit from continuing operations included an initial Pounds 767,000 contribution from P-E International. The discontinued Cray Technology operations, which were all sold during the year, added another Pounds 473,000 to operating profits. A Pounds 235,000 loss was carried on the disposal. Net interest receipts of Pounds 146,000 compared with Pounds 871,000 of costs previously. The group ended April with net cash of Pounds 15.6m, up from Pounds 12.8m. At the divisional level the advance was again led by Cray Communications, which boosted its input to Pounds 20.9m (Pounds 12.7m) on turnover of Pounds 165.3m (Pounds 127m). Margins improved from 11 per cent to 13 per cent and divisional research and development expenditure increased to Pounds 20m. Cray Systems, which now includes the P-E Computer Services business, lifted turnover to Pounds 57.6m (Pounds 35.2m) including organic growth of 15 per cent. Profits of Pounds 4.51m (Pounds 3.71m) represented a reduced 8 per cent (11 per cent) margin on turnover which reflected the inclusion of the loss-making P-E operations. The P-E International management consultancy business reported profits of Pounds 581,000 on turnover of Pounds 21.1m. COMMENT The reorganisation of the Cray businesses is now complete, the P-E International operations have been integrated and the group is now organised into three distinct divisions. Despite persistent rumours of a possible bid for Racal, Cray's management makes it clear that attention is clearly focused on expanding these core businesses internationally - mainly by organic means - and achieving further margin improvements. In particular the management has has set a 20 per cent margin target for the core communications division, which has a strong and expanding product portfolio. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 33.2m look possible this year, generating earnings of 10.6p. The shares are trading on a deserved premium prospective p/e of just under 16.</p>

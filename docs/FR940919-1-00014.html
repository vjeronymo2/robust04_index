			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are approximately 426 McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 269 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspections at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the inspections proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $29,590, or $110 per airplane, per inspection cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It would take approximately 8 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed replacements at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $9,009 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the replacements proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,541,781, or $9,449 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above figures, the total cost impact of the inspections and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacements proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,571,371, or $9,559 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive. Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the required actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even if they were not required to do so by the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this proposed AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this proposed AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that the original cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this proposed AD would be redundant and unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

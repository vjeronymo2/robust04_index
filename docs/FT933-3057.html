			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / ICI seeks buyer for stake in Teesside plant IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, Britain's biggest chemicals company, yesterday said it wanted to sell a substantial stake in its Teesside ethylene plant, one of Europe's largest petrochemicals operations. The move would continue ICI's withdrawal from commodity petrochemicals. Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive, said the 850,000 tonne a year plant, located at Wilton, was not a core activity and he expected ownership to change hands. Ethylene is the basic building block for plastics. 'There's no urgency. We won't be a distressed seller and we want to dispose of it in a constructive way. But it is not a core business in the sense that it will be part of ICI for ever and certainly not in a 100 per cent way,' he said. ICI has already set up a joint-venture with Enichem of Italy for its polyvinyl chloride operations and is in the process of selling its European polypropylene operations to Germany's BASF. While it came as no surprise on Teesside to learn that some ICI activities at the site were vulnerable as the company focuses on core businesses, Mr John Newbold, Teesside district secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, was enraged at Mr Hampel's comments. 'I find that statement appalling,' said Mr Newbold, whose union represents 2,000 of the 5,000 blue collar ICI employees at Wilton. 'It would have been common courtesy to explain to the workforce first of all. His first responsibility is to his workforce, not to cause more uncertainty amongst them with generalised statements like this.' The vagueness of the comments could only damage morale, he said. Speaking at a chemicals industry seminar hosted by SG Warburg, Mr Hampel said: 'The Teesside ethylene cracker is modern and cost-competitive and will remain part of the European petrochemical industry for a long time to come.' He stressed that the PTA and Melinar ethylene derivatives businesses were not for sale and that the company would require secure supplies of ethylene for these operations. Mr Hampel said: 'Gone are the days when ICI could afford to carry businesses in which we have no competitive advantage and which do not have profitable growth potential.' The ethylene facility is part of the industrial chemicals division which generated profits during the first half of the year of Pounds 60m on turnover of Pounds 1.8bn.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Thorp Go-ahead: Greenpeace set for court fight Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group which has most vigorously opposed the licensing of the Thorp plant in Cumbria, was last night preparing a final challenge by asking the courts for judicial review of the decision to allow it to operate. But Greenpeace's supporters are concerned that the move could jeopardise its finances. British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, has made no secret of the fact that it hopes costs will curb Greenpeace's ability to campaign. Yesterday's announcement allows BNF to start full operation of the plant in 28 days, which allows time for legal action before the first load of fuel makes the plant radioactive. Greenpeace, whose headquarters in Islington, north London, has been dominated by the Thorp campaign for more than a year, believes judicial review will be granted within days. If granted a review, the pressure group will argue that the government has acted illegally in not holding a public inquiry, and in particular, that it has not taken enough account of health risks. The High Court judge's decision is likely to be final. The risk Greenpeace is running in tackling Thorp through the courts is that if it loses, it will face huge legal bills. In September Greenpeace lost a court battle to prevent BNF testing the plant with uranium and was told to pay all of the government's costs and two-thirds of BNF's costs. Greenpeace says it has not yet received the bill from Freshfields, BNF's solicitors. But it warned its supporters several weeks ago that the bill for that round could be Pounds 250,000. So far, Greenpeace has met its costs from its UK finances. Although fundraising from its 400,000 UK supporters - 2,500 in Cumbria - has suffered during the recession, Greenpeace UK's income last year was Pounds 4.1m net of fundraising expenses, compared with Pounds 3.8m in 1991. If it lost a further court action its campaigning might be seriously dented. Lord Peter Melchett, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said he expected to be able to meet the costs if Greenpeace lost, but that if necessary they could be paid from international funds. Greenpeace's annual worldwide income has hovered around Dollars 150m since 1990.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Threat to airline's services Workers at Ireland's state-owned flag carrier Aer Lingus threatened yesterday to disrupt flights next week, stepping up a dispute over dismissals and cost-cutting. Maintenance workers at the airline's TEAM Aer Lingus subsidiary are due to meet today to discuss strategy after talks with the company and mediators fell apart. Union leaders said they expected the meeting to authorise further action. About 18 flights were delayed at Dublin airport for up to two hours on Saturday when maintenance staff walked off the job. Ireland's Labour Court has said it will investigate the row over attempts to save money in the maintenance division, where 1,300 people have been dismissed. Unions are refusing to accept a package of redundancies and a 28 per cent pay cut as part of plans to save IPounds 8.4m (Pounds 8.3m) a year in government subsidies to the loss-making airline.</p>

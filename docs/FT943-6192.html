			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Management: TUC tackles a 'slippery' idea - Some unions' experience of human resource management is at odds with the hostile rhetoric To some people, human resource management is just a grandiose American term for personnel management. To others, it is a significant departure. The second camp falls into two categories: those for whom the current fashion for HRM represents a belated rush towards enlightened management, and those who see it as the cold manipulation of people as a resource to be managed like any other. Britain's trade union movement is belatedly just taking its first serious and comprehensive look at the subject. Delegates at next week's Trades Union Congress in Blackpool will debate a lengthy policy document that the TUC has just produced*. HRM appears to fill the TUC with suspicion, if not downright hostility. In the words of the new report, 'it is a slippery concept that means different things to different people'. As the TUC says, in business school theory HRM is primarily about making the best use of the skills of employees and placing the management of 'human resources' at the centre of business planning. As the report puts it, 'on this definition HRM may be associated with a range of techniques involving changes in the methods used to communicate with workers, the organisation of the workplace and payment systems'. The main ingredients of HRM, as the TUC sees it, include teamworking, quality circles, single status, lean production and just in time manufacture, customer care training as well as performance-related pay, profit sharing and share options. In essence, the report believes that the HRM focus is 'on the individual rather than the collective body of workers'. This differs sharply from traditional personnel management, in the TUC's view. David Coates, the author of the TUC report, argues that HRM 'is concerned with building a new workplace culture. Personnel management was less comprehensive and not integrated into the production process'. From the experience of its affiliate unions, the TUC believes that 'the theory of HRM bears little relationship to the practice'. 'The language of HRM has been so abused by employers that the term may have outlived its usefulness,' the report declares. 'The question now is better posed in terms of how trade unions should engage with management change and use that process to improve the working lives of our members.' What particularly concerns the TUC is its conviction that HRM 'rhetoric has often been used to conceal a deliberate anti-union policy'. In the minds of many union leaders, HRM is associated with trade union derecognition in the workplace by employers, and a resulting loss of union influence. But at the same time the TUC accepts it cannot simply resist blindly what is happening in the workplace. It agrees that unions must 'use the process of change to deliver on trade union objectives'. Part of the trouble lies in a question of definitions. The TUC seeks to distinguish between what it calls 'good' and 'bad' HRM. The former is concerned apparently with a corporate strategy to 'build a world-class workplace'. As the TUC argues: 'The employer would be seeking to improve performance by developing employee commitment. This would in turn entail an extension of consultation with recognised trade unions, long-term investment in training and a genuine attempt to develop social partnership.' The TUC believes there are two 'bad' kinds of HRM. The first is 'the piecemeal, ad hoc, unsystematic attempt to select items from the HRM menu in the hope that this will improve the company's performance'. The second involves an emphasis on individualising the employment relationship that conceals a 'vigorous anti-union policy'. The TUC says many trade unionists believe that HRM is 'nothing more than implementing redundancies, casualising the workforce, reducing wages and reasserting management's right to manage'. In written evidence to the TUC on their experience of HRM, a number of trade unions emphasised that while they may not like it, they have had to respond pragmatically. 'Our view is that while HRM may be undesirable, the facts have to be faced,' explained Terry Lane, the deputy general secretary of the Engineers' and Managers' Association. 'HRM techniques are being put into practice by employers and while they may not yield the results anticipated by their advocates, the trade union roles should be to minimise their detrimental effects. Our experience has been that if we were to try and stand between our members and the prospects of improved rewards, respect and support dwindles. Our members expect us to protect them and take steps as are necessary to minimise any potential losses to them individually.' A more positive and less defensive view came from Bill Jordan, the AEEU engineering union's president. He told the TUC that his union had signed a number of single union agreements with foreign companies like Nissan, Toyota and Sony and that it had found 'their approach to HRM gave no reason for complaint'. 'Team working, flexibility and multi-skilling have been central to the competitive edge that these companies have established but they have never sought to exploit their workforces by using these techniques,' he explained. Jordan pointed out that quality circles and team-working implied 'consultation with the workforce as well as the devolution of power as far as is practicable'. He instanced a deal with the Rover group in April 1992 as 'the first attempt of a British motor manufacturer to introduce HRM'. The AEEU president conceded that some unions have had a negative experience of HRM as a 'short cut to the shedding or exploitation of labour'. And 'sadly, the AEEU has experience of working in these companies as well but this is no reason, in itself, to reject the proper use of HRM,' he added. 'In reality companies will introduce these techniques regardless of our opposition,' said Jordan. 'Let us not leave our shop stewards with the unenviable task of trying to respond to change with no guidance or practical support from their union or from the wider trade union movement'. Other unions are hostile to HRM. The finance union Bifu told the TUC that 'the common themes running through most of the HRM techniques that have been introduced are cost control, increased flexibility of resources and attempts to marginalise the union role'. Nor was there much sign of enthusiasm for HRM in the evidence to the TUC from the CPSA civil service union. It complained that HRM posed 'a serious threat to collective bargaining arrangements'. Despite the criticisms and doubts about HRM, most of Britain's trade unions are anxious to emphasise they want to co-operate with workplace innovation and not resist change. In the TUC's document a number of case studies are highlighted to illustrate this, most notably workplace reforms at Ford in Bridgend, the Inland Revenue, British Telecom, and Lucas Flight Control Systems in Wolverhampton. The angry words of condemnation to be expected from the rostrum of congress in Blackpool next week on the so-called iniquities of HRM will belie the flexible and pragmatic way in which a growing number of unions are forming partnerships with companies in the introduction of new working practices to make business more competitive. Not for the first time in the trade unions, the gap between rhetoric and practice is enormous. * Available from Sept 4. Price Pounds 5.</p>

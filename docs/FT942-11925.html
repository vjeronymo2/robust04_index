			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Tuesday: Figures for M0, the narrowest measure of the UK money supply, are expected to show growth of 5.9 per cent in the 12 months to April. This is still well above the government's 0-4 per cent monitoring range and would provide further evidence that consumer demand remains buoyant despite the tax rises. The Treasury's panel of independent forecasters, the so-called 'wise men', meet to discuss the prospects for the UK economy. Their findings will be published on May 17. German industrial production data for March are expected some time this week. Analysts forecast a monthly rise of 0.5 per cent, compared with February's 1.2 per cent. Wednesday: The UK's official reserves are expected to show no change in April, after falling by Dollars 45m in March. The Treasury will release its monthly monetary report, to coincide with the meeting between the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England. Thursday: German unemployment statistics for April are expected to show a seasonally adjusted rise of 23,000 in the west and an unadjusted fall of 20,000 in the east.</p>

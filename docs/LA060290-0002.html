			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A HARD LESSON: WATER, CHILDREN DON'T MIX  </P> <P> Kevin Wood Jr. was down to one egg.  </P> <P> An Easter egg hunter of enormous talent, he searched and searched -- and then  pounced.  </P> <P> He had it. He smiled. His basket was full. He was as content as a 2-year-old  can be.  </P> <P> Two minutes later, he was nearly dead.  </P> <P> His uncles and aunts found him floating face down in the pool, his body an ugly  blue, bobbing just out of reach of the tennis ball he had chased into the  water.  </P> <P> "He was only out of sight for a few moments," said his father, Kevin Wood, a  Marine sergeant whose voice cracked as he spoke. "He was always laughing, full  of life, getting into things."  </P> <P> The mean season for children and water is under way.  </P> <P> Eighteen San Diego-area children who had nearly drowned or had drowned have  been taken to Children's Hospital this year -- 13 in March and April alone --  and local health officials have begun the annual summer campaign to promote  water safety and cardiopulmonary resuscitation lessons.  </P> <P> In San Diego County, juvenile drownings decreased slightly in recent years, but  the death rate is up early this year, according to the county medical  examiner's office.  </P> <P> Six area children under age 14 have drowned so far in 1990, compared with 8  deaths in 1989, 12 in 1988, 18 in 1987, and 15 in 1986.  </P> <P> The number of children who nearly drown each year -- many of whom suffer  permanent brain or lung damage -- was not available, but it is estimated that  for every drowning, 10 children are hospitalized from water incidents.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is children should never be left alone -- for even a few  seconds -- around any water," said Mark Morelli, a spokesman for Children's  Hospital, which treats the more severe cases. Last year the hospital handled 52  children who had drowned or nearly drowned.  </P> <P> Area hospitals and other groups will conduct safety programs and classes this  summer at schools, parks, beaches and other areas.  </P> <P> Nationwide, an average of 330 children drown and an additional 4,200 nearly  drown each year, according to the U.S.  </P> <P> Consumer Products Safety Commission. Most are male and between the ages of 12  months and 35 months.  </P> <P> Family back-yard pools account for 65% of the drownings. More than  three-fourths of the victims were seen in the house by an adult less than five  minutes before the accident.  </P> <P> "I can give you all the statistics you want, but the point is that anybody with  a pool must be committed to vigilance (in supervising children)," said Jack  Eden, a spokesman for the federal safety commission. "It can happen to anyone.  Turn your back for a moment. Parents better believe it."  </P> <P> Drowning in residential pools remains the leading cause of death among children  under age 5 in California, one of only four states where water kills more  children than fire, according to the commission.  </P> <P> "These accidents have happened in pools, spas, bathtubs, buckets, but they are  preventable," Morelli said. "We have to convince parents that it can happen to  anyone."  </P> <P> Most drownings and near drownings occur when a child falls into a pool or spa  or is left alone in a bath tub, according to health authorities. Infants can  drown in an inch of water. An 11-month-old Vista baby drowned in April after  falling head-first into a bucket of water.  </P> <P> In April, Michelle Sallee of Chula Vista left her 13-month-old daughter  Brittany in a few inches of water in the bathtub for 30 seconds.  </P> <P> "She was face down when I came back," Sallee said. "She wasn't breathing. Her  lips were blue. I threw her on the floor and started CPR."  </P> <P> Brittany suffered no permanent damage, but the experience convinced Sallee to  encourage other young mothers to be especially watchful around water.  </P> <P> "I thought nothing like that can happen to my baby, but it was just like that,"  Sallee said, snapping her fingers.  </P> <P> Water safety tips include:  </P> <P> * Never leave children alone around water, even those who have taken swimming  lessons.  </P> <P> * Never rely on flotation devices.  </P> <P> * Keep pool and spa areas locked.  </P> <P> * Teach children water safety habits, including no pushing, dunking or diving  into unknown bodies of water.  </P> <P> * Enroll children older than 3 in swimming lessons.  </P> <P> * Learn CPR.  </P> <P> * Teach children how to dial the 911 emergency phone number.  </P> <P> Hospital officials said the Wood family's situation involved the two most  common factors in child drowning or near drownings: Adults were present and the  child was out of sight for only moments.  </P> <P> "His aunt had him by the hand and they started to go into the house," said  Wood, 31, of Escondido. "He follows her like a puppy and she assumed he  followed her into the house, but he slipped away for only a couple minutes.  That's all it took."  </P> <P> Young Kevin is in critical condition in the intensive care unit at Children's  Hospital. He apparently escaped brain damage, but he contracted pneumonia and  remains on a ventilator.  </P> <P> It is too soon to know if Kevin suffered permanent respiratory damage or when  he might breathe without the ventilator, said Dr. Bradley Peterson, director of  the hospital's intensive care unit.  </P> <P> "It can take weeks, months, before we know," Peterson said. "The waiting is the  hardest part for the parents. They go through hell."  </P> <P> Wood and his wife, Myrna, visit their son nightly.  </P> <P> "The waiting is frustrating. We feel helpless," Wood said. "Like my wife says,  she has a real heavy heart."  </P> <P> Wood urged other parents to heed the warnings about children and water.  </P> <P> "You know the old saying: It only happens to the other guy. Well, it happened  to us. I want to tell parents it's a lot easier to put up a fence around the  pool than stand over your child in the ICU and watch him fight for his life."  </P> <P> Peterson said the degree of permanent neurological and respiratory damage  caused by nearly drowning depends on several factors, including the temperature  of the water, how long the heart and blood flow are stopped and whether any  vomit expelled with swallowed water enters the lungs.  </P> <P> Colder water slows the chemical reactions in human tissue, allowing a person to  survive for an extended period with little or no oxygen, and vomit exposes the  sensitive lung tissue to infections, Peterson said.  </P> <P> Most drownings occur before children reach age 4 and develop a minimum of  swimming ability and a greater sense of knowing when to avoid water, Peterson  added.  </P> <P> "The dangerous time is when they learn to walk and they go exploring," he said.  "They can get into paint buckets, mop buckets, drainage ditches, duck ponds.  Anything."  </P></p>

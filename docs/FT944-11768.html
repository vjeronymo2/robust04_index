			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Arts: Spectacular reticence - The praise for Gothenburg's new opera house should be sung from the roof-tops For a city which has just acquired a splendid new opera house, Gothenburg is being very quiet about it. The Operan, to use its Swedish name, opened last month with three song-and-dance evenings targeted at a local public. It has just unveiled its first stage production, Karl-Birger Blomdahl's space opera Aniara, sung by members of the local ensemble. The programme contains no translations for foreigners, and unlike other recent opera house inaugurations, no attempt has been made to attract international attention. It is as if Gothenburg could not care less what an international public thinks of its new opera house. And, you might ask, why should it? The theatre was designed not for jet-setting canary-fanciers, but for the working people of Sweden's second city, who have struggled against considerable odds to get it built. Nonetheless, the absence of fanfare is surprising. Gothenburg, with its westward-looking port, has always thrived on its openness to the world. It is even more surprising when you see the new theatre's spectacular harbourside location, its practical design and user-friendliness: its praises deserve to be sung from the roof-tops. The reticence can be partly explained by management instability in the run-up to the opening. The opera house has been a hot political potato since it was first seriously mooted in the 1960s. There have been rowdy demonstrations, arguments about where it should be sited and who should pay, and repeated attempts by local politicians to dictate the style and content of the programme. These machinations resulted last year in the sacking of the Gothenburg Opera's artistic and administrative directors. Their replacements arrived only three months ago - to find a building far behind schedule: even now, the stage lighting is not properly installed. The new artistic director is Juhani Raiskinen, an experienced conductor and manager who ran the Finnish National Opera from 1973 to 1984. As a professor at the opera school in Gothenburg, he knew the situation and quickly won the backing of staff. But the reticence also reflects the fact that Gothenburg has not provided enough money to run the theatre properly. The city laid detailed plans in the boom years of the 1980s, and by a stroke of good timing, signed the builders' contracts before recession began to bite. The final bill - much of it paid by business and private subscribers - was SKr558m (Pounds 48m), half the cost of Helsinki's opera house. With 1250 seats and a stage of 475 square metres, the new theatre has more than double the capacity of the old Stora Teatern (Grand Theatre), a beautiful but crumbling structure. Now that Gothenburg has the chance to compete and co-produce at international level, it cannot pay for theatre of international quality. There are only 39 members of the chorus, 78 in the orchestra and 50 in the ballet. Raihinen says raising standards above the provincial will take time and money. 'People here have seen Swan Lake on the old stage and cannot understand why we don't revive it in the new theatre. With our present corps de ballet, the dancers would be lost. And can you imagine the end of the first act of Tosca with a chorus of 30 on a stage this size? You can bluff your way now and then, but not for 220 performances a year.' Never mind: the fabric of the building is in place, and what a magnificent site it occupies, with cranes and ocean-going ferries looming across the water, leisure craft moored literally on the theatre's cobbled doorstep, and everywhere a real smell of the sea. The long curved lines of a ship's hull have been incorporated in the exterior design, which has buoyant roof projections, spiked fly-tower corners and a swirling glass facade offering panoramic views up and down stream. Standing apart from other buildings just a stone's throw from the city centre, it fits the harbour environment perfectly. Inside, the atmosphere is warm and intimate, thanks to cherry-wood floors and a traditional horse-shoe design with three balconies. The acoustic is probably a little too bright (it was hard to judge from my seat on a covered side-balcony). Jan Izikowitz, a Swedish architect of Polish origin, deserves credit for creating a theatre which has character but is never boastful. Aniara is hardly an opera for the common man, but the Gothenburg performances - which run till the end of November - sold out quickly because of interest in the new theatre. Blomdahl (1916-1968) based his first and most successful opera on a book by the Swedish author Harry Martinson. It takes place entirely within a spaceship, which hurtles into eternity after abandoning a poisoned Earth. The master is a near-human computer, the Mima, which is fed lumps of pure earth and operated by a mysterious character called Mimaroben. With the onset of despair and moral decline, the computer expires and the passengers gradually die. The opera was first produced in 1959 by the Royal Opera in Stockholm. It created quite a stir - this was two years before man went into space - and even today, 25 years after the first moonwalk, a space opera throws up all kinds of stimulating ideas. What has dated is Blomdahl's music. An easy-on-the-ear mixture of jazz, vocalise, choral chanting and lyrical flourishes, it has episodic atmosphere but lacks a coherent personality. The use of the original electronic tapes only underlined the point. A good production would have overcome these limitations. That the Gothenburg performance fell short was not the fault of the cast, which included a Mimaroben of eerie presence in Mats Persson, a capable Blind Poetess in Carolina Sandgren and a strong cameo from Ragnar Ulfung as the comedian Sandon. The weakness lay in Leif Segerstam's unsubtle conducting and Marie Feldtmann's staging, which used romantic choreography (Virpi Pahkinen), quaint and colourful costumes (Annsofi Nyberg) and a set dominated by a tree representing the Mima (Lars Ostbergh). What Feldtmann saw in Aniara was a metaphor for people who lose their illusions about life and discover that their dreams and aspirations no longer matter. But what we saw was a traditional, earthbound opera. The Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra plays Sibelius' music for The Tempest at the Barbican in London on Saturday November 5.</p>

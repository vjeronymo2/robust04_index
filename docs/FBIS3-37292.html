			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Lukashov report under the "Candidates" rubric: </F> "Elections in Tatarstan: Part Two"]    [Text] By midnight on 14 February the process of  collecting signatures and applications from local citizens  wishing to compete for seats in the federal legislature ended in  Tatarstan's five State Duma districts and one Federation Council  district. A record was set by Privolzhskiy district No. 27: A  total of 11 candidates plan to run for parliament there. A  curious situation came about in Moskovskiy district No. 24,  where the coveted seat will be contested by columnist Fedor  Burlatskiy (it is yet unknown what relation to Tatarstan he has  -- SEGODNYA) and Yuriy Voronin, former deputy Russian Federation  Supreme Soviet chairman, who had earlier been chairman of the  Tatarstan State Planning Committee and had been nominated there  for the Russian parliament. Aside from these, there are another  five candidates registered in the district.    At least five candidates have been registered in three other  State Duma districts also. Virtually all lists feature  Tatarstan Communist Party nominees and candidates from "Equality  and Rule-and- Law," Tatarstan's democratic bloc. Political  observers have noted that there are few Tatar names in the lists  of candidates who have already submitted documents. As in all  of Russia in the latest elections, journalists and charismatic  local leaders account for a significant share of the candidates.    As for the Federation Council, Tatarstan President Mintimer  Shaymiyev and Supreme Soviet Chairman Farid Mukhametshin will  apparently honor its meetings with their presence in the not so  distant future. At least they have already submitted the  requisite number of signatures. People in Kazan think that they  both have virtually 100 percent chances of success, because  their sole opponent is Aleksandr Lozovoy, a deputy chairman of  the local parliament. It has been pointed out, however, that he  may "draw" a certain share of votes of the Russian-speaking  population thanks to his Slavic name.    On 18 February all electoral commissions are required to  compete the authentication of electoral lists and other  documents, after which registered candidates will be given  appropriate certificates.    The new round of the Federal Assembly elections, which were  deemed to have been invalid in December, is scheduled for 13  March.</p>

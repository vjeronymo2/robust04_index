Lula, a 48-year-old lathe operator and union leader, told  foreign correspondents in a news conference that "if we win the  presidential elections, we will fight hard to promote respect  for Cuba and to help it overcome the blockade that is isolating  it from the rest of the world."    Endorsing the Cuban people's right to resolve their  difficult  economic and political problems on their own, Lula said: "The  Cubans have the right to decide their future free from foreign  interference."    Lula, who for one year has enjoyed the preference of 30  percent of the voters in opinion polls, stated that he would  like to see Cuba experience a political opening. He made it  clear, however, that he would refrain from making any proposal  to this effect out of respect for the Cuban people's  independence.    Lula, who is the leader of the Workers Party [PT], said:  "Although I would like to see elections and a political opening  in Cuba, I am respectful of the free determination of the Cuban  people."    "My criticism of Fidel (Castro) is a respectful one  addressed  to a comrade who, because of external pressure, has been unable  to prove that his system can work," Lula said.    The PT is a party consisting of sectors ranging from  ultraleftist to social democratic moderate factions. The PT  leader acknowledges that since the collapse of the Berlin Wall,  socialism is no longer seeking to put an end to capitalism.</p>

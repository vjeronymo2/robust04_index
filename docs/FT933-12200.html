			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Fuel aid plans rejected: Ministers at a loss over method for VAT compensation MINISTERS are at a loss over how to compensate all those who will need extra help to take account of value added tax on domestic fuel. They have rejected every suggestion put forward by Whitehall and told officials to go back to the drawing board. The compensation package for people who just miss eligibility for income-related benefits is the key to making this new tax on household fuel more generally acceptable. The Liberal Democrats yesterday again sought to exploit the unpopularity of the policy by insisting that a defeat for the Tories at Christchurch could mean a change in the plans to extend VAT. Two opinion polls at the weekend showed Mrs Diana Maddock, the Liberal Democrat candidate, on course for a resounding victory in Thursday's by-election. No final decision has to be reached on the compensation arrangements until the annual statement about uprating benefits. But Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, will come under pressure to outline his plans and give renewed guarantees at the Tory party conference in early October. Ministers have said there will be compensation for poorer people beyond the automatic impact of the price increase on the uprating formula, and can see how to provide help for those on income-related benefits. But since the move was announced in the Budget, Tory backbenchers have made clear that there must be a proper compensation scheme for pensioners, especially those whose savings or income just disqualify them from income support. Earlier this month the government's social security advisory committee estimated that compensating about 8m people for fuel bills once the full rate of VAT was charged from 1995 would cost about Pounds 720m. Social security ministers have been looking at possibilities such as raising the amount of savings that makes someone ineligible for income support, increasing the age-related premiums, and adapting cold-weather payments. All have been rejected so far - some because they would be too expensive, others because they are too complicated. Ministers emphasise, however, that in spite of the difficulty of targeting people in need of help but not on income-related benefits, they are determined to find some way of making extra provision. Unease in the party is reflected in some of the conference motions put forward by constituency associations.</p>

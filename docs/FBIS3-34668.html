The source said: Such allegations which some Western  information media have been circulating are totally untrue. He  said: We are convinced that involving Libya's name in this seeks  to harm Libya and, by the same token, to undermine the fraternal  good relations that link it with fraternal Jordan. The source  stressed that Libya has no connection with such actions which it  condemns and rejects.</p>

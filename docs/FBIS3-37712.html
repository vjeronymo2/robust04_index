			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Aram Safaryan held a news conference at the Armenian  Foreign Ministry today.    The Foreign Ministry press secretary referred to the  cease-fire agreement concluded among Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh,  and Azerbaijan in Moscow last Friday [18 February] with the  mediation of Russia and noted that it is another step on the way  toward peacefully resolving the Karabakh conflict and  establishing peace in the region. The Armenian authorities  welcome such a step and will do everything possible to find ways  toward the peaceful resolution of the conflict. Now everything  depends on the stance to be adopted by Azerbaijan and  Nagorno-Karabakh. It is very important that the agreement on a  complete cease-fire was also signed by the representative of  Nagorno-Karabakh. This is another confirmation that Karabakh is  being recognized as one of the main sides to the conflict.    Safaryan also highlighted that in addition to the  cease-fire,  the agreement also envisages the deployment of peacekeeping  forces between the armed formations of Azerbaijan and  Nagorno-Karabakh all along the conflict zone. Of course, no one  should overestimate the importance of this document, after all,  agreements on a cease-fire were concluded in the past but never  implemented because of Azerbaijan, but it should not be berated  at the same time because this is undoubtedly another step in the  difficult process of establishing peace.    The latest developments in the region have generated the  need  to conduct active diplomatic contacts. This is why Armenian  Deputy Foreign Minister Zhirair Liparityan met Vladimir  Kazimirov, the Russian president's ambassador on special  missions, in Moscow. During his 90 minutes of talks with Turkish  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin in Ankara on 21 February, they  examined issues relating to the peaceful resolution of the  Karabakh conflict. Liparityan will also visit France and  Germany, where he will meet Foreign Ministry officials. These  contact are important because both countries are members of the  CSCE Minsk Group and should be able to clarify views on  particular issues relating to the measures envisaged by the CSCE  Minsk Group. At the end of the week, Liparityan will visit  Iran. Armenia's relations with Iran are thriving and must be  expanded in every sphere of cooperation.    Safaryan noted that Armenia aspires to establish good  neighborly relations with all its neighbors in the region. In  this context, Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan's upcoming visit  to Israel is particularly important. The visit is planned for  6-9 March.</p>

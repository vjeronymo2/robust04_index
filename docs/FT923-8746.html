			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / The long, hard road to peace in Mozambique TO suffer one war can be disastrous. To experience four in less than three decades accounts for the catastrophe that is Mozambique. But if this week's peace accord - a belated consequence of the complex peace process under way in southern Africa - is put into effect, recovery can at last begin. Behind it lie the end of superpower rivalry and the proxy battles it led to, and the South African government's decision to negotiate a post-apartheid constitution. For Mozambique, however, the benefits have been a long time coming, and its tribulations go back many years. The guerrilla campaign that won independence from Portugal in 1975 proved a pyrrhic victory, triggering an exodus of hundreds of thousands of whites, many of whom sabotaged what they were forced to leave behind, leaving the country bereft of skills. Ill equipped for independence after centuries of Portuguese misrule, Mozambique's plight deepened when it took the part of rebels in the conflict in neighbouring Rhodesia. Rhodesian retaliation took two forms: attacking guerrilla bases and economic targets such as power stations and bridges, and creating Renamo, the rebel group led by Mr Afonso Dhlakama, co-signatory to yesterday's agreement. Rhodesia's emergence as independent Zimbabwe in 1980 brought no respite. South Africa took over its role as the backer of Renamo, training and supplying a loosely organised army of local war lords, renegades and defectors from the ruling Frelimo party. By then Mozambique was playing a frontline role once more, providing a secure base for the military wing of the African National Congress (ANC) of South Africa. But by 1984, enervated by civil conflict and Pretoria's attacks, Mozambique submitted to her powerful neighbour. In May 1984 the late President Samora Machel and the then South African president, Mr PW Botha, signed the Nkomati non-aggression pact. Unconsulted and unprepared, the ANC was bundled out of Mozambique. In return, South African assistance to Renamo was to end. It never did. Covert aid to the rebels continued at least until President FW de Klerk took office in South Africa in 1989, and there is some doubt whether it ended then. The seeds of Renamo were the black soldiers who had served Portugal's cause in the run-up to independence, many of whom took sanctuary in Rhodesia. But they fell on fertile ground. Popular at first, Frelimo steadily alienated many of its supporters, by mismanagement of the economy, its authoritarian style, or by ignoring or overriding the wishes of traditional community leaders. Renamo, tutored by US and South African advisers, refined its ideology, portraying itself as a movement that stood for multiparty democracy and a market economy. And although it is renowned for its brutality, in recent years its claim to grass-roots support has gained credibility. But whoever wins the promised elections that lie ahead will inherit an impoverished nation deeply scarred by war.</p>

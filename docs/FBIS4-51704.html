			<p>BFN     [Text] The Philippines has launched a campaign to increase  its exports to Japan.    Under this action plan, the country's exports are projected  to increase from $1.8 billion in 1993 to $1.90 billion in 1994;  $1.99 billion in 1995; $2.19 billion in 1996; $2.42 billion in  1997 and $2.66 billion in 1998.    To achieve these objectives, the Export Development Council  (EDC) has adopted the following strategies:  -- Establish a priority Japan program.    -- Promote an effective marketing of the Philippines, its  products, services and investment opportunities.    -- Enhance the Philippine investment environment to take  advantage of the globalization of Japanese industries.    -- Strengthen supply capacities through technology  transfer and increase overall production and efficiency with  foreign capital.    It was noted that during the past few years the trade  balance  between the two countries had always been in favor of Japan.    Statistics show that in 1988 Philippine exports to Japan  amounted to $1.420 million against imports of $1.421 million;  1989, $1.591 million against $2.043 million; 1990, $1.621  million against $2.258 million; 1991, $1.771 million against  $2.372 million; 1992, $1.745 million against $3.086 million and  1993, $1.810 million against $4.00 million.    The top Philippine exports were shrimps and prawns, fresh  bananas, copper concentrates, ignition wiring sets, electrical  and electronic machineries.    The top Philippine imports were consigned electronic parts,  car components, industrial circuit parts and microassemblies,  structures of iron and steel and truck components.    Meanwhile, it was also revealed that the Philippines also  plans to increase its exports to the Greater China market by 50  percent to $1.9 billion this year.    This was reported by Salome Rebosura, leader of the Greater  China Market Group, during a meeting of the Export Development  Council (EDC).    Greater China is composed of mainland China, Hong Kong and  China's breakaway island province of Taiwan.    Export leaders acknowledged the potentials of Greater China  to raise the country's export receipts. The nation has set a 15  percent annual growth target for exports.    To achieve the targets of the industry, Rebosura cited the  following short-term strategies:  -- Focus marketing strategy on Southern China.    -- Establish commercial and consulate offices in Guangdong  or Fujian.    -- Carry out market researches on Greater China initially  on Southern China.    -- Conduct an aggressive marketing and promotional program.    -- Negotiate and implement cooperation development  projects.    -- Explore "outward processing trade" and other joint  venture arrangements.  She also listed the following long-term strategies:    -- Study air and tourism linkages.    -- Cultivate long-term relationship and commitment.    -- Carry out extensive market research.    -- Sustain an aggressive marketing and promotional program.    -- Institutionalize networking.</p>

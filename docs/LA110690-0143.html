			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> PARIS IN THE RED: You're a $150,000-a-year executive in a $500,000 Newport  Beach home and you're due for a transfer.  </P> <P> Which do you pick: Toyko, Paris or Dallas? . . . Careful, for according to  Irvine-based Century 21 Real Estate Corp., your standard of living is in for a  jolt. . . . Pick Dallas and you can get a bigger, more luxurious house that's  $150,000 cheaper. But pick Tokyo or Paris and you'll probably wind up spending  $500,000 to buy an apartment at least 50% smaller than your old house. . . .  "Some are shocked," says a Century 21 spokesman. "That's why Dallas is so  red-hot right now." George Frank and Ann Conway  </P></p>

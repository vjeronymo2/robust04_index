			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the various regulatory regimes discussed herein, the Commission would maintain the above-described exemption from annual charges with respect to municipal projects that have not yet commenced commercial operation. In addition, the Commission proposes to include in the assessment formula (whatever it may be) only licensed and exempted projects that have already been constructed or whose construction has commenced. Although framed in terms of all projects, as a practical matter, because of the exemption for municipal projects, the change would primarily affect non-municipal projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that commencement of construction is a more appropriate determinant than completion of construction, for two reasons. First of all, the date on which construction commenced is a legally precise, documented date <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 15&hyph;16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  whereas the date on which construction is completed is not defined with the same precision. Secondly, it is our understanding that licensees of projects under construction can draw on construction loan funds to pay the annual charges whereas such funds may not be available prior to the commencement of construction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 15&hyph;16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 13 of the FPA requires that the licensee commence construction of the project within fixed time periods after issuance of the license, as specified in section 13 and the license. Thus, the Commission has evolved standards for determining the precise date of commencement of construction, and the hydropower industry is familiar with those standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also proposes to establish a minimum and maximum annual charge. The minimum annual charge would be $100. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We believe that $100 is a reasonable charge for a regulated project to pay, to participate in defraying the cost of administration of the hydropower regulatory program, regardless of how small the project's capacity may be. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under certain circumstances (e.g., commencement of construction, or transfer or termination of a license during a fiscal year) the minimum charge would be prorated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In the event that a municipal licensee was entitled to a partial exemption from annual charges, the exemption could reduce its charge below the $100 minimum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also proposes to set a limit on annual charges so that, with respect to costs incurred by the Commission, no licensee's project would be required to pay more than 2.0 percent of the total costs. We believe that a maximum charge is appropriate to avoid having a small number of projects bearing most of the Commission's costs of administration. The proposed limit is modelled after the formula in &sect;382.203(b) with respect to annual charges for oil pipelines. The maximum annual charge stated therein is 6.339 percent of the total charges, but that figure is based on a much smaller number of significant entities (interstate oil pipelines) sharing a much smaller total cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to a minimum charge, other alternatives would be to waive charges below a fixed dollar amount or below a fixed capacity. With respect to a maximum charge, different percentages could be used for the ceiling. If the formula were to be based solely on capacity, another alternative would be to have a 50 percent discount for all authorized capacity above a prescribed ceiling ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  500 megawatts). In this example, if a project had an authorized capacity of 1000 megawatts, it would be counted in the apportionment formula as 750 megawatts (all of the first 500 megawatts plus half of the second 500 megawatts). The Commission invites comments on these and other potential alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission notes that adoption of some of the alternatives discussed herein might increase the annual charges for certain pumped storage projects. Nevertheless there are other features (such as the start-of-construction date and the maximum charge) that would benefit some pumped storage projects, to the extent that large pumped storage projects have extended design and construction periods and comparatively massive capacity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

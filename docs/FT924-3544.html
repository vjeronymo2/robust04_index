			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / International Company News: Cornelissen quits Royal Trustco directorship MR MICHAEL Cornelissen, who headed Royal Trustco for 10 years during its international expansion, has resigned as a director and will not now become vice-chairman. Royal Trustco is Canada's second-biggest trust company and a key member of the Edper group controlled by the Toronto Bronfman family. It reported a third-quarter loss of CDollars 243m (USDollars 190m) after write-downs on North American and UK property investments, and has sold its US affiliate Pacific First Financial. Its domestic trust business remains profitable. Mr Cornelissen stepped down as chief executive in September. Mr James Miller, 61, a chartered accountant, took over last week as chief executive, a month earlier than expected. Mr Hartland MacDougall, chairman, said: 'Mr Cornelissen thought it best for personal reasons to sever all ties.' Laurentian Bank, controlled by the Laurentian financial services group, reported profits for the year ended August 31 of CDollars 38.7m, up 13 per cent from the previous year.</p>

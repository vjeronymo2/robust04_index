			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Hosokawa victory on reforms: Japanese vote for political change ends days of party wrangling JAPAN'S coalition government last night won the first round of a parliamentary showdown with the opposition Liberal Democratic party, paving the way for wholesale reforms to the corrupt political system. A parliamentary committee voted in favour of the plans, ending days of bitter wrangling between the seven-party coalition and a divided LDP. The Tokyo stock exchange's Nikkei average recovered from Monday's 2.3 per cent fall although investors remained cautious ahead of prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to the US at the end of the week. The committee vote means the four reform bills are now likely to gain majority approval from what is set to be a stormy debate in the lower house tomorrow. That is the biggest hurdle they face. The bills will replace the present multi-seat constituency system, a Japanese peculiarity blamed for encouraging politicians to use money and influence to gain votes, with a mixture of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation. Lower house seats would be reduced from 511 to 500, of which 274 would come from single-seat districts and 226 from proportional representation. The reforms would also ban donations to individual politicians and parties would have to disclose donations exceeding Y50,000 (Pounds 314) a year. Yesterday's vote has opened a rift between younger LDP members eager for reform and able to accept the compromises offered by Mr Hosokawa and older parliamentarians who have spent years and millions of yen building power bases and who fear losing their seats under the new system. Several young LDP parliamentarians promised to vote for the government's proposal tomorrow, heralding another wave of defections. Officials predicted that between 20 and 30 LDP parliamentarians might defect to one of the coalition reform groups. Yesterday's vote follows an early morning breakdown in negotiations between the government and an LDP paralysed by its internal divisions. An attempt to reopen talks later yesterday morning got nowhere, leaving the LDP outmanoeuvred by Mr Hosokawa's success. Tempers frayed as Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP chairman, likened Mr Hosokawa to a 'banana salesman', an unusually pungent insult by Japanese parliamentary standards. If the reform bills clear the lower house by the end of the week, as is likely, they should have enough time to pass through the upper house, the final stage, by Mr Hosokawa's December 15 deadline. He had indicated he would resign if political reform failed to get through parliament by the end of the year. Unless the LDP employs delaying tactics in the upper house, it does not look as if he will have to make that sacrifice.

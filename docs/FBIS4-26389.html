			<p>BFN     [Text] Accompanied by provincial leaders [Deputy  Secretary] Zhang Guoying and [Vice Governor] Liu Weiming, Qian  Qichen, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central  Committee, vice premier of the State Council and concurrently  foreign affairs minister, arrived at the Bei Jiang dike this  morning to express sympathy and concern on behalf of the party  Central Committee and the State Council for the Army personnel  and civilians fighting on the front lines of the flood fighting  and relief work effort as well as to direct this work.    Vice Governor Ou Guangyuan, general director of the Bei  Jiang  Dike Front Line Flood Control Headquarters, briefed Qian Qichen  on the rescue work at the Dachang section of the Bei Jiang dike.  On 18 June the flood waters ran high and swelled perilously at  the Dachang section. If the precarious situation had not been  handled promptly, the dike could have collapsed. Once the  perilous swelling occurred, Army personnel and local civilians  rushed to rescue the dike and in the end averted the potential  disaster.    Qian Qichen conveyed the regards of the party Central  Committee and the State Council to the hundreds of officers and  men who were carrying out relief tasks at the Bei Jiang dike,  highly appraised their performances in fighting floods and doing  relief work, and urged them to make persistent efforts, heighten  their vigilance, and strive for overall victories in the  struggle against the flooding at the Bei Jiang dike.</p>

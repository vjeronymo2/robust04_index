			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Karin Fischer] </F>   [Text] Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] Chairman Haider  sees his fears confirmed. He has learned there are additional  agreements to the transit treaty, which, however, are being kept  secret by the negotiators. It was agreed that, regarding the  weight limit of 38 tonnes per truck, Austria will adopt the  guidelines of the European Union [EU]. That is to say, if a  truck driver from the EU is caught with a heavier load, he will  be liable to prosecution, but, in contrast to Austrians, he need  not pay a fine. Haider literally calls this a dirty trick.    [Begin Haider recording] One talked of tough negotiations  while the negotiators themselves were soft at the negotiating  table. Thus, considering the individual main points of the  negotiations, one has the feeling that the white flag of  capitulation had been hoisted before the beginning of the  struggle at the negotiating table. Klima, Mock, and their  clique spoke strong words at the beginning of the negotiations.  Provincial governors had also expressed what was essential --  for example, the Tirolean governor's comments on the transit  treaty, which are actually not at all in line with the results.  Thus, one can say that the delegation to the negotiations was  largely hoodwinked in Brussels or it was pulled back when the  chancellor finally pulled back and did not permit the delegation  to maintain its tough line, simply because he wanted to achieve  a result. [end recording]    Haider has called on the government to negotiate with the  FPOe on what can still be done to save the agricultural sector.  After that, the extraordinary FPOe congress on 8 April will  decide whether to make a positive or negative recommendation for  the referendum.    The Greens do not share the satisfaction with the outcome of  the negotiations in the least. Madelaine Petrovic [Greens floor  leader] asks who can still believe that this government will  change Europe if it is not even able to adhere to minimum  conditions, for example, the observance of the transit treaty.    [Begin Petrovic recording] The result of the negotiations  differs widely from the few conditions of the Nationalrat for  the Austrian Government. The Austrian Government had clear  instructions regarding neutrality and the maintenance of the  full duration of the transit treaty. Neither of these things  has been ensured now. The transit treaty in particular has been  so flagrantly and crassly violated that I am actually sure that  this will affect the elections in the laender where diet  elections will be held in March and that the numerous  transportation initiatives in Austria will not tolerate it.  [end recording]    This evening, the Greens want to hold first negotiations  with  Tirolean transit opponents on possible blockades.    In contrast to the other two opposition parties, Heide  Schmidt from the Liberal Forum regards the transit solution as  an acceptable compromise.    [Begin Schmidt recording] I am satisfied with the fact that  we have opened the road to an important objective for Austria,  that is, to become an EU member. It is absolutely possible that  more might have been achieved on one point or another. However,  in my opinion, as a member of the opposition, one also has the  duty to see the objective and not to dish out petty political  blows. [end recording]    Heide Schmidt clearly recommends a yes vote in the  referendum.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Church surges by 70% to Pounds 3.2m Pre-tax profits of Church &amp; Co, the footwear manufacturer and retailer, surged by 70 per cent from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 3.2m for 1993, boosted by a 'most significant' advance from its wholly owned subsidiary A Jones &amp; Sons. Group sales advanced by 7 per cent to Pounds 74m (Pounds 68.9m). Earnings per share were 17.4p, up 45 per cent on last year's 12p, while the dividend is stepped up to 13p (12.5p) with a final distribution of 10p. The directors' aim is to return to a dividend cover of two times as soon as possible. Mr John G Church, the chairman, said that Church Footwear and Cheaney further improved their performance. However, losses were incurred in the two North American companies, while the French retail concern also suffered a modest loss, mainly as a result of recessionary pressures in continental Europe. The chairman explained that 1993 was a year of consolidation in which 'we concentrated specifically on improving the profit performance of our various subsidiary companies, both in manufacturing and retail.' The group, he added, acquired a further 25 per cent in its Hong Kong associate, taking the holding to 50 per cent. Results for A Jones revealed a jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 569,000 to Pounds 1.7m for the 12 months, from turnover of Pounds 33.9m (Pounds 30.15m). During 1993 a shop was opened at 133 Bond Street, London, and two more shops will be opened this year. However two others are being closed.</p>

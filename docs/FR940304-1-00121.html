			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Maintenance and installation costs were considered for ranges and ovens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department determined that the only design option which required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional maintenance costs was electronic ignition for gas cooktops. Using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data obtained from electronic ignition manufacturers, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established a price for replacing malfunctioning electronic ignition devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A retirement function based on data received from electronic ignition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers and service technicians was used to establish the rate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure of these control devices. With the retirement function and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement cost, the expected maintenance expense was then determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Rajendra Narang provided patents for improving the efficiency of gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ranges/ovens. These included, for ovens: Combustion air preheated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge gases, heated discharge gases discharged only when combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurs, and circulation fans for better airflow; for cooktops: an efficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> piloted ignition and flame containing burner rings to support pots and pans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Narang, No. 82).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department was not able to assess the energy savings from most of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the design options presented by Mr. Narang. (Circulation fans were analyzed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however.) Experimental data and simulation models were not available to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation of these design options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other comments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the usage assumptions for ranges/ovens be decreased to account for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in lifestyles since the original usage values were estimated. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said the reductions in energy use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are from 68 to 74 percent for cooktops and ovens. (Association of Home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61 at 38). Whirlpool Corporation stated that DOE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should revise the test procedure to account for lower usage; the present test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure overstates usage for cooktops and ovens by 70 and 76 percent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 17). The American Council  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for an Energy Efficient Economy also recommended that the usage values be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> updated. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. at 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, Arkansas Western Gas said range use is down, and that gas use is so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low (6Mcf) that any conservation item will have little effect. (Arkansas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western Gas, No. 64 at 6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated previously, the Department has proposed revised test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for kitchen ranges and ovens. The Department used the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test procedure, including the more current field usage numbers, for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses in today's notice. The new annual useful cooking energy output  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> values were determined to be 209.4 kWh for electric cooktops, 732.5 kBtus for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas cooktops, 35.5 kWh for electric ovens, and 124.2 kBtus for gas ovens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to potential microwave oven standards, the Association of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home Appliance Manufacturers contended that such standards would have an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insignificant effect on energy consumption. (Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers, No. 61A at 29).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department analyzed quantitatively the energy-saving potential of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards on microwave ovens and found that significant savings are possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (See Technical Support Document, Chapter 5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the usage values for microwave ovens, Whirlpool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation stated that microwave energy use has increased significantly, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE should initiate a new study to determine a reasonable estimated energy use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for microwave ovens. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 19). Citing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Electronic Industries Association's estimated 100 kWh/yr usage for microwave  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ovens in 1987, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was consistent with its 1976 data showing 75 kWh/yr usage because, although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average family size has decreased, microwave oven use within the household has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 27).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with the usage number for conventional ranges and ovens, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department used the proposed test procedure usage values for the analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microwave ovens. The Department obtained the proposed energy use values from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several utility conditional demand studies resulting in the proposed usage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value of 270 kWh/yr for microwave ovens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Singaporeans weary of the high cost of driving: The price of running a car in the cramped island state has risen again Thinking of buying a new car but shocked by the expense? Take comfort. You could be living in Singapore. A Jaguar XJ3.2 costs about SDollars 320,000 (Pounds 139,000) to put on the road in Singapore. The equivalent model in Britain costs around Pounds 28,000. At the other end of the market, a Proton manufactured in neighbouring Malaysia costs about SDollars 95,000 to drive in Singapore. In Britain a Proton can be picked up for under Pounds 7,000. Import duties and other taxes take their toll but priciest is the fast accelerating cost of a government Certificate Of Entitlement (COE), the vital piece of paper that allows you to take your already expensive machinery on to the road. Singapore has 2.8m people squeezed on to an island of only 240 square miles. Determined to avoid the traffic chaos of Bangkok and many other Asian cities, the government brought in the COE system in 1990 in order to control the car population. The government releases only a certain number of COEs each year. A new car cannot be registered without one. COEs are obtained by dealers and the public through a monthly bidding system with the government. If 8,000 people are bidding for 4,000 COEs available, the government fixes the COE cost at the level of the lowest successful bid. On Friday the government announced the prices for October COEs. In future Singaporeans will have to dig even deeper into their pockets to experience the joys of motoring. Over the past month a COE for the bigger, more luxurious models has gone up by SDollars 10,000 to SDollars 94,000. COEs for smaller engined cars have gone up by about SDollars 5,000. Mr Philip Eng, managing director of Cycle &amp; Carriage Industries, the company which has the franchise for Mercedes and various other makes in Singapore, says people thought SDollars 1,000 was a lot to pay for a COE four years ago. 'No one ever expected the price of the certificates to go up so fast,' says Mr Eng. 'But what is really amazing is that the market is still growing. In the case of some cars we can't get deliveries fast enough.' A top of the range Mercedes S class costs about about SDollars 330,000 in the Singapore showroom. But add on a new COE and the price comes to around SDollars 420,000. The same car in Germany costs around DM100,000 (Pounds 41,000). At the lower end of the market a Proton's showroom price will be around the SDollars 45,000 mark. Add in the cost of a COE and the price will more than double. According to Mr Eng, 'The prestige level of owning a car here is much higher than in Europe or the US. Here, all the extras we fit in our cars, like stereos or the upholstery, have to be top of the range.' Mr Eng says that with about 12 per cent of the total car market, Mercedes has a bigger market share in Singapore than anywhere else in the world. He says that demand well exceeds supply for C class, the compact Mercedes range. Sales of the S class vehicles are growing and now running at about 500 a year. But while incomes of Singaporeans have risen sharply in recent years, owning a car is an impossible dream for many people. The rapidly rising costs of cars has become a political issue. The COE system brings billions of dollars into the exchequer each year. However, the government is criticised for what is seen as an inequitable system. One government critic asks: 'What about the market trader or hawker? They need cars more than the Towkays (big businessmen) and their Tai Tais (ladies of leisure).'</p>

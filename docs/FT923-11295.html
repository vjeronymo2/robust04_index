			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Survey of Second Cars (4): Tempting offers - at a price - Ways to Finance / 'Free credit' is genuinely available but it usually has a price-tag BORROWING money to buy an asset which depreciates as fast as a car is inadvisable. Adding to your personal debt burden, even minimally, to acquire a second car seems ludicrous. Gone are the go-go 1980s. These are the caring 1990s when experts are advising us to pay off our debts as quickly as possible - even the mortgages on our houses - because we are unlikely to receive a return on savings higher than the rate we have to pay on money we borrow. So obviously the best way to finance the purchase of a second car is either to pay cash from savings or to save until the cash is available. For those people who for some reason cannot follow this advice, a loan arranged by the dealer selling the car might well be the cheapest form of finance. Most car companies have their own finance subsidiaries and these may offer very attractive terms. Dealer finance rates are often negotiable. If you don't like the sound of the first offer, find out elsewhere if better terms are available. Personal loans from banks or building societies - organisations also geared up to deal with individuals seeking money - are also likely to offer competitive terms. But shop around by checking the APR (annual percentage rate) on loans, remembering that APR often varies according to the length of loan. Don't forget to see if you qualify for some special deal because you work for a particular company or belong to a particular trade union or other organisation. Gold credit card holders are offered special, low rates on loans. Hire purchase arrangements tend to be more expensive than bank and building society loans and in some circumstances you can lose the car if you fail to keep up with the payments. On the other hand, with hire purchase you are better protected if something goes wrong with the car because the hire purchase provider has joint liability. For instance, if the dealer went bankrupt and could not fulfil his obligations you would still be legally protected by the finance company. On this question of protection, some lenders sell their own insurance policies to ensure the loan is repaid should something go terribly wrong with your health or job. However, these can be very expensive - some even add about 30 per cent to the cost of the loan. It is sometimes possible to link a loan for a car to an existing property mortgage. The interest is likely to be favourable but many people would not think it worth repaying a car loan for the rest of the mortgage term. This cash-raising option probably would suit only those with mortgages with relatively little time still to run. At the other extreme, if you need to raise a short-term loan for a car (perhaps while waiting for some savings which are taking time to release) an overdraft from your friendly bank manager will almost certainly be the cheapest form of finance. As there is no conclusive indication yet that the car market is moving out of recession, there is a proliferation of tempting offers by manufacturers and dealers. Free credit is genuinely available but it usually has its price. Interest-free credit is generally offered only if you pay the full retail price for a car, whereas a cash buyer can often get a reasonable discount. Interest-free credit is frequently on offer only if the loan is paid back quickly. For example, there is a zero interest rate with Vauxhall's current deal on Novas and Cavaliers - but only if you put down a 50 per cent deposit and pay the remainder back in one year. If you decide to try to negotiate a discount for cash (with perhaps the intention of raising a personal loan to cover the outlay) it is best to remember that the average dealer's profit margin on high-volume, small cars is about 18 per cent. However, manufacturers frequently set dealers agreed sales targets which, when reached, can earn the dealer an additional credit of 3 or 4 per cent off every car sold during the offer period - which might be over several months. Consequently, if you are lucky enough to catch a dealer who is only a few units short of the sales target with just a few days to go, you might strike a very good bargain indeed. One sign that these are difficult times for car producers is an unusual scheme that Ford, the market leader in the UK, has introduced. Ford has come up with what is virtually a car leasing scheme for private individuals and it must be assumed that its rivals will follow suit if it shows any sign of success. With Ford's 'Options' scheme, a customer chooses a new car and the manufacturer guarantees the value at the end of the finance agreement by advising, in writing, the car's minimum guaranteed future value - Ford's estimate of the amount the car might be worth at the end of the agreement. This sum is then deducted from the price of the car so that the customer makes payments only on the balance, plus interest on the full price. At the end of the agreement customers have three options: Choose a new car, selling the old car themselves or through the dealers' resale club. The guaranteed future value amount is only paid to Ford Credit. In this situation the customer benefits from any profit above the guaranteed future value. Keep the car by paying the guaranteed future value amount. Return the car to the dealer. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, suggests that Options will make a new car 'affordable' for many people who, because of the recession, have been unable to buy one. He says Options aims 'to encourage customer loyalty and to enable customers to change their cars more frequently with minimal change to their monthly budget'. Anyone who has tried to sell a used car recently will tell you that Options looks like a good deal. However, there are some drawbacks. For example, you might not actually receive the guaranteed future value payment you expected if the car has suffered excess wear and tear. Ford dealers will apply the same scale used for measuring damage to leased cars to assess the reduction in value and the buyer will have to make up any shortfall. Also, where the car is sold through a dealer for more than the guaranteed value, the dealer may insist on a share of the profit. But whatever method you choose to finance that second car, remember the golden rule: never borrow more money than you can raise if you have to sell the car in a hurry.</p>

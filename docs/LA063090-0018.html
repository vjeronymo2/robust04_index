			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BATMAN' WHO TOOK ON RAP  </P> <P> I'm not a fearful person, but there are a few things that frighten me.  </P> <P> Nuclear weapons. Moldy leftovers. Astronomical real estate prices. And men like  Jack Thompson ("The 'Batman' Who Took On Rap" by Chuck Philips, June 18)  frighten me.  </P> <P> Thompson's virulent campaign to smother First Amendment freedoms is noteworthy  not only for its vociferousness but also for its apparent success.  </P> <P> When he says, "(God) has put the world together in such a way that government  exists to point people God-ward," I become truly frightened. All this time I  thought government existed to govern.  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER MEINDL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Austria stands out in flat week IN AGGREGATE, the world was flat last week. Europe and Japan moved into decline after improvements in the previous week, and this cancelled out a rise of 1.2 per cent in the US. Interest rate hopes affected Wall Street and Tokyo, the former ending higher last Friday on hopes of a cut this week. Europe lost its glow with a fall, excluding the UK, of 0.4 per cent. Sassoon (Europe), UK arm of the Singapore-based stockbrokers, estimates that a portfolio of European blue chips brought investors a return of approaching 30 per cent in the first quarter of 1991, a process it describes as 'the suckers' rally'. According to Mr Roger Hornett, who leads on Europe, this is a rise in a bear market, brought on by people who do not want to miss the next bull run. It is there to be enjoyed, he says, but participants should remember to sell out before the next bear market leg. In Germany, Italy and France, says Sassoon, earnings have been disappointing, even if in the Netherlands and Spain the surprises have been on the upside. 'Volumes are beginning to close back down,' the broker observes, adding: 'This gift horse has the most rotten of teeth.' Last week's best European performer was Austria, up 2.2 per cent after a similar rise in the five days before. Mr Andrew Thomson of Kleinwort Benson said last week that he was raising his short term weighting for the country for several reasons: The end of the Gulf war could see the end to the recent volatility of the market; economic prospects remain well above average; earnings growth remains healthy; the chart of the domestic index is giving a buy signal; anticipated equity issues, think Kleinwort, are now largely discounted and liquidity has been building up; a cut in asset tax on equities would help the market; and, finally, any hint of recovery in the economies of Austria's eastern neighbours could strongly boost equity sentiment.</p>

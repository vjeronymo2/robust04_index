			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / All eyes on the prize: FT writers on the race to stage the 2000 Olympics For four international cities limbering up in the race to stage the 2000 Olympic games, the coming marathon will be a test of organisation as well as of endurance, with much gold awaiting the winner. The International Olympic Committee will decide the venue in September next year. Already, the four contestants - Berlin, Manchester, Sydney and Milan - are moving into the starting blocks. Beijing has also put in a bid. But, hampered by memories of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, it is already regarded as an also-ran. The cities are gearing up for a widespread marketing effort. There are intriguing national differences in the styles of their campaigns. Berlin's candidature is designed to symbolise the new face of a reunited Germany. Mr Heiner Giersberg, spokesman of the Berlin 2000 Olympic games office, calls the proposal 'Chancellor Kohl's personal baby'. Manchester is supported by lthe dashing figure of the Duke of Westminster, Britain's richest landowner, who heads the city's Olympic committee. He runs his Grosvenor Estates land and property empire from neighbouring Cheshire. With an eye on the general election and the number of marginal constituencies in north-west England, Mr John Major, the sports-loving prime minister, has given the Mancunian initiative his personal backing - as well as a large infusion of government money. Sydney, which hopes to bring the Olympics to the southern hemisphere for the first time since the Melbourne games in 1956, is banking on its scenic setting as well as its well-established facilities. Yachting in Sydney Harbour, in sight of the Harbour Bridge and Opera House, would be one of the most spectacular of all Olympic events. According to Mr Rod McGeoch, chief executive of Sydney Olympic 2000, the private company running the bid, ambiance is vital. 'I don't think you can hope to win the Olympic games unless you can demonstrate that the athletes will have an excellent time.' True to form in a country where the turf for the 1990 World Cup was not laid until days before the soccer started, Milan is taking a more languid approach. Italy's commercial and financial capital is stressing its reputation as an international business centre and its independence from Rome. Experience with the World Cup is likely to be one of the few strong cards in Milan's hand. Despite all the tantrums about unfinished stadiums and incomplete roads, 'Italia 90' went remarkably smoothly. 'We produced a fabulous stadium,' says Mr Roberto Caputo, the city councillor for sport, whose department is responsible for the Olympic project. He adds, a little lamely: 'We have a strong sporting tradition, with two famous football teams.' Selling cities as Olympic capitals involves large financial outlays. In Australia, Mr McGeoch, a prominent Sydney lawyer and amateur sportsman, is being paid more than ADollars 150,000 a year (Pounds 65,000) to run the bid, on which planning started in December 1990. Olympic 2000 has a budget of ADollars 20m, underwritten by the state government of New South Wales. Sydney's backers believe the city's biggest drawback is Australia's geographic position, which would make it expensive to reach, particularly for competitors from Europe and large parts of the Third World. Sydney is in a time zone where Europeans would have to stay up all night to watch events live on television. But morning events would be prime-time evening viewing in the US, which accounts for 70 per cent of television revenue for the games. Olympic 2000 says the games would generate about ADollars 1.1bn (Pounds 470m) in ticket sales, licensing and other revenue, compared with expenses of about ADollars 1bn. Any shortfall would be covered by the state government, which believes the Olympics would create 27,000 construction projects, and generate economic activity worth up to ADollars 10bn. The Berliners, meanwhile, are putting forward significantly larger figures for their city's potential outlays. Compared with Sydney, there is also more money attached to the job of chief Olympic promoter. Mr Axel Nawrocki, the head of Berlin's Olympic games office, was hired from the Treuhand privatisation agency on an annual salary of DM360,000 (Pounds 125,000). The Olympics proposal links the two halves of the city. The decision to seek the prize was one of the first moves by the previously separate city administrations of East and West Berlin not long after the wall fell in November 1989. Berlin's backers believe that the Olympics would cost roughly DM2bn and earn DM4bn. For Berlin, one of the largest expenses will be the Olympia Express, an 18km-long rapid transit system costing an estimated DM400m and linking the Olympic sites at Lake Rummelsburg in east Berlin with the Olympic village at Ruhleben in west Berlin. It will run parallel to the S-Bahn overground railway, and will be used after the games, limiting the cost to the organisers. Like Berlin, Manchester is using its campaign to stress the city's quest for renewal after a period of fraught recent history. The driving force behind the Mancunian campaign is Mr Bob Scott, the Somerset-born dynamo behind the city's commercial theatre revival in the past 10 years. Mr Scott says that, if Manchester is to swing the games its way, the IOC will want to see 'deeds not dreams'. A Manchester Olympics would cost about Pounds 1bn, says Mr Scott, of which a third would come from the government. Earlier this month Whitehall committed an overall Pounds 55m to help. Most of it is earmarked for building an indoor arena near Manchester's city-centre Victoria Station and a velodrome in east Manchester, as well as for clearing the site where the Pounds 170m Olympic stadium is planned. Milan estimates a cheaper price tag of about L1,500bn (Pounds 695m). 'The bulk' of this will have to come from outside, says Mr Caputo. He is looking for commercial sponsorship, not for subsidies from the Italian government. Milan is stressing the importance of cutting costs, and of limiting the environmental impact of the new facilities. 'The priority is not to become submerged in a sea of cement nor to inundate the city with more traffic,' Mr Caputo says. Milan's qualms over construction underline that an important factor determining the choice of Olympic venue will be the efficiency of planning. A key element behind Berlin's proposal is that only four sports halls need to be built, all in east Berlin. The largest multi-purpose Berlin sporting facility, Olympia Hall, will have a capacity of 15,000 and is to be financed by private investors at about DM1.1bn-DM1.6bn. Sydney's backers say up to 70 per cent of the sporting facilities will be in place by the time the IOC votes in September 1993. The government has advanced ADollars 300m to finance an aquatic centre and two athletics stadiums. The most costly element in Manchester's Pounds 1bn total, meanwhile, would be the Pounds 400m Olympic village, which would be used as housing afterwards. As they prepare to make their decision, IOC officials will not simply be besieged with plans for new facilities; they will also see some infrastructure of a more traditional variety. Berlin's stadium built for the 1936 games is to be refurbished and used for the opening ceremonies and other events. Manchester will show off Lancashire's Old Trafford cricket ground, where baseball would be staged. As far as lobbying is concerned, Australia's, at least, look likely to be spartan. Sydney's Mr McGeoch rules out the ritzy public relations used by past contenders. 'I have never taken anybody to lunch to get their business. I want to be able to say to the IOC: 'Come to us and you will get the Olympic ideal.'' The cities have 18 months to show they can satisfy that tradition. The contest is under way to capture the Olympian mood of the millennium.

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Gardening: Plant of the Week - Choisya ternata This fine evergreen shrub is known as the Mexican Orange Blossom because its white, sweetly-scented flowers are somewhat like those of the orange but the plants are totally unrelated. The leaves are three-parted, very glossy and aromatic when bruised. The flowers are produced most freely in May and early June but a few more to appear later in the summer. It makes a densely-branched bush, 5 ft or more high, but it can be kept smaller by pruning after flowering. It likes sunny places sheltered from wind.</p>

During their meeting in the Russian capital Monday [21  March]  and Tuesday, Lithuanian and Russian negotiation teams  initialled a bilateral agreement on border crossings.    At a press conference in Vilnius Wednesday, Bulovas said the  Lithuanian group paid primary attention to the implementation of  the Lithuanian-Russian agreements signed last November and the  fate of Lithuanian savings kept in the former Vneshekonombank  and the Soviet Savings Bank.    The Lithuanian negotiator said the Russian delegation  focused  on problems related to the Kaliningrad region. In Bulovas'  words, his Russian counterpart Viktor Isakov complained of a  number of problems as if encountered by the region, but when a  separate group discussed Kaliningrad matters, only two problems  remained -- customs duties and Russian transit through Lithuania  by rail and by road. Both issues should be discussed in April,  the Lithuanian diplomat said.    Russia also raised the problem of military transit. The  Lithuanian group said there are no intentions to sign a military  transit agreement, but there will be transit regulations  instead. The Russian side said it would like experts to hold  consultations on military transit in May. This request was  registered in the meeting's protocol but Lithuania did not  promise anything, Bulovas said.    Lithuanian negotiator Raimondas Barcevicius, who deals with  commercial and economic matters, said presidents may have to  intervene to achieve enforcement of economic and commercial  treaties. Barcevicius said the agreement on the most favored  nation trade status does not function because it has not been  ratified by Russia. Moreover, he said, export to Russia became  even more difficult in March when Russia changed its customs  regulations. In Barcevicius' opinion, it becomes useless for  Lithuania to renew its agreement with the Moscow city  administration.    The negotiator said Russia uses its new parliament as a  cover  to link the ratification of the most favored nation trade status  agreement with a number of other problems.    Barcevicius said similar problems are encountered in dealing  with the return of lost savings. Ricardas Seidelis, also a  member of the Lithuanian group, said Russia tries to link the  return of savings with the problem of covering internal debts of  the former Soviet Union.    Seidelis said Russia's reaction was stormy when Lithuanian  negotiators noted the matter might be referred to international  arbitration. In his words, the Russian delegation immediately  assured that the problem can be solved without any international  interference.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- Sinsegi Mobile Telecom, a  consortium to build and run the country's second cellular phone  network, said it had decided to exclude GTE Corp. of the United  States from its prospective shareholders.    The American company has turned down Sinsegi's offer to send  a letter agreeing to join the consortium as a shareholder.    Sinsegi has earlier allotted its foreign stake of 22.2  percent among four American companies -- 10 percent to ATC, 7  percent to Southwestern Bell, 4 percent to GTE and 1.2 percent  to Qualcomm -- and asked them to send a letter of consent by  Friday.    Sinsegi will take action on the 4-percent stake allotted to  GTE in consultation with its controlling shareholders, Pohang  Iron and Steel Co. and the Kolon Business Group, a company  official said.</p>

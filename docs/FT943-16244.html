			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Brazilians spoil USA's Independence Day party Not all revolutions end with the good guys winning, Jurek Martin writes. The second 'shot heard around the world' came not from a young American in red, white and blue but from Bebeto of Brazil in the 73rd minute as the World Cup's favourites ousted their hosts 1-0 on Independence Day. Brazil now meet Holland in the quarter-finals. There were times yesterday when the improbable dream of the US soccer team seemed alive and in never more than in the closing minutes of the opening half. First Romario, comfortably the best player on the field, struck a right-foot shot against Meola's left-hand goalpost. Moments later, Leonardo's left elbow struck Ramos's jaw front and centre. The American went down - not to return - and Brazil's right side offensive threat went off under a red card. No score at the break and Brazil down to 10 men presented the US with an opportunity to excite even the most hardened pessimist. But the essential superiority of the Brazilian team reasserted itself in the second half. Or, to be precise, Romario imposed himself on the game. Time and again he ran at the US defence, the ball under close control, the intent lethal. It was he who created the coup de grace. After 73 minutes, he beat a couple of defenders on the run down the middle, before laying it off with the outside of his boot to Bebeto, his faithful side kick, on the right inside the penalty area. The shot was not hard, but it was low and accurate, just inside Meola's right post and under his dive, which seemed higher than it might have been. After 85 minutes, Clavijo, the stalwart US defender, got his second yellow card, and thus an ejection, for bringing down, inevitably, Romario. But by then the US had run out of steam and ideas. Brazil dropped Rai from mid-field, an odd decision given his earlier performances. He certainly seemed missed in the first half, as his team rarely threatened to score. This, and Leonardo's sending-off must have elated Bora Milutinovic's men but their ultimate lack of offensive skills proved too great a handicap. The US team certainly achieved all reasonable expectations. They did not, as many feared, become the first host country not to survive the first round. And they held the favourite to one goal. July 4 commemorates victory over the Redcoats, but it was not enough to inspire the US 218 years later to knock off the men in gold. Earlier in Orlando, Holland shrugged off criticism of their early form to beat Ireland 2-0. Bergkamp scored in the 11th minute and Jonk blasted home the second in the 41st. Bonner, the Irish goalkeeper, grappled with Jonk's searing 25-metre drive but failed to stop it. Ireland tried to rally in the second half but their limitations had been exposed by a far sterner and more imaginative Dutch side. Fifa said yesterday that Swiss referee Kurt Roethlisberger would play no further part in the tournament after he admitted he should have awarded Belgium a penalty during their 3-2 defeat by Germany. 'He admitted that he made a mistake. He knows that's it for him,' said Fifa general secretary Sepp Blatter. Belgian soccer authorities attacked Roethlisberger's decision not to award a penalty in the 70th minute of the second-round match, arguing that his decision was the turning point of the game. Roethlisberger, in his second World Cup finals, was earlier quoted telling Swiss tabloid Blick he realised he made a mistake when he saw a television replay of the foul. 'I decided mistakenly. The Belgians were right to claim a penalty,' he told the newspaper.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Results  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Holland          2   Ireland          0 Brazil           1   USA              0         Second Round Games Today     Nigeria vs Italy Boston (6pm BST)   Mexico vs Bulgaria New Jersey (9:30pm)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Quarter-finals Saturday, July 9 Match A: Spain vs winner of Nigeria-Italy, Boston 5pm Match B: Holland vs Brazil, Dallas 8.30pm Sunday, July 10 Match C: Germany vs winner of Mexico-Bulgaria, New Jersey 5pm Match D: Romania vs Sweden, San Francisco 8.30pm  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Semi-finals Wednesday, July 13 Winner match C vs Winner match A, New Jersey 9pm Winner match D vs Winner match B, Los Angeles, 12.30am Thurs  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Final Sunday, July 17 Los Angeles 8.30pm  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Leading Scorers Salenko (Russia) 6 Klinsmann (Germany) 4 Batistuta (Argentina) 4 Dahlin (Sweden) 4 Andersson (Sweden) 3 Goicoechea (Spain) 3 Hagi (Romania) 3 Romario (Brazil) 3 Stoichkov (Bulgaria) 3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

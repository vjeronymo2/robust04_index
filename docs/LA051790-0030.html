			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DISSECTING THE BUNION STORY  </P> <P> Iread The Times' article in the April 24 Valley section about a podiatrist  named Dr. Garey Weber with shock and dismay.  </P> <P> Weber removed three bunions from my feet last December in a most professional  and efficient manner. Within three months I was able to play tennis up to three  hours a day with no problems.  </P> <P> I believe that the reporting was irresponsible. The article quotes James  Rathlesberger (executive officer of the state Board of Podiatric Medicine)  saying that "one of the most significant terms in the settlement was Weber's  agreement to stop performing the 'Weber bunionectomy.' " Later in the article  it indicates that Weber has not stopped performing the surgeries but only  altered the location of his bone cuts less than one inch. How can this  methodology possibly be "medical mayhem" if it is continuing to be performed?  By featuring this description of the surgery, the Los Angeles Times makes Weber  guilty.  </P> <P> In addition, Rathlesberger says that people are screaming in agony in Weber's  office. I have been in the office at least 30 times and always found a calm,  friendly and professional medical atmosphere. His claim is patently absurd.  </P> <P> Rathlesberger also relates that Weber, in effect, breaks people's toes and then  asks them to walk on them in great pain. This simply is not true. The article  states that "patients who have pins inserted normally are bedridden and do not  walk for days or weeks." Conventional bunion surgery does involve a pin -- but  not bed. People haven't been put in a bed for bunions for years. People with  pins walk out of the office in a cast, with the assistance of crutches. Weber's  patients walk out of the office with a bandaged foot in an orthopedic shoe and  do not need the assistance of crutches. They are able to drive immediately and  conduct their lives normally. Recovery is fast, bones heel quickly, and the  chance for complications is reduced.  </P> <P> I acknowledge that most of my complaints are with Rathlesberger's comments.  However, Cheevers features these comments and presents them as facts. Although  the Medical Board of California did not find Weber guilty, anyone reading the  article would assume that he is. In my opinion, The Los Angeles Times has  responsibility to print facts. Printing mistruths, lies and damaging  descriptions simply because someone says them does not absolve The Times.  </P> <P> PATRICIA HARRIS  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

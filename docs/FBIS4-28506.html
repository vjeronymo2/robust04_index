			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 5 (YONHAP) -- Western banks obliged to  report to the Bank of International Settlements increased their  credit to North Korea 45 million U.S. dollars to 492 million  dollars last year, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reported Sunday.    The Japanese-language economic newspaper said the reason of  the Western banks' increased credit to North Korea last year in  spite of the heightened tension over the Stalinist state's  nuclear standoff was not known, citing an international  financial market source.    Western credit to North Korea was on the decline between  1990  and 1992.    Japanese banks' loans to North Korea have leveled off at  about five percent of the Western banks' credit over the years,  the source was quoted as saying.    The EUROMONEY magazine published in England put North Korea  at the 157th place in the country-risk ranking in its March  issue last year.    The Western banks' increased credit to North Korea last year  in spite of such a high country risk may be attributed to  increased trade between North Korea and Western nations on a  short-term credit basis, the newspaper said.</p>

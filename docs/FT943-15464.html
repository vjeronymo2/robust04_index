			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Germany cuts conscription The German government yesterday decided that conscripts in the German armed forces will have to serve 10 months instead of 12, part of a package of reforms designed to trim the Bundeswehr from 370,000 to 340,000. A total of DM47.5bn (Pounds 19.6bn) will be earmarked for the 1995 military budget. The new structure of the Bundeswehr will have 290,000 troops assigned to the so-called main defence forces and a further 50,000 in crisis reaction forces where soldiers must serve at least 12 months. The crisis reaction troops could see action as part of United Nations operations, a thorny issue which the German constitutional court is expected to decide next Tuesday, when it will rule whether German troops can be deployed outside the Nato area.</p>

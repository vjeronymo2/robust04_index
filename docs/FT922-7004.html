			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Azerbaijan may pull out of CIS THE NEW leadership in Azerbaijan yesterday vowed to take the republic out of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, leader of the dominant Popular Front and the favourite candidate to win presidential elections due on June 7, said 'Azerbaijan will not be part of the current CIS, there is no doubt about that'. Popular Front leaders refused to accede to a collective security pact signed by six of the CIS members in Tashkent last week, seeing it as a threat to the republic's security. They believe Russian influence helped reinstate the former communist president, Mr Ayaz Mutalibov, for 24 hours last week before he was forced to flee. The conflict between Armenian and Azeri forces, which has spread from Nagorno Karabakh in Azerbaijan to the northern tip of the Azeri autonomous republic of Nakhichevan within Armenia, is causing growing concern to neighbouring Turkey and Iran.</p>

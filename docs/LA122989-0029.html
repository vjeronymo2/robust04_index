			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA: IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> SAFETY VIOLATIONS IN CRANES FOUND  </P> <P> City officials say inspectors have found safety violations in half the  high-rise construction cranes operating in San Francisco a month after a crane  collapse killed five people. California Occupational Safety and Health  Administration inspectors have ordered five cranes shut down until violations  were corrected. Two other cranes were found to be in proper order, while the  other three cranes in use at high-rise construction sites have yet to be  inspected, officials said. Mayor Art Agnos, who requested Cal/OSHA to do the  inspections after the Nov. 28 disaster, promised to seek stricter supervision  of the machines, warning careless operators that "we're coming after you." He  said he will tell other mayors throughout the state of the result of the  inspections and hoped that together they could pressure the state Legislature  for stricter regulation.  </P></p>

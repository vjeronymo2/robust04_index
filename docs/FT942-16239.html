			<p>940412 FT  12 APR 94 / Brussels optimism on trade European Commission officials are hopeful that informal discussions can smooth over some of the disputes which have come to the fore during negotiations on the Uruguay Round of global trade reform and EU plans to develop European information highways. The optimism follows talks between European and US business leaders and officials in New York last week. A Brussels spokeswoman said the largest obstacles concerned standardisation, intellectual property rights and data protection, where the lack of harmonisation has led companies on both sides to complain of discrimination. EU officials are due to hold another round of discussions with US officials and possibly Japanese representatives again in the autumn.</p>

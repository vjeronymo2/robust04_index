			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary will announce the final funding priorities in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The final priorities will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by responses to this notice, available funds, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other considerations of the Department. Funding of particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects depends on the final priorities, the availability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds, and the quality of the applications received. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication of these proposed priorities does not preclude the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary from proposing additional priorities, nor does it limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary to funding only these priorities, subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting applicable rulemaking requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  This notice of proposed priorities does not solicit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications. A notice inviting applications under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competition will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  concurrent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with or following publication of the notice of final priorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Priorities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary proposes to give an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> absolute preference to applications that meet one of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following priorities. The Secretary proposes to fund under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program only applications that meet one of these absolute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priorities:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Priority 1: Accommodations for Individuals With  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disabilities in Adult Education Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In fiscal year 1991 Adult Education (AE) programs funded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the Adult Education Act (P.L. 100&hyph;297, as amended) served  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over 3.7 million people in Adult Basic Education, Adult Secondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Education, and English-as-a-Second-Language programs. Adult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Education programs serve persons who are educationally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disadvantaged, including individuals with all types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabilities. The Office of Vocational and Adult Education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates that at least 30 percent of the persons in AE programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a disability. Adults (aged 16 years or older) with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabilities are enrolled in AE programs throughout the States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and territories in local educational agencies, community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> colleges, community-based organizations, mental hospitals,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitation and correctional facilities, and other facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serving individuals with disabilities (U.S. Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Education, Adult Learning and Literacy Clearinghouse, Fact Sheet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9, February 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because they are educationally disadvantaged, some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals with disabilities in AE programs may need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodations. These accommodations may involve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification of policies, practices, or procedures, or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision of auxiliary aids and services (e.g., relaxed time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for tests, interpreters). Published efforts to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify accommodations for adults with disabilities in AE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs have focused on administering tests and diagnostic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessments (American Council on Education, ``GED Test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accommodations,'' Washington, D.C., 1990; American Council on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Education, ``External Diploma Program Assessment Accommodations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Modifications for Adults with Special Learning Needs,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washington, D.C., 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to testing and assessment accommodations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals with disabilities in AE programs may require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodations related to the presentation of instructional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials, alternative formats to print materials, notetakers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives to written assignments, practicums, scheduling, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a variety of other educational tasks and requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adult Education administrators and teachers need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understand not only their obligations under section 504 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rehabilitation Act, as amended, but also the resources that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to enable them to provide the accommodations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, students with disabilities in AE programs need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understand their rights, articulate their needs, and identify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodations that will assist them to meet the program's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Priority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An R&amp;D project on accommodations for individuals with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabilities in Adult Education programs shall_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Survey the nature and extent to which a representative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sample of AE programs are providing programmatic accommodations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to students with disabilities and determine the relationship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the provision of those accommodations and program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outcomes for those students (e.g., graduation rates, program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completion, career advancement, etc.);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identify and evaluate effective programmatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodations for individuals with disabilities in AE programs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and develop recommendations for the development of new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodations, including, but not limited to, accommodations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to testing, presentation of instructional materials,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative formats to print materials, notetakers, alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to written assignments, practicums, and scheduling;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

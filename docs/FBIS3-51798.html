It is estimated that there are  approximately 3 million kerosene stoves in [word indistinct]. In  1993 the consumption plan was for 464,000 tons of kerosene which  amounts to $90 million on the world market, where this fuel is  no longer sold.    Cuba cannot produce this fuel, so how do we solve this  dilemma? The Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces's center  for fuel development and research determined that a  kerosene-diesel mixture was an answer for domestic kitchens.  This became one of the outstanding projects of the Eighth Forum  of Science and Technology.    After several trials, researchers concluded that the most  feasible solution was (Jet A-1 turbo) fuel, a refined kerosene  used in aviation. The average cost of (Jet A-1) fuel is $205 per  ton, which exceeds that of standard kerosene. To overcome this  problem the refined kerosene is mixed with diesel fuel, which is  much cheaper. The researchers took steps so that the mixture  would not damage the stoves [words indistinct] and would have  acceptable thermal safety and efficiency. They decided on a  ratio of 30 percent diesel and 70 percent of kerosene, which  will allow an annual savings of $3 million, equivalent to 20,000  tons more fuel for domestic use -- the amount that the  population of Havana City consumes in three months.    The first tests of this research were carried out in 50  homes  with a 90-percent acceptance rate. According to Lieutenant  Colonel Eduardo Perez Pena, more tests are taking place in a  municipality of Havana City. The fuel should be available  throughout the country by May.</p>

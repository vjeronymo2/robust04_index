			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Federal Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe has justified as "absolutely necessary" the attacks  carried out by NATO combat aircraft on Serbian positions on  behalf of the United Nations. It was obvious that the Serbs  would only understand "this clear language," Ruehe said in an  interview with the daily DIE WELT (Tuesday [12 April] edition).  A "human catastrophe on an immense scale" was beginning to  emerge in Gorazde. Now everybody has to exert an influence on  the Serbs to stop their attacks. Russia could also continue to  play an important role in this process, the minister stressed in  the article, which was released in advance of publication by the  Federal Defense Ministry.    Hitherto the United Nations has had neither the legal nor  the  practical opportunities to actively disarm the Serb besiegers.  It is therefore all the more important now to exploit all the  opportunities in Bosnia, "where the United Nations could fall  back on NATO's resources." This means military air operations  in particular, Ruehe said. Neither the civilian population nor  UN troops must come to harm during this. Ruehe once again  stressed that the deployment of German soldiers in the former  Yugoslavia will "not be considered" for historical reasons.</p>

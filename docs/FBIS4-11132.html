			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Orlando Mendieta C.] </F>   [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate for  the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), has fallen 3.5 percent  in voter preference for election as president of Panama, while  Ruben Blades of the Papa Egoro Movement [MPE] moved up to second  place, increasing his popularity among voters by 3.1 percent,  according to a poll conducted by the Center for Latin American  Studies (CELA).    Marco Gandasegui, director of the CELA survey, reported that  the fifth CELA poll was conducted in early April among 2,600  people, excluding the Provinces of Darien, Bocas del Toro, and  the San Blas Intendancy.    According to Gandasegui, in light of the call to unite civic  forces against the PRD, a virtual union between Carles, Mireya  Moscoso de Gruber, and Eduardo Vallarino could garner a high  enough percentage of votes to challenge the candidacy of Perez  Balladares.    The poll revealed that Perez Balladares continues to lead  voters' preferences with 29.7 percent. However, he descended in  popularity in comparison with the previous CELA poll, in which  he obtained 33.2 percent support.    Meanwhile, Blades, who in the previous poll got 13.4  percent,  which placed him third in voter preference, won 16.5 percent of  popular support in this poll, boosting him into second place.    Although he registered a 0.4-percent increase in popular  support over the previous poll, Ruben Dario Carles of MOLIRENA  [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] has fallen back to  third place on the chart with 14.8 percent support.    Meanwhile, Mireya Moscoso de Gruber of the Arnulfist Party  came in fourth in voter preference with 14.3 percent, reflecting  a 6.3-percent hike over the previous poll in which she won 8.5  percent support.    The CELA poll revealed the following order for other  candidates: Eduardo Vallarino of the Christian Democratic Party  (PDC) with 2.6 percent, Samuel Lewis Galindo of Solidarity with  1.3 percent, and Jose Salvador Munoz of the Doctrinaire  Panamenist Party with 0.3 percent.    Gandasegui said that this was the last CELA poll before the  8  May elections. He announced that the organization plans to  conduct another survey once the elections are over.    He added that this poll was conducted before President  Endara  aired the videos showing compromising footage against the PRD,  as well as before the latest ILDEA-sponsored [Latin American  Institute of Advanced Studies] presidential debate. Gandasegui  noted that it is possible that these events have changed the  level of preference for specific candidates.</p>

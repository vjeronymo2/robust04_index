			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper supported after heavy fall Present conditions in the copper market were summed up by one analyst yesterday who said: 'The only certainty is that it will be volatile'. He was speaking at the end of a day when copper's price dropped by Dollars 60 a tonne in early trading on the London Metal Exchange to its lowest level for six weeks. But during the afternoon it regained virtually all the lost ground. Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, said the sell-off came as no surprise because stocks were rising both in LME warehouses and on the New York Commodity Exchange. However, the selling yesterday was not heavy and the price refused to go below strong technical support at Dollars 2,360 a tonne. 'Copper's fundamentals are not negative but they are neutral now,' he added. 'US economic growth is slowing, tightness in the US copper market is easing and in Europe many fabricators are on holiday this quarter. There probably will be a small supply surplus this quarter compared with the big deficit in the first half. That is showing up in stock levels.' Selling was triggered yesterday by a reported rise of 2,046 short tons in Comex stocks. Then the LME reported its stocks had gone up - only by 250 tonnes but this was the first increase since March.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium                     -3,675            to      2,520,275 Aluminium alloy                  -20            to         26,860 Copper                          +250            to        338,900 Lead                            -500            to        356,425 Nickel                          +408            to        133,752 Zinc                            -175            to      1,213,900 Tin                               +5            to         30,695  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

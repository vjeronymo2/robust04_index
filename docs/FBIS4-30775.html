			<p>BFN     [Text] Integration into West European and trans-Atlantic  structures, and the creation of conditions for full membership  of Slovakia in NATO are the fundamental goals of our foreign  policy, as formulated in the presentation document submitted by  the Slovak delegation at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on 25  May. As Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis said in today's  edition of the television discussion program "Kroky," we have  thus become one of 16 countries to have signed the Partnership  for Peace initiative.    In connection with bringing Slovakia into the security  structures of Western Europe, Pavol Kanis stressed the  inevitability of a reorganization of our Armed Forces.    Josef Prokes, the honorary chairman of the Slovak National  Party, who is foreign minister in Meciar's shadow cabinet,  pointed out that the European stability pact in itself was not  dangerous but could be abused. Western Europe, according to  him, has not solved the problem of minorities and yet expected  East European countries to do so.    Foreign Minister Edvard Kukan observed that minority  problems  could be solved on an international level by means of the CSCE  and on the Council of Europe level.</p>

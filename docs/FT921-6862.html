			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Brazil suffers setback in Paris Club debt talks BRAZIL's initial proposal for the rescheduling of its Dollars 21bn-Dollars 22bn debt with the Paris Club group of creditor governments has been rejected in the first day of negotiations in Paris. However, Brazilian economy ministry officials yesterday remained confident agreement would be reached this week. The Brazilian negotiating team, led by Mr Francisco Gros, the central bank governor, was working on a new proposal yesterday after German and Japanese representatives had refused to accept Brazil's original offer. The main sticking point is Brazil's insistence on including in the rescheduling, debt that was rescheduled in the last accord in 1988. Mr Gros said on Friday that this accord had created an excessive concentration of repayments over the next two years. Brazil's original proposal asked for the rescheduling of Dollars 13.5bn over 18 years. This includes Dollars 8.6bn in arrears and Dollars 4.9bn in payments due over the next two years as a result of the 1988 accord. Only in exceptional circumstances does the Paris Club agree to reschedule already rescheduled debt and Brazil's non-payment of interest for the last three years has not endeared it to official creditors. They complain that they have been receiving worse treatment than the commercial banks to which Brazil started paying 30 per cent of due interest last year. According to Brazilian economy ministry officials, the Germans and Japanese are insisting that Brazil respect the 1988 accord. The Brazilian team pointed out that it has not asked for a reduction of the principal and maintains that it does not have the capacity to pay under the previous terms. However, creditors believe that Brazilian reserves are now at their highest levels since the start of the debt crisis. Despite these differences the negotiations are said to be taking place in a favourable climate and Brazil has received unexpected support from the presence of Mr Enrique Iglesias, head of the Inter-American Development Bank, who has flown to Paris specially to make a personal presentation backing the government's new stabilisation programme.</p>

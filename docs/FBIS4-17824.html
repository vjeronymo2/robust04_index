			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 26 Apr -- A Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Ministry  delegation, led by Ambassador at Large Andriy Ozadovskyy, is  back from a tour of the Balkan Peninsula's countries. At its  meetings with Bosnian Serb and Muslim leaders in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, issues of the possibility of halting combat  operations in that region were discussed, and steps to put into  practice the UN Security Council's resolution on a political  settlement to the Yugoslav crisis, as well as questions of  guaranteeing the safety of the peacekeeping forces' contingents  that were taking part in UN operations to secure peace, were  examined.    Ukraine is concerned about the UN decision to deploy the  Ukrainian peacekeeping forces battalion in the area of the town  of Gorazde where lately there has been intensive fighting. It  was emphasized at the meeting between Mr. Ozadovskyy and the  command of the UN forces in Yugoslavia that decisions on the  Ukrainian contingent further participating in UN peacekeeping  operations should be made with the safety of our military  personnel taken into consideration. That is why it is only  after combat operations in the Gorazde area are halted that the  Ukrainian peacekeepers can be deployed there.</p>

The Commission concludes on its own motion that it would be in the public interest to subject all incumbent facilities, including public safety, to mandatory relocation if an emerging technology provider requires the spectrum. Of particular concern is providing adequate spectrum for operation of new licensed PCS services in major urban areas where there are a large number of incumbent public safety fixed microwave facilities and operation of unlicensed PCS devices. It has been recognized by incumbent fixed microwave and PCS interests alike that it will not be possible for PCS and fixed microwave to operate in the same geographic area on the same frequency without interfering with each other. Upon review, and after considering these additional comments, the Commission is now convinced that PCS service may be precluded or severely limited in some areas unless public safety licensees relocate. Allowing all public safety facilities to remain in the band indefinitely would defeat the Commission's primary goal of providing usable spectrum for the implementation of emerging technologies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. The Commission believes that certain public safety entities warrant special consideration because previously they have been excluded from involuntary relocation and because of the sensitive nature of their communications. Therefore, it is adopting for the public safety entities previously exempted from mandatory relocation a relocation plan consisting of a four year voluntary negotiation period followed by a one-year mandatory negotiation period. This policy, summarized below, will not disadvantage incumbent public safety operations required to relocate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _All relocation costs will be paid entirely by the emerging technology licensee. These costs included all engineering, equipment, and site costs and FCC fees, as well as any reasonable additional costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Relocation facilities must be fully comparable to those being replaced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _All activities necessary for placing the new facilities into operation including engineering and frequency coordination must be completed before relocation, including engineering and frequency coordination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The new communications system must be fully built and tested before the relocation itself commences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Should the new facilities in practice prove not to be equivalent in every respect, within one year the public safety operation may relocate back to its original facilities and stay there until complete equivalency (or better) is attained. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 15. In the Third R&amp;O, the Commission clarified the definition of public safety licensees operating 2 GHz facilities that would receive special treatment in the relocation process. The facilities within this exception were defined as those part 94 facilities licensed on a primary basis under &sect;90.19 Police Radio Service; &sect;90.21 Fire Radio Service; &sect;90.27 Emergency Medical Radio Service; and subpart C of part 90, Special Emergency Radio Services; and on which a majority of communications are used for police, fire, or emergency medical services operations involving safety of life and property. Additionally, licensees of other part 94 facilities licensed on a primary basis under the eligibility requirements of part 90, subparts B and C, may request similar special treatment upon demonstrating that the majority of the communications carried on those facilities are used for operations involving safety of life and property. The Commission's purpose in providing special treatment in the relocation process to some licensees was to ensure that essential safety of life and property communications services are not disrupted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. The Commission continues to believe that special treatment in the relocation process should be reserved for only those facilities as defined above. Special treatment in the relocation process for facilities that provide only limited communications for safety of life and property would negatively impact implementation of services employing new technologies. Accordingly, the Commission will maintain its definition of public safety facilities subject to the extended relocation period addressed above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. In the Third R&amp;O, the Commission authorized the grant of tax certificates for any sale or exchange of property made in connection with voluntary agreements to relocate fixed microwave facilities during the designated two-year period for voluntary negotiations between incumbents and emerging technology providers. This policy was authorized to further the Commission's policy of encouraging voluntary agreements to relocate fixed microwave facilities during the initial two-year period. However, the Commission agrees with commenters that tax certificates should be used to facilitate incumbent relocation from the band designated for unlicensed PCS devices and in geographic areas that are not developed by emerging technologies within the two-year voluntary negotiation period. Accordingly, the Commission is modifying its policy to authorize the grant of tax certificates to incumbent fixed microwave operators that negotiate voluntary agreements during either the voluntary or mandatory negotiation period. The Commission will not grant tax certificates to incumbents forced to relocate or that reach agreements after the mandatory negotiation period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. In the Third R&amp;O, the Commission adopted a policy of generally not permitting incumbent microwave operations to relocate within the 2 GHz band. While such relocation could be accomplished in many cases by making modifications to the incumbents' existing equipment, such as retuning it to another nearby frequency, the Commission concluded that allowing relocation within the band for other fixed microwave facilities would not be in the public interest because in most cases the incumbent licensee eventually would be required to move to another band. Any such intervening relocation would increase the overall cost of relocating the incumbent fixed microwave facilities; increase the cost to licensed emerging technology providers by increasing the number of fixed microwave facilities that they may have to pay to relocate; and burden incumbents with two relocations instead of one. However, recognizing the need of public safety licensees not to disrupt essential safety of life and property communication services, the Commission authorized relocation within the 2 GHz band for incumbent public safety facilities upon an adequate showing that such a relocation would not adversely affect the operations of the public safety incumbent, or any other fixed microwave incumbent or emerging technology/PCS licensee. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

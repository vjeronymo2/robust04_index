			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Venture offshoot helps BWD to Pounds 1.81m BWD SECURITIES, the USM-quoted stockbroking and financial services group, reported a 48 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.81m for the six months to May 31. The outcome also represented an increase of nearly 4 per cent on profits of Pounds 1.74m recorded in the last full year. Turnover rose 34 per cent to Pounds 7.43m (Pounds 5.53m), partly reflecting steady increases in new clients nationwide for BWD Rensburg, its stockbroking arm, and expansion of Northern Registrars, the wholly owned share registry subsidiary. Profits were helped by 'significant uplift' at Capital for Companies, the Leeds-based venture offshoot, which raised Pounds 39m for assured tenancy schemes under the Business Expansion Scheme. Although the government is shutting down the BES in December, the schemes will yield annual fee income for five years. The interim dividend is 1.5p (1.3p), payable from earnings per share of 6.6p (4.5p). The group is placing 841,885 new shares at 95 1/2 p each via James Capel, its broker, to fund the purchase of a 10,000 sq ft modern office block near its headquarters for Northern Registrars. The subsidiary now acts as registrar for about 70 companies and continuing expansion has seen it outgrow its existing offices. The new shares will rank pari passu with the 18.03m existing shares but will not qualify for the interim dividend.</p>

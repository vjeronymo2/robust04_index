The defense ministry said the blast and fire which was  rapidly brought under control was caused by a short-circuit in a  high-tension cable.    Investigators earlier suspected a malfunction in an  underground generator.    All those injured had breathing problems and were taken to a  navy hospital for treatment but only one navy employee was still  in hospital late Tuesday, said Admiral Khristos Limeris, chief  of staff of the Greek armed forces.    The Ayia Paraskevi base is the general NATO headquarters for  the eastern Mediterranean.</p>

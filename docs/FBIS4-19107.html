			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has declared that  following the NATO intervention against Serb positions  yesterday, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is relatively  calm. He said that efforts are under way to secure a cease-fire  between the sides.    Addressing the Turkish Grand National Assembly session  chaired by Mustafa Kalemli, Cetin commented on the Serb attacks  against Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Explaining that he  conducted a telephone conversation with the prime minister of  Bosnia-Herzegovina this afternoon, Cetin said that it was once  again confirmed that chemical weapons were not used in Gorazde.    [Begin Cetin recording] Following the two NATO operations  last night, the situation is calm in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The  Bosnian prime minister [Alija Izetbegovic] said that there are  no incidents at the moment. There is no question of mass deaths.  He is the prime minister of the country; I must believe him,  and so must we all. No mass killing or chemical weapons were  used.    Now, various countries are engaged in efforts to secure a  cease-fire. He cited his conditions for a cease-fire in Gorazde  because we are also conducting contacts on this matter. For a  cease-fire, the Serbs must withdraw to their positions of 29  March. In other words, the Serbian units and militias must  withdraw to the positions they were occupying on 29 March. He  asked us to continue our contacts on this matter. He expressed  the Bosnians' readiness for peace but the Serbs must definitely  withdraw to their positions of 29 March. [end recording]    The foreign minister stated that the initiatives on this  issue will continue. Pointing out that the events in  Bosnia-Herzegovina will be recorded as a black mark in history,  Cetin remarked, however, that it is not right to use this as a  tool for internal politics. A response must be given to each  Serbian move, Cetin stressed, adding that the Serbs understand  only force.    Cetin said that certain private television stations in  Turkey  reported the use of chemical weapons and mass massacres in the  region when the Serbian attacks against Gorazde began on  Saturday [9 April]. He added that his contacts proved this to be  untrue. Such a broadcasting concept does not exist in any part  of the world, Cetin underlined. Cetin stressed that the  demonstrations initiated following the Gorazde incidents could  undermine Turkey's democracy and its image abroad and especially  political parties should categorically avoid this.    After Cetin's speech. political party groups expressed their  views on the subject. Motherland Party Bitlis Deputy Kamran  Inan said that the Serbs are acting with the aim of annihilating  the Turkish culture in the Balkans. Inan remarked that the  operations conducted by NATO air forces in the past two days are  mere acts of show.    [Begin Inan recording] The aim here is the creation of a  great Serbia, which is the policy of Britain. Lord Owen is  being used to this end. They wish to curb German influence in  the north and Turkish influence in the southern Balkans by  establishing the greater Serbia-Greece front. It is necessary  to understand what is going on. Greece is currently engaged in  preparations to block Turkey's way and possibly create a war in  the Balkans. Therefore, the situation should not be viewed in  its narrow framework. It is good to conduct contacts, but the  important thing is to achieve results. [end recording]  [passage omitted]</p>

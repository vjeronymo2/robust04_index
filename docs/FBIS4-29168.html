			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by a "Japan-U.S. relations reporting team"; second </F> in a series entitled "Japan and the United States -- The Picture  Shakes": "Ally Is Ignorant of the Security Pact?"]    [Text] On the seventh floor of the U.S. State Department  building, there is a section behind a heavy door with frosted  glass. Behind this door are the offices of the secretary and  deputy secretary, and a conference room. Each morning, Deputy  Secretary Strobe Talbott assembles the department's 20 assistant  secretaries in a room decorated entirely in the English style  for a staff meeting.  <H5>  "Pearl Harbor Syndrome" </H5>   The central topic at the 2 June staff meeting was how to  deal  with the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected development of nuclear  arms. On the previous day, Hans Blix, International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) secretary general, had just reported to the  UN Security Council that it had become impossible to verify  whether North Korea engaged in nuclear development in the past.  Both Robert Gallucci, assistant secretary for  political-military affairs who is in charge of the issue, and  Winston Lord, assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific  affairs, were present at the meeting.    The State Department had so far regarded the North Korean  nuclear issue as one link in the global issue of "nuclear  nonproliferation." The fact that Lord gave a long briefing  during the day's meeting shows that the State Department has  begun to perceive the problem as a security issue for East Asia.  On the day after the meeting, Shunji Yanai, director general of  Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Foreign Policy Bureau, and  Kim Sam-hun, ROK envoy in charge of the nuclear issue, came to  the State Department.    As the focus of the issue is turning to East Asia, a certain  anxiety is spreading in the United States. William Watts,  president of Potomac Associates, which specializes in public  opinion polls, calls this the "Pearl Harbor syndrome," meaning,  distrust of Japan. Watts says, "If Japan does not cooperate in  economic sanctions in the North Korean issue, or it restricts  the use of U.S. military bases in Japan, the U.S. Congress will  explode." That is, right now, after North Korea has announced  its withdrawal from the IAEA, the relationship of trust between  Japan and the United States may collapse from its very  foundation depending on how the problem is handled.  <H5>  "No" is Not Acceptable </H5>   THE WASHINGTON POST's editorial on 5 June pointed out that  in  case of a North Korean crisis, it would be more difficult to  build an alliance in the Pacific, compared to forming an  alliance against Iraq during the Gulf war. It said, the reasons  are: North Korea has close relations with Japan, and pacifist  tendencies in Japan make Japan take a passive attitude toward  security issues.    It seems that the U.S. message to Japan on this issue,  expressed in various forms, is: "Do not take an indifferent  attitude; deal with it seriously."    How does Japan react to this? During the intergovernmental  discussions on the Theatre Missile Defense (TMD) program in  Tokyo last year, which lasted for nine hours, the Japanese team  spoke only for a total of seven minutes.    Of course, within the Japanese Government, many people have  come to realize the seriousness of the situation. For example,  after U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's visit last April,  various government offices, including the Cabinet Security  Affairs Office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Defense  Agency, have compiled their own reports. These documents  discuss possible actions North Korea may take, the responses of  Japan and the United States, and amendments that will be needed  to Japanese laws.    According to U.S. Government officials, when Perry came to  Japan, the United States asked for "Japan's cooperation within  the limits of the Constitution." What this means in more  precise terms is: The United States will not ask Japan to send  its Self-Defense Forces to the Korean peninsula, but with regard  to the use of U.S. military bases in Japan, when prior  consultations are held with Japan in accordance to the "Exchange  of Notes" on Article VI of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, Japan  should not say "no." Japanese Government reports have generally  agreed to this line of argument.  No Consensus Among Government Ministries and Agencies    However, U.S. concerns are not limited to advance  preparations for the crisis. Recently, the following incident  occurred:    Concerning the issue of remittances from Japan to North  Korea, the Ministry of Finance sent a senior official to the  U.S. Department of the Treasury to inform it that, "Under  current laws, it would be difficult to completely halt  remittances." This incident became a basis for major U.S.  newspapers to report that "Japan is not positive about sanctions  against North Korea." Disconcerted by such reports, the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs quickly defended Japan by saying "we can halt  the remittances," and it pleaded with the State Department that  "to avoid aggravating American distrust of Japan, the U.S.  Government should issue a statement announcing 'Japan says it  can do it [stop the remittances]'."    The major U.S. papers have now modified their previous  reports, stating that Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said at the  Japan-ROK foreign ministerial meeting that "taking gradual steps  is important; Japan intends to take responsible action within  the limits of the Constitution." The United States is certainly  unsettled at Japan's lack of international sense as evidenced by  the fact that powerful Japanese ministries have given  contradictory information to the side on an issue closely  affecting Japan.    A number of senior officials of the previous U.S.  administration criticize the Clinton administration, saying, "If  it were the Bush administration, we would have obtained China's  cooperation, and solved the problem earlier." Such a criticism  applies to Japan, if you paraphrase a little: "If the Japanese  Government's strategy were more viable, we would have..."</p>

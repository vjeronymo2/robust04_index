			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / UK Company News: QMH has big proxy vote in its favour Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group, is understood to have substantial proxy votes in favour of resolutions to be put at two extraordinary meetings tomorrow. If the resolutions, which confirm the group's Pounds 2bn borrowing limit, are not passed the company will not be able to continue trading. Shareholders are unlikely to receive any new information about progress of financial restructuring, disposals or current trading. The group should soon receive the latest property valuation, which will be incorporated in the 1993 accounts. However, some holders may use the the meeting to raise other questions. Mr John Bairstow, former chairman, said last week that the resolution being put should be divided into two. The first approving the borrowing limit and the second releasing present directors from any liability caused by the error which called the borrowing limit into question. Mr Bairstow said if the resolution was in two parts then shareholders could vote on each issue separately. QMH dismissed his suggestion yesterday, saying that the two parts of the resolution were 'inextricably linked'. The second meeting is for holders of the 7 per cent convertible preference shares who were mistakenly excluded from voting on borrowing powers at annual meetings. Shareholders may also ask who was responsible for the oversight which necessitated the meetings. The problem dates back to 1989 when the preference shareholders were first omitted from voting on a change of borrowing powers.</p>

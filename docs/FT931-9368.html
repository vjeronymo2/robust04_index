			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Government insists on EC treaty with opt-out: Clarke warns on Maastricht THE government will this week send a clear signal to its anti-Maastricht rebels that it will not allow a defeat over Labour's controversial social chapter amendment to undermine its determination to ratify the treaty. In an uncompromising message to the Conservative Euro-sceptics, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, insisted yesterday that the Cabinet would pursue 'whatever course is necessary' to achieve ratification without the UK having to drop its opt-out from the chapter. Speaking in a BBC television interview, Mr Clarke was clearly intent on correcting the impression given by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, last week that the government would abandon the treaty if Labour's Amendment 27 was passed. 'We are aiming at getting the treaty without the social chapter and we propose to proceed in parliament on that basis,' he said. While reiterating its confidence that the amendment would be defeated, Downing Street tacitly backed up Mr Clarke by underlining that there were widely varying interpretations of the amendment's legal impact on ratification. Foreign Office lawyers have been in close contact with Brussels as to how its passage would be interpreted. However, a senior minister close to the discussions was adamant last night that the government had no plans to ride roughshod over the Commons by ignoring the amendment if it is passed. 'There is no question of us thwarting the will of parliament,' he said. Technically, the British government could override parliamentary opinion and ratify Maastricht because legally treaties only require the approval of the Crown, not that of parliament. However, such a course of action would provoke outrage among MPs and could undermine the government's authority. Downing Street was yesterday determined to quash newspaper reports that Mr John Major, the prime minister, would press ahead with ratification whatever parliament concluded. Instead, a senior official steered inquiries to Mr Hurd's exact phrasing in his BBC interview last week. At the time, the foreign secretary said: 'There is no question of our ratifying a treaty other than the one we negotiated.' While this was widely interpreted as a threat to drop the ratification process in the event of a defeat, it is now understood that no such strategy exists. The government is now devising a series of fall-back positions should its 21-vote overall majority in the Commons be overturned by an alliance of Labour, Liberal Democrats and Tory rebels. Speculation is mounting that this could involve holding a separate debate on the social chapter -  which is fiercely opposed by all Conservative MPs - on a motion reaffirming the government's opt-out. If, as expected, such a motion is passed, the government will claim that it has won the authority of the Commons to override the Labour social chapter amendment at the report stage or in the Lords without thwarting the will of parliament. Mr George Robertson, Labour's European spokesman, agreed last night that this was the kind of strategy which may now be under way, although he added that such a device would amount to 'sharp practice'.</p>

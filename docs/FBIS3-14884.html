			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bohdan Kushnir, MOLOD UKRAYINY special </F> correspondent: "A Sad Finale"]    [Text] The trial of Anatoliy Lysenko, Ukraine's Security  Service major from Mostyska, is about to be concluded. It is  expected that on Monday, the chairman of the Warsaw Military  District Court, Colonel Kasparczak, will announce the sentence.    The finale will be sad, but not for Anatoliy Lysenko,  because  even the procurator demanded a minimal punishment -- five years  imprisonment, whereas the Criminal Code article on espionage  envisages between eight and 15 years imprisonment or capital  punishment. Yet another small nuance. Perhaps, in anticipation  that the judges may arrive at a "not guilty" verdict, the  procurator asked that the episodes involving smuggler Janusz  Bojarski be considered by the civilian court. This means that  the spying case has burst like a soap-bubble. The Polish  witnesses, driver Salata and military doctor Madej, confirmed  that on that day, Lysenko was, indeed, taking his sick son for a  medical consultation. During the court proceedings, there was  an embarrassment: Mr. Salata felt unwell and was taken away by  an ambulance.    Defense counsel Czeslaw Jaworski delivered a long speech. He  spoke about Ukraine's cooperation in this case and stressed that  Anatoliy Lysenko's acquittal would promote the establishment of  good relations between Poland and Ukraine.    Anatoliy Lysenko's health is steadily deteriorating, and the  few days that remain until Monday may be tragic for him. Even  the court chairman emphasized that.    Let us wait and see what happens on Monday....</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Plans to aid low-cost housing PLANNING arrangements are to be made more flexible to encourage builders to provide a greater number of low-cost homes. But planning minister Sir George Young, announcing the changes, said he had rejected the idea that local authorities should have the power to insist on a fixed quota of cheaper homes when they grant planning permission. This has disappointed conservationists, who would like to see councils given mandatory powers to make developers provide a proportion of cheaper houses and flats in new developments. 'It is a missed opportunity,' said Mr Tony Burton, planning officer for the Council for the Protection of Rural England. 'It has not given the local authorities the powers they need to be effective.' The scheme mainly applies to rural areas where the influx of well-paid house purchasers from urban areas has sent prices up beyond the reach of local people. Sir George is asking local authorities to negotiate with developers to include a proportion of low-cost housing.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Eu" report: "No All-Clear Possible Yet"] </F>   [Text] Potsdam -- At the moment one cannot yet give the  all-clear in the field of right-wing extremism. Despite the  fact that the wave of violence in Brandenburg, which reached its  climax at the end of 1992, has abated, right-wing extremism  remains a central challenge to state and society. This was  stressed by Interior Minister Alwin Ziel (Social Democratic  Party of Germany) on the occasion of presenting the 1993  Constitutional Protection Report. The paper provides detailed  information about the activities and scope of political  extremism as well as on the role and structure of the  Constitutional Protection Office in Brandenburg, which is still  in the process of being established. It is the first report of  this kind that has been presented so far. Combating right-wing  extremism will characterize the work of the coming years,  Wolfgang Pfaff, head of the Brandenburg Office for the  Protection of the Constitution, said. One needs long-term  measures, which must also nip the problem in the bud by means of  an appropriate youth and social policy. With this the impetus  of the moment could be reduced. Above all the so-called Central  German Youth Promotion Project (FMJ) continues to be the target  of all efforts. The number of members is given as 100, with an  upward trend. The organization openly picks up the usual topics  of Nazi propaganda, the Constitutional Protection Report says.  They are committed to Hitler's person and "work." Anti-Semitic  instigation and the denial of the holocaust are evidence of the  cynical racism that is cultivated in the FMJ.    Constitutional Protection also watches increasingly the  development of left-wing extremism. Since Berlin is so close,  it is also encroaching on Brandenburg, which is proved by the  militant squatters' scene in Potsdam, Pfaff said. Therefore,  the personnel dealing with leftist violence in his office will  now be increased, he said. At the moment, there are hardly any  activities by the Red Army Faction (RAF). The RAF has other  priorities, but that might change very quickly.    Pfaff said that there are about 500 rightist Republikaner in  Brandenburg. In the past their activities were rather limited  because of controversies among the leaders. However, there are  signs that the Republikaner will gain in importance in the 1994  election year. According to Pfaff, "in the surroundings" of  right-wing extremist organizations there are also members that  are moving toward the Republikaner. Nevertheless, the  Republikaner cannot necessarily be considered a collection pond  of the rightist scene, because they are taking great care not to  accept "real neo-Nazis" into their ranks.</p>

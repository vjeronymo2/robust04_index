			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Men in the News: Opposite sides of the track - Robert Horton and Jimmy Knapp This week's UK rail dispute has witnessed the sight of two formidable prizefighters squaring up to one another. Robert Horton, chairman of Railtrack, gained a reputation as a corporate hatchetman during his 35-year climb to the top of British Petroleum. Jimmy Knapp, the gravel-voiced general secretary of the RMT transport union, has acquired a name as a canny and experienced negotiator in the arcane world of railway industrial relations over more than three decades. They have been pitted against each other in the sort of industrial dispute which many thought had died with the 1970s. The battle between the rail union and Railtrack, the company which took over responsibility for British Rail's track, stations and signals in April, led to a one-day shutdown of most of the rail network on Wednesday and the threat of further action next week. The outcome of the first round appears to have been victory for Knapp, leaving Horton and his negotiating team looking out of their depth. Faced with an outrageous demand from the union for a no-strings-attached pay rise of 11 per cent, Railtrack's negotiating team fumbled its hand. Knapp got hold of internal company memos, indicating an early willingness to make an offer of 5.7 per cent to the union. This had prompted the government to intervene to avert any risk of a settlement which would break its guidelines for a public sector pay bill freeze. By allowing the dispute to flare up at this early stage of the privatisation of the BR network, Railtrack has damaged its own credibility and harmed its own prospects for a speedy and profitable flotation. This has awakened fears in the rest of the rail industry about Railtrack's ability to manage its affairs. The question being asked is whether Horton, 54, who took up his Pounds 120,000-a-year job after being ousted as chairman and chief executive of BP in 1992, has made a successful transition from the world of big oil to the rail industry. In his first 12 months at Railtrack he has tackled a mass of administrative detail - on property ownership, access agreements with train operators, and so on. It will be another year at least before Railtrack can show whether it is reducing costs and improving the efficiency of the railway. But its ability to deal with the rail unions will set an important signal. Horton acquired his tough image at BP by abolishing head office committees and cutting layers of management. But a sharp decline in profits during the recession and a reputation for arrogance prompted his fellow directors to press for his resignation. There is a feeling in the rail industry that he carried over this haughtiness into Railtrack, which has a monopoly of the railway infrastructure and which is, by and large, dealing with far smaller companies. 'There is a perception of Railtrack as an organisation with an arrogant self-confidence,' commented one rail industry source. To blame Railtrack for being remote from the concerns of railwaymen would be a mistake, however. Many of its senior managers, including chief executive John Edmonds and the industrial relations team, are long-term railwaymen. There is speculation in the industry that Horton's management style may have clashed with that of the old-timers. Certainly, morale at Railtrack will not have been enhanced by Horton's description of Colin Hall, author of the memo made public by the union, as 'an over-zealous, very junior manager'. In fact, Hall, production manager of Railtrack's south zone, is fairly senior. 'I don't think British Rail would have fingered a member of staff in that way,' said an industry source. Horton, however, is keen to challenge his aggressive reputation, and be seen as the railway's saviour, not executioner. 'I have a sense of responsibility as the custodian of a great national asset,' he said recently. 'We have got to jolly well use it. I would be disappointed if we are not carrying more passengers over more miles in three years.' Jimmy Knapp's public image is similarly deceptive. He resembles the last of the trade union dinosaurs (though only 53), a throwback to the old labour agenda of industrial strife. He once likened himself to 'the picture of Dorian Gray in reverse'. But contrary to his appearance and thick, gravelly Ayrshire accent, Knapp is not an old-style autocratic union leader. Far from being a willing tool of the left wing which dominates his union's policymaking, he is essentially a traditional socialist, with a strong will of his own. He and his union activists have fought hard and long, but without much success, against the privatising of the railways and for more investment in the network. He has lost numerous battles when his members have refused to heed the union's strike calls - over, for instance, engineering workshop closures. Knapp's years in office have seen the union fighting an often bitter rearguard action against change on the railways, particularly in defence of entrenched and obsolete working practices, such as insisting that even new trains - operated only by drivers - should have guards on board. Some critics believe Knapp and his executive are intent on sabotaging privatisation by frightening off possible franchise holders with a display of old-style industrial aggression. But Knapp is simply trying to preserve the centralised industrial relations system of the pre-privatisation British Rail while working with a management more sensitive to commercial pressures. In the long run, such a strategy looks doomed to defeat, because the railway needs to be modernised. For the moment Knapp appears to have thrown Railtrack on to the defensive. Horton and his team have made a poor start - but it would be foolish to underestimate their ability to recover. This weekend, as the two sides meet at Acas, the conciliation service, they will to be trying to bridge what they agree is the 'enormous gulf' between them - before the next strike, due on Wednesday.</p>

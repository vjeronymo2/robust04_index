			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 26 Apr (EFE) -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister  Miguel Angel Burelli has announced the creation of the  Association of Caribbean States, which he defined as an  important step within the process of regional integration.  Burelli, who made the announcement on Monday when he dedicated  the Department of Latin America and the Caribbean at the Central  University of Venezuela (UCV), explained that the association  will include all of the Caribbean states and will begin work on  4 July.    As of 1969 and following the process of independence of the  countries forming part of Caribbean Common Market, Venezuela  designed an "unchanging policy of lending a hand" to these  nations with the sole purpose of serving its neighbors, the  foreign minister emphasized. Venezuela is the only country that  has 12 embassies and 10 cultural centers in the Caribbean. It  also signed the San Jose Pact with Mexico, which supplies  petroleum to those nations under special payment conditions. In  addition, the government in Caracas has signed a Caribbean  Development Bank exchange program that allows the granting of  recoverable lines of credit to the Caribbean countries.    The Venezuelan foreign minister expressed his support for a  massive Venezuelan projection into the Caribbean that, with the  exception of Trinidad-Tobago and Guyana, is made up of small  nations without large resources and with a small population.</p>

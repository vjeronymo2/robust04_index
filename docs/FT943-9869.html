			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / RMT digs in on pay supplement The RMT transport union may soon return to the negotiating table through Acas, the conciliation service, in a further attempt to settle the nine-week signalling workers' dispute. However, the union will first require a clear understanding that Railtrack, the state-owned company that runs the network, is willing immediately to consolidate into basic rates a large part of a 6 per cent supplement it has already offered. Acas officials said yesterday they were 'actively in touch with both sides'. Mr Mike Patterson, secretary of the Central Rail Users Consultative Committee, said that neither side had taken advantage of the 'window of opportunity' offered by the vote to reject industrial action by RMT signalling supervisors last Thursday. He added: 'It is extremely frustrating that that opportunity has not been taken.' Confusion continued to surround the dispute yesterday, when little outward progress was made towards a resumption of negotiations. The RMT and Railtrack have both said that they want to re-enter talks, but these have failed to materialise. With the prospect of 72 hours of severe disruption starting on Friday with further strikes on Monday and Tuesday, there is little time to reach a settlement before the weekend. The RMT said that the main obstacle remained Railtrack's apparent unwillingness to state unequivocally in writing that it was prepared to allow a consolidation of part of the proposed 6 per cent supplement. In recent days Railtrack has not been prepared to make its position clear on this point, which RMT negotiators say is crucial to removing the obstacles preventing a settlement. The RMT seems prepared to accept Railtrack chairman Mr Bob Horton's public offer to try to settle the whole restructuring package for signalling workers during five days through secret negotiations if a deal could be reached on an interim payment. Only a few days ago Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, rejected Mr Horton's suggestion outright. Railtrack welcomed the lastest apparent conciliatory move from the union. The RMT insists that at no time has Railtrack spelt out its willingness to consolidate up to half the 6 per cent supplement. During the five days of fruitless bilateral negotiations through Acas from July 21 to 25 Railtrack said it was willing to go 'half way' to meet the RMT if the union displayed similar flexibility. But this was never turned into an offer with specific figures. Mr Knapp said yesterday that he was pledged to make 'every genuine effort' to find a settlement. Letters, Page 14</p>

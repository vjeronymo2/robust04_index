			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Gas monopoly 'keeps tariffs up' THE early abolition of British Gas's monopoly in supplying the mainly residential market could lead to annual savings on gas bills of 8 per cent, or Pounds 26 per household, according to a report issued yesterday by 12 independent gas companies. The 12 reject the possibility that the removal of the monopoly could lead to a rise of British Gas tariffs for small users, a possibility mentioned in the recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into the future of British Gas. They also claim that British Gas's operating overheads are higher than those of other energy utilities, and that an 'efficient supplier' could operate with an annual standing charge of Pounds 32 per customer, compared with the Pounds 36.88 charged by British Gas. The report said concerns over safety and security of supply would be addressed by the strict conditions likely to be imposed by the public gas supplier licence, which the independents would have to obtain before they could sell gas to households. The Gas Consumers Council welcomed the report. Mr Ian Powe, council director, said 'If these 12 companies are prepared to sign up to a strict gas supply licence and still undercut prices then the sooner the monopoly is abolished the better.' The independent suppliers, including six joint ventures between regional electricity companies and Utilicorp UK, the British subsidiary of Utilicorp of the US, called on Mr Michael Heseltine, trade secretary, to abolish by 1996 the British Gas monopoly on customers using less than 2,500 therms a year. The MMC has recommended that the threshold be lowered to 1,500 therms by 1997, and abolished three to five years after the recommended divestment of British Gas's trading business from its pipeline operations by March 1997. 'It's frustrating to have to wait another four years if you are ready to provide a service,' Mr Roger Turner, managing director of United Gas, said yesterday. He called on the Department of Trade and Industry to 'lose no time in putting the assertions to the test.' British Gas's 30,000 manual workers at have won a 2.6 per cent pay rise, backdated to January, through arbitration, the independent Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service said yesterday. The rise, double the offer made by the company, takes the average basic rate to Pounds 270.75 a week.</p>

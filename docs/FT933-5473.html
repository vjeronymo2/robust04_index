			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Japan cautious on China slowdown - Robert Thomson on Japanese companies' views of Beijing's economic cold bath WHEN the Chinese government has thrown water on an overheated economy, Japanese companies have generally been drenched. Imports have suddenly stopped, loan repayments have slowed, and even technology transfers to large state projects, such as the giant Baoshan steel mill, near Shanghai, have been halted or delayed. The current attempt to calm the Chinese economy is part of a cycle of surge and slowdown during 15 years of reform, but Japanese companies expect fewer bruises this time around. They say Beijing is more sophisticated in handling economic policy and has less control over ambitious provincial governments, which are some of Japan's best customers. 'I think the Chinese government has understood that it made mistakes in the past. We are fortunate that (vice premier) Zhu Rongji is in charge of economic policy. His character is different from past leaders'. He understands how an economy works,' said Mr Kenji Hattori, planning manager at the the semi-governmental Japan-China Association for Economy and Trade. Mr Zhu took control of economic policy in early July, lifting interest rates and attempting to slow an economy expanding more rapidly than the frenetic 13 per cent of last year. The first sign for Japanese companies was an increase in Chinese customers unable to raise finance, and a slowing of orders after a 51.2 per cent increase in exports during the first half. Japanese banks are concerned that their enthusiasm for China could have prompted lending to projects viable during the good times but vulnerable to failure if Beijing turns off the flow of foreign exchange. The banks, burdened by bad loans from their own 'bubble' era during the late 1980s, were reluctant to lend to international companies and even to domestic clients, but remained keen to find new customers in China. 'There was a real sense earlier this year that China had entered a period of endless rapid growth. I think there may be some losses, some cancelled contracts,' an executive at a Japanese commercial bank said. With consumer spending and capital investment falling at home, Japanese manufacturers were delighted to find free-spending consumers and officials in China taking some of their excess production over the past two years. An official at the Japan Association of Corporate Executives suggested that the weak Japanese economy would be even weaker without demand from China, particularly for consumer electronics, steel and cars. Japan's steel industry is anxious about twists and turns in China's economic policies. In 1989, during another slowdown, Chinese buyers cancelled orders, and a decade earlier, plant contracts for the Baoshan steel mill in Shanghai were put on hold by a Chinese government short of hard currency. In the last year, demand was strong for steel used in construction, and Japanese manufacturers fear that Beijing's new controls on funds will slow the development projects and steel exports, which doubled in the first half of this year. However, orders within Japan fell 5.3 per cent during the same period. Nippon Steel, the country's largest steel maker, said a fall in sales was inevitable, but demand in the past two years had been 'unusually high'. In the longer term, the company said, exports to China should remain steady, although it was difficult to forecast demand for late this year and next year. Japanese car makers have had a similar experience, declining demand at home and an eightfold increase in passenger car exports to China in the first half. In June, exports to China were 94 per cent higher than a year earlier, but in July the year-on-year increase was a relatively modest 54 per cent. Exports to Europe during the same month were down 32 per cent. The car makers are most concerned about a suspension of imported car purchases by Chinese government agencies for the rest of this year. But they draw comfort from the apparent difficulty Beijing will have in policing this edict, particularly in southern China. NEC, the electronics company, said its sales would be generally unaffected because a large share of orders was for state-sponsored infrastructure projects likely to be given priority by Beijing. But attempts to control growth have yet to slow Japanese investment, which Mr Hattori expects will almost double from the Dollars 1.1bn in the year to last March. The confidence in longer-term growth, he said, and the belief that local production provided the best access to the China market, would encourage companies to expand investment. 'There will be a big delegation of Japanese automobile companies going to China later this year, companies like Toyota, Nissan and Honda,' Mr Hattori said. 'They can see foreign car makers have already invested, and they want to research investment possibilities.'</p>

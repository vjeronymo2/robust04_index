			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Pledge on NHS cash planned The government is expected to announce today that it is providing an additional Pounds 2m to pay for part-time consultant posts in the National Health Service. Baroness Cumberlege, junior health minister, will tell a Royal College of Physicians conference that she believes doctors want a more flexible career pattern, and that bringing up children and developing other talents are also part of a doctor's life. The Royal College of Physicians says in a report published yesterday that the needs of doctors who want part-time specialist posts are not being met and that if the system does not change the NHS will be deprived of skilled staff.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / French recovery hits bumpy patch The uneven nature of France's economic recovery was yesterday underlined by industrial production figures, released by Insee, the official statistics agency. In November last year industrial production rose by 0.6 per cent over its level in October following a month-on-month drop of 0.7 per cent. Despite see-sawing and conflicting indications of an economic upturn, the government is adhering to its forecast of 1.4 per cent growth for this year, while busily reviewing its options if the economy looks like falling far short of this. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, yesterday said the credibility of the government's forecast had been reinforced by a Bank of France survey of industrialists in December who 'confirmed the improvement in industrial production detected in November'. Insee is predicting that output in the fourth quarter of 1994 will show a 0.3 per cent rise over the third quarter. The agency forecasts an average 0.4 per cent output rise in the first two quarters of this year. After Prime Minister Edouard Balladur discussed the situation with three of his economic ministers yesterday, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the budget minister and official government spokesman, said 'encouraging prospects' had been identified, and that no new measures would be announced before a special February 3 ministerial seminar. Mr Balladur is to hold similar discussions on health insurance reform today and on unemployment next week. This flurry of meetings is prompted partly by Mr Balladur's desire to regain political momentum after last week's setback to his education reform, and partly out of genuine uncertainty about the economy and worry over rising unemployment.</p>

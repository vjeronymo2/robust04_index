			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Loan row points up Israeli military reliance on US: Hugh Carnegy reports most weapons are US supplied and financed - loss of advanced technology would be a hard blow THE DISPUTE between Israel and Washington over the issues of loan guarantees and alleged Israeli sales of sensitive US weapons technology has underscored the extent to which Israel has become dependent on US aid, both in the economy as a whole, but also particularly for its military strength. Government ministers have responded defiantly to Washington's refusal to grant Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.7bn) in loan guarantees to help settle thousands of Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union unless Israel halts Jewish settlement in the occupied territories. Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, has said Israel will not 'crawl or beg for help' and that it will look to world Jewry for the funds instead. But Israeli leaders know it will be hard to cope with any significant reduction in the levels of US aid. The failure to secure the loan guarantees and the implicit threat of reduced access to US military assistance if abuse of US technology is proved has sent a shudder of alarm through the government and the defence establishment. Despite Mr Arens' appeal, diaspora Jews, who already contribute about Dollars 2bn a year to Israel, cannot realistically be expected to fill the gap left by the loss of the loan guarantees. And Israel expects that borrowing large amounts on world markets without the guarantees would be very hard. Mr Jacob Frenkel, the governor of the Bank of Israel, said a programme of tough spending cuts, possibly on social spending, and accelerated reforms to promote growth and investment would be necessary. However, the deeper concern raised by the US stance on the guarantees, and a political climate in Washington less sympathetic to foreign aid than in the past, is that it may presage a decline in the traditional high level of economic aid Israel has received annually from the US for the past 20 years and more. US government aid to Israel has totalled around Dollars 40bn since the establishment of the state in 1948. Since the early 1980s, combined annual economic and military aid of around Dollars 3bn has all been in grant form, in effect lifting the burden of Israel's foreign debt and allowing Israel to maintain rates of military spending at times amounting to more than 20 per cent of gross domestic product. As Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, remarked tartly in evidence to Congress, the reason Israel has a good debt repayment record is because the US provided the dollars with which to pay it back. In 1991, US aid went up to close to Dollars 4bn because of emergency help for Gulf war expenditures. This amounted to some 8 per cent of GDP. In contrast, net foreign investment was negative for both of past two years. Critics of the Israeli economy argue persuasively that US aid has been a factor in Israel's poor growth record since the 1970s by fuelling misallocation of resources and blunting the incentive to introduce market reforms to the state-dominated economy. But it is clear any big reduction would be extremely painful in the short term. Nowhere would this be felt more than by the military. A recent study for Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Centre for Strategic Studies* says Israel's ability to finance military acquisitions rests on US security assistance, which makes up Dollars 1.8bn of the annual aid package. This accounts for an average of more than 30 per cent of the defence budget and may have reached half in 1991. 'This reliance on Washington for the flow of arms goes much deeper than the financial sector,' the study says. 'For not only is the US the principal funder of weapons acquisition, it is the number one provider as well.' Military experts have been quick to point out that any reduction in military assistance - -or blocking of access to technology - would be extremely damaging. Since France cut off arms supplies in 1967, Israel's main weapons systems have become US supplied or financed, or both. Access to US technology has been a vital part in maintaining Israel's crucial 'qualitative edge' over its Arab foes. US systems used by Israel include its frontline F-15 and F-16 aircraft, Apache helicopters and radar surveillance aircraft. 'Even Israel's main battle tank, the Merkava, has been built in large part by US investment capital,' says the Jaffee Centre study. The US is funding the development of the Arrow ballistic missile interceptor, the Israeli-made weapon which Israel intends to be its main defence against missiles such as the Scud rockets fired at it by Iraq during the Gulf war. Under offset terms attached to the US military aid, Dollars 375m can be spent by Israel in Israel and Dollars 100m by the US in Israel, a vital source of business for the country's indigenous military industries. These also benefit from annual Pentagon purchases from Israel of Dollars 250m. Israeli officials and US diplomats say that the current disputes between them have not compromised Washington's commitment to support Israel's security. But Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, junior minister in the office of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, said in a radio interview this week that Israelis should be ready for a decline in aid. 'We are entering a decade in which we will no longer be able to depend on American aid,' he said. *Rearming Israel: Defence Procurement through the 1990s, JCSS 1991. Published by the Jerusalem Post, PO Box 81, Jerusalem 91000. Israel will bar 750,000 Palestinians from leaving the Gaza Strip from today until further notice, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. The order came two days after a Gaza man stabbed to death a Jewish woman and an Israeli-Arab man and wounded another 19 people. The attacker, who was avenging the death of his father in an Israeli prison, was shot dead. Palestinians said it was the first time since the Gulf war a year ago that the army had sealed off Gaza. About 20,000 Gazans leave daily to work in Israel, mostly as labourers. Security officials said the closure order came from Defence Minster Moshe Arens, who is in Washington for talks. The uprising against Israeli rule began in a Gaza refugee camp in December 1987. Gaza is a stronghold of the Moslem fundamentalist Hamas movement.</p>

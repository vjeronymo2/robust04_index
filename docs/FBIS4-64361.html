			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Aho Wants To Continue as Party </F> Leader"]    [Text] Prime Minister Esko Aho is ready to continue as  Finland's Center Party chairman. He stated his wish to continue  in an interview published Friday [15 April] by the paper  KESKIPOHJANMAA. "I regard it as my duty to be in a position to  defend what has been done over the period of the last three  years," Aho affirmed. SUOMENMAA reporter Seppo Kuisma was  indignant over Aho's interview. In a subsequent article, Kuisma  accused Aho of betraying the Center Party's main press organ by  announcing this through KESKIPOHJANMAA. Aho had not deigned to  tell of his wish to continue when he spoke with SUOMENMAA  reporters on Thursday. He cited as explanation as "simply for  reasons of scheduling." It was made clear to Kuisma that it was  a problem of KESKIPOHJANMAA's printing schedule.</p>

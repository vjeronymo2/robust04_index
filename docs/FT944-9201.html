			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico falls 1.1% Mexican stocks were hurt by political worries in connection with the investigation surrounding the assassination of Mr Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, secretary general of the ruling Institutional Rev-olutionary Party (PRI), in September. At the close the IPC index was down 27.49 or 1.1 per cent at 2,459.15. The market turned negative after the man leading the investigation, Mr Mario Ruiz Massieu, brother of the murdered official, accused two senior PRI officials of trying to hinder his inquiry. Investors were also concerned about the increase in US interest rates by the Federal Reserve, fearing that this could lead to a repatriation of US funds. Heavily weighted Telefonos de Mexico opened higher but quickly joined the losers, shedding 0.22 per cent.</p>

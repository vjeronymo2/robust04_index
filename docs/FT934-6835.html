			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Observer: Over and out So much for the Scandinavians' fabled ability to sink their differences when all around them seemed to be losing their tempers. When Jan Carlzon, the Swedish architect of the ill-fated Alcazar project, got up to put across his point of view at Sunday's press conference he was quickly shot down by a Danish superior. The diplomatic incident between Carlzon, the former chief executive of Scandinavian Airline Systems, and SAS chairman Tage Andersen was triggered by a seemingly innocent query about what Carlzon planned to do next. 'I am less worried about my own future than about the future of the four airlines,' replied Carlzon. This is the sort of statesmanlike statement one might expect from a big picture man like Carlzon but it clearly incensed Andersen, who turned an angry purple and retorted that the SAS board is 'not worried about the future of SAS'. Assembled newshounds were told that if they had any further questions about the future of the airline they could put them to the chairman and not to Carlzon.</p>

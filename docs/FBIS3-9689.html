			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  "Dangerous" Precedent </H6>   A commentary in a Bratislava independent weekly has warned  that the proposed extension of a new law providing for  restitution of property unjustly seized during the communist era  to cover the decade preceding the communist takeover (including  the 1939-45 period, when Slovakia was a satellite of the Third  Reich) may create a "dangerous" precedent, legitimating the  claims of former Sudeten Germans to former Czechoslovak  property. The author, Jaroslav Stracelsky, writing in the 22  February issue of MOSTY, urged Slovak lawmakers to pay close  attention to the drafting of the restitution law and, in  particular, to oppose the government in its effort to shift the  beginning of the period covered by the law from the originally  proposed February 1948 to November 1938.  <H5>  Role of Hungarian Leader </H5>   Stracelsky claims that, while drafting the restitution law,  designed to compensate Slovak citizens and organizations,  particularly Jewish citizens and the churches, for losses  suffered because of political discrimination in the pre-1989  period, the Slovak Government may have been unduly influenced by  the demands of Miklos Duray, the chairman of Egyutteles, the  largest political party representing the Hungarian minority in  Slovakia. Speaking on Slovak television, Duray attacked the  so-called Benes Decrees of 1945, which legalized the expulsion  of the Sudeten Germans as well as some Hungarians from  Czechoslovakia immediately after World War II. Duray insisted  that these decrees be invalidated.  <H5>  Implications for Sudeten Claims </H5>   Stracelsky suggested that "Slovakia's Hungarian citizens  apparently felt that what Duray had in mind was redress of old  wrongdoings" and that the Slovak Government must have shared  that view. This, he said, may explain why, "under the innocent  pretext" of wanting to rectify the injustices inflicted on the  churches and their property, the government proposed to push  back the date for property restitution to the Jewish communities  from 1948 to the day of the Vienna Arbitration of 2 November  1938, when Slovakia ceded portions of its territory to Hungary.  But, argues Stracelsky, "this innocuous legal move" has serious  hidden implications. The government has either ignored or  overlooked the fact that, "while on the day of the Vienna  Arbitration the Slovak south was not yet occupied by Hungary,  Hitler had already annexed the Sudeten territory." Thus, whether  intended or not, the recognition of this fact by the Slovak  Government, as reflected in the draft of the law, "will make it  possible for the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft [the  Bavaria-based organization of Sudeten Germans and their  descendants] to obtain additional support for its territorial  and property claims" against the Czech Republic.    The Sudeten Germans will be able to insist that, because the  Slovak Government seems now to be willing to compensate those  who were dispossessed as early as 1938, the Czech Government  should follow suit. "The fact that this can be done in Slovakia  should make things easier for the [Sudeten] Germans in their  negotiations with the Czech Republic as well." It should be  clear, Stracelsky adds, that "the Slovak Government would be  committing a major mistake," and he admonishes the Slovak  parliamentary deputies to be "vigilant" no matter how "innocent  the government documents submitted to them may appear."  <H5>  Link to German Visitor Seen </H5>   In conclusion, Stracelsky hints that Duray's criticism of  the  Benes Decrees may have been related to a visit to Budapest by  Klaus Franke, a Christian Democratic deputy in the German  Bundestag. Franke's trip, he points out, took place shortly  before Duray's television appeal. During that trip, according to  Stracelsky, Franke allegedly tried to induce Gyorgy Csoty, the  deputy chairman of the Hungarian parliament's Foreign Affairs  Committee, "to make sure that the Hungarian minority deputies in  Slovakia appeal, in the Slovak National Council and the Slovak  media, for the cancellation of the Benes Decrees, which affected  the Sudeten Germans." Stracelsky characterizes the Franke-Csoty  talks as a "provocative event" that could not but "attract  attention in both Hungary and Slovakia" and speculates about the  possible existence of "a lobby (endowed with considerable  financial means) that may be interested in a deliberate  escalation of Slovak-Hungarian and Slovak-Czech tensions and  that utilizes, for that specific purpose, its own stable of  Trojan horses." The potential impact of such tensions on the  course of the early elections that are being planned, he adds,  should not be ignored.</p>

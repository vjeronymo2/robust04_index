			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Video games turn nasty: The latest generation of TV toys, launched in the UK this month The best part is when you run over the granny with a walker,' says Erick Arnold, 14, eyes fixed on the TV screen, hands grasping the controller as he races recklessly through city streets on a motorcycle in Road Rash, a hit video game for the 'multiplayer system' made by US company 3DO that is being launched in the UK this month. Parents, and especially grandmothers, may not appreciate the humour, but 3DO technology is a winner among 'selfish, single males', as one software developer describes the target market. The latest generation of TV video games has sharper graphics, higher-speed moving video sequences and better sound quality than other game machines. The games are stored on CD-Roms, rather than in cartridges. There seem to be plenty of them around. World video game sales are expected to top Dollars 9bn this year, with Nintendo and Sega, both of Japan, the 'mighty forces' in this world of Street Fighters, Fatal Fury and Killer Instinct. 3DO charged on to the scene a year ago, like the bold champion in one of its fighting games, vowing to banish the evil monsters that fragment the market with different technical specifications and create a unifying global standard for interactive multimedia. The company licenses 3DO technology to hardware and software companies, which pay royalties to 3DO from sales of their products. Among 3DO's backers are Matsushita, the Japanese consumer electronics manufacturer; AT&amp;T, the US communications company; Time Warner, the publishing giant; and MCA, the entertainment group. For a time, it seemed that 3DO was outgunned. Initial sales of the first 3DO licensed product, Matsushita's Panasonic Multiplayer game machine, were disappointing in the US. Heavily promoted software titles, such as a video game based on the film Jurassic Park, arrived late and did not live up to the hype that preceded them. Over recent months, however, 3DO has been gaining momentum. 'We just had our best month ever,' says Mr Trip Hawkins, founder and chief executive of 3DO. Sales of the Panasonic game machine have reached a total of 200,000 - boosted by strong sales in Japan - enough to attract the interest of some of the best game software developers. Consumer electronics groups Sanyo of Japan and Goldstar of Korea have announced plans to launch their versions of 3DO technology this autumn and Creative Technologies, the leading supplier of sound cards for personal computers, has introduced an add-on circuit board for personal computers that enables them to play 3DO games. Now comes the UK launch. 'The big competitors are not as entrenched here,' says Mr Bob Faber, 3DO senior vice-president of marketing and managing director of the new UK operation. He also sees an opportunity to build a broader market in the UK. Whereas most American and Japanese players - or 'gamers' - are in their teens, the UK has a strong 'adult gamers' market, he says, and even a growing band of 'second-generation 'gamers' whose fathers grew up playing Atari games in the early 1980s'. There is no doubt where the primary - and primal - interests of video game developers lie. 'Your mission is to protect five teenage girls . . . ,' says the commander of Night Trap, a 3DO interactive movie. 'If you don't have the brains or the guts for this assignment, give the controls to somebody else.' 'An ancient clan with the power to transform into fearful monsters stands poised to destroy itself for a goddess who will grant their every wish . . . ,' reads the introduction to Breath of Fire. For now, 3DO has a technology edge over rivals, according to game aficionados. 'The graphics and sound effects are much better,' says Erick, a veteran player of Nintendo, Sega Genesis and personal computer games, 'and the play action is faster than on the computer.' But he says the 3DO player is too expensive, at about Dollars 500 in the US and a list price of Pounds 399 in the UK. 'It would take forever to save up for from a paper round (newspaper delivery round).' Sega's planned introduction in the US this November of Genesis 32X, a Dollars 150 add-on component for its Sega Genesis video game machines may close the performance gap at a lower price. In the interests of research, however, Erick and several of his friends did not object to spending many hours this summer glued to the TV screen assessing the merits of 3DO games such as Road Rash, in which motorbike riders kick and punch each other, mow down pedestrians and plough into oncoming cars. Crash &amp; Burn, a car race that would drive the authors of the Highway Code crazy, and Shock Wave, in which players fight alien conquerors, also proved popular. The latter is 'good fun, great sound effects and graphics', says Erick. 3DO's goal of establishing a global standard for interactive multimedia, including interactive TV, personal computers, video production as well as video games may be similarly difficult to conquer. The fledgling company will face bigger competitors at every turn. Whether 3DO can move beyond video games will depend largely upon its ability to attract 'gamers' in the next year. That may be challenge enough for a young player in a big market.</p>

The Indians, which make up the four ethnic groups that live  in the 34 municipalities in Guerrero State, left Monday night  with signs that read "Indians, never again second class  citizens," "For a court that judges violations to Indian human  rights," and "Solidarity with the noble and fair cause of our  Chiapas brothers." Included in their requests, the demonstrators  demand compliance with the EZLN demands for democracy, justice,  and liberty; autonomy for the Indian peoples; the creation of a  state fund for the development of their peoples; and that the  state satisfy the needs of employment and services.    The Guerrero Indians and other Indians who have arrived from  different parts of the country, on 3 March will participate in a  Mexico City rally and they have requested an audience with  Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.    Yesterday the EZLN and the government began their first  peace  talks in San Cristobal de las Casas, in the southern State of  Chiapas.</p>

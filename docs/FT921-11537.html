			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Observer: Policy switch No sooner has Britain's Office of Fair Trading chief Sir Gordon Borrie handed in his notice than another good OFT man - Richard Thomas, the 42-year-old director of consumer affairs - heads for the door. Could the two events be connected? Thomas, like his boss, is a clever lawyer whereas Sir Bryan Carsberg, Borrie's successor as director general, is an accountant. However, Thomas assures me that the timing of the departures is pure coincidence. He never regarded himself as a candidate for Borrie's job and unlike most of his OFT colleagues, he is not a career civil servant. He is off to join City law firm Clifford Chance as the first director of its public policy practice. He will not be a partner but he will certainly be earning more than the Pounds 51K-59K that his old job is being advertised at. It seems slightly odd that Clifford Chance wants to poach a consumer affairs expert rather than someone like Martin Howe, boss of the OFT's competition policy division, who should be able to command juicy advisory fees if he ever decided to go private. But Clifford Chance partner David Reid is confident that he has made the right choice. Thomas will assist clients 'in dealing with the ever enlarging interface between business and governmental bodies in the area of developing laws'. Or more briefly, perhaps, Mr Fixit.</p>

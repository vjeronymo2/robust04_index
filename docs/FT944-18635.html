			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Business Travel (Update): London to Syria The UK's minister of state at the Foreign Office, Douglas Hogg, arrived in Damascus yesterday for a three-day visit. He has already visited Syria twice since London and Damascus resumed relations in 1990 and British officials said the aim of this visit was 'to keep up the relationship'. Mr Hogg will have talks with his Syrian counterpart, Mr Nasser Qaddour, and possibly with other ministers, especially those responsible for the economy. The UK would like to expand its business relationship with Syria but British companies face stiff competition from Italian, German and Japanese rivals.</p>

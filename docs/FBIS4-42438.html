			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Barbara Palombelli: "Only Crazy People With </F> Bossi"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- "Friends, colleagues, it must be clear to  everyone that this government will not last the duration of the  legislative term.... We have done our utmost to build a stable  majority, but we have not succeeded, and the result is that this  strong majority does not now exist.... But this must not  frighten us: We have been underestimated in Parliament and are  improving in all the opinion polls. We apparently already have  over 25 percent.... And we are ready for any eventuality." It  was shortly after 1100 yesterday, up on the fifth floor of the  parliamentary group offices, which are connected to the lower  house by a long elevated walkway. A meeting of Forza Italia's  100 deputies was under way. Silvio Berlusconi spoke in his  twofold role as government leader and leader of the  party-cum-movement founded five months ago. And he spoke off  the cuff, taking advantage of the fact that no reporters were  admitted to the room.    He talked about the future, about alliances, and about  strategies. He declared war on [Northern League Secretary]  Umberto Bossi -- "someone who is in danger of being understood  and followed only by crazy people." He reaffirmed [National  Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini's loyalty but enlarged on his  ideas about Benito Mussolini. He explained the nature of the  party or nonparty that he wants to create and described future  posts and responsibilities. He entrusted new deputy Fabrizio  del Noce, former foreign correspondent for television channel 1  news, with responsibility for the very delicate media  department. He provided answers on the question of internal  dissent and the sudden departure of Domenico Mennitti (he may be  replaced in the post of national coordinator by Paolo del  Debbio). And he issued the following watchword to his colonels:  We are ready for anything. He made it clear, with no  circumlocutions, that "if it becomes impossible to govern, we  will not be caught unprepared by an early election.... So much  the worse for the others, for those who have failed to realize  that they are playing with fire...."    It was a case of Forza Italia versus the Northern League.  Was this merely electioneering? Following the attacks from  Bossi, who described the Berlusconi movement as "a UFO with no  ideals," Berlusconi issued a sharp response, but warned his men  "not to reply in the same tone, in the same language. We must  ponder long and hard before attacking them, otherwise we risk  losing votes, like them. Of course, the debate has now fallen  below the danger level. Yesterday evening I saw Bossi on `Milano  Italia' and I do not know whether it is possible to continue  with an ally who insults you on television, and then tries to  get smart by flirting with the PDS [Democratic Party of the  Left] and opening up to the progressive forces, without  consulting with anyone...." Lastly, a piece of advice to his  deputies: "Talk with the League deputies. Make them understand  that they were elected with your votes, which are moderate  votes. Make them listen to reason: If they follow Bossi they  will quickly lose their seats, sooner than they imagine...."    Though Bossi is a traitor, Fini "is loyal, a truly  trustworthy ally. And we repay his loyalty. But that does not  mean forever and unconditionally." The prime minister  explained: "Today's alliances will not always be the same  tomorrow...." This was a mysterious observation. Particularly  when set alongside his brusque distancing from the  fascism-antifascism issue. With regard to Mussolini and his  American interview, Berlusconi explained that he "never said  that Mussolini did some good things...partly because it is  obvious that someone who wields total power will do both good  things and bad things. But my thoughts lie elsewhere: Since we  believe strongly in democracy, we want to do good things within  democracy and certainly not under a dictatorship. Is that  clear?" [passage omitted]</p>

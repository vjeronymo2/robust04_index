			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / The Property Market: Investment rules are being rewritten The UK property industry is still firmly in the grip of one of the worst recessions it has ever experienced. Yet, paradoxically, many experts think that the case for buying property has rarely been better. 'Our forecasts suggest that 1992-93 may represent a classic purchasing opportunity, with the benefit of hindsight,' says Jones Lang Wootton, the chartered surveyor. 'Our expectation is that the worst is over,' says Mr Rupert Nabarro of Investment Property Databank, a research group. 'There may be strong arguments to support returning to the market.' The nub of his argument is that yields for commercial property have never stood so high, returns in other types of investment, such as gilts, are not promising, and there is little competition from property companies or foreign investors to bid up the prices for property. However, institutions should beware of smugness, says Mr Nabarro. Most of the good quality buildings that flooded the market during the boom period in the mid-1980s are not in institutional hands. 'To maintain the quality of your estates you will need these buildings,' he says. A strong case for renewed property investment is also being made at a time when the discipline of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System is provoking some hard thinking about the merits of gilts and equities. If high real interest rates are here to stay, profits may come under pressure and fund managers could regret their heavy emphasis on equities. But investors have to consider the possibility of a return to inflation (if, say, the prospects for European monetary union collapsed and sterling was devalued), in which case gilts would have difficulty in holding their own. In such a scenario, property could be an attractive way of hedging investors' bets. If inflation falls, the real value of income from property will appreciate in value. If inflation rises, the impact will be mitigated by higher growth in rents. The problem with assessing these arguments is that it is extremely difficult to generalise about the state of the market. The pain of the property recession is still very unevenly spread. The portfolios of institutional investors have 'extraordinary strength' says IPD's Mr Nabarro: these portfolios boast secure leases, low vacancies and include few developments in hand. By contrast, most of the quoted property companies are over-borrowed and too focused on London. The state of many private property developers - and the banks which lent to them - is even worse. At the same time, the property market has splintered into separate tiers governed by location, quality of tenant and length of lease. The returns measured by IPD for 1991 show the greatest contrasts since it began records, ranging from -10.1 per cent for offices to +8 per cent for industrial property. The problem for the property industry is that new demand is concentrated on top quality property which accounts for just 15 per cent of the total market. Institutions are playing it safe and pursuing properties with long leases and good covenants. The demand for this select group of property outstrips supply; competition has already significantly driven up prices. Outside this narrow band of property, enthusiasm is still weak. The mood of property agents is very depressed. The prospects for the office market in London and the south-east, which accounts for a high proportion of the total market's value, are too poor to allow talk of any broadly-based recovery in the property market. Savills, the chartered surveyor, said this week that rents across the market would not begin to rise until the end of 1994. That sent property shares into a spin, even though Savills thinks that values have stabilised as a result of some hardening in yields. Total returns will reach 5 per cent this year, it believes. If rents have stopped increasing, investors will get little comfort from the rise in property yields to a level where they have converged with gilt yields. Investors demand a premium of between 1 per cent and 4 per cent for property to compensate for the disadvantages of management costs, illiquidity, obsolescence and risk of default. Where rents are still falling and there is no reason to expect yields to harden, the case for property is an unconvincing one. Another reminder of the fundamental problems of the sector was provided by County NatWest, the merchant bank, this week in a report which raised doubts about the willingness of overseas lenders to continue to support the market in the face of severe domestic problems, particularly in the Japanese market. 'At best, the negative effect may be restricted to an unwillingness to refinance loans in the UK market; at worst, it may prompt the calling in of existing loans and the liquidation of property assets, with dire consequences for the UK (and global) property markets,' it said. Leaving aside the huge variations in different parts of the market, predictions about its future behaviour are a complicated matter. Not only have changed expectations about inflation reduced the value of the market's past behaviour as a guide to the future, but the market's past behaviour often defied conventional wisdom. The relationship of property yields to gilt yields and rental movements is one example of this. Contrary to common belief in the business, there is little correlation between property yields and rental movements, on the one hand, or property yields and gilt movements, on the other, when the figures for the past 20 years are examined. 'One of the greatest myths in the property sector is that property share prices respond positively to changes in interest rates,' says Mr John Atkins at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house. Similarly, there is no evidence that yields move in anticipation of changes in rental values, he says. 'Indeed, property yields have often moved in exactly the opposite direction. Increases in investment usually occur, for example, in response to, rather than in anticipation of, periods of above average rental growth,' says UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. As yet, it is unclear what impact the growth of property research over the past decade will have on investors' ability to anticipate periods of rental growth. The uncertainties facing the market do not end with the behaviour of investors or expectations about inflation and growth. For example, the question of whether tenants should continue to be responsible for leases they have assigned is under review and could have profound implications for the investment market. Investors plunging into the market can also comfort themselves in the belief that counter-cyclical investors win through in the long run. According to research by Jones Lang Wootton, 'the best long-term returns have been achieved by concentrating purchasing activity in periods when real estate returns are declining and avoiding purchasing in periods when they are peaking.' But the real rewards of property investment undoubtably depend on an examination of tenant, lease and sector. Extrapolating last year's results may be hazardous. For instance, Savills believes that the recession has caught up with industrial property, which will give way to retail property as the industry's best performing sector. Nonetheless, IPD believes that the lessons of 1991 may give an indication of the running order as the sector pulls out of recession. Prime buildings, strong tenants, the provinces, industrials and out-of-town property were all 'in' in 1991 while London was clearly 'out', it says. Anything that was old, secondary, high yielding, facing a lease expiry or concerned with offices should have carried a warning to tread carefully. The rules of property investment are being rewritten, according to IPD. '1991 may mark a new turning point in property investment,' it says.

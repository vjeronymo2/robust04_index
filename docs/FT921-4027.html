			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Financial spanners for a battered industry - Cars THE UK motor industry, limping along at new car sales rates not seen since the 1970s, has been calling increasingly urgently for help. So it gave a big sigh of relief yesterday when rescue patrolman Lamont turned up, his battered red box brimming with financial spanners. Most will give unambiguous help to beleaguered manufacturers and dealers, who have seen sales fall from a record 2.3m in 1989 to 1.59m last year - a decline which is continuing. Indeed, by last night an industry consensus was emerging that the measures overall are likely to push up sales by 60,000-80,000 in a full year. One spanner, however, may yet turn out to have dropped inconveniently into the works, at least from the perspective of the big manufacturers such as Ford. In ignoring the protests of Customs &amp; Excise, and serving notice that there will be no VAT penalties for companies offering cash alternatives to company cars, Mr Lamont may have opened the door to an explosion in 'cash for car' schemes among companies which believe that their cars are no longer tax-effective, or which no longer want the hassle of operating them. There may be thousands of companies in this category, whose employees could easily opt for a second hand car and cash, or an exotic import, rather than the Ford, Vauxhall or Rover to which they may previously have been restricted. The issue is important because of the sheer size of the company car market. Around 60 per cent of all sales are to businesses. For both corporate and private car buyers, however, the Budget's effects were wholly positive. The halving of Special Car tax to 5 per cent of a car's wholesale price means that, as of this morning, about Pounds 400 should have been knocked off Tuesday's showroom price of a small family car. Higher up the scale, a Vauxhall Senator 3 litre, 24-valve which had a list price of Pounds 28,630 before Mr Lamont got to his feet should now be retailing at Pounds 2,200 less (before any market-driven discounts). The Special Car tax cut leaves total purchase taxes on most new cars in the UK at close to the EC average of about 22 per cent, although still high compared with German's less than 15 per cent.( In all EC cases, cars imported from outside the EC are subject to an extra 10 per cent duty). Even if most companies and employees opt to keep their company cars, the cars themselves are likely to change as a result of structural changes to the income tax scale charges payable by employees on their company car benefit. Rightly, Mr Lamont yesterday described the current system as arbitrary and unfair. It comprises a series of 'thresholds' based mainly on engine capacity but, at the top of the market, on Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000 ceilings above which tax charges are also increased sharply. The system discriminates against both diesels - which, although more economical than petrol cars need more capacity for equivalent power - and specialist executive and luxury car makers such as Jaguar. A user of a car priced just below the Pounds 29,000 threshold pays 62 per cent less tax than the operator of a Jaguar costing just over Pounds 29,000. 'It's been very damaging to us,' a Jaguar spokesman said last night. The prospect of a more simple, graded system in the consultative document the Inland Revenue will publish in the summer will be welcomed by the entire industry as a means of smoothing out production and marketing distortions. Corporate car purchasers have yet to feel the full adverse effects of last year's Budget, when for the first time Mr Lamont imposed National Insurance contributions on employers for the company car benefit. The first payments - for 1991-92 - will not fall due until July, when they will cost business an estimated total Pounds 750m a year. That will more than offset Special Car Tax reductions, which will cost the treasury only Pounds 635m in 1992-93 - and that includes the benefit accruing to private buyers. However, the business sector will also benefit from the decision to make available full capital allowances on cars costing up to Pounds 12,000, rather than the Pounds 8,000 ceiling which has been in place since 1979. This represents an extra Pounds 1,000 allowance per car per year. The industry was under few illusions that Mr Lamont might end another anomaly - the inability of companies to claim back the 17.5 per cent VAT on company car purchases, even though theirs is a plight unique within the EC. Yet even here, Mr Lamont showed generosity, acknowledging that taxis, hire cars and driving school vehicles are genuinely 'tools of the trade' and making such vehicles VAT-refundable from August 1.</p>

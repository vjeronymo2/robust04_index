			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Consortium wins German mobile telephone licence A CONSORTIUM headed by Thyssen and Veba, the German industrial groups, and including BellSouth of the US and Vodafone of Britain, was yesterday awarded the licence to develop and operate a new cellular telephone network in Germany. The new E1-network is described as the world's biggest digital cellular network. Total direct investment in it is estimated at DM4.8bn (Pounds 2bn), and investments by suppliers may be worth a further DM3bn. The network is expected to generate 8,000 jobs in Germany, of which 3,500 would be in the east, Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the newly-appointed minister of posts and telecommunications, said yesterday. The network will cater for 3m subscribers by the end of the decade, and begin operations initially in eastern Germany, based in Berlin and Leipzig, by the end of the year. Mr Botsch said the group had won by a clear margin from the only other competitor, the E-Star consortium headed by BMW, the Bavarian motor manufacturer, and MAN, the engineering group. The new system will be the third cellular telephone network to be developed in Germany, and will compete directly with the C and D1 network operated by Deutsche Telekom, and the D2 system operated by Mannesmann, respectively. The key difference is that the new network will operate at 1800 megahertz, instead of the traditional but overcrowded 900 megahertz used by the existing systems. Germany will be only the second country, after Britain, to use the higher frequency. The consortium comprises Thyssen and Veba with a 28 per cent share each, BellSouth, based in Atlanta, Georgia, has 21 per cent, and Vodafone, the largest cellular telephone operator in Britain, has 16 per cent. Other partners include several east German enterprises, among them Minol, the petrol refining and distribution chain taken over by Elf and Thyssen, and the French banking group Caisse des Depots et Consignation. The latter is expected to help promote a European network based on the DCS 1800 standard. Thyssen said the system would be built up initially in east Germany, covering 88 per cent of that area by 1995, and 77 per cent of the west. Vodafone said it hoped to be making an operating profit within four years. One of the main requirements for the system was to put the initial emphasis in east Germany where telephone density is only 20 per 100 inhabitants, compared with 50 per 100 in the west.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT HOME: IMMIGRANTS BRING ENERGY TO OLD CITY;  </P> <P> ALHAMBRA: TOWN'S MIX OF ANGLOS AND LATINOS HAS SEEN CHANGES WITH INFLUX OF  ASIANS, MANY OF WHOM HAVE INVESTED IN BUSINESSES AND HOMES.  </P> <P> A decade ago, the moon cake was as unfamiliar to residents of Alhambra as the  hamburger was to the Russians.  </P> <P> But today the bean-filled Chinese delicacy is common fare in most bakeries of  the San Gabriel Valley community, where Asians account for more than 30% of its  population.  </P> <P> "Alhambra has been experiencing the winds of change with hurricane force,"  noted Warner Jenkins, the editor of the Alhambra Post Advocate for the last 42  years.  </P> <P> "The infusion of Asian money, Asian customs and the energy of immigrants  experiencing a new kind of freedom and opportunity have made a big difference,"  Jenkins said, adding that of Alhambra's 75,000 residents, Anglos and Latinos  now make up less than two-thirds of the population mix.  </P> <P> David and Fei Louie, newlyweds in their 20s, recently closed escrow on a  $190,000-townhouse in Alhambra. David, a native of Hong Kong, has been in the  U.S. for more than a decade, while Fei arrived from mainland China three years  ago.  </P> <P> "We live in a good area and in a well-educated community," said Louie, an  assistant vice president at Banker's Trust in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Janet Ho, the agent at Imperial Realty who sold the Louies their home, finds it  easy to sell properties in Alhambra.  </P> <P> "I've done very well selling to new immigrants, many of whom are young  professionals," said Ho, adding that one of the reasons they can afford to buy  property is because their parents often provide the down payment needed for the  purchase.  </P> <P> "Traditionally, we Chinese want to help our children get a good start in life,"  she said.  </P> <P> Initially, the influx of Asian immigrants created unsettling feelings for many  of Alhambra's long-time residents.  </P> <P> Even Dr. Annie Chin Siu, a Chinese-American who settled in Alhambra 35 years  ago with her physician husband when very few Asians lived there, admits she had  to adjust to the changes.  </P> <P> "For a native Californian like myself, the new Asians seemed so different,"  said the Alhambra orthodontist and former president of the local Chamber of  Commerce. "But because I had an Asian face, they related to me, and it was  easier to establish communication.  </P> <P> "The immigrants, especially older Asians, are taught to blend into the woodwork  and not make any waves," she said. "It's refreshing to see that the younger  people who have been arriving from Taiwan and Hong Kong have brought with them  a strong sense of enterprise and enthusiasm."  </P> <P> High on the list of amenities that draw newcomers to the city is Alhambra's  convenient location, only 8 miles northeast of Los Angeles Civic Center. This  was a major consideration for newlyweds Maruca and Jose H. (Pepe) Ojeda, who  both commute to jobs in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "I'm employed by Childrens Hospital and my husband has a job with the Bank of  America. It only takes us 25 minutes to get to work," Maruca Ojeda said. "We  drive the surface streets to avoid the freeway traffic."  </P> <P> The Ojedas were married last October and started looking for a house in  Montebello, El Monte, Covina and other affordable communities before purchasing  their 1,240-square-Spanish-style home in Alhambra.  </P> <P> "We wanted to live in Alhambra because it was the kind of stable community  where eventually we would want to raise our family. Alhambra is close-knit, has  nice parks and is well maintained and secure," she said.  </P> <P> The city's 160-member police force prides itself on a lower crime rate than  most similarly sized communities and on its three-minute response to major  crime calls.  </P> <P> Broker Millie Williams of Century 21 ACRES, a neighbor of the young couple,  sold them their home. "It was a particularly good buy for the Ojedas at  $194,000," she said. "Anything that close to San Marino normally sells for  around $240,000."  </P> <P> "We'll have to do some fixing to the property," said Cuban-born Ojeda, "but  that's always expected when you move into an older home. Maruca and I will  enjoy making something beautiful out of it."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, some older residents have been cashing in on huge home equities and  moving away from the community, said editor Jenkins, who paid $18,000 for his  home in 1958 and recently declined a cash offer of $300,000 for the house.  </P> <P> "Others are simply being squeezed out by the high cost of living," he said.  "Those most affected are older women who have outlived their families and live  alone."  </P> <P> One of these is Gwen Cottier, who at 82 feels fortunate to be paying only $445  a month for her small two-bedroom court bungalow near the center of town. "I  get by on Social Security, Medicare and on the small sums I receive for  performing at local clubs and organizations."  </P> <P> A former career pianist and singer, Cottier is active in the community's Crime  Club and Postal Alert programs and does volunteer work at Joslyn Center, which  sponsors programs for seniors.  </P> <P> Rising housing costs within the community are most apparent in an area commonly  known as the Bean Tract in the northeast portion of the community adjoining San  Marino, said realtor Tom Berge who manages the Berge Co.  </P> <P> "A tear-down in that area would cost you around $250,000, while a four-bedroom  home with all the modern amenities would run close to $650,000," Berge said.  </P> <P> The least-expensive residential property can be found next to the San  Bernardino (10) Freeway and alongside the railroad track on Mission Street, he  noted. Home prices there average from around $180,000 or $190,000.  </P> <P> A new housing trend is seen in increasing numbers of new multifamily  developments being built throughout the community, Berge said. "The price for  three-bedroom condo units is at about $200,000, while rentals average between  $1,000 and $1,200 a month in upscale areas."  </P> <P> Unusual properties like Dupuy Castle, just south of Valley Boulevard near the  western entrance to the city, are rare listings nowadays, said Orin Berge, who  founded the long-established realty firm.  </P> <P> "The castle, with its numerous secret passages and turrets, has long been the  source of mysterious speculation and is said to have served as a hide-out for  Eastern gangsters. It was built in 1926 to resemble a chateau in the Pyrenees,"  he said.  </P> <P> Berge Co. sold the 10,000-square-foot, 26-room chateau for $400,000 a few years  ago after it was sectioned off into apartment units and had fallen into  disrepair. The concrete-and-steel structure, extensively renovated by its most  recent owner, is back on the market for $3.5 million.  </P> <P> Nearby, Ramona Convent remains the most visible of Alhambra's landmarks, and is  said to be the oldest private Catholic school in Los Angeles County still on  its original site. It was founded in 1899 by the Sisters of the Holy Names.  </P> <P> The city was incorporated in 1903, but its earlier formative years are linked  to Benjamin D. Wilson, a native of Tennessee and wealthy land owner known as  Don Benito, who purchased the original Alhambra Tract.  </P> <P> The naming of Alhambra is credited to Wilson's daughters, who had read  Washington Irving's tales of the Moorish palace in Spain and suggested it to  their father. Hence, also the city's romantic street names -- Almansor,  Granada, Valencia, Cordova, Vega and Hidalgo.  </P> <P> Dorothy Outwater, Alhambra's city clerk from 1966 through 1986, lives in one of  the community's older homes, which was built by her husband's parents in 1923.  </P> <P> "I find the growth in the community in recent years very exciting," she said.  "One of the more dramatic changes has been in the influx of Asians. I find them  very gracious."  </P> <P> The current demographics for the community are clearly reflected in the student  enrollment at Alhambra's four high schools (which are 55% Asian) and an even  greater Asian student enrollment in the elementary grades, said Parker  Williams, vice president of the Asian-owned American International Bank and a  former mayor of the city who now serves as president of its board of education.  </P> <P> "Actually, we have become the beneficiaries," Williams added. "Historically,  education has been an important focus for Asians, and this kind of motivation  for scholastic achievement has spread to all our students."  </P> <P> For Charles A. Hayden, a mortician since 1949, Alhambra's growth and  development would be far greater today if not stymied by the delays in linking  the Long Beach Freeway to the Ventura (134) and Foothill (210) freeways.  </P> <P> "It remains the biggest problem we face," he said. "And we just haven't  addressed it firmly enough. Too many of Alhambra's main streets, like Garfield  and Atlantic, are being used as access to northern communities from Interstate  10."  </P> <P> Mike Paules, 33, the city's assistant manager and director of housing and  community development, agrees with Hayden on the need to resolve the freeway  issue, although, he said, there have been major gains for Alhambra,  particularly in the mid-'80s, that account for a healthy and growing economy.  </P> <P> To the south, new Asian businesses have mushroomed along the town's 3-mile  stretch of Valley Boulevard, where properties that sold for $20 per square foot  10 years ago are now worth $150 a square foot.  </P> <P> "And the rebirth and beautification of Main Street, which seemed doomed to  becoming a ghost town in the '60s and '70s, is another of Alhambra's signs of  wellness," Paules said.  </P> <P> "On its south side, Alhambra Place -- a major shopping hub anchored by Mervyn's  and a multi-screen theater complex -- already has helped restore the town's  pedestrian environment. And in a few months, construction is expected to begin  on a new 40,000-square-foot upscale supermarket and 60,000-square-foot retail  center on the north side of Main Street."  </P> <P> Notable development to the west, Paules said, includes Auto Row and a busy  Commerce Center that includes the Price Club, with a reported retail volume of  $100 million a year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> 1989 estimate: 75,271  </P> <P> 1980-89 change: 16.5%  </P> <P> Median age: 32.2 years  </P> <P> Annual income  </P> <P> Per capita: 11,784  </P> <P> Median household: 25,072  </P> <P> Household distribution  </P> <P> Less than $15,000: 28.7%  </P> <P> $15,000 - $30,000: 29.8%  </P> <P> $30,000 - $50,000: 27%  </P> <P> $50,000 - $75,000: 10.3%  </P> <P> $75,000 + 4.1%  </P> <P> Home price  </P> <P> December average: $198,832  </P></p>

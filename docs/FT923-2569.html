			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / SIB replies to City critics THE Securities and Investments Board, the city's chief watchdog, yesterday replied to critics who have accused it of dragging its feet over the creation of a new regulatory body for retail financial services. Ms Colette Bowe, director of retail markets at the SIB, said the body had no power under the rules of the Financial Services Act to force firms into a new proposed regulatory body to be known as the Private Investment Authority, even if it wanted to. Speaking at a Financial Times conference on retail investment regulation, Ms Bowe defended the SIB's failure to take a hard line with the banks and building societies whose financial services arms it regulates directly. Those firms are under pressure from others within in the industry to join the new body so that competing firms in the same business are regulated by the PIA. Ms Bowe also defended the SIB's new proposed disclosure regime for life insurance products, which has been criticised by consumer groups and the financial press for going too far to meet the concerns of the life insurance industry. She said: 'We believe very strongly in holding a dialogue with the industry and with consumers as we frame regulation . . . For regulators not to do this would lead us towards inflexible, onerous and finally unworkable regulation.' However, Mr Tom King, general manager of marketing at Standard Life Assurance, said that in spite of criticisms levelled at the new regime by consumer groups, it was still detrimental to the life industry. 'I believe that the bases that we now have to use to disclose expenses will unfairly affect the sales of life policies. 'Many clients will not look past the costs to see the benefits - to their own detriment,' he said. Meanwhile, at the same conference, Mr Keith Bedell-Pearce, chief executive of Prudential Financial Services, said the life insurance industry would be reluctant to support the Investors Compensation Scheme to the extent that it has, unless banks and building societies joined the PIA, too.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Mexican MP faces arrest over murder The Mexican lawmaker implicated in last week's assassination of Mr Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu agreed yesterday to renounce his congressional immunity, and turn himself over to the authorities. Congress yesterday afternoon voted to grant Mr Manuel Munoz Rocha's request for leave. A spokesman for the attorney-general's office said Mr Munoz Rocha's whereabouts were known, and unconfirmed reports indicated that he had been detained. Mr Munoz Rocha said in a statement released by Congress that he had proof that Mr Abraham Rubio Canales, a former close associate of Mr Ruiz Massieu serving time in jail for fraud, was the 'intellectual author' of the assassination. Mr Rubio Canales reportedly bore a grudge against Mr Ruiz Massieu, who he believed could have kept him out of prison. Separately, the wife of one of the alleged accomplices told investigators that Mr Munoz Rocha had been paid about Dollars 300,000 by Mr Rubio Canales to plan the assassination. She alleged that the conspirators' next target had been the governor of the state of Tamaulipas whom Mr Munoz Rocha wished to succeed. Reports of a conspiracy to assassinate Mr Ruiz Massieu continued to rattle investors in Mexico's financial markets. Yesterday interest rates on all but the shortest-term government paper rose sharply in the weekly auction. The stock market was down 1 per cent at the close, having recovered the sharp losses of the morning. The conspiracy theories were given further life yesterday by Mr Munoz Rocha's claim, reported in a newspaper, that Mexico's legendary former oil union boss, Mr Joaqun Hernandez Galicia, known as 'La Quina', was involved in the assassination of Mr Ruiz Massieu, the number two official in Mexico's ruling party. La Quina controlled Mexico's powerful oil union until 1989, when his arrest was ordered by President Carlos Salinas. In a further move last night, the attorney-general's office said that Mr Humberto Garcia Abrego, brother of Mr Juan Garcia Abrego, suspected leader of the Gulf drug cartel, had been detained. He was being questioned about thee cartel's possible involvement in the murder.</p>

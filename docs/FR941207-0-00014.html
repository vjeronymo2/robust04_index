			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A total of twelve comments was received on this proposal, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ten commenters being in favor of the provision, one commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being opposed, and one commenter possibly misunderstanding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed provision. Six of the ten commenters supported the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision exactly as proposed, while the remaining four made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional suggestions for inclusion in the provision. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional suggestions were as follows: 1) the Department must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop specific objective guidelines to follow when reviewing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternate value pass-through systems to ensure that all systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are evaluated under the same criteria; 2) the Department must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider the burden an alternate system would place on smaller  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors, since they would probably have to use that system in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a State where it had been approved; and 3) any alternate value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pass-through system should be piloted for one year before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receiving full approval and reviewed every year thereafter to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that it is an accountable and efficient system. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department believes that one commenter may have misunderstood the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions, since concern was expressed that the Department was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to eliminate the option of allowing alternate value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pass-through systems. Finally, the one commenter who was opposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the provision stated that there was no need for this proposal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since the Department already has the authority to approve or deny  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative value pass-through systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department supports the continued use of alternate value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pass-through systems with FCS approval under the State processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and NCP Programs. The Department also supports the proposal that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the paperwork and resource burden associated with an alternate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value pass-through system are extremely important factors that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be taken into consideration when determining whether an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternate system should be approved. The Department believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that distributing agencies, recipient agencies, and processors do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not have the time or resources to dedicate to alternate systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are more labor-intensive and provide no greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accountability than systems currently described for use by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, since there has been little interest expressed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributing agencies in using alternate value pass-through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems, the Department does not believe it would be practical to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop specific guidelines for use in evaluating such systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically, there have only been three requests to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternate systems. While two of these systems were approved for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use in the State processing program, only one is currently in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use. Instead, the Department finds that it is more effective to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate all requests to use alternate system value pass-through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems on a case-by-case basis, making sure that, at a minimum,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the alternate system under consideration complies with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verification requirements contained in section 250.19(b)(2) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Food Distribution Program regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule adopts section 250.30(d)(1)(iii) of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State processing regulations and section 252.4(c)(4)(iii) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NCP regulations without change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Invoice Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would eliminate the requirement under sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 250.30(d)(2) and 250.30(e)(2) of the State processing regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and section 252.4(c)(4) of the NCP regulations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor/distributor invoices must indicate the amount of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discount included or refund due the recipient agencies for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end products purchased, regardless of the type of value pass-through system used. Sections 250.30.(d)(3) and 250.30(e)(2) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rule would also require processors to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing information summaries to contracting agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contracting agencies would be required to provide these pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information summaries to recipient agencies as soon as possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after contract approval by the distributing agency. If any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing information changed during the contract year, processors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be required to provide updated pricing information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summaries to the contracting agencies 30 days prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date. The contracting agencies, in turn, would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to provide the updated summaries to the recipient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies. Section 250.30(c)(4)(xvii) of the proposed State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing regulations would create the affirmative duty of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor to provide these pricing summaries and updated pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summaries. Under the NCP program, section 252.4(c)(4) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule would require processors to provide pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information summaries directly to the recipient agencies as soon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as possible after FCS contract approval. Also, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 252.4(c)(4) of the proposed rule would require that if any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing information changes during the contract year, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor must provide updated pricing information summaries to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FCS and the recipient agencies 30 days prior to the effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of such change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

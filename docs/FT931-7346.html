			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Keating promises review of monarchy AUSTRALIA'S Labor government yesterday promised to establish a committee to draw up plans for constitutional reform if it wins the federal election on March 13. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, said the committee would be asked to produce options for the creation of a federal republic to replace the existing constitutional monarchy. The undertaking, delivered at the formal launch of Labor's election policies, represents the party's first move towards the implementation of its decade-old commitment to the abolition of the monarchy. Mr Keating said Australians were beginning to question the relevance of the 1901 constitution under which Australia's head of state is the British monarch. He said Australians should decide whether to abolish the monarchy before 2001, the centenary of the federation of the continent's six former British colonies. However, he did not commit Labor to a referendum during the three-year life of the next parliament. Abolition of the monarchy is opposed by the Liberal/National party opposition, which is leading the government by between 6 and 12 percentage points in the opinion polls. Mr Keating also promised extra spending of about ADollars 300m (Pounds 142.8m) on social benefits for low-income families, but the low-key policy launch appeared unlikely to revitalise the government's flagging campaign. Ralph Atkins adds: In London the Foreign Office refused to be drawn on the issue. 'It is absolutely a matter for the Australians,' said an official. Buckingham Palace also refused to comment.

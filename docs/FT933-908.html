			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Confident London brokers start to recruit LONDON-BASED securities houses have begun to recruit again, signalling the end of one of the worst ever periods for jobs in the City. Headhunters have been given a new lease of life as brokers have begun taking on staff to cope with a near doubling in investment activity in the past 12 months. Mr Hugh Hughes, chief executive of Societe Generale Equities International in London, expects to increase markets staff by about 50 per cent over the next 12 months. He stressed the strengths of London as a centre for trading European stocks. UBS, the Swiss-owned securities house, has boosted its research and sales staff by 10 per cent over this year at an average total salary package of Pounds 100,000 per person. Mr Hector Sants, vice-chairman of the securities house, said: 'If you didn't make money in the first half of this year you probably shouldn't be in broking.' City job advertisments in the Financial Times, meanwhile, have increased threefold since July. Nomura International, one of the City's biggest firms, has reversed a decison taken last year to cut staff and has strongly expanded its research team. Mr Michael Brookes, deputy managing director, said: 'We see lots of potential in London. It all depends on the quality of staff.' Nomura has recruited 20 senior analysts and proprietary traders this year. Mr Leigh Bruce, head of corporate communications at Salomon Brothers, said: 'We are definitely recruiting more staff. In the past year we have taken on around 30 full-time staff and a number of consultants. 'The bulk has been back-office staff to deal with the substantial increase in volume of business we have experienced. But we have also taken a number of traders and researchers. We now employ 830 full-time.' City headhunters are also benefiting from the more confident mood. Mrs Fiona Stephens, managing director of Stephens Associates, said: 'We have seen an increase in recruitment by market firms and also increasing willingness on the part of City employees to look at new job opportunities.' She stressed the growing internationalisation of City recruitment, with money management groups looking for staff with experience in handling international portfolios. Mr Hughes said US funds place great store by the London market, which they use to funnel investment into continental Europe. There is little sign, however, of a return to the heady days of the mid-1980s when London was willing to take on beginners at high salaries and wait for them to prove themselves. Much of the rebound in recruitment confidence is ascribed to the substantial improvement in UK equity turnover since sterling's departure from the ERM in September last year. Prospects in the UK bond market have also strengthened significantly as the government has returned to debt financing.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 2m exceptional charges push Hartons further into the red LOSSES at Hartons Group, the distributor of semi-finished plastics, deepened from Pounds 5.36m to Pounds 6.25m in 1992. The directors continue to defer the declaration of a preference dividend. Losses per share were 8.5p (8.1p). Pre-tax losses on continuing operations were Pounds 2.52m (Pounds 4.66m) after net exceptional costs of Pounds 45,000 (Pounds 859,000). There were exceptional charges of Pounds 2m (Pounds 1.22m). Some Pounds 1.84m related to goodwill in the consideration for a loss-making Spanish subsidiary, which was previously written off on acquisition. The goodwill had to be shown as Hartons' holding in the subsidiary was reduced to 25 per cent since the year end. The company said Spanish labour law made the alternative of re-organising the subsidiary expensive and difficult. Net interest charges were Pounds 2.57m (Pounds 2.99m). Borrowings stood at Pounds 11m (Pounds 14.8m) at the year end and the group is committed to reducing them. The directors said the results were disappointing but concealed a significant improvement in the underlying position of the group in a harsh economic climate, which deteriorated in this period in continental Europe. Restructured UK operations achieved an operating profit of Pounds 684,000 (losses Pounds 1m). The French subsidiary, also restructured, incurred an operating loss of Pounds 500,000 (profit Pounds 30,000) on underlying turnover down 20 per cent. The company disposed of its resin business in June, which made about a third of turnover. The Benelux operations made Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 90,000) at the operating level on turnover up 39 per cent.</p>

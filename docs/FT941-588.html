			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (1): Region revitalised for prosperity  -France's largest economic region outside Paris, an historic centre of French conservatism, is hauling itself out of recession When the glossy new Opera de Lyon opened its doors on the Place de la Comedie last summer, the city gained a state-of-the-art opera house, an architectural showpiece which has transformed its skyline. The new Opera is an uncompromisingly contemporary building designed by Jean Nouvel, one of France's most innovative architects. His modernist vision is only the first of a series of ambitious architectural schemes for Lyon over the next few years. Restoration of the Beaux Arts museum is nearly complete. The first phase of the Cite Internationale commercial and cultural complex, designed by Renzo Piano, the Italian architect, opens next spring. These buildings are intended not only to revitalise Lyon, but to enhance its status as the capital of the Rhone-Alpes region. 'Rhone-Alpes is already established as one of Europe's strongest economic regions,' says Thierry Bernard, head of ERAI, the local business development organisation. 'But if we are to prosper in the future we must improve our resources and that includes ensuring that Lyon is recognised as a city of international calibre.' Rhone-Alpes today is a vast and varied region stretching from the Rhone and Beaujolais vineyards in the north to the snow-capped Savoie mountains on the Swiss and Italian borders in the east, to the rural beauty of the Ardeche in the south. Physically it is the same size as the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland toether. Its population of 5.2m people is roughly equivalent to those of Denmark and Finland. Economically Rhone-Alpes is the second largest region in France, after the Ile-de-France area around Paris. Its gross domestic product is FFr574m. It owes its economic strength to the long tradition of scientific innovation in its universities and to the manufacturing prowess of its cities: Lyon with its broad industrial base; the old mining and textile town of Saint-Etienne; and the pioneering high-tech centres around Grenoble. The solidity of its old industries, coupled with the dynamism of its new high-tech enterprises, has historically sheltered Rhone-Alpes (apart from Saint-Etienne) when the rest of France has been bruised by recession. Its location - so close to Germany, on the border with Switzerland and Italy - has helped local businesses to build up buoyant export trade to counter any downturn in domestic demand. When the present French recession began three years ago it seemed as though the Rhone-Alpes region would again emerge unscathed. But the franc's strength since the currency crisis of autumn 1992 has had a devastating effect on the region's exports - particularly on sales to Italy, its main foreign market. Since then, the region has been blighted by job losses, business failures and plunging property prices. The recession may have been shorter there than in other areas, but it has undoubtedly been sharper, as illustrated by the alarmingly steep increase in unemployment. Traditionally, the level of unemployment in Rhone-Alpes has been lower than in the rest of France. However, the speed and scale of cutbacks over the past two years has brought the region almost into line with the national average. At the end of 1991 unemployment in the region stood at 8.7 per cent, against a national average of 9.8 per cent. The unemployment figure has since risen by 20 per cent in the whole of France - but it has increased by 27 per cent in Rhone-Alpes. As a result, 11.4 per cent of the local workforce is now unemployed: uncomfortably close to the national average of 11.8 per cent. The worst affected areas have been those which were once most prosperous. Grenoble has been badly affected by the crisis in international electronics which has forced many local companies, notably Thomson and Bull, to rationalise, thereby imposing intense pressure on their sub-contractors and suppliers. Similarly, Lyon has been hit by the difficulties of its chemicals, textile and construction companies. By contrast, Saint-Etienne is still licking its wounds after the long term erosion of its industrial base caused by the closure of its old coal mines and textile mills. It has at least the consolation that unemployment has recently risen more slowly there than in the rest of France. However, the local unemployment level is still above the national average, at about 13 per cent. There are now signs that the tide is turning and that Rhone-Alpes, having gone into recession later than other regions, may be emerging earlier. 'It's too soon to talk in terms of recovery, but the situation does seem to have stabilised,' says Guy Morens, deputy mayor of Grenoble. Jacques Moulinier, his opposite number at Lyon, shares his cautious confidence. 'The Rhone-Alpes economy reached its nadir last October and is now in a stable state,' says Thierry Bernard of ERAI. 'The number of job losses is falling and business start-ups are accelerating. Companies have managed to reduce their stock levels and orders are starting to increase again.' Two years of severe recession argue against a rapid recovery. The consensus among local economists is that the situation will remain reasonably stable through spring and summer, with an upturn forecast for early autumn. In the meantime, local officials are sticking to their long term strategy of trying to make the most of the region's cosmopolitan location by attracting international investment. The rejection last year of Lyon's bid for the European Monetary Institute (precursor of the European Central Bank) was a serious blow. It would have been an invaluable catalyst for investment. Yet the regional authorities and city councils are pressing ahead with plans to improve local infrastructure. One aspect of this strategy is investment in prestige arts projects such as the FFr490m Opera de Lyon and the sumptuous new FFr210m Musee de Grenoble. Another is the continuing effort to improve road and rail links. Creation of the TGV (trains a grande vitesse) network was an important reason for the region's buoyancy in the 1980s. It is still growing. In June, Satolas, the main Lyon airport, will become the first French airport with a TGV link. But the most ambitious project of all is the plan to link Lyon to Turin by TGV. This would reduce the travelling time between the cities to just over an hour, but the scheme - which would involve tunnelling 56km through the Alps - would be extremely complex and expensive. The traumas of the Channel Tunnel project have deterred prospective private sector investors. The Lyonnais and their Italian partners will soon start lobbying for public sector support. They are beginning to realise that funding will be hard to find in the current economic climate. But they are also acutely aware that a trans-Alpine high speed rail link could enable Lyon and the rest of the Rhone-Alpes to fulfil their true potential as one of the European commercial centres in the next century.</p>

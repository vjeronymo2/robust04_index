			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Observer: The No's have it Full marks for trying. Retired bus driver Ken Clark, 79, has just conducted a telephone survey of fellow pensioners in Lewisham and found that 10 out of the 10 Ken Clark(e)s he contacted are against the government's plans to impose VAT on domestic fuel. Lucky for Ken that Norman Lamont is no longer Britain's chancellor of the exchequer. As it is, he had to fiddle his figures a bit by counting all the Clarks, whether or not their surname was spelt the same way as the current chancellor. But then even this government fiddles its figures from time to time.</p>

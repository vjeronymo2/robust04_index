			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LET BOTH NATIONS SHARE THE PEACE-DIVIDEND PIE;  </P> <P> ARMS CONTROL: WRITE FOUR LINES OF DECK TO SUPPLEMENT INFORMATION IN THE HEAD,  AND END IT WITH A PARAGRAPH SYMBOL.AND ADD ONE MORE LINE.  </P> <P> The United States and the Soviet Union appear to be moving in a timely manner  toward significant reductions in strategic nuclear forces. Indeed, the  successful meeting of Presidents Bush and Gorbachev at Malta opened prospects  for broadening the network of cooperation between our two countries in economic  as well as security and arms-control matters. Perhaps we should now explore  possibilities for arms reductions that combine immediate and direct security  benefits with cooperative economic gains for both countries.  </P> <P> In the past, one country or the other has frequently been in the position of  spending money to expand or modernize its forces in order to strengthen its  bargaining position at the negotiating table. It would save a lot of time and  money to negotiate a force reduction that both countries desire before  investing in such a build-up.  </P> <P> In order to make such an agreement more balanced and attractive, the money  saved by the country that was no longer obliged to complete an expensive  missile modernization program could then be applied to the benefit of both  countries. For example, we could negotiate to remove land-based ICBMs that are  both mobile and armed with multiple warheads. Many analysts have endorsed a ban  on such systems, which are destabilizing as well as difficult to verify.  However, the United States has just started to convert our existing MX  multiple-warhead missiles to a mobile force that will match a similar one  already deployed by the Soviet Union. Instead of waiting until that conversion  has been completed, we should cut a deal now for their removal, applying the  money we save to balance the benefits for both parties.  </P> <P> A few years ago, it would have been impractical to propose economic cooperation  in order to balance asymmetries in the reduction of military forces. But the  extraordinary progress in East-West relations has given us hope that, moving  beyond the Cold War, we might now succeed in achieving a balance. An excellent  opportunity presents itself in the matter of land-based mobile ICBMs.  </P> <P> The fixed, silo-based ICBM forces of both the United States and the Soviet  Union are perceived as growing increasingly vulnerable to destruction. This  vulnerability arises from two developments: Intercontinental missiles are now  MIRVed -- armed with multiple warheads that can be independently delivered at  one or more targets. And these warheads have achieved a high degree of  accuracy. This combination leads to the possibility -- and threat -- that an  attacker might have to use only one of his warheads (perhaps two) to destroy  the warheads (as many as 10) on one MIRV-augmented missile housed in a single  hardened underground silo.  </P> <P> In order to reduce this threat, both countries have initiated very costly  modernization programs for their ICBM forces. These programs have two  components. One is to develop small, single-warhead ICBMs, identified as the  Soviet SS-25 already in deployment, and the U.S. Midgetman currently under  development. Thus both forces would be mobile. Also, the United States has  undertaken a program to remove its 50 MIRVed MX missiles from their individual  silos and deploy them as a rail-mobile force, as the Soviet Union has done with  its MIRVed SS-24s.  </P> <P> Putting aside operational complexities and added costs, mobile basing of these  missiles raises serious concern about the ability to verify compliance with  negotiated limits on the number deployed. The verification challenge for mobile  basing is more difficult than simply counting silos; the means are annoyingly  more intrusive and considerably more expensive. Concerns about accuracy in the  count are intensified by the fact that, whatever the uncertainty on numbers of  missiles, the uncertainty on numbers of threatening warheads is, for the SS-24  and the MX, 10 times larger.  </P> <P> This latter concern has led a broad spectrum of strategic analysts from both  countries to urge a ban on deployment of these ICBMs in future negotiations on  strategic arms. Such a ban is likely to be one of the goals in the next round  of START. At that time, however, there will still be a large asymmetry between  the two ICBM forces. Numerically they will be comparable, but Soviet SS-24s are  already deployed -- at considerable expense -- as a rail-mobile, highly  survivable force. In 1991, the United States will still be in the very early  stages of constructing a rail-mobile system for its 50 MXs, which are now based  in highly vulnerable underground silos.  </P> <P> Will the United States be compelled to spend many billions of dollars and  complete a rail-mobile deployment in order to establish symmetry before we can  negotiate a draw-down (or return to silo basing)? Or can we negotiate a cut in  the existing forces and, at the same time, establish an overall quid pro quo  with the Soviets by putting the money saved to our mutual economic benefit? The  reduction in numbers of missiles and warheads would be identical for both  countries. The asymmetry would lie only in what the Soviets have already spent  to deploy a more survivable mobile-basing scheme. It is these costs that would  be compensated by a mutually beneficial economic deal.  </P> <P> Many possibilities for establishing such a quid pro quo suggest themselves. One  might involve funding for a joint technology program to develop and build  "inherently safe" nuclear reactors for clean power. Three-Mile Island and  Chernobyl are grim reminders that both countries have serious needs in this  area; and the ominously looming problems of environmental damage, including  global warming, caution us that safe, clean and economical power for the  developed and developing nations is a very high priority issue for all.  </P> <P> There are many other areas of economic collaboration that may be more  practical, such as industrial modernization, improvement of the very  inefficient system for food distribution in the Soviet Union and expanded job  retraining programs in non-defense industries for both countries.  </P> <P> The attractiveness of this simple scheme is that both countries reduce their  forces equally in order to achieve a mutually desirable goal. Time, effort and  money are all saved by implementing these reductions before both systems are  fully converted to a more survivable basing, and any asymmetric financial  advantages realized thereby can be applied to the economic advantage of both  parties.  </P> <P> The economic cooperation that this calls for no longer seems so visionary as to  be dismissed as impractical.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COSTA MESA DRUG MAKER, YUGOSLAV FIRM TO MERGE  </P> <P> SPI Pharmaceuticals said Wednesday it has tentatively agreed to merge with  Yugoslavia's second-largest drug manufacturer in what it said would be the  first merger of its kind between U.S. and Eastern European drug companies.  </P> <P> The Costa Mesa-based pharmaceutical company said it had signed a letter of  intent to merge with Galenika, a Belgrade-based firm with 5,800 employees and  annual sales of about $150 million.  </P> <P> The proposed merger would create an international drug company with close to  7,500 employees and nearly $300 million in sales.  </P> <P> Jack Sholl, an SPI spokesman, said his company would benefit from the proposed  merger by gaining direct access to consumer markets in Eastern Europe and the  Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "This proposed agreement symbolizes the new opportunities that have been  created by the changing political climate in Eastern Europe," SPI Chairman  Milan Panic said.  </P> <P> Terms of the proposed agreement were not disclosed.  </P> <P> Sholl said the deal is subject to approval of both companies' boards of  directors as well as the government of Yugoslavia.  </P> <P> Galenika manufactures and sells a wide range of pharmaceuticals. The company's  products are sold throughout Eastern and Western Europe, Africa and the Middle  East.  </P> <P> SPI is a prescription and non-prescription pharmaceutical company with $124  million in sales annually and about 1,600 employees worldwide. About 89% of  SPI's stock is owned by ICN Pharmaceuticals, a Costa Mesa-based drug company.  </P> <P> SPI has recently seen an increase in international sales, especially in Mexico  and Central America. The company has also benefited in those areas from  increased demand for injectable multivitamins and antibiotics. SPI does not  have approval to sell those drugs in the United States.  </P> <P> Boosted by strong international sales, SPI recently posted a 26% jump in its  earnings for fiscal 1989. The company earned a record $12.9 million for the  year ended Nov. 31, contrasted with $10.2 million in fiscal 1988.  </P> <P> SPI's shares closed unchanged Wednesday at $9.125 per share on the American  Stock Exchange.  </P></p>

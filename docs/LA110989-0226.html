			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RACER SENNA WONDERS IF HE HAS LOST DRIVE  </P> <P> Former Formula One champion Ayrton Senna said today he is no longer sure he has  the motivation needed to continue competing on the Grand Prix circuit.  </P> <P> At a news conference in Sao Paulo, the 29-year-old Brazilian said, "the  possibility of abandoning Formula One exists and I am still debating with  myself whether or not I have the motivation to continue racing.  </P> <P> "As for the immediate future, all I can say is that next week I'll be training  in Portugal."  </P> <P> Senna said he started questioning whether or not it "is all worthwhile" after  the Paris-based International Federation of Auto Racing slapped a six-month  suspension and a $100,000 fine on him for dangerous driving in the 1989 Grand  Prix championship race.  </P> <P> The suspension was lifted, but the 1988 Formula One champion will be on  probation for six months next season.  </P> <P> The punishment resulted from an incident in the Japan Grand Prix on Oct. 22.  Senna bumped into teammate Alain Prost in a turn seven laps from the end,  forcing the French driver out of the race. Senna finished first but was  disqualified for not returning to the track at the same point he went off.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> DENTAL HYGIENIST DECISION REVERSED  </P> <P> A state appeals court in Sacramento ruled that regulators illegally approved an  experiment allowing dental hygienists to treat patients without the supervision  of a dentist, officials said. Under the test program, administered through Cal  State Northridge, 16 Southern California hygienists were allowed to treat  patients without a dentist's supervision. All other hygienists are required by  state law to work with a dentist. The 3rd District Court of Appeal ruled that  the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development should have held a  public hearing on the program before approving the test, which began two years  ago.  </P></p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Risk and Reward: Grabbing the tiger's tail with HK warrants Grabbing the tail of the Asian tiger that is the Hong Kong stock market has been easier for investors since October, when the American Stock Exchange began listing a series of institutionally-issued warrants on its own capitalisation-weighted index of 30 representative companies traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Designed to track the popular Hang Seng index, the Amex 30 Hong Kong index was created to give US dollar-oriented investors a highly leveraged means of betting on Hong Kong's rapid equity expansion and diversifying their portfolios into an emerging market. With the Hong Kong stock market up 98 per cent over the last 12 months, as measured by the FT-Actuaries World indicies in local currency terms, its not surprising New York's main investment houses have been tumbling over themselves to bring Amex-traded Hong Kong warrants to market. PaineWebber was first, selling 2.6m Hong Kong 30 call warrants and 2.4m put warrants to the public on October 26 and listing them for trading on the Amex. They were followed by a Morgan Stanley Group issue of 6m call warrants on November 2 and a 1m issue of call warrants by Salomon on November 5. Bear Stearns issued 1.5m put and 1m call warrants on December 10 and Merrill Lynch rounded out the selection, issuing 1.6m call warrants on the Amex Hong Kong 30 on Friday. Aside from Hang Seng futures traded in Hong Kong, the Amex warrants are the only exchange-traded derivative product available on Hong Kong equities. While global money managers can access the market through direct investment and structured derivative transactions, smaller investors have had to purchase specialised Asian mutual funds to ride the rally. The Amex warrants' popular price - almost all of them sold in the Dollars 5 range - have attracted a broad range of investors. They have two or three-year durations, with all expiring well before Hong Kong is due to be handed back to the Chinese in 1997. At expiration, warrant-holders are paid the cash value represented by the index. They can be actively traded, and do not have to be held to expiration. The PaineWebber calls were issued in October at Dollars 4.75 each, with a strike of 440.09 on the index. The index has since climbed to 531.76, while the value of a PaineWebber call has jumped to about Dollars 6.50. The warrants, like options, are used for portfolio diversification. Call warrants allow an institution to 'tilt' its portfolio toward an active market without the capital required for direct share purchases. Put warrants can be purchased to protect profits from existing investments. Traders holding profits from owning Hong Kong stocks will buy the puts as cheap insurance against a market reversal. The alternative - liquidating stock - eliminates potential gains if the rally continues. With the Hong Kong market overdue for a downside correction, some Wall Street traders believe the timing of new warrants is a little late for investors to catch the crest of rally. The fear of a correction in a raging bull market prompted Merrill Lynch to engineer a 'reset' clause into the Hong Kong 30 call warrants it priced on Friday. Merrill will allow warrant buyers to 'reset' the strike price of the issue in 60 days, shielding them against losses should the index turn down in the interim. 'The reset provision really sets our product out from the other Hong Kong warrants,' said Mr Stanton Green, vice-president of equity derivatives for Merrill Lynch. 'We included it because it was clear our clients wanted it.'</p>

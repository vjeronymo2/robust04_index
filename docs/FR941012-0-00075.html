			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The other protective device that I see that's had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial improvement is the throttle lock mechanism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where it has to be held down with your palm in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the trigger to operate. For years it was common  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the first thing a logger did was he got a roll of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> black tape and he would tape that down so you didn't  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have to operate that. Through our progressive Montana  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sawyer Safety Program and other efforts I brag to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> people that we now have developed a genetically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> superior timber faller in Montana that can now squeeze  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with his palm and pull with his trigger finger at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These two chain saw protective devices combined with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leg protection have had a significant impact on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction of accidents in Montana relative to timber  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> falling. In fact, it's been so significant that I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> don't even consider the other options of even any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application to logging when we talk about the low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kickback bar, the low kick-back chains and even the bar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tipped guards. They may have individual special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application but I'm thoroughly convinced with the chain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brake, the throttle lock and the leg protection we've  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> so significantly reduced chain saw injuries that any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further attention is maybe some wasted effort and just  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further develops additional conflict (Tr. OR 536). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. David Kludt, Logging Safety Program Supervisor for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State of Idaho, testified that 10 percent of all logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accidents each month are the result of chain-saw kickback  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that these accidents could be drastically reduced by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of chain brakes (Ex. 9&hyph;4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, Maine BLS says that chain brakes have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> played a significant role in lessening the effects of chain-saw injuries in that State (Ex. 5&hyph;174). They reported that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only 13 percent of chain-saw accidents where chain brakes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were present resulted in hospitalization, while nearly half  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of all other accidents required hospitalization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters, however, disputed the effectiveness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chain brakes for preventing kickback (Ex. 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;59, 5&hyph;66).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of these commenters said chain brakes were not reliable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and required frequent maintenance, however, no evidence or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data were presented to support the contention (ex. 5&hyph;59).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter said that a study showed that while chain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brakes reduced kickback by 80 percent, non-kickback  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accidents showed a 400 percent increase (Ex. 5&hyph;66).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the commenter also admitted that the study was from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1972 and that chain brakes had undergone significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvement since that time. Another commenter said chain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brakes, depending on their design, could become entangled in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the brush the saw is clearing and create a safety hazard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ex. 5&hyph;39). The WIR survey, however, does not support the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter's argument. None of the chain-saw operators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting injuries said their chain brake had become caught  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ex. 2&hyph;1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OSHA regulatory action.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters said that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final rule should include requirements for chain-saw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protective devices (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;42,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5&hyph;46, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;4, 9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;18, 9&hyph;20; Tr. OR 536&hyph;37).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, some commenters, including chain-saw and chain-saw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accessory manufacturers, said OSHA should include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance requirements for chain saws in the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard rather than specification requirements (Ex. 5&hyph;4, 5&hyph;8, 5&hyph;13, 5&hyph;15, 5&hyph;26, 5&hyph;37, 5&hyph;59). Many of these commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supported incorporating by reference the American National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards Institute (ANSI) B175.1&hyph;1985 standard on ``Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requirements for Gasoline Powered Chain Saws'' (Ex. 5&hyph;4, 5&hyph;8,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5&hyph;13, 5&hyph;15, 5&hyph;26, 5&hyph;37, 5&hyph;59). The ANSI standard specifies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a performance criteria for manufacture and testing of chain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> saw safety features, such as protection from chain-saw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kickback. One commenter summed up their rationale: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [T]he Status Report on Chain Saw Related Hazards since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1985 Revision to The Voluntary Standard ANSI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B175.1, which was prepared for the Consumer Product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safety Commission in March of this year, is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testimonial to the fact that the reduction in chain saw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injuries is the result of adherence by manufacturers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the voluntary standard. There truly is little to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> said in defense of OSHA when it chooses to knowingly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ignore the demonstrated success of the chain saw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voluntary standard, which equates compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of a combination of devices, in favor of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arbitrary and inexpert agency decision to the effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that one specific device, in and of itself, is superior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to any other device or combination of devices permitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the standard (Ex. 5&hyph;4). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These commenters stated that OSHA would create  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``confusion in the marketplace'' if OSHA adopted requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that were significantly different from the ANSI chain-saw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard that all manufacturers have been voluntarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following (Ex. 5&hyph;4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters, however, opposed incorporating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI standard in the final rule (Ex. 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;48; Tr. OR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 118). These commenters said the ANSI standard was developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to protect consumer chain-saw users, not professional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loggers: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The ANSI B175.1 Standard was developed from an injury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data base that was consumer based and therefore its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct application to pro-logging may not be justified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ex. 5&hyph;27). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Speaking in an interview for the ITN television news  network,  Germany's ARD, and the UPI press agency, President Walesa  claimed that in failing to admit former communist countries into  the European communities, "the West betrays itself, and has  scored an own goal." The West has achieved nothing since the  fall of communism, he asserted.    Walesa was critical of the U.S. "partnership for peace"  proposals. "We cannot talk about partnership, since there is no  partnership visible yet. There is Russia, which threatens the  West, which is frightened, and us in the middle, saying there is  no need to be afraid, all you must do is to increase,  physically, technically, the resources of Western Europe," he  said.    "We have got by, we will get by, and we face no threat.  Russia is not about to invade Poland -- it is too small a  matter for Russia. If the dangers of which the West speaks  exist, then they threaten, not Poland, but Europe," President  Walesa said.</p>

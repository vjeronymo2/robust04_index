			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Simon Sinaga in Jakarta] </F>   [Text] Workers at a cigarette factory in north Sumatera, on  strike since last Saturday for payment of overtime claims,  yesterday released three foremen whom they had taken hostage  briefly earlier in the day.    A company official who declined to be named said the nearly  4,000 employees of the N.V. [expansion unknown] Sumatera Tobacco  Trading company in the industrial town of Pematang Siantar, 120  km south of Medan, had yet to return to work.    Manpower Ministry officials have been trying to mediate in  the six-day dispute, which has been confined to the factory  premises. Dozens of police and military personnel have been  deployed in the area.    The situation at the factory remained tense yesterday  evening, but the workers, who damaged some company offices and  property on Wednesday, did not resort to any more violence,  sources said.    It was not known why the employees held the three foremen  hostage. Two were ethnic-Chinese Indonesians and the third came  from Java.    The workers began their strike action last Saturday after  their demands for payment of overtime claims were not met.    The head of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation's Medan  branch, Mr. Alamsyah, said that on Tuesday the entire workforce  marched to the local police station to protest against the  detention of one of their colleagues who had been among the most  vocal during the strike.    No clashes occurred between workers and security forces, but  on Wednesday workers damaged property on the factory premises.    A labour activist source said that although the Manpower  Ministry was trying to mediate in the incident, the "workers  appeared to have lost trust in the officials".    Workers in Medan and surrounding towns staged violent  demonstrations in April, causing untold damage to factories,  shops, houses and other property. One ethnic-Chinese  businessman was killed.    The government this week began prosecuting over 80 people  for  their involvement in that protest, which workers had mounted to  demand higher minimum wages and better working conditions.    Mr Alamsyah did not link the action at the Sumatera Tobacco  Trading company with the earlier more widespread unrest. But he  said some company employees were not even getting the officially  sanctioned Rp [rupiah] 3,100 (S$2.21) [Singapore dollar] daily  minimum wage.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Rail telecoms move threatens union deal THE reorganisation of British Rail Telecommunications before its planned privatisation threatens the only single-union deal established in British Rail. RMT, the main rail union, which has no members inside BRT, said yesterday it would be pressing for recognition or for a new ballot on union recognition when more than 1,500 RMT telecommunication workers join BRT before April 1994. BRT employs about 650 people but over the next few months this will rise to 2,700 as it absorbs staff from BR, most of whom are RMT members. BRT managers may want to retain the single-union recognition which could be attractive to potential buyers. RMT also warned that splitting the telecommunications function from signalling could threaten safety. The functions were often carried out in the same cables and could affect each other, the union said.</p>

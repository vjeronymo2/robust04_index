			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQI TROOPS IN KUWAIT SAID TO SUFFER CRITICAL SHORTAGES;  </P> <P> MILITARY: ARAB COMMANDERS QUOTE DEFECTORS, SAY MANY OF FOE'S TANKS COULD BE  USELESS.  </P> <P> Iraqi troops massed in Kuwait are suffering from critical shortages of food,  water, fuel and ammunition, according to defectors from the Iraqi military.  </P> <P> Arab military commanders, as well as the U.S. commanders backing up the Arab  positions, said the shortages could make useless many of the 1,500 Iraqi tanks.  </P> <P> The shortages, and their corrosive effect on Iraq's military capability, are  largely a result of world trade sanctions against Iraq, officials said.  </P> <P> And the shortages come at a time when the U.S. and Arab forces are increasing  their strength, with major new deployments in the next two weeks, including  hundreds of U.S. tanks and anti-tank helicopters.  </P> <P> Military commanders said the arrival of additional troops in Saudi Arabia,  together with the tightening economic stranglehold on Iraq, is helping to even  the numerical odds that were stacked against Saudi Arabia and its allies in the  first month of the Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> As a result, many U.S. and Arab military officials interviewed here said, the  likelihood of Saudi Arabia and the United States launching an offensive into  Kuwait may be increasing.  </P> <P> These views appear to be at odds with widespread speculation in Washington and  elsewhere that the failure of the embargo -- not its success -- could result in  a U.S.-Saudi move into Kuwait.  </P> <P> The Iraqi defectors are coming in -- in tanks and armored personnel carriers --  at the rate of 50 to 100 a day in the western sector, said Brig. Gen. Mohammed  Shehri, the Saudi army officer in charge of logistics for the Arab troops here.  </P> <P> "We learned from what we saw that they are really in a very poor condition,"  Shehri said. "They don't know the terrain, and there is no help from the  Kuwaitis or Bedouins."  </P> <P> Judging by the state of the equipment brought over by the defectors, the  general said, "I really don't think they can use all their tanks."  </P> <P> Most of the defectors are enlisted men, and their morale is low, according to  Saudi officers. But Gen. Shehri said that some of the defectors are  lieutenants, captains and majors.  </P> <P> Many defecting troops say they were told on Aug. 1, the day before Iraq's  invasion of Kuwait, that they were going to Kuwait to drill with forces of the  Gulf Cooperation Council, which is made up of the six countries on the Arabian  Peninsula. Others said they were told they were going to attack Israel via  Kuwait.  </P> <P> Several officials said that the chemical weapons protection gear the Iraqi  soldiers are carrying is old and probably ineffective..  </P> <P> This prompted Shehri to suggest that there is more bluster than reality to the  much-feared Iraqi threat to use chemical weapons against troops.  </P> <P> "I think it's more for propaganda," he said. "They will have problems first  before we do."  </P> <P> Despite the Iraqis' mounting supply problems, the Arab troops arrayed across  Saudi Arabia are a lightly armed force that U.S. officers describe as a "trip  wire." Its mission, according to Saudi military officials, is to delay the  advance of an Iraqi offensive for about four hours while U.S. forces move up  from the rear.  </P> <P> The Arab force is also designed to help channel tanks into "killing zones"  where the Saudis and their allies would concentrate their tanks and anti-tank  weapons to even the odds.  </P> <P> In doing so, however, Saudi Arabia's Arab and Muslim forces would likely have  major problems. For example, Egypt, which is contributing one of the larger  Arab forces, has never conducted exercises with its new Arab military allies.  </P> <P> Also, the nine national forces operating here -- soon to be 10 with the arrival  of Pakistani troops -- use a variety of different -- and sometimes incompatible  -- weapons and equipment. In combat, this would further complicate the  difficult task of supply.  </P> <P> As a result, as the 30,000 or so Arab troops take up defensive positions near  the Kuwaiti border, the question arises: Do they have enough tanks to blunt  even an Iraqi offensive debilitated by morale and supply problems?  </P> <P> "Inshallah (God willing), we can," said Col. Abdul Aziz Bedawi, a Saudi tank  commander. "Inshallah, we have enough tanks."  </P> <P> But facing a larger force across the flat, featureless desert, the Saudis and  their Arab allies are counting on air power to delay an Iraqi advance.  </P> <P> "When he becomes tired, exhausted, during the day, we will have a field day,"  said a captain who commands a helicopter unit. "When he comes at night, the air  force will take care of him."  </P> <P> Among Arab forces, however, that is as close to boasting as the officers get.  There is among Saudi and other Arab forces little of the bluster found among  some American troops.  </P> <P> "Our mission is to enhance the defensive capabilities and help defend Saudi  territories . . . to defend the holy places (Mecca and Medina)," said Maj. Gen.  Mohammed Bilal, commander of the Egyptian forces in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> The Egyptian forces consist of paratroopers and anti-tank commandos, and a  Saudi official said that if an Iraqi offensive comes, the Egyptian troops will  likely be dropped behind the Iraqi tanks to disrupt their supply lines.  </P> <P> Although Saudi and other Arab officers sought to minimize the offensive option,  several said that if Iraqi troops do come across, the Arab commanders will  launch a counteroffensive aimed at liberating Kuwait.  </P> <P> But U.S. officers said it is more likely that the Arab forces will back up the  American lines as the American forces move north.  </P></p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Judge's 'hands tied' on MoD plea A judge yesterday admitted his 'hands were tied' over seven test appeals brought by the government against large compensation awards to former servicewomen dismissed after becoming pregnant. Mr Justice Morison said he was aware of public disquiet over more than 2,000 awards already made against the Ministry of Defence - some of which have been six-figure sums - but there was little he could do as far as the cases before him were concerned. On the final day of an Employment Appeals Tribunal in London, the judge said his freedom to reduce the awards was limited by the way the MoD had conducted its case. The hearing was told that an 'all or nothing' approach had been used in making many of the original awards but the ministry had not made that a ground of its appeal. The judge said the tribunal could only deal with points at issue in the appeal. The awards came after the MoD breached European legislation by forcing pregnant women to leave the services. The tribunal's ruling is expected before the end of the month.</p>

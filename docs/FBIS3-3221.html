			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 17 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Financial and  Economic Committee [FEC] of the National People's Congress [NPC]  -- after completing deliberations on the "Report on the  Implementation of the 1993 Plan for National Economic and Social  Development and the Draft 1994 Plan" delivered by Chen Jinhua,  minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, on behalf  of the State Council -- believes that the guiding idea,  principle, and key points of the 1994 national economic and  social development plan are correct and that measures put forth  therein are feasible. The FEC recommended that the "Report on  the Implementation of the 1993 Plan for National Economic and  Social Development and the Draft 1994 Plan" delivered by Chen  Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, be  approved and a draft 1994 plan for national economic and social  development be adopted. In the process of carrying out the  national plan, any partial adjustment of the plan necessitated  by major changes of the circumstances has to be reported in  advance to the NPC Standing Committee for examination and  approval.    The examination report points out: In 1993, people of all  nationalities across the country -- under the guidance of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, the party's basic line, and the  guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and in accordance  with the guidelines of the First Plenary Session of the Eighth  NPC -- worked in unity and scored major progress in economic  construction, reform and opening up. The national economy  registered sustained growth, a good harvest was recorded in  agriculture, and grain output grew continuously. Industrial  production maintained a rather high growth rate and state plans  for major products were fulfilled. A number of key construction  projects and technical upgrading projects of the state were  completed and put into operation. The market at home and abroad  was brisk, income in both urban and rural areas grew, and living  standards continued to improve. China's opening up continued to  advance to higher levels and expanded in all directions and in  all domains. There was a sharp rise in the utilization of  foreign capital and further progress was achieved in science and  technology, education, and other social undertakings.    The report believes that in spite of the progress, there are  some problems meriting our attention. The major ones are:  Insufficient capacity for sustained growth in agriculture,  grain production in particular; a rather sharp drop in cotton  output; an overly large volume of investment in fixed assets;  irrational structures; slow progress in industrial  restructuring; a worsening of "bottleneck" restraints regarding  some infrastructure facilities and basic industries, with a  large proportion of enterprises operating in the red and with  large deficits; high inflation; and an import growth rate higher  than that of export. We must take these problems seriously and  conscientiously solve them in the new year.    The FEC offered the following suggestions for the smooth  implementation of the 1994 plan:    1. Extend every effort to strengthen and improve  macroeconomic regulation and control in order to ensure  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national  economy.    2. Continue to develop the rural economy in an  all-round way and protect peasants' economic interests.    3. Continue efforts to improve economic efficiency.    4. Exercise strict control over the volume of  investment in fixed assets and optimize the investment pattern.    5. Maintain tight control on credit volume and  issuance of currency.    6. Strictly control inflation and display genuine  concern for the people's livelihood.    7. Properly solve some of the problems in science and  technology, education, culture, public health, other social  undertakings about which the people care.    The report points out: The tasks of reform, opening up, and  economic development in 1994 are onerous. New situations and  new problems are bound to arise in our march forward. Favorable  conditions, however, also abound. In order to successfully  accomplish the various tasks, we must unify our thinking in line  with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, the party's basic line, the guidelines  of the 14th CPC National Congress, and the decision adopted at  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and  seize and take full advantage of the opportunity. Government at  all levels must further mobilize the initiative of the masses,  get them mobilized and organized, and get them to understand and  support reform with the utmost enthusiasm and plunge themselves  into the great practice of reform. Leading cadres at all levels  must work with one heart and one mind, set a good example, work  hard and do solid work, tell the truth, provide real services,  and guard against going through the motions or doing things for  appearance's sake. We must go deeply into the realities of  life, maintain close contact with the masses, serve the people  wholeheartedly, and strive for the successful accomplishment of  the 1994 Plan for National Economic and Social Development.</p>

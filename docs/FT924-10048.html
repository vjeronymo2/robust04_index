			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Caricom to cut external tariffs The Caribbean Community (Caricom) has agreed to reduce the top level of the common external tariff from 45 per cent to 30-35 per cent, writes Canute James in Port of Spain. Caricom's 13 member states will introduce the lower tariff between January 1 and June 30 next year. The top rate will be further reduced to 25-30 per cent by 1995, falling to 20-25 per cent by 1997. The tariff cut, agreed in Trinidad, has angered regional businesses, which want continued protection. The US has sought more substantial and immediate cuts. The new tariff structure is aimed at satisfying deep divisions among community members over tariff levels.</p>

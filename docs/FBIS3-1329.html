Addressing the party's first anniversary  meeting on Thursday [25 March], Mr Dumbutshena said the  government was derailing the noble cause of giving land to the  homeless by allocating land instead to senior officials of the  ruling ZANU [Zimbabwe African National Union] (PF [Patriotic  Front]) Party.    The government last month announced it would lease  designated  farms to individuals. Tenants would be resettled because some  designated farms would be put to best use if not divided into  smallholdings. But so far senior government officials, including  cabinet ministers, have benefited most from the programme.    About 110,000 rural families are still waiting to be  resettled on five million hectares of land which the government  has yet to acquire, the ZIANA news agency reported.    FPZ Vice-President Washington Sansole said the resettlement  programme was a failure. He said the government rushed to give  people land, but failed to provide roads, schools, clinics or  water supplies. Mr Sansole said some government officials  benefiting from the tenant resettlement programme had  "absolutely no idea about farming" and treated the farms as  holiday resorts.</p>

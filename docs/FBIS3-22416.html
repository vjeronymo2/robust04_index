			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from "NHK News 7" program] </F>   [Text] In Russia, radioactive waste has been leaking from  tankers, and the storage of radioactive waste is in a dangerous  state. The Russian Pacific Fleet has made a request for  Japanese Government financial aid to construct ground facilities  for its storage. The request was conveyed during an interview  with two officers of the Russian Pacific Fleet by NHK's  Vladivostok bureau. [begin recording]    Danilyan, captain 1st rank, chief of the Radioactive  and Chemical Defense Operations Department: Since this is a  decommissioned tanker, we suspect that what we already have are  micro leaks. In other words, radioactive waste leaks out and  settles on the bottom of Bolshoy Kamen Bay. We suspect this is  so. [end recording].    [Begin recording]    Chishisenko, captain 1st rank, chief engineer of the  Technology Bureau: Therefore, we believe the waste should  be transferred to other containers in the shortest time  possible. [end recording].    In connection with this, the Russian Pacific Fleet plans to  construct by May this year ground facilities to store liquid  radioactive waste at Sysoyevo Bay in the eastern part of  Vladivostok, and other ground facilities to dispose of  radioactive waste at Bolshoy Kamen Bay where tankers are  presently berthed.    The Russian Pacific Fleet, which estimates the cost of  constructing the facilities at around $50 million, wants the  Japanese Government to provide financial aid. The Russian  Pacific Fleet feels a strong sense of crisis as the Russian  Government is not showing any eagerness to use funds from Japan  to resolve the radioactive storage issue.    The request comes shortly before Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata's 19 March visit to Moscow. It is believed to be aimed at  explaining the situation to the Japanese Government before he  arrives in Moscow.</p>

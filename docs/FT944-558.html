			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Hijack drama gives Balladur poll boost: PM's standing enhanced but France faces growing threat from Algerian war Mr Edouard Balladur yesterday resumed his holiday in the Alps to weigh the bitter-sweet implications of France's Christmas hijack drama. His own standing as prime minister and presidential hopeful has been enhanced. But his country has been dragged towards the frontline of Algeria's civil war and faces further threats from the torment of its former colony. In ordering security forces to storm an Air France airliner, which had been seized on Christmas Eve by Islamic opponents of Algeria's military-backed regime, Mr Balladur threw off his cautious image. Monday evening's operation, in which the 169 passengers were rescued, was widely hailed as a success for a premier hitherto dogged by a reputation for prevarication and concessions. 'France received its own Action Man for Christmas', said one diplomat. 'He has succeeded in the first major crisis he has faced since he took office.' For the prime minister, the timing is significant. Within the next few weeks he is expected to declare his candidacy for presidential elections due in the spring. The decision earlier this month by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, not to run as Socialist candidate, left Mr Balladur favourite to succeed Mr Francois Mitterrand. The outcome of the hostage crisis will further strengthen his hand. Satisfaction, however, will be tempered by the implications of the hijacking, the most daring assault yet on foreign interests by Islamic opponents of the Algerian regime. The attack underlines the risks inherent in French policy towards its former colony and the growing threat of the civil war spilling into France. 'For the first time since the Algerian war of independence we are seeing Algerian terrorism on French soil,' said one Paris university professor. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, has warned that the violence in Algeria is set to continue and that France will step up security measures. Air links between the two countries have been suspended as a result of the hijacking. France's policy has brought it increasingly into conflict with opponents of the Algiers regime. Since the cancellation in 1992 of elections which the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win, France has provided support and financial backing for the government to try to contain the conflict. This stance reflects a series of concerns. In particular, Paris is eager to avoid a flood of refugees, swelling the ranks of the 1m or so Algerians already living in France, fueling immigration tensions and playing into the hands of extreme-right politicians such as Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, head of the National Front. Mr Juppe, like his counterparts in London and Washington, has sought to promote a negotiated solution. But this has been overshadowed by the hardline approach of Mr Charles Pasqua, the powerful interior minister, who has launched a series of crackdowns on Moslem fundamentalists in France. In November, for example, Mr Pasqua claimed to have broken a support group for Algerian guerrillas following a dawn swoop which netted 90 suspected Islamic radicals. Mr Pasqua's actions appear to have public backing. But they have drawn France into the firing line of Algerian Islamists, in particular the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), the most militant of the forces opposed to the Algerian regime of President Liamine Zeroual. The GIA claimed responsibility for the hijacking, describing the action as a response to the military and financial aid to the Algerian government. Such hostility will only be heightened by the killing of the four hijackers. As one diplomat in Paris put it; 'France has shown that it will act tough. This could dissuade further attacks. But it could equally bring reprisals.' With its policy of containment under strain, France is being pushed to reconsider its relationship with the Algerian government. Mr Juppe denied it was considering a policy shift, but he talked of tensions with the Algerian government during the hostage crisis and sought to distance France from close support for the regime. 'We are not backing a regime or a government. . . . the only side we are backing is that of democracy,' he said. 'This message is directed to the Islamists as well as to those who back the policy of all out repression.' France may now try to step up its contacts with Algeria's Moslem groups in an attempt to ease tensions and break the deadlock in Algiers. Sources in Paris say the government has already sought to influence the FIS through discussions in Tehran and Khartoum. There are limits, however, on how far France seems prepared to move. According to Mr Juppe, democratic forces have still to emerge with a political platform in Algeria. In the meantime, he said, France and the international community should provide financial aid to the Algerian people to avoid 'chaos'. However, such economic support, which has totalled about FFr38bn (Pounds 4.5bn) in 1994, is fiercely opposed by the Islamic fundamentalists. They believe the financial assistance is propping up the regime and reject France's assertion of impartiality. A further obstacle to French strategy is lack of progress in seeking a democratic solution to Algeria's woes. In November, President Zeroual promised elections by the end of 1995. But the offer was rejected by militants, who have pledged to continue their armed struggle. Fighting has escalated sharply since negotiations broke down in the autumn. The increased ferocity of the civil war has played into the hands of radicals who are more willing to go beyond Algeria in pursuit of their struggle. The Air France hijacking has sent a warning to Paris in particular. Despite the events of the past few days Mr Balladur has not been rescued from the Algerian crisis. Editorial comment, Page 13</p>

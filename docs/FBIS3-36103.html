[Shushkevich] The reasons were quite aptly formulated by  numerous commentators: The restoration of nomenklatura power.  The formal pretexts simply do not stand up to criticism:  Anyone who has seen my ordinary dacha, which I began to build  with my own hands, knows that not by the remotest stretch of the  imagination can it be termed "personal vanity."    It is something else that surprises me: I managed to work on  for 18 months after the disposition of forces in the Belarusian  parliament had become obvious, where the majority did not need a  democrat or centrist as a speaker.    [Yuferova] Politics are a tough team game. You did not have  your own party, your own faction in parliament, or even, they  say, your own team. Are you a lone politician?    [Shushkevich] I could not make the majority think  differently  but some newcomers started to think like me -- and that is good  for our power inclined toward old convictions. I have always  had complete mutual understanding with politicians from stable  democratic countries.    I was a political romantic; I had no political support among  the social strata; some of the intelligentsia understood me.  The trouble is that the mass media in our country are entirely  in the hands of those who actually rule and have now finally  taken all power. The first organizational meeting of the  present government was held by the first secretary of the  Communist Party of Belarus Central Committee; this government  has in fact brought the republic's economy to its knees. The  legislative base for the transition to the market, although it  is not the best base, has nonetheless been created.    [Yuferova] But does it not seem to you that the rapid  deterioration of the people's life, galloping inflation, also  voted against the head of state?    [Shushkevich] Not a single parliament can neglect  production. Through the will of the government not a single  market mechanism is operating in our country. The state cannot  pay two-thirds of their wages to 50 percent of the plants for  the umpteenth month when people are doing nothing. We are  consuming our fixed capital, everything which our predecessors  accumulated.    No one from outside will rectify our own stupidity. They can  help, but they cannot cure us from the outside.    [Yuferova] Stanislav Stanislavovich, in that case should the  Russian ruble fulfill its "international duty" on Belarusian  territory? Many economists in Moscow are less than delighted,  to put it mildly, in connection with the union of the two  states' monetary systems. For some people the ruble zone will  simply be a zone....    [Shushkevich] Nothing threatens the Russian ruble for a  reason which has already been cited: The majority of  enterprises are out of it -- that means we should not expect an  eruption of inflation. Our neighbors' empty coffers present no  danger. The complication will lie in the mutual settling of  accounts. The Russian ruble will help but will not lead us out  of the impasse. What difference will it make: There used to be  no Belarusian rubles, now there will be no Russian rubles. In  my view the unification of the two monetary systems is becoming  more problematical with every passing day.    [Yuferova] What was the reaction in the republic to your  resignation?    [Shushkevich] I remember a well-known anecdote: Khrushchev  was at home shortly after being sent into retirement when his  telephone rang. He lifted the receiver: "Hello, at your  service." And he heard in reply: "In the past you had to be of  service, but now you can come downstairs with us to play  dominoes." So what can I say now.... There is a pile of  reassuring telegrams, there are people who support me, there are  my friends and my family.    [Yuferova] Was there any official or unofficial reaction  from Moscow or Kiev? After all the three Belovezhskaya Forest  "bison" -- Yeltsin, Kravchuk, and Shushkevich -- crossed the  Viskuli [reference unknown] together into history.    [Shushkevich] No. A resignation is a state's internal  affair. And the conservation of friendly relations is our  personal business.    [Yuferova] How did the rumor appear that Shumeyko had  offered you the post of chairman of the CIS countries'  interparliamentary assembly?    [Shushkevich] I have nothing to do with it. The rumor was  obviously generated by ignorant people. According to the  established rules, only an acting head can head the assembly.    [Yuferova] Who is your successor, elected recently as head  of the Belarusian parliament?    [Shushkevich] Myechyslaw Ivanovich Hryb, a retired  lieutenant general, headed the national security commission in  the parliament, and I once even asked him to be my deputy. And  even now I do not cast doubt on his fitting human qualities.  Let us see how he does in this position although it is an open  secret that a disposition of forces convenient to the government  is taking shape in parliament. I should like to wish him  success in establishing Belarusian statehood.    [Yuferova] There is a feeling that the present speaker is  temporary. No analyst predicted this figure's appearance on the  political Olympus.    [Shushkevich] That is a problem for the analysts, not for  the speaker now chosen. At the sessions there was frequent talk  on the subject but early parliamentary elections were not in  fact scheduled (the deputies are utterly reluctant to part with  their mandates acquired in the USSR). According to the existing  Constitution this parliament has one year and two months to work  -- until new elections in March 1995.    [Yuferova] If Belarus decides on presidential elections,  will you run?    [Shushkevich] For the time being I shall say just one thing:  I do not intend to leave political life.    [Yuferova] But considering past mistakes you cannot  seriously count on anything as a lone politician. On whom do  you intend to rely in the future?    [Shushkevich] Give me two weeks to think. At present it is  the fashion to play numerous parts, I want to retain my  convictions.    [Yuferova] How have you spent these difficult days since  your resignation, who has been by your side?    [Shushkevich] To be honest, I wanted to be quite alone, in  the sticks, at my dacha. But it did not work out that way.  Close friends have arrived and now I have my daughter, my  son-in-law, and my dog Kuzka with me. I regret not having gone  to the writers' center today to bid farewell to Ales  Mikhaylovich Adamovich. I did not have time. It is 3 km to the  local station and another 50 km to Minsk. And my 1983 Zhiguli  would not start.    [Yuferova] Stanislav Stanislavovich, it seems to me there is  actually another reason here. It is not that simple to mingle  with people in a different capacity even at a time of grief.    [Shushkevich] Perhaps there is some truth there.... Ales  Adamovich was a man of great principle and honesty.    The people and rulers should have been proud of such a son,  but he was obliged to spend the past six years in his favorite  foreign land -- Russia. Sometimes a man has to die to be  understood in his own Fatherland. How painful it was to learn  that when Bulat Okudzhava last came to Minsk there was a crowd  which abused him. That is our shame, that is the same crew  which drove Adamovich from the republic.    [Yuferova] Your immediate plans?    [Shushkevich] Over the past few years I have taken virtually  no leave; I will finally enjoy this right and then continue work  in parliament as a deputy.    [Yuferova] Have you not thought of the destiny of the  professors who went straight from meetings into big-league  politics: Akayev, Ter-Petrosyan, Khasbulatov, Landsbergis,  Popov, Shushkevich. Can a scholar change profession in his  maturity without personal drama? What is your personal  experience?    [Shushkevich] The need to understand the thrust of a  phenomenon, the need to focus efforts on a specific avenue leads  some people to victory, others to resignation. Most likely here  it is a case not of their profession but of the size of their  personality. [Shushkevich ends]    Shushkevich gave this interview over the telephone on Sunday  evening while he was at his dacha near Minsk, of which even  PRAVDA, always biased against the former speaker, wrote that the  parliamentary commission's claims looked ridiculously inadequate.    They settled accounts with him over a different subject.</p>

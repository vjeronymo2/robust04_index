			<p>BFN     [Text] In a speedy reaction, the UN secretary general and  the Security Council have condemned the martyrdom-seeking action  of a revolutionary Muslim Palestinian at 'Afula.    The representative of Hamas, the Islamic Resistance  Movement,  in Tehran described the stance of the UN Security Council as  spiteful. He said: This proves that the Palestinian nation  should not expect sympathy from the United Nations or the  Security Council, because they have always remained silent in  the face of the daily murder of Palestinian women and children  by the Zionists.</p>

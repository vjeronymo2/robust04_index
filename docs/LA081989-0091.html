			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CELEBRATING HAWAII'S STATEHOOD;  </P> <P> A GREAT LUAU DEPENDS ONLY ON THE HOSTESS'S IMAGINATION  </P> <P> Although it seems like any excuse would do for a luau, such tropical-themed  outdoor celebrations should be in full bloom this weekend, because Monday is  the 30th anniversary of Hawaii's statehood.  </P> <P> With plenty of resources at local party-favor shops and ethnic grocery stores  -- perhaps catering to the 150,000 estimated Hawaiians in Los Angeles --  Angelenos can easily bring a little of the 50th state into their neck of the  tropics. Just fill up the back yard or patio with flowers, palms and lots of  greenery, and bring a little ingenuity, an easy, hang-loose attitude and plenty  of aloha, which translates into "love" as well as "hello" and "goodby."  </P> <P> "It (a luau) is our way of being together, sharing with loved ones and just  having a good time," said Loretta Mangold, an organizer of luau shows for 20  years, who hosts elaborate ones of her own. "It's very relaxed; living is much  slower. The people are always close to nature -- the sand and the ocean."  </P> <P> With Los Angeles about 2,500 miles from the islands, luaus here may be of a  more mainland variety.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'You Have to Adapt  </P> <P> "You have to adapt to whatever's available in your environment," said Honolulu  native Carmen Postrzech, co-founder and president of the 18-year-old San  Fernando Valley Hawaiian Club.  </P> <P> According to Mangold, whose Playa del Rey patio is decked with papayas,  plumerias, a macadamia nut tree, ginger, taro, a ti bush and other exotic  plants native to the islands, "You can't have too many decorations --  especially greenery."  </P> <P> First, scout your yard and the yards of your friendly neighbors for flowers and  shrubbery, or visit a flower shop or the downtown flower mart. While  carnations, Boston ferns, gardenias and orchids are the most tropic-like, Doris  Keawe, luau chairwoman for the Wilmington-based L.A. Polynesian Society,  insists that "whatever you can get your hands on is fine." Yellow hibiscus is  the state flower of Hawaii, but Postrzech doesn't recommend them for evening  luaus because "they close at the end of the day."  </P> <P> One might also visit a party-goods or stationery store for invitations to match  the tropical theme, along with napkins and plates. Other luau paper novelties  include cardboard cut-outs of hula dancers and palm trees, and crepe-paper  sculptures of pineapples and ribbonfish. And, one shouldn't forget those  ubiquitous plastic floral leis and garlands. Bananas, coconuts, mangos and  papayas make great table centerpieces, especially when arranged inside  pineapple or coconut halves used as fruit bowls. Wicker baskets also make  tropical-looking fruit containers. (The bowls can be filled with diced fruit  speared by colorful toothpicks.) Other creative decorations include sea shells,  which look great in fish netting or as ashtrays.  </P> <P> One might set out souvenirs brought back from Hawaii, such as shell necklaces,  ukeleles or drums. Lily pads and other floating plants can line the swimming  pool.  </P> <P> Tiki and wooden ornaments, as well as anything made of bamboo or wicker, "makes  it look really Polynesian," says Keawe, who moved to Los Angeles from Honolulu  in 1949.  </P> <P> For a warm nighttime glow, install bamboo posts with tiki torches and place  colored-glass lanterns on tables. The more ambitious might want to construct a  little grass hut over the bar area and draft a bartender who can whip up fruity  tropical drinks.  </P> <P> A luau is a feast, so eating should rank high among the festivities. The food  can be as ethnically mixed as the Hawaiians themselves, with elements from  various countries.  </P> <P> "A lot of people have adapted menus to their own taste," Postrzech said. "There  are a lot of (Hawaiian) dishes people here don't eat," Meat, often roast pork,  short ribs or chicken, is usually cooked teriyaki-style or grilled as kebabs.  Side dishes might include rice and sweet potatoes.  </P> <P> Those who want a more Hawaiian flair may try the trademark staple: poi, the  mushy, grayish goo that looks like papier-mache paste (it's made from the root  of the taro plant and mixed with water). But Hawaiians themselves admit it's  bland and takes an acquired taste, even when sweetened with cream or sugar.  Other Hawaiian dishes include lomi lomi salmon (fish marinated with green  onions and tomatoes) and saimin (wheat noodles in broth). Coconut pudding or  sheet cake is the dessert de rigueur. Poo poos (hors d'oeuvres) may consist of  sweet breads, fruit salad and madacamia nuts, one of Hawaii's main exports.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ultimate Delicacy  </P> <P> Traditionalists may want to serve the ultimate Hawaiian delicacy, a kalua pig,  which is roasted underground in a pit over lava rocks. Preparation takes more  than a day and is undoubtedly a lot of work. Postrzech, who now cooks hers in  an oven, said: "It got to be too much of a hassle. You can't get lava rocks  here unless you bring them back from Hawaii."  </P> <P> Keawe, who owns a Hawaiian-style restaurant in Wilmington with her husband,  Joe, advises hosts to order the pig from a restaurant or caterer.  </P> <P> Clothing is casual and colorful; women wear the roomy muumuus or midriffs with  sarongs (floral-print wraparound skirts), and men wear loose wildflower shirts  and shorts. Or, Mangold suggests, good-humored guests may opt to look like  tourists in Hawaii, with white pants, straw hats, sunglasses -- and leis or  cameras around their necks. Children might want to dress up as hula dancers,  with grass skirts, leis and flowers in their hair.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hawaiian Hospitality  </P> <P> Just as vacationers to Hawaii are greeted with flower leis, your guests can be  greeted with "aloha," and then draped with a lei. "When you present someone  with a lei, always with a kiss, always," emphasized Postrzech, who attends  about 10 luaus a year. Guests can be made to feel like kings walking between  feathered staffs, which represent royalty, on each side of the entryway.  </P> <P> Entertainment, which often tells the story of Hawaii, can range from one  performer dancing to taped music to a 10-person choreographed troupe  accompanied by a four-piece band. It all depends on your budget and how much  you want to impress. Elaborate bands typically include a steel guitar, drums,  the ever-present ukelele (which is Hawaiian for "jumping flea") and a Hawaiian  vocalist a la Don Ho.  </P> <P> Hula dancers, who move like swaying palms to the beat of the drum, demonstrate  dances and costumes of all the islands, with props including drums, feather  gourds and bamboo sticks. For extra excitement, some male Samoan dancers  perform with fire and knives, twirling and flipping their props into the air  like jugglers and touching hot fire to their tongues and feet. Troupes, which  typically perform half-hour to one-hour shows, should be booked three months in  advance during the high-demand summer. Check regional magazines, the Yellow  Pages under "Entertainers."  </P> <P> This time of year, one might hear a verse of Hawaii's national song, "Hawaii  Pono'i," which means "Hawaii, together, we stand."  </P> <P> Hawaiian decorations and clothing:  </P> <P> Murakami's, 1975 Portero Grande Drive, Monterey Park 91754, (818) 571-0711.  </P> <P> Oriental Gifts, 10770 W.

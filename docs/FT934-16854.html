			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Nothing to fear from Nafta: America Nothing better illustrates America's loss of self confidence than the hysterical opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). It seems scarcely believable that the world's greatest economic power - the founder of the liberal global trading system - should be leery of a free trade pact with impoverished Mexico, whose economy represents only 4 per cent of US gross domestic product. Yet the fears are real and are being expertly fanned by such canny political operators as Mr Pat Buchanan on the Republican right, Mr Ross Perot, the Texan billionaire, and Mr Richard Gephardt, the popular Democratic congressional leader. President Bill Clinton is now backing Nafta, although not with the passion he brings, say, to healthcare reform. But if Congress fails to ratify the agreement in December, he will bear much of the blame. He was passive during the spring and summer while opposition to Nafta steadily gathered momentum. He equivocated during last year's election campaign, refusing wholeheartedly to support President Bush's initiative. Just as significant, by talking constantly of US economic decline, he helped create the national mood of economic insecurity that lies behind opposition to Nafta. Every time his campaign jet touched down, he reminded voters they were 'working harder for less' as a result of the failure of Reagan/Bush policies. As a political strategy, Mr Clinton's declinist rhetoric paid off handsomely. But it was never well supported by the facts. Between 1980 and 1992, US GDP rose 32 per cent in real terms - hardly a sign that tougher foreign competition was undermining living standards. This was not fuelled solely by population growth: after allowing for inflation, per capita personal disposable incomes rose more than 18 per cent. The distribution of income did grow somewhat more unequal in the 1980s, but most boats were lifted by this tide of prosperity. It was only the unskilled - mainly young high school drop-outs - who experienced a significant absolute decline in wages. As a nation the US thus has nothing to fear, and much to gain, from a lowering of barriers to trade and foreign investment. It is not even certain that low-skilled US workers will be adversely affected. Professor Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University points out that foreign competition can only reduce US wages if it first reduces the prices of goods produced with unskilled labour. He claims there is little evidence of downward pressure on prices and therefore blames falling real wages at the bottom end on other factors, such as rapid technological change. If this sounds counter-intuitive, remember that as incomes in developing countries rise, so does their demand for goods produced in industrial countries. The negative impact on wages from an increased global supply of low-skilled labour has to be balanced against a positive 'income' effect, reflecting higher global demand for goods and services. Some of the detailed econometric analyses of Nafta support the Bhagwati thesis, claiming that it will raise the wages even of unskilled US workers because of positive demand effects. But even if intensified competition does put downward pressure on the wages of unskilled US workers, it is extraordinary that so many leading public figures, including a majority of congressional Democrats, appear to believe the solution lies in protection. There is a strong economic case for responding by improving education and training for the low-skilled and by extending financial relief through the tax system, as the Clinton administration did in the budget through its expansion of the earned income tax credit. But to try to narrow opportunities for trade and foreign investment on the grounds that some groups will lose out is to inveigh against capitalism itself. The domestic equivalent of fighting Nafta is to argue that companies should not be allowed to move from California to Utah, in case reduced labour costs enable them to become more efficient. Mr Clinton, admittedly, has rejected overt forms of protection. He says the US should embrace change and create the jobs of tomorrow rather than try to 'preserve the economic structures of yesterday'. But his commitment to market principles is skin deep. The whole point of trade is to benefit from your neighbour's comparative advantages which, in Mexico's case, include relatively low wages. Yet Mr Clinton is proudly pointing out that this is the first trade agreement to insist that the poorer country gradually raise its wage rates toward those in the richer nation. With this clause he is pandering to the same special interests as Nafta opponents; his tactics are just more subtle. Yet in a strange way, Mexico holds the key to Nafta. Unless the US Congress comes to its senses, Mexico faces a serious political rebuff. But although it cannot force the US to sign up it can unilaterally introduce many Nafta provisions, for example by cutting tariffs further and by liberalising rules for US direct investment. It already enjoys pretty unrestricted access to the US domestic market. This would be the ultimate humiliation for the US: to be informed by its economically sophisticated neighbour that it can take advantage of opportunities it is too frightened to demand.</p>

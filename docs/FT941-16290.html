			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Observer: Sticky wicket It never pays to upset your stockbroker, at least not in India. G V Ramakrishna, chairman of India's Securities and Exchange board - the government's watchdog - has been replaced by Shirish Nadkarni, a former test cricketer. Ramakrishna's 'promotion' to the National Planning Commission was greeted with jubilation by stockbrokers and caused the new year markets to soar. The outgoing chairman, whose five-year term was cut short by more than a year, was highly unpopular with brokers. At one stage they went on strike for a week protesting at a ban on forward trading transactions. They claimed Ramakrishna didn't understand the markets and was prone to excessive nit-picking. By contrast, Nadkarni is seen as much more 'industry-friendly'. A former chairman of the Industrial Development Bank of India, he heads the State Bank of India's asset management company, as well as being the sheriff of Bombay. He's also chairman of the National Stock Exchange. How very cosy.</p>

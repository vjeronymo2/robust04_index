			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY'S REDISTRICTING CASE AND EDELMAN'S APPROACH TO POLITICS  </P> <P> In describing the unconscionable and arrogant conduct of Supervisors Deane  Dana, Pete Schabarum and Michael Antonovich, Domanick's article is a lucid  illustration of why the voters of Malibu on June 6 overwhelmingly voted to  become a city.  </P> <P> And, his statement is correct that everyone even vaguely familiar with the  workings of the Board of Supervisors is either choking with outrage or shaking  their heads in bemusement.  </P> <P> Our voters undoubtedly felt outrage. It took these three supervisors to get the  voters in Malibu finally to approve cityhood -- something they had rejected  three times in past years. Although it is hard to envision right now, maybe  history will show through their abusive excesses they were Malibu's best  friends, after all.  </P> <P> TOM RINGER  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

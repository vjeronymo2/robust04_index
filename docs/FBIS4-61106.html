			<p>BFN     [Text] A conference of NATO's defense ministers and  ministers of defense of the former Warsaw Pact alliance will be  held in Brussels at the end of May. The conference will examine  the issues of NATO's Partnership for Peace program. Anatoliy  Potapov now comments on Russia's attitude to the program.    Lately many politicians from the NATO member countries have  turned their attention to Russia's delay in joining the NATO  Partnership for Peace program. Sometimes some of them even  allow themselves to come to such a conclusion that Russia is  after all not going to join the NATO program.    Now let us examine the real issues at stake. It should be  remembered that there is a single document that must be signed  by each state that has embraced NATO's program. This is the  first stage of joining the program. Moscow has no fundamental  disagreements with this single document that spells out in  general terms NATO's Partnership for Peace program.    Even though Russian experts have on several occasions  pointed  to the document's nebulous character and its perfunctoriness,  this is of course a general declaration of intentions. It is  the second stage of the program that is very important: the  handing over of a so-called presentation document to NATO.    In this document it is written in black and white what  exactly each country expects from the program and what  contributions are expected from each state -- that is, the  rights and obligations of member states of the NATO's  partnership program.    Moscow believes that the first stage -- the signing of the  single document -- is a mere formality that represents no  binding obligation. The crux and the concrete content of the  partnership program is embedded in the second stage. The  planned partnership and the scope and scale of the proposed  agreement are clearly spelled out in this second document.    Experts in Moscow are now working on this second document to  determine clearly all the aspects of the partnership program in  order to make it abundantly clear to Russia and to NATO. Russia  may sign the little, single document -- that is, the first  stage. It may similarly propose in its place a more capacious  and concrete agreement. The most important thing is that Moscow  is not moving or shying away from the NATO program, but on the  contrary would want to establish a solid base for its signing.    In preparing the draft of such an agreement, Russia hopes to  consult NATO. This, of course, will take time, but then the  working program of the partnership would be harmonized in  reality and would be very solid.    Why is Russia now giving such minute and detailed attention  to the hammering out of the draft of the future agreement?  Because it should contain certain Russian-specific points,  certain Russian interests. It should be noted that no other  European country invited to join the program possesses such huge  and powerful nuclear weapons as Russia. Neither [as heard] of  them has the same weight and influence in the world arena like  Russia does, and none of them has the same geopolitical  peculiarities as Russia. That's why Moscow would want these  basic conditions and peculiarities taken into account in  planning the partnership program.    Therefore, it is not the formal time of joining the NATO's  partnership program which matters. The issue is that the  partnership between Russia and NATO should be real: equal in  reality and in the interests of a stable and permanent European  security.</p>

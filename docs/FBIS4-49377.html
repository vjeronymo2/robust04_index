			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, May 5 (XINHUA) -- China joined the Nice  agreement of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)  on Thursday [5 May] to internationalize its trademark system.    The agreement, known as "The Agreement on the International  Classification of Goods and Services for Trademark  Registration," was first established in 1957 and is the major  instrument of WIPO.    Tang Yufeng, deputy representative of the Chinese mission to  the UN in Geneva, presented a protocol for entry to Arpad  Bogsch, director-general of WIPO.    Since joining WIPO in 1980, China has signed nearly all  international agreements protecting intellectual property rights.    Bogsch said that a special meeting will be held for the  entry  of Chinese products into international trademark registration.    The Nice agreement now has 36 signatory members.</p>

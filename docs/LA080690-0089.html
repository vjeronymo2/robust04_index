			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> PARAMEDIC PROVIDER ADDS 3 MOBILE UNITS  </P> <P> Pruner Health Services, a private company contracted by Ventura County to  provide ambulance service to the east county, has added three mobile paramedic  units, a company spokesman said.  </P> <P> The vehicles contain life-support equipment, such as fibrillation units and  cardiac monitors, and are available 24 hours a day, said Doug Greenfield,  Pruner's director of support services.  </P> <P> The company has ambulance stations in Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Camarillo and  just outside Moorpark.  </P> <P> Pruner's Chief Administrative Officer Steve Murphy said growth within the  company's service area does not warrant a fifth ambulance station, but the  mobile units will handle an increase in demand.  </P> <P> The units provide "more treatment on the scene without tying up a whole  ambulance station," Murphy said.  </P> <P> Pruner, which serves about 330,000 people and an area of about 430 square  miles, is not subsidized by tax revenue, but operates on user fees, Greenfield  said.  </P> <P> One of the new vehicles is a four-wheel-drive unit that can be used on rough  terrain, he said.  </P> <P> Greenfield said that the company's goal is to send paramedics wherever and  whenever they are needed and that the support vehicles were the most efficient  and cost-effective way of doing that.

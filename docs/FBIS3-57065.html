			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Alain Lamassoure, French minister [delegate] for  European affairs, told journalists last night that a defense  cooperation treaty between Lithuania and France would be signed  in the immediate future. The text of the treaty has already  been coordinated, and it has been signed by Lithuanian National  Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius. Lamassoure said that he  would take this treaty to French Defense Francois Leotard, who  intends to visit Lithuania this year.    The purpose of the current official visit by Lamassoure is  to  establish economic and political contacts between France and  Lithuania. According to Lamassoure, his visit has been speeded  up by the parliamentary elections in Russia, because France has  always supported the struggle of the Baltic countries for  freedom, and it feels its responsibility regarding the situation  here.    France thinks that North and Central European countries  should have associated membership in the West European Union, a  defense organization uniting nine West European states,  Lamassoure said. France also has other initiatives concerning  Lithuania. Negotiations on a trade agreement between Lithuania  and the states of the European Union are taking place.  Lamassoure said that this involves not only economic but also  political agreement, which may decide Lithuania's admission to  the European Union, if this Lithuania's wish.    Yet another proposal by France is the so-called Balladur  plan-- submitted by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur--which  concerns countries having problems with their neighbors or with  national minorities. This is a kind of peace conference where  the countries of the European Union would be mediators. It is  planned to convene such a conference in Paris next April.    Lamassoure met on Friday the chairman of the Seimas,  Ceslovas  Jursenas, members of the Seimas Foreign Affairs Committee,  representatives of all political forces, Foreign Minister  Povilas Gylys, Defense Minister Linkevicius, and the leader of  the opposition, Vytautas Landsbergis. He is meeting Prime  Minister Adolfas Slezevicius today.    Lamassoure will go from Vilnius to Latvia.</p>

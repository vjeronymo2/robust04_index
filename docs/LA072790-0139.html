			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SURF COUNTY, USA;  </P> <P> THE LONG RIDERS;  </P> <P> SOME CHANGE FROM BUSINESS SUITS INTO WET SUITS. OTHERS PRACTICALLY LIVE IN THE  WATER. ALL FIND EXCEPTIONAL CHALLENGES AND REWARDS IN THEIR SEARCH FOR THE  PERFECT WAVE.  </P> <P> CHRIS EVANS  </P> <P> DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY, 35  </P> <P> The aging twin-engine Convair went into a sharp dive, and Orange County Deputy  Dist. Atty. Chris Evans felt his stomach climb into his throat. A few minutes  later the passengers were clapping. They had landed safely on the small  airstrip of Isla Natividad.  </P> <P> There isn't much on the dun-colored island except some of the finest surf in  Baja California. That was all Evans and his friends needed. Never mind the  Spartan accommodations.  </P> <P> Evans, 35, who has prosecuted some of the county's heaviest organized crime  figures, is an avid surfer, the kind with a yen every now and then for waves  south of the border.  </P> <P> "I still like surfing for the same reason I started. It's exhilarating," Evans  said. "And, it's got every element of a spare-time sport you could want" -- low  cost, thrills and a little adventure.  </P> <P> Evans, an Anaheim resident, started surfing when he was a 21-year-old county  firefighter. He has been to Hawaii and popular breaks in Baja California,  including San Miguel and K-38. But his favorite is Isla Natividad.  </P> <P> "It's great," Evans recalled. "The biggest danger is the flight down . . . The  pilot was 50 or so and the co-pilot was 19. They smoked cigarettes in the  cabin. It was unreal, but worth the trip."  </P> <P> Evans is prosecuting Dr. Thomas Gionis, charged with plotting an attack on his  former wife, Aissa Wayne, who is John Wayne's daughter, and her boyfriend,  Roger Luby, at Luby's Newport Beach home.  </P> <P> He is also handling a case against Robert Paduano, a reputed organized crime  figure who allegedly tried to take over part of the county's cocaine trade.  </P> <P> "Nothing can stop me from surfing," Evans said. "No case, not even the Gionis  case, can keep me from it. It is not even a close call." DAN WEIKEL  </P></p>

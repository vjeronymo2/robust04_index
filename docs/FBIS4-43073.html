			<p>BFN     [Text] Finland's territorial waters are to be extended.  The government presented a bill on this to the Eduskunta today.  Finland's territorial waters will extend to 12 nautical miles  instead of the current 4 nautical miles. This is an attempt to  improve the authorities' ability to control entry and exit in  the sea areas. It is proposed that the extension of the  territorial waters will be implemented in the Gulf of Finland so  that there will always be a east-west open sea corridor  measuring 3 nautical miles on the northern side of the median  line.</p>

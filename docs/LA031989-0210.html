			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK.  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors will hold a public hearing Wednesday to consider  raising the annual fees for about 11,000 Orange County businesses that generate  or store hazardous wastes underground.  </P> <P> The county conducts routine annual inspections of businesses that handle or  store hazardous wastes. To pay for that inspection, those businesses must pay  an annual fee, ranging from $165 for a company with fewer than 10 employees to  $1,002 for companies with more than 500 workers. County health officials have  proposed a 3.5% to 4% fee increase for all companies.  </P></p>

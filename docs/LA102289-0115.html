			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> TUCSON MERGER IS THE LOGICAL ONE;  </P> <P> UTILITIES: SEVERAL FEATURES OF THE ARIZONA POWER COMPANY MAKE IT, NOT EDISON, A  GOOD MATCH FOR SDG&amp;E.  </P> <P> The most glaring omission in the regulatory review of the proposed merger  between San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison is the  failure to compare the Edison merger with the now-abandoned merger between  SDG&amp;E and Tucson Electric Power.  </P> <P> Shortly after the ink was dry on the cooperative Tucson merger, the plan was  scuttled by Edison's hostile takeover tactics. Today, under the gun of Edison  lobbyists, both the California Public Utility Commission and the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission have rejected entreaties by the city of San Diego, the  Utility Consumers Action Network and other intervenors to compare the Edison  and Tucson merger plans before passing judgment on Edison's application.  </P> <P> In fact, the Tucson merger is the far superior alternative, both for San  Diegans and for electricity customers in the broader Southwest region. If the  Tucson merger, rather than the Edison merger, were consummated, San Diego  electricity consumers would pay lower rates for more reliable service, and the  San Diego air basin would probably suffer far less pollution.  </P> <P> Electricity rates would be lower under the Tucson merger for several reasons.  First, Edison's electricity rates for all customer classes -- commercial,  industrial and residential -- are higher than SDG&amp;E's, and the current 9%  rate gap is projected to continue over the next decade.  </P> <P> Because Edison is forbidden by the PUC to charge different rates to customers  in different service territories, San Diego ratepayers will see their rates  rise inexorably to Edison's much higher levels over time. Moreover, even if  Edison is allowed to temporarily lower rates for San Diego customers (as per  its public promises), our rates will inevitably climb.  </P> <P> In contrast, Tucson's rates are more than 20% below SDG&amp;E's. Under the  Tucson merger, San Diego rates would either remain low or drop even further  below Edison's.  </P> <P> Second, Tucson affords SDG&amp;E a more economically diverse generation mix  than the Edison merger. Ninety-four percent of Tucson's power is  coal-generated. This coal power perfectly complements SDG&amp;E's reliance on  gas, oil and nuclear generation and provides SDG&amp;E with a resource  diversity that is a strong buffer against future oil shocks.  </P> <P> In contrast, the generation synergies offered by the Edison merger are  virtually nil because Edison's resource mix is almost identical to SDG&amp;E's.  </P> <P> Third, both Tucson and SDG&amp;E are small compared to Edison, but together  they could be a potent countervailing market force to Edison's attempted  monopolization of the Southern California and Southwest electricity markets.  The resultant competitive pressures in purchased power markets would save  ratepayers throughout the region hundreds of millions of dollars.  </P> <P> In fact, many knowledgeable observers believe that the primary motive behind  Edison's hostile takeover was foreclosing competition in this market and  preserving its hegemony.  </P> <P> Beyond the rate issue, the Tucson merger provides San Diego electricity  customers with much more reliable service. Whereas SDG&amp;E has warned that it  may run short on power by the mid-1990s, Tucson seriously overbuilt during the  '70s and '80s and has substantial power reserves that could be used by  SDG&amp;E through the end of the century.  </P> <P> Moreover, Tucson possesses an excellent, under-utilitized transmission network  that would give SDG&amp;E access to 37 additional utilities throughout the  Southwest, Midwest and Northwest.  </P> <P> In contrast, the only excess power that Edison has to offer SDG&amp;E is very  high-cost generation from one of its unregulated subsidiaries, Mission Energy.  Mission Energy is a "money pump" formed to exploit a loophole in a federal law  designed to stimulate small power production through inflated prices. Edison  buys Mission Energy power, passes the high prices on to its ratepayers and  passes the profits from its unregulated subsidiary on to its shareholders.  </P> <P> The Edison merger might also significantly increase air pollution in San Diego,  while, under the Tucson merger, pollution would be reduced. As the San Diego  County Air Pollution Control District has documented, the Edison merger could  raise pollution levels significantly, ranging from 119% for carbon monoxide to  an astounding 6,947% for sulfur oxides. Edison would do this by cutting down  generation at some of its polluting plants in the Los Angeles air basin and  replacing it with generation from San Diego plants.  </P> <P> The Edison merger would also have several additional unwanted side effects.  They include the loss of jobs and local control, as well as reduced charitable  contributions from the resulting utility.  </P> <P> Last, but not least, the Edison merger would prove an unwelcome stimulant to  the ongoing "Los Angelization" of San Diego by provoking an equally unwelcome  "political merger." This merger between an Edison seeking new customers and an  already-too-powerful development industry would have as its aim continued rapid  growth.  </P> <P> Since the Tucson merger was abandoned, Tucson Electric Power has undergone  considerable internal controversy. Its chief executive officer resigned under  fire, the company has experienced large losses in both its unregulated holdings  and power operations, and its stock price has fallen. All of these events  suggest that there is now an even better economic opportunity for SDG&amp;E to  pursue a cooperative merger with Tucson.  </P> <P> Toward that end, the San Diego City Council or Board of Supervisors should send  an emissary to Tucson to explore the reopening of merger talks. The council  should also pass a nonbinding resolution recommending that SDG&amp;E reopen  discussions and reaffirm to both the PUC and the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission the desire to see the Tucson merger included as part of the  regulatory review.  </P> <P> In March, 1990, Chairman Tom Page and the SDG&amp;E board of directors will be  free to terminate the Edison merger agreement without penalty, because of a  "drop dead" clause in the contract. If Mr. Page and the board would simply  discard their "golden parachutes" and put the interests of San Diego above  their own, there would be no obstacle to renewed discussion between Tucson and  SDG&amp;E about a merger that is founded in common sense and mutual benefit  rather than in Edison's exploitative power play.  </P></p>

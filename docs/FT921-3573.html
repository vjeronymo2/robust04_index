			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Election fears push markets down again STERLING and shares came under renewed pressure yesterday, as uncertainty about the Conservatives' prospects in the election continued to cast a shadow over financial markets. The pound weakened by 1 pfennig against the D-Mark, closing in London at DM2.86, while the FT-SE 100 index of leading UK shares fell 29.1 to 2,493.3, after shedding more than 50 points on Wednesday. Investors are worried that the subdued outlook for the economy, and the fact that this makes an interest rate cut over the next month unlikely, form a poor backcloth for the government as it fights the election campaign. The financial markets' second successive day of jitters followed a Budget on Tuesday by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that many in the City judged as unlikely to help the Tories' chances. However, ministers anxious to prove to voters that the economy is on the mend will be cheered by a report today from the House Builders' Federation. This suggests that sales may be slowly picking up in the housing market, a crucial sector for the economy. Government supporters are also likely to take comfort from the latest distributive trades survey from the Confederation of British Industry, which pointed to a modest improvement in retail sales last month. The fall in the FT-SE 100 index to its lowest close for two months came after investors virtually gave up hope of a cut in base rates, now at 10.5 per cent, before the general election. Reflecting this, the three-month interbank rate, which shadows base rates, firmed by  1/16 percentage point to close at about 10 5/8 per cent. On currency markets, investors switched funds out of sterling. The pound lost ground against the dollar, closing in London more than 1 1/2 cents down at Dollars 1.7085. Its trade weighted index shed 0.6 percentage points to 89.7. In New York, sterling closed at DM2.8607 and Dollars 1.713.

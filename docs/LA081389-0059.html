			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POETRY AS PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> I think what Jack Miles said in "Slept Through Any Poetry Lately?" (Book  Review, July 23) was that despite the current trend toward performance of  literature, in general he favors the one-to-one relationship between reader and  poem, novel, etc. If so, then I agree. I came away from this column, however,  with sufficient ambivalence that I have to believe it reflects, at least in  part, his own mixed feelings. Perhaps also my own.  </P> <P> I disagree totally with the concept of a poem whose only merit lies in its  recited performance. I am equally certain that the well-written poem will also  perform well. Not long ago I listened to David Whyte read, in his marvelous  Yorkshire accent, Neruda (in Spanish and English), Rilke (German and English),  Akhmatova, David Wagonner and Beowulf, Kabir, and his own poetry, in a setting  truly a gift from the gods: at Esalen overlooking the cliffs, high above the  Pacific, nothing between us and the next land but six thousand miles of water,  sky, and poetry.  </P> <P> But all of those writers enriched mankind before Whyte, and will continue,  though I consider myself blessed to have heard him. The writer's commitment is  to a sheet of paper, his inner world, and that of his reader. Whatever else  follows is serendipity (or synchronicity). All the better, if they also sing  their brilliance, not only in our mind's ear, but at Cafe Largo or Esalen or  the Pomona 20.  </P> <P> Miles said it well: "The great strength of fiction was that it contained its  own set, lights, sounds, special effects within itself."  </P> <P> BARBARA L.

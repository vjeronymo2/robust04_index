"The responsibility will rest with those who try to  resolve controversial issues in the region by violence", head of  the main headquarters of Russian border troops general Aleksandr  Tymko told Interfax.    Amid renewed tension on the Tajik-Afghan border, two Russian  posts came under cross border mortar and rocket fire on Monday,  Tymko said. In a separate incident, the rebels mounted rocket  fire on one other post on Saturday. One Russian soldier was  injured.    There have been more than 50 such attacks on Russian troops  since early this year. Agreements on an end to the attacks on  Russian posts have failed to work on parts of the border, Tymko  said.</p>

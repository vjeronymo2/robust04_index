			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Property: Sea-change in UK attitudes to property - Gerald Cadogan looks back on 1994 and makes some predictions for the new year Come the millennium, we shall look back on 1994 as the year of a sea-change in British attitudes on how to live. Finally, Britons have started to understand that the prime purpose of housing is not as a get-rich-quick investment vehicle - it is to provide a place to live. Greedy 1980s attitudes - the idea of buying one's home to make a quick profit - are now seen as a false trail. Instead, the UK is returning to the pattern of low property price inflation that existed for decades up until the 1960s. At the same time renting has become a sensible, and growing, alternative to owner-occupation, which it has not been since before the second world war. The stagnant buying market for most of 1994 (except at the top end which has seen price increases, mainly in London and the home counties) is the first sign of this change. Ironically, it has appeared while housing has been more affordable than for many years in terms of wages (for those in work), prices and interest rates. Another irony is that it has happened under a Tory administration that used to espouse a property-owning democracy. Pessimistic realism has replaced the optimism that potential buyers possess when they embark on buying a house or flat. Home buying is a big emotional, financial and family commitment and one of the three main decisions in most people's lives (along with choosing a partner and obtaining a job). This negative outlook stems from a combination of reasons. Negative equity is the worst of them for the 1.096m households that the Bank of England estimates cannot expect to repay their mortgage from the proceeds of selling their home. While it does not affect those secure in their jobs and not thinking of moving, it stops anyone who wants to move. And for all who have suffered, it has destroyed the once clear financial advantage of buying one's own home. Redundancy is equally responsible for preventing people moving home. The whittling away of mortgage interest relief and the Budget's cuts in mortgage benefit on losing one's job make matters worse. So does the fear of higher interest rates - not that they are overly high, but they have gone up and there is little trust that they will stop where they are. The final blow, many think, is our shambles of a government. How can we hope for better things - which we must do to make sense of buying a home - when government seems so inept? If you doubt the general lack of confidence and refusal to take on debt, look at the figures for private car buying. As an act of commitment, the car is second to the house. Yet potential buyers of new cars are holding back. The year 1994 began full of hope, especially for those who had thought of moving but decided to wait for the 25 per cent rise in prices in prime London properties (and 19 per cent across the country) that Savills predicted in December 1993. The cheer lasted the first quarter, when attractive, worry-removing, low-rate, fixed mortgages were on offer, and a lucky few enjoyed large City bonuses. Net sales recorded by the Corporate Estate Agents property index peaked in February and March. In April, mortgage relief was pared, fixed mortgage rates went up and turnover fell. Since June it has been below 1993 levels, says the CEA. Average house prices peaked in March, Halifax reports, although Nationwide's did not until August. Both indices agree more or less on a slight summer rise, and a decline since September. The latest figures, for November, show a year-on-year decline of 0.6 per cent (Nationwide) or 1 per cent (Halifax), and fewer sales than a year ago (CEA). For top properties the story is different. They have always had their own market. Prices have risen, although there is disagreement as to how much. Savills estimates a 20 per cent annual rise in prime London homes until September, which goes a long way to validating the firm's forecast for the year. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's London residential review is more cautious: a 10 per cent year-on-year rise to June 1994. Most agents would agree with that, if quickly mentioning larger increases for Kensington houses on domestic buying. Prices have returned to 1988-89 levels or sometimes better, but in nominal terms. The retail price index shows that the pound has fallen by about a third since 1988. The Savills/KFR figures differ from those of the building societies, because the societies work from their mortgage lending and necessarily pass over the 28 per cent of purchasers who do not need a mortgage, says William Gething, of buying agent Property Vision. These cash buyers are concentrated in London and the south east of England (where prices have risen most) and they tend to buy more expensive properties. Central London also benefits from foreign buyers, especially for flats. They led the market's bounce back in autumn 1992, and have kept it on the move since. If you are from Hong Kong, Singapore or Malaysia, London is still good value. The London rises have spread throughout the south east and westwards along the M4 and in to the Cotswolds. Savills estimates a 12 per cent rise for the best houses in the home counties (for which KFR suggests a less bullish 6 per cent). Demand is high, and the supply of good period houses finite. Hampshire agents have reported many unusually quick sales, some before the house even came to market. The tactic of resorting to 'best and final offers' is a ploy that produces figures well above the guide price, while at public auction this autumn a Cotswold rectory needing renovation, with a Pounds 400,000 guide price, sold for Pounds 592,000. The demand for larger houses has helped developers build pricier new homes, laden with extras and much improved on their products of 10 years ago, 'which can, however, be hard to sell,' says David Bedford, of agent Bedford, in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. He suggests that if new home values continue to rise, we may even see developers buying 1960s and 1970s houses to demolish them for their site value. Further from London, and off the motorways, prices have shown little growth. East Anglia, for instance, offers fine value. A house with a few acres near Newmarket, will cost 40 per cent less than a comparable house near Newbury, says Jock Lloyd-Jones of Bidwells in Cambridge. In 1995, present conditions and lack of confidence will continue. Buyers should think in terms of local markets and get to know their chosen area and its prices thoroughly. Be prepared for prices to race if there is competition. Sellers of good properties can be sure of finding buyers, but that still leaves the problem of where to move, which may stop them selling. The best forecast is more of the same in all the different micro-markets. Top housing prices will probably continue to push ahead faster than ordinary housing. But it is hard to see that anything can produce large rises soon. The prospect of a Labour government by 1997 will ensure that those who have to sell for tax reasons, or to organise their estate for their children, will do so fairly soon. Hamptons already reports a 20 per cent increase in open market sales over Pounds 1m by its Guernsey office, and 'a similar increase in successful applications for Jersey immigration at this level'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  said on Tuesday "Our liberal democracy is an absolute value  which we all should safeguard and cultivate under all  circumstances."    In a statement issued in observance of the "month of  veterans  and fallen patriots" in June, President Kim said today's world  situation following the demise of the Cold War expressly shows  that "our belief in liberal democracy has been right."    He said the strength with which the precious value can be  upheld would spring only from burning patriotism and firm senses  of national security on the part of each people. "It is thanks  entirely to the sacrificial dedication made by our fallen  patriots and veterans that we today enjoy peace and prosperity  in a free and democratic country," Kim said.    Also in an exclusive interview with the NAEWAY ECONOMIC  DAILY  [name of daily as received], President Kim said he would see to  it that some public enterprises would be privatized in a just  manner without any tint of suspicion.    Denouncing some industries for unfoundedly accusing rival  firms in bids to grab public enterprises being privatized, the  president said relevant offices are now working out a plan to  forestall any by-products that may pop up in the course of  privatization.    He said the government would enforce a plan to sharply  improve the environment for foreigners investment within the  first half of this year. The plan, he said, would involve all  areas related to foreigners direct investment such as financing,  taxation, labor and land use.    Touching on his upcoming official visit to Russia, President  Kim said he hopes the tour would serve as an opportunity to  further expand bilateral economic cooperative relations between  the two countries. "During my visit, we will in particular try  to remove various obstacles to free trade and investment and  enhance practical cooperation in all areas," he said.</p>

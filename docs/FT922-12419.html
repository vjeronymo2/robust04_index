			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / As They Say In Europe: A very British carry-on THE ROWS of papers on the news stand at Heathrow terminal 2 last Saturday gave food for thought. They offered the first reactions to John Major's election victory. All agreed it was the big story: not just Le Monde and Die Welt, which take an unusual interest in British affairs - there were also the Neue Zurcher Zeitung, Die Presse of Vienna, El Pais of Madrid and all the Italians. On the Malev flight to Budapest, I found a copy of the Hungarian socialist paper, Nepszabadsag, with the headline 'Carry on Major]' This doubtless will instil in some British film producer the germ of an idea for a vulgar new oeuvre in the well-known tradition. British readers may find this perfectly reasonable, but no continental election could give rise to the same excitement in the British press. That is why the supporters of proportional representation are making a great mistake. British elections are a marvellous sporting event: a two-man fight and a junior spoiler struggling on unpredictable terrain for victory in a winner-take-all battle, as the sports writers would say. The allocation of parliamentary seats (which bears little relationship to votes cast) and the personal nature of the contest all add to the fun - capped, this time, by the willingness of ordinary men and women to manipulate opinion pollsters ruthlessly. In some ways, the most impressive account was in Die Presse. Its headline ran: 'Historic victory against all polls.' The chief commentator for this conservative daily, Thomas Chorherr, rattled off a 600-word celebration for the front page. 'Europeans were given a multi-stage lesson in a fine English style yesterday. Politicians, the media, above all the pollsters, will take it to heart.' He said all the experts were in danger of digging themselves an ever-deeper grave and added: 'The final spurt in the neck-and-neck race did not end in a photo finish but a significant victory . . .' He concluded as he had begun: 'In fine English style in the Mother of Parliaments, pure parliamentarianism will once again be exercised as it should be.' Almost everybody delighted in the result, regardless of political affiliation. El Pais drew a picture of the voters quietly deciding against 'uncertainty' in the 'silence of the polling booths.' Le Monde's heart, however, went out to Labour. 'It is always difficult to lose, especially when having made concessions, within honourable limits, to the ideology of the enemy.' The paper's cartoon showed a battered President Mitterand saying to an equally damaged Chancellor Kohl: 'I tell you, Helmut, the English never show solidarity.' The result in Scotland was also reported universally. The Neue Zurcher Zeitung said the Tories had been fighting for lost positions but had justified the 'divide and rule' strategy. 'They played the 'all-or-nothing' independence policy of the nationalists brilliantly against the middle way of devolution.' Nobody was able immediately to supply a coherent explanation for what had happened. The elation over a surprise result meant that, for one day, there was a suspension of the disrespectful accounts of the state of Britain which provide much of the normal fodder for continental readers. This did not mean the reporters themselves were glad that the Conservatives had won; most had wanted a Labour victory because it would have provided good copy for weeks rather than a day. On Friday, the news agencies and papers regretfully tore up profiles of the Labour leadership and whole pages were readjusted. Their earlier stories had all been based on the exit polls which had implied a hung parliament. That phrase produced some marvellous translations in half a dozen languages which never have to deal with anything but confused results. A British election provides a unique European political event: it is all over when the votes are counted. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

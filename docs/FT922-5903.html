			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Hutchison bids for Cavendish minorities MR Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa yesterday made a second attempt to take its associate Cavendish International private, when it unveiled a HKDollars 5.50 a share bid, valuing the company at about HKDollars 16bn (USDollars 2bn). Analysts said the higher price may just win the day for Mr Li although it still represented a discount on the company's net asset value of more than HKDollars 6 a share. Mr Li was surprisingly rebuffed last year when minority shareholders failed to support a HKDollars 4.10 a share offer for the company. Hutchison, which already owns 63.4 per cent of the company, will have to outlay HKDollars 5.58bn to acquire the minorities. It said its offer represented a 32 per cent premium over Cavendish's share price prior to the bid. The company said the proposed consolidation of Cavendish would allow the Hutchison group structure to be simplified and economies effected. Cavendish main assets are its 34 per cent of Hongkong Electric Company - the monopoly supplier of electricity to Victoria Island - 24.5 per cent of Husky Oil, the Canadian oil and gas producer, and 50 per cent of property developer ICH. A merger of the two would give the enlarged Hutchison 49 per cent of Husky. Mr Li owns 46 per cent of Husky personally. He exercises effective control over Hutchison and Cavendish through a 39.07 per cent interest in Hutchison held by his flagship, Cheung Kong. In March Cavendish reported a 5 per cent fall in net profits to HKDollars 1.25bn - the result of a HKDollars 462m provision for the fall in value of Husky's oil and gas reserves. At the end of 1991 Hutchison had net cash of HKDollars 491m and Mr John Mulcahy, research director at Peregrine Brokerage, said that given its capital spending commitments in its telecommunication business it may have to come to the market with a rights issue.</p>

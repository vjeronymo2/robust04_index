			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Branko Geroski: "Disputable `Mileage' for </F> General Tellefsen"]    [Text] Brigadier General Tryggwe Tellefsen, UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] commander for Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], recently visited Nis, where he  had discussions with representatives of the General Staff of the  Yugoslav Army. The news broadcast by Macedonian Television  described the visit as "technical" (as was, allegedly, the  character of the meeting), which was why it was not even noted  by the press. In a statement for this most powerful of the  media, General Tellefsen told the Macedonian public that he had  had talks with Serbian officers about some "minor" questions:  How to avoid border incidents between the "blue helmets" and  Yugoslav troops; how to establish normal communications and  exchanges of information between the two sides (in the case, the  two sides are the Yugoslav Army and UNPROFOR)... together with  other similar "technical" trifles that should not excite the  public unduly.    Unfortunately, not everything is as straightforward and  simple as it may first appear. This is at least because of two  unusually "strong" statements made by Mr. Tellefsen. The first  is the information about the increased presence of Serbian  military formations near the Macedonian-Yugoslav border,  allegedly because of some Yugoslav Army maneuvers. The  Macedonian public had not been informed about any maneuvers near  its border or about the unusual presence of military formations  on the other side of the border (this "line" should normally be  taken conditionally, because there is no marked or defined  line). Nevertheless, being a serious soldier, General Tellefsen  does not talk nonsense (God forbid!), which means that there  must have been some unusual activities on the other side of the  border. Before this statement, the public had probably been  generously spared this information. Let us now not split hairs  or broach the question about "normal" communications between two  states, when one of them violates normal procedures for  informing the other whenever it undertakes unusual military  activities in the vicinity of its border. This is the Balkans  and one should not expect such good manners.    The second statement made by Tellefsen is rather more  serious: Namely, if we have understood it correctly, the general  said that there is around 140 km of Macedonian-Yugoslav border  regarded as disputable, militarily speaking. The border, as we  know, has not been marked with posts, but there is the practice  from former Yugoslavia and there are some administrative borders  that Macedonia, at least until this statement was issued,  assumed were undisputable -- according to statements made by  government officials, there are only a few points on the border  that are in dispute. General Tellefsen owes the government and  the broader public a serious explanation about the criteria by  which 140 km of the northern border (from Kumanovo to the  Bulgarian border) is being regarded as disputable.    There is no trickery here: General Tellefsen starts out from  real problems faced by his soldiers -- incidents and so on.  Wherever one happens, it certainly represents a "disputable"  space for the UN peacekeepers. The trouble is that in each such  individual case the "disputable" nature is defined by the  Serbian border guards. So far there has not been a case of the  Macedonian border guards or the "blue" observers capturing or  kidnapping a Serbian patrol on territory that can be defined as  "disputable" by the Macedonian side.    The UNPROFOR delegation, General Tellefsen stated, had  agreed  to a certain "good will" procedure with the representatives of  the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army in such unfortunate  cases. In brief, it was agreed that if the peacekeepers were  accidentally to stray into "disputable" (read: Serbian)  territory, the Serbian guards should be "gentle" and  understanding. Moreover: The Serbian side will inform UNPROFOR  about military exercises and maneuvers in order to avoid  incidents. (But will anybody officially inform Macedonia?)    At first sight, it is good that some kind of procedure has  been established to avoid unnecessary incidents. However, it is  possible to view this in another way. Namely, the situation on  the territory (these unmarked borders) could remain so for  years. During all that time the Macedonian border guards and  the "Macedonian" UNPROFOR members will establish certain  practices to resolve incidents. With each case, point by point,  part after part of the territory that official Macedonia does  not see as disputable will be treated as such. All this will be  done along these 140 km, which even General Tellefsen regards as  disputable. Is this not a dangerous precedent before the future  necessary demarcation of the border?    This is why we conclude that it would have been an  elementary rule to have at least the formal presence of a  representative of the Macedonian Government there. General  Tellefsen could have independently informed his Serbian  collocutors about his units, have any kind of fruitful  conversations, even about the mentioned incidents, but the  moment the Macedonian-Yugoslav border was mentioned and treated  as partly "disputable," the subject unquestionably became  political. The discussions of issues of such a kind without the  presence of Macedonian representatives is a weird gesture, if  not more than that.    Nevertheless, let us be realistic: General Tellefsen is a  soldier. The man has real problems on the ground and that is  why his conduct is militarily pragmatic. The problems, or at  least so it seems, have been solved. The general has no strict  obligation to understand our sensitivities when the border is at  stake or to demonstrate good manners in front of his good hosts.  The problem is that the Defense Ministry did not react, and  official Macedonia did not react. Not for the sake of  unnecessary quarreling with UNPROFOR (God forbid!) but to make  it clear that neither directly, nor "military" or "technically,"  can our borders be discussed without our presence.    The UNPROFOR peacekeepers are staying in Macedonia without  any official arrangement, and our requests for a definition of  the special mandate of the forces in Macedonia have been  repeatedly ignored. All of this can be considered as of minor  importance, because what really matters is the peace mission.  However, that is not a good enough reason for the lack of  official contacts with Macedonia in this case. There still  remains the statement that half of our northern border is  disputable and it really will be most typical if it remains  hanging over us in this way.</p>

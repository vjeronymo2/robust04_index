			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CONDUCTOR FINDS PERESTROIKA PLAYS WELL FOR CAREER  </P> <P> Soviet conductor Vassili Sinaisky may be forgiven if his composure appears  slightly ruffled. Just two weeks ago, he was alerted that he would be making  his American debut with the San Diego Symphony, taking the place of the ailing  Valery Gergiev. Then, a week ago, he learned that he had been appointed the new  music director of one of Moscow's two State Symphony Orchestras.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, his first full day in America, the 41-year-old conductor gave up  most of an already-brief lunch hour sandwiched between two long rehearsals for  an interview. In the role of interpreterr was San Diego Symphony concertmaster  Igor Gruppman, a Russian emigre several years Sinaisky's junior who will be  playing the solo in Glazunov's Violin Concerto tonight under Sinaisky's  direction.  </P> <P> The two musicians attended the same music conservatory in Leningrad, where each  met his future wife, so, although they had met only the evening before at the  airport, they displayed the camaraderie of two old friends at a reunion.  </P> <P> For Sinaisky, the salutary breezes of perestroika have brought him back from  musical exile in Latvia and put his career back on the fast track.  </P> <P> "After 12 years of being the music director of the Latvian Radio and Television  Symphony in Riga, Latvia, it meant I was given a chance to assume a post with  the Bolshoi Opera. And now I have my own orchestra. I can breathe now!"  Sinaisky said.  </P> <P> "Before perestroika, the music that was performed was only by party composers  and people in power, people approved by the composers' union," he said. "Now  that censorship does not exist at all, and we can perform a broad spectrum of  music. Ultramodern pieces -- even electronic music -- are being performed,  although not necessarily of the highest quality."  </P> <P> Although contemporary Western music has not yet achieved the status of American  jazz and blue jeans, it is the newest fad in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "Only 10 days ago, Andrew Lloyd Webber's 'Requiem' was played in Moscow by the  State Symphony Orchestra," Sinaisky said. "Over the last five years, the  government's planning committees have begun to promote contemporary Soviet and  Western music on a large scale. There have several new festivals devoted  exclusively to contemporary music. Last year one took place in Leningrad. They  performed some 300 contemporary works in two weeks!"  </P> <P> As with most of the changes in contemporary Soviet life, Mikhail Gorbachev has  been the catalyst for music's renewed importance. According to Sinaisky, after  the Soviet leader visited the finals of the most recent Tchaikovsky  Competition, his subordinates became converted to regular concert-goers.  </P> <P> "That set the pace," Sinaisky said. "Now it is very fashionable for Soviet  leaders to come to the concert and invite visiting officials from other  countries."  </P> <P> When then-President Reagan met with Gorbachev in Moscow, Sinaisky was on the  podium the night the two world leaders attended the symphony at the Bolshoi  Theatre.  </P> <P> Sinaisky said he has heard of both the upcoming San Diego Soviet Arts Festival  and Seattle's 1990 Soviet festival. Since he has just achieved the status of a  Soviet conductor with an international agent, he has not been approached to  perform at either.  </P> <P> "Any Soviet conductor would be happy to participate," he said.  </P> <P> Tonight's San Diego Symphony concert of Borodin's Overture to "Prince Igor,"  Rachmaninoff's Second Symphony and the Glazunov Violin Concert marks Sinaisky's  American debut. However, he has performed in this hemisphere before. In the  late 1970s, he conducted several times in Cuba. His recollections about that  experience, however, had more to do with climate than with musical  interpretation.  </P> <P> "We were in Havana, and it was very hot. I was conducting a Brahms symphony,  and the heat was 102 degrees . . . . Although the whole orchestra was allowed  to take their jackets off, I had to keep tails on for the whole concert."  </P> <P> The first big break in Sinaisky's career came in 1973, when he won first prize  in the Herbert von Karajan International Conducting Competition, the first  Soviet conductor to win that prize. In spite of the professional importance of  the award, Sinaisky remains cautious about competitions when it comes to his  15-year-old son, a budding pianist. When asked if his son is preparing for the  next Tchaikovsky Competition, Sinaisky said, "No, not yet," and stressed that  he and his wife are trying not to apply undue pressure.  </P></p>

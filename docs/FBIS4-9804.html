			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 29 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rica has  abandoned the "banana war" it was waging with other Latin  American nations against the European Union (EU) and accepted an  offer shortly after the defeat of Costa Rican Foreign Minister  Bernd Niehaus as OAS secretary general. Roberto Rojas, Costa  Rican foreign trade minister, told ACAN-EFE that this agreement,  negotiated last week with Rene Steichen, EU commissioner for  agricultural matters, "has nothing to do" with Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria's election as OAS secretary general.  Rojas assured that the largest banana producers in the  Caribbean, such as Belize and Jamaica, voted for Costa Rica on  Sunday in Washington and that the agreement with the EU  safeguards the advantages it has always granted to these small  nations.    At the OAS election, some Caribbean nations, as well as  Panama and Ecuador, which had committed their votes to Costa  Rica, broke their pledges at the last minute and voted for the  Colombian president. This gave Gaviria the victory to lead the  OAS for the next five years.    These events caused strong misgivings in Costa Rican  diplomatic and political circles because, according to Rojas,  vigorous U.S. pressure in support of Gaviria included the use of  the banana issue as a negotiating tool. Nevertheless, the Costa  Rican minister assured that the "banana war" did not have a  bearing on changes in OAS votes, although there was an attempt  to link the "banana war" to Foreign Minister Niehaus' bid to  become OAS secretary general. Neihaus lost to Gaviria by a vote  of 20-14.    The European commissioner today appeared satisfied with the  agreement which, besides resolving the dispute, "assures that  the EU's objectives in regulating banana imports will continue  to be respected." For Steichen, this guarantees respect for the  interests of EU banana consumers and producers, as well as of  the producers of the fruit in Africa, the Caribbean, and the  Pacific.    Costa Rica was the most ardent challenger -- followed by  Colombia -- of the EU restrictions that have been in force since  July. Costa Rica now will benefit the most by this agreement.  The agreement grants Costa Rica a 23.4 percent share (25  million cases) of the quota established for all banana imports  from Latin America. Of the 2.1-million ton quota for this year  and 2.2-million tons for next year, Colombia will obtain 22  percent, Nicaragua 3 percent, and Venezuela 2 percent.    The agreement also includes a reduction in (import) tariffs  from 100 ECU's [European Currency Units] ($112) per ton to 75  ECU's ($75), as well as granting 70 percent of the import  licenses to the producing nation. This was one of the most  controversial issues in the Latin American-EU dispute.    Europe imposed a quota system on Latin American banana  imports on 1 July, reducing its purchases from 2.5 million to 2  million tons. This unleashed charges from the Latin Americans --  led by Costa Rica -- before the GATT, which ultimately ruled in  favor of the producers, claiming that the EU system violated  basic GATT principles.    The other four nations -- Ecuador, the world's largest  producer that will have a smaller quota to export to the EU;  Panama; Honduras; and Guatemala -- will continue their struggle  before GATT. Of these nations, only Guatemala is a full member  of this trade agreement, while Honduras is in the process of  joining.    After a meeting with the Costa Rican producers, Rojas said  this agreement will allow Costa Rica to arrive feeling satisfied  at the signing of the Final Document of GATT's Uruguay Round on  15 April in Marrakesh, Morocco. Rojas stated: "This agreement  will create market and price stability while resolving this very  difficult controversy for Costa Rica and the producers." At the  same time, Rojas highlighted the importance of the European  market for his country.    Rojas assured that his country will remain a member of the  Union of Banana Exporting Countries and will attend all meetings  in which this matter is studied. Nevertheless, he made it clear  that the bloc that had negotiated with the EU has been  dissolved. In this regard, Rojas said Costa Rica will attend the  meeting of producing nations to be held in Panama on 8 April to  explain the reasons for and the terms under which Costa Rica  accepted the EU's proposal.</p>

Carlos Alejandro Tello, the designated Mexican ambassador to  Cuba, said Mexico "will maintain its policy rejecting the U.S.  blockade against Cuba, implemented more than 30 years ago, and  will advocate its elimination because it harms the Cuban people."    Asked if the Mexican Foreign Secretariat has asked its  diplomats to report on the Chiapas situation in the countries  where they are accredited, Tello said "we were instructed to  tell the truth from the start of the incidents." He added that  "if I am confirmed as ambassador to Cuba, I will do as I did in  Moscow; I will say it is a local problem, a Mexican problem.  There should be no foreign intervention and a political solution  will be sought through dialogue."    He said he has received no special instructions for carrying  out his duties in Cuba. "Mexico will not only maintain the  excellent and solid relations that currently exist, but will  strengthen them by redoubling efforts in the areas of tourism,  oil, and industry," he stressed.    Tello, who has been the Mexican ambassador to Portugal and  Russia, among other positions, expects to be confirmed  ambassador to Cuba by a Congressional plenum on Wednesday [23  February].</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Observer: Money talks She may lack her former pulling power, but she still pulls a large whack. Baroness Thatcher is currently in Brazil at the invitation of Banco Garantia to speak at a conference on privatisation. Yesterday she was due to meet the president and the foreign minister. But Brazil's most important government member - finance minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso - cried off. He had to stay over in the US to discuss details of Brazil's anti-inflation and debt rescheduling plans. But the Iron Lady still drives a hard bargain. She is understood to be charging Pounds 120,000 for her words and, with the Brazilian cruzeiro devaluing by 40 per cent a month because of rapid inflation, is wisely not accepting local currency.</p>

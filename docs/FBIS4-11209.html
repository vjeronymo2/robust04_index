Professor Ruben  Dario Carles made the statement in Veracruz during a political  tour.    Sympathizers and supporters of the Morena [National Renewal  Movement], Civic Renewal Party, and Molirena [Nationalist  Liberal Republican Movement] parties, which comprise the Change  '94 alliance, received presidential candidate Ruben Dario  Carles, who toured the community of Veracruz. Carles was  accompanied by people seeking electoral posts in Veracruz  corregimiento, the western sector of the capital.    During his tour, supporters assured Professor Carles of  their  vote on 8 May. They also expressed concerns regarding community  problems. The presidential candidate for Change '94, during an  impromptu meeting, promised his government will work with the  community to improve and clean Veracruz beach, to improve the  roads, and to protect children from the corruption of drugs.  Professor Carles said that without preconditions or impositions  an agreement can be reached to form a broad civic alliance to  confront the PRD on 8 May.    [Carles] We politicians must sound out the people, to seek a  ticket to guarantee victory and to ensure Panamanians a better  way of life.    [Reporter] Professor, but among the civic alliance  candidates  there seems to be a lack of willingness to set aside their  political interests to form this ticket.    [Carles] Look, everybody cannot win. We have to use logic  and consider what is most advisable for the country. I agree it  must be without preconditions, without impositions, to reach an  agreement for the good of the country. [end recording]    The political leaders of Veracruz, who back the Change '94  slate expressed appreciation for the support they have received  from the Change '94 ticket.</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> EXTENSION ASKED IN BAT TAKEOVER  </P> <P> Sir James Goldsmith, one of the three financiers leading the hostile takeover  bid for BAT Industries PLC, said today a British regulatory panel must extend  its deadline or his takeover attempt will fail.  </P> <P> Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers requires that all conditions of a bid,  including U.S. regulatory hurdles, must be completed within 81 days of the  posting of the bidder's formal offer document.  </P> <P> "If there is no extension from the panel it's very hard to see the offer  succeeding," Goldsmith said.  </P> <P> Goldsmith's consortium, Hoylake Investments Ltd., posted its $21.4-billion bid  for BAT and its U.S. subsidiaries Aug. 8, which leaves the group 58 days to  meet U.S. regulatory requirements.  </P> <P> London-based BAT, the world's largest tobacco company, has significant  interests in financial services, paper and retailing -- including such U.S.  holdings as Farmers Insurance Group and the Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall  Field department stores.  </P></p>

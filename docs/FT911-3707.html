			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Martin Marietta up MARTIN Marietta, the US aerospace company whose Patriot missiles hit the headlines during the Gulf war, lifted first-quarter earnings by 6 per cent to Dollars 71.1m after tax,from Dollars 67.1m in the same period a year ago. But revenues fell to Dollars 1.4bn from Dollars 1.42bn. Marietta said the fall stemmed partly from non-recurring sales from a commercial Titan rocket launch in the first quarter of 1990, and partly from the effects of the recession and poor weather. At the operating level, Marietta reported a slightly sharper rise of 13 per cent to Dollars 108m. But 'other income' fell to Dollars 1.7m from Dollars 6.8m, while interest expenses rose from Dollars 10.2m to Dollars 12.1m. The earnings per share figure was much in line with analysts' expectations, at Dollars 1.44, against Dollars 1.32.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Comment at seminar on socioeconomic issues by Nguyen Dinh </F> So, member, CPV Central Committee, and secretary, Ha Tay  Provincial CPV Committee: "Exchanging of Experiences--Leading  the National Defense Work in Ha Tay"]    [Text] Our party has affirmed that building and defending  the fatherland always is the two closely-linked strategic tasks  and the law of Vietnam's revolution.    Today, in the renovating efforts, as the task of  socioeconomic stabilization and development is placed at the top  of our agenda, the task of firmly defending the independence,  sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the socialist  fatherland, and stopping and defeating every enemy destructive  and aggressive plot and act remains the strategic task of all  our people, army, and political system.    Maintaining peace and political stability has a decisive  significance for the fate of the nation and the development of  the country. On the other hand, socioeconomic development and  improvement of the standard of living are the topmost conditions  for strengthening our ability to defend the fatherland.    In the face of complex international and regional changes,  the fact that the country is encountering new challenges and new  opportunities requires that we thoroughly understand the party's  views and line and apply them to our locality in an appropriate  manner. The Ha Tay Provincial CPV Committee always adheres to  this leadership thinking and carries out the task of leading the  efforts to consolidate national defense in the locality. These  are the major issues that Ha Tay Province always attaches  importance to and concentrates its leadership and guidance on:    I - To try to stabilize production and the living  standard, to create the people's political and spiritual  unity as the invincible line of defense in defending the  fatherland.    In the economic field, the characteristics of the province  --  nearly 80 percent of the population lives on farming in rural  areas -- requires that we concentrate our efforts on achieving  total development of agricultural production, with the central  point of interest being grain production. In 1993, our  production was 810,000 tons, exceeding the goal (800,000 tons)  set for 1995. The per capita average production increased from  317 kilograms/year (in 1990) to 365 kilograms/year (in 1993).  Our province granted the people the right to have long-term  steady use of land as early as mid-1992. Although land was a  pretty complicated issue due to many years of war and numerous  changes in the sizes of cooperatives and in land and rural  population, the fact that we assumed tight leadership over the  efforts to grant farmers the land right ensured maintaining of  stability and avoiding of disturbances and troubles. The  people who lived in rural areas and did not have any other  occupations, including active military personnel and workers and  civil servants transferred to the locality, all received land.  That was an important factor that enabled farmers to have  peace of mind and the enthusiasm for doing productive work.    In addition to agricultural production, the people of Ha Tay  have many handicraft occupations. In 1990 and 1991, because of  many difficulties, our production declined. Recently, the  province has strengthened its leadership; consolidated,  developed, and promoted all economic sectors; stepped up  industrial, small industrial, and handicraft production; and  succeeded in boosting the latter to account for more than 30  percent of the total value of agricultural and industrial  output, thus creating more jobs, raising the people's income,  and gradually increasing accumulation of wealth.    In the social field, in addition to correctly implementing  the social policies, we pay attention to gradually building the  new countryside: achieving "happy villages, harmonious  families." We do realistic work depending on the abilities of  individual villages and aimed at three goals: raising the  people's intellectual standard, strengthening community welfare,  and protecting national culture and the environment.    The province has so far remodeled 60 percent of its schools  to make them more good-looking; 100 percent of villages now have  their own dispensaries; more than half of village roads have a  brick or concrete surface; nearly 100 percent of villages have  provided homes with electricity and have installed wired radio  loudspeakers in their hamlets; some villages are creating their  own new cultural models, and so on. These are the realistic  measures aimed at creating the people's confidence in the  party's new positions and policies, and stopping and defeating  the enemy's "peaceful development."    In addition to caring about production and the standard of  living, we expand democratic activities among the people. We  have succeeded in urging wide and democratic participation of  the people in the periods of soliciting public opinion for  contributions to party congress documents, the Constitution,  state laws, National Assembly elections, and so on; we have  clarified, resolved, and dealt with in a timely manner the  people's petitions and issues of concern raised by the public.  As for the complicated cases, the "hot spots," the province  has provided all sectors and echelons with guidance in regard to  how to correctly evaluate the reasons behind any problems,  particularly behind any contradictions among the people, so as  to correctly handle them in accordance with the following  principle: As to all matters having to do with the people, they  must persistently rely on the people to resolve them at the  basic level, with cadres having to apologize to the people and  to behave accordingly after committing some mistakes. The key  leading cadres need to hold direct conversations with the people.    As a result, the "hot spots" were all safely resolved, thus  preventing the bad people from taking advantage of them and  avoiding quarrels among the people and a loss of their  solidarity. The fact that the rural areas became more stable  and the standard of living was improved has been a positive  contribution to the common stability in the province as a whole.    II - To build defense areas, to strengthen the  all-people national defense potential and combat posture.    1. The first job is to educate and mobilize all the  people and the entire political system for having the necessary  concept and knowledge regarding today's task of consolidating  national defense and maintaining security.    In various forms and with appropriate measures, Ha Tay has  gradually made its cadres, party members, and people clearly see  the enemy's wicked plots and tricks and at the same time grasp  the characteristics and new needs of the current task of  defending the fatherland. On this basis, it has been trying to  heighten vigilance and the spirit of responsibility and to build  a strong base so as to turn every village into a "fortress" and  every citizen into a warrior devoted to the defense of our  native land and the defense of the fatherland. It has plans  for closely linking national defense and security with the  political system to create a combined force and to be ready to  successfully deal with any peaceful-development tricks,  subversive and overthrowing action, or any daring acts on the  part of the enemy.    2. To do good planning for economic development through  the year 2000, to closely link economic development plans with  consolidation of national defense.    We all know that the economy and national defense have close  relationships and act on each other. How do we build the  economy in order to both strengthen the national defense  potential and create favorable conditions for national defense?  In our economy today, the state is the social operator and  manager and at the same time the major customer of economic  units. It uses the law to operate; policies and other tools to  act; and inevitably development plans to limit the negative  aspects, to make the people rich and the country strong, and to  hold steady the socialist movement. To achieve this, it  requires that the planning for economic development, now and in  the long term, be closely linked with national defense, with the  two strategic tasks being truly combined. This is an extremely  important issue in the planning and plans for socioeconomic  development. As to Ha Tay, a large province having over 2.2  million people, specific resources, and many good historical  monuments and natural sights, and being adjacent to the capital  city of Hanoi, it has planned and will plan for becoming a  province having an economic structure suitable for its  capabilities and conditions (concentrating on three main  sectors, namely, agriculture, industry, and tourism) and at the  same time being capable of maintaining national security and  creating favorable conditions for further strengthening  national defense. We have been paying attention to making  economic installations thoroughly understand the party views and  avoid being interested "solely in economic matters," going after  income at any cost, pursuing joint business and alliance in an  unprincipled manner, and thus weakening national defense and the  security of the locality and the country.    3. To build our armed forces strong in every way.    In the last few years, as we contributed to building a  well-trained regular revolutionary army being gradually  modernized, we set quality as the first requirement in our  recruiting and calling up people and at the same time made sure  that we fulfill the goals that the state had assigned to us.  In the years of 1992 and 1993, nearly 80 percent of our  recruits were in the good-health category; 94.3 percent of them  had cultural background of levels 2 and 3. In addition, we also  overfulfilled the goals set for recruiting people for military  schools. The numbers of people having passed the examinations  in Ha Tay accounted for 10 percent of the national total in 1992  and 11.3 percent in 1993.    To build the reserve force ready for mobilization was  considered a regular and long lasting important task. This was  a rather demanding job because it had to do with 25,000 people  in almost all villages and production installations; it required  a close combination; reasonably tight, neat, and professionally  correct arrangement; and good quantity and quality in regard to  both soldiers and cadres. Each year about 3,000 reserve officers  and soldiers were involved in periodical training and exercises.  Consequently, the party organizations and administrations at  all levels had to adhere to tight leadership and management, to  follow appropriate procedures and policies, and particularly to  do a good job in regard to providing the people and members of  the reserve force with good political and ideological education.    The militia and self-defense forces were further  strengthened, with quality being the main goal to be achieved;  they were organized in such a way as to be closely linked with  administrative headquarters and production units (hamlets,  villages, organs, enterprises) and to be of the right size  (about 1.5 percent of the population). Training had to be  realistic. The activities of these forces had to be linked  with protecting production and maintaining security and order at  the basic level; fees had to be paid by the collectives and  people to allow them to operate effectively and to strengthen  their organization on a regular basis.    4. To correctly implement the army's rear-area  policy.    Because this was a job that would directly affect the  building of the armed forces, party organizations,  administrations, and mass organizations at all levels, from  provincial to basic, attached a proper importance to it. The  province as a whole had more than 37,000 dead heroes and nearly  25,000 wounded soldiers. As the right to use land on a steady  and long-term basis was granted farmers, close-by and good  ricefields were given on a first-priority basis to families of  dead heroes and wounded soldiers, who were exempted from paying  any contributions. On the 45th anniversary of the 27-7 event  (in 1992), people in the province contributed money and energy  to repairing and building hundreds of cemeteries and a number of  monuments, built 500 affection-and-devotion houses and awarded  more than 10,000 savings books to the families of dead heroes  and wounded soldiers who had encountered difficulties, and took  100 percent of the seriously wounded soldiers (more than 500 of  them) into their homes and provided for them.    Although there still were shortcomings, the above-mentioned  deeds reflected a good effort and a total moral affectionate  behavior toward those people who had sacrificed their lives for  the independence and freedom of the fatherland and the happiness  of the people; they have brought a degree of peace of mind to  the people who are and will be fulfilling the military  obligation and to their relatives.    5. To closely coordinate the work between the locality  and the main-force units stationed in the province so as to  maintain security and to strengthen solidarity between the army  and the people.    At present, there are in Ha Tay Province many units of the  main-force corps [binh doan], arms and services, institutes,  officers' schools, storehouses, and national defense  enterprises. Both the locality and the army are paying proper  attention to the close coordination among them.    Party committee echelons at all levels, from provincial to  district, city, and village, have plans for coordinating their  work with these units in order to maintain security under any  circumstances. Local party committee echelons and  administrations, along with the heads of these units, hold  annual meetings to exchange ideas about realistic work aimed at  strengthening solidarity between the people and the army in the  new situation. Many units have wholeheartedly helped the  people to fight natural disasters, to protect production, to  build schools and affection-and-devotion houses, to get medical  treatment, and so on. On the other hand, many localities have  helped the army units to protect their barracks, storehouses,  and lines of communications, and to uncover and handle in a  timely manner any misuses of army properties.    For the time being, the localities and units are checking  the  areas and boundaries of land so as to report them to the  government, which will legitimize the right of the army to use  land and at the same time will put aside some land where it is  available for the construction of military families' residential  areas, and thus to create favorable conditions for gradually  stabilizing the family life of cadres of those units being  assigned for long-term stationing in the province.    Because national defense work is very important and has to  do with many aspects and many fields of activities, we must  ensure the party's absolute and total leadership, first of all  in regard to national defense views, line, and policies.    As we assume the national defense leadership in the  locality,  we pay attention to taking the following key steps:    - To correctly apply the party's renovation views on the  construction and defense of the fatherland so as to devise the  ways to strengthen national defense in the locality.    - To build the armed forces to make them truly clean and  strong, suitable for peacetime military organization, and ready  to satisfy wartime needs.    - To make plans for and train military cadres to make them  loyal and reliable people having strong determination, good  background, and the necessary knowledge of economic and  foreign-policy affairs.    - Through party building, to strengthen and fully control  party bases. To consider building party bases the important  part of the efforts to build and strengthen national defense and  security in the locality.    The state relies on the party line and policies, which are  formalized in the form of documents serving as laws and  regulations to be abided by all people, including party members,  as they fulfill their sacred obligation toward the defense of  the fatherland. The state must also take care of more  important practical matters, such as balancing the budget, and  the procedures and policies having to do with national defense  and create favorable conditions for the locality to be stronger  and stronger in terms of doing its national defense work.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Poroskov: "The Army Will Be Like Its </F> Officer Corps Will Be"]    [Text] The Army and Navy are above all the officer corps.  As it will be, so will be the Armed Forces, and the course of  reforms depends most of all on it. What are the officer cadres  like today? They represent more than 100 nationalities and about  80 percent are Russian. About 90 percent have a higher military  or specialized military education. More than 28 percent of the  officers have served in their positions for less than a year.    In comparison with the beginning of last year, the number of  officers in the Russian Armed Forces has declined by almost 8  percent, and the strength level of the Army and Navy was 85  percent of the required number of officer cadres (all figures  were as of the beginning of 1994).    A major problem for the Army was the mass discharge of young  officers up to 30 years of age. More than 95,000 of them left  the Armed Forces in 1990-1993 becuase of the disorder and the  loss of prestige in the service. People in this blossoming age  accounted for one-third of those discharged last year and more  than half in the Airborne Troops. About 5,000 people are at the  disposal of commanding officers, commanders of different  ranks--sometimes for three to six months.    Through the efforts, by no means insignificant, of the Main  Directorate for the Training and Distribution of Cadres [GUPiRK]  and local personnel agencies, it was possible to stop the  unplanned discharge of more than 20,000 people, and there was a  reduction of the number of officers going to sovereign states.  By the way, of the more than 13,000 who left last year for the  near abroad, [many] were young people who, as everyone knows,  are inclined to heed their emotions. Many, not being able to  reach the desired place, as they say, are besieging the  reception room of the Ministry of Defense of Russia and the  GUPiRK with requests that they be allowed to return. As a rule,  such people are not accepted, with the possible exception of  those who finish school not so long ago, provided that they are  not motivated by mercantile considerations.    There is still one other painful problem, the discharge of  officers who have reached the maximum age and who have a right  to a pension. Here last year's plan was fulfilled at 81 percent,  in part because the discharge of this category is more than made  up for locally by the discharge of young officers. Even of the  1,400 officers sent to other ministries and departments, more  than half are junior officers who turned out to be "superfluous"  despite the condition of being under strength.    As of today, there are about 10,000 officers who have  reached  the maximum age, and about 6 percent of them have "outgrown" the  limit by five years or more. If the plan for discharges is not  fulfilled, then by the end of the year, in the opinion of  Col.-Gen. Yevgeniy Vysotskiy, chief of the GUPiRK, almost  another 12,000 will be added to the present 10,000. Of course it  is necessary to maintain experienced cadres, but without thereby  forgetting about the prospects of young officers.    The condition of being under strength is partially being  compensated by women--there are more than 1,500 of them in  officer positions, mostly medical personnel and translators. A  new source of manpower acquisition is the voluntary service of  reserve officers under contract. Last year there were just 820  such volunteers, mostly specialists from the Ground Forces.  Apparently a minor help in the situation will be the call-up of  15,000 reserve officers in accordance with a justified edict of  the president of the Russian Federation. Even military  educational institutions as a basic source of manpower  acquisition can hardly fill one-fourth of the existing needs.    The enumerated problems can in part be explained by the not  always smooth introduction into operation of individual statutes  and articles of new laws on military questions, organizational  and personnel measures, the reduction of the numerical strength  of the forces, and the decline in the prestige of the individual  in service. But there are also shortcomings within the Army.  Many officers are dismissed from positions, primarily command  and staff positions. Last year 26 commanders of brigades,  regiments, and ships first rank were removed. In a number of  cases, the removal took place less than a year after  appointment. The reason clearly lies in the low quality of the  selection process. Hence the significant costs--a worthy  candidate who is not accepted, undermining of the faith of  subordinates in their commander, and a worsening of results as  well as expenditures in connection with the move to a new place  of service and so on.    It is also reasonable to seek the reason for this phenomenon  in the existing certification procedures. They were established  back in 1977 and refined somewhat in 1985, but, in the opinion  of the leadership of the GUPiRK, they have become obsolete.  Moreover the simultaneous one-time certification of all officers  will inevitably lead to elements of formalism. Work is being  done to prepare new guidance on the certification of officer  personnel. It will be announced by order of the minister of  defense, but after the putting into effect of the Statute on the  Order of the Performance of Military Service, which includes 68  articles and 8 chapters. The draft of this document has been  submitted to the Government of the Russian Federation and it  will also be introduced to the Duma for discussion.    Despite some expenditures and difficulties, the officer  corps  of the Russian Federation is gradually acquiring more definite  contours. A normative-legal base has been established in  principle, and the first stage in the transition to a contract  system has had a positive influence on the quality of the  officers. In a number of cases, it was possible to eliminate  "ballast" and the system of military education that was  disrupted with the collapse of the USSR has been fully restored.  The second stage of its reform has begun and a list of  specialties for which there is training in institutes of higher  education of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation  has been refined and put into effect.    Still, Col.-Gen. Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General  Staff, calls the situation with respect to military cadres  complex and ambiguous, one that requires timely and balanced  actions. Among the directions specified for work with cadres in  the longer term is the raising of professionalism, the  improvement of the system for manpower acquisition and training  of officers, and their social protection. But perhaps the main  thing is the preservation of the officer corps, without which, I  repeat, there is no Army.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Bogachev] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- It seems that strong  emotions expressed by some politicians from East-European  countries and the Baltic states demanding to immediately admit  them into the North Atlantic military alliance have failed to  shatter the position earlier assumed by the NATO member-states.    Documents pertaining to the "Partnership for Peace"  programme  signed by the heads of state and government of the NATO  member-states in Brussels on January 10 confirm provisions of  the 1949 Washington Treaty to the effect that NATO remains open  for other European states to join it. Participants in the  session of the North Atlantic alliance reiterated that the  expansion of the NATO to the east will be carried out on the  basis of an evolutional process and that countries claiming NATO  membership must first prove their capacity to "contribute to  ensuring security of the North Atlantic region."    The documents neither set any term for admitting new members  into the alliance, nor name probable candidates.    On the eve of the Brussels summit the U.S. president's aide  for National Security Anthony Lake declared that hasty admission  of new member-states into the alliance might lead to the  destabilisation of the situation in the European region, which  meets neither NATO's interests nor the interests of the states  of Central and Eastern Europe.    The U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher expressed the  opinion that none of the NATO member-states considers new  applicants to be prepared for membership in the alliance.    It seems that both the United States and other NATO  member-states are interested in maintaining existing tendencies  in countries, which formerly belonged to the Warsaw Treaty  Organisation, as well as Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic  states, and seek to fortify the current situation by military  and political measures. However, participants in the Brussels  summit realise that the immediate admission of new members into  the alliance will cause a negative response in Russia, since in  the long run, military alliances are usually targeted against  some state or a bloc of states.    The immediate admission of former Warsaw Treaty  member-states, with Russia being left out, might be seen as a  discriminatory and unfriendly step against the Russian  Federation. Such developments are not likely to strengthen  stability in Europe or democratic processes in Russia.    "Partnership for Peace" adopted at the NATO session in  Brussels is, perhaps, the best option of resolving uneasy  problems of the European security. This programme envisages a  number of measures of a military and political character for  ensuring security of the programme participants and maintaining  stability in the European region. These measures include joint  military operations with NATO member-states, joint planning and  joint military exercises, and envisage consultations with NATO  by any member-state of the "partnership" if it decides that it  is being threatened.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sawsan Abu-Husayn report: "Nabil Sha'th Tells AL-SHARQ </F> AL-AWSAT: Palestinian Foreign Affairs Will Not Be Under Israeli  Control"]    [Text] Cairo -- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, adviser to Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat, has confirmed that Yasir 'Arafat is  ready to take over the national authority this week. He said  that executive steps have already begun for the assumption of  national authority and that Palestinian police units will begin  to arrive in Gaza and Jericho. The vanguards of these forces,  he said, have reached the Egyptian-Palestinian border.    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Sha'th explained the  "agreement, emphasizing that it is much better than the  Declaration of Principles because there have been many  amendments. If those opposed to the agreement knew these  amendments well, they would change their minds because the  agreement is very different from the Declaration of Principles.  [quotation mark as published]    He stressed that the agreement was, for the first time,  signed by the PLO and the state of Israel and that it was agreed  to call the national authority the Palestinian Authority. That  authority will implement all the international agreements  concluded by the PLO. That authority, he said, will have the  right to take charge of foreign affairs, which, in other words,  will not be under Israeli control. The Palestinian Authority  will have the right to have representative offices abroad in  addition to the existing embassies of the state of Palestine  throughout the world.    As an example of the Palestinian Authority handling its own  foreign affairs, Sha'th cited the agreement he signed with U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher on aid in the transfer of  authority, to the tune of $5 million and 200 police vehicles.    He said the agreement consisted of three parts: The first is  the agreement itself, the second consists of four appendices,  and the third consists of exchanged letters. They complement  one another "and we can say that this agreement is a first step  that will lead to other steps related to Jerusalem, the  repatriation of refugees, the area of Jericho, and the  settlements." He added that "in the transitional period the PLO  will work on the Jerusalem issue to ensure that our rights in it  are not eroded."    He also said: The Palestinian-Israeli agreement is a prelude  to comprehensive peace based on Security Council Resolutions 242  and 338, and not as claimed by certain people who try to cast  doubt.    He descsribed what has been published about formation of an  authority council as mere speculation, noting that the PLO's  Executive Committee was in continuous session for the purpose of  setting up the authority.    On the powers of the Palestinian Authority, Sha'th said that  Palestinian officials would have a right to stop and detain an  Israeli suspect and then hand him over to the Israeli  authorities, and also prohibit possession of arms by members of  the public without a license.    On the date of 'Arafat's departure for Jericho, he said:  That will be announced minutes before it takes place.</p>

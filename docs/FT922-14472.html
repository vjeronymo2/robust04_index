It found that 88 per cent were satisfied with their treatment and 82 per cent with the time they were kept waiting. A similar study last year showed 67 per cent were happy with the time they waited. Harris questioned 1,079 voters who had received hospital treatment over the past two years, in 100 constituencies between last Thursday and Saturday.</p>

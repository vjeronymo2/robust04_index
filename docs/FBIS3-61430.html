Bulavenko; UDC 681.3.06] </F>   [Abstract] State-of-the-art in the development of computer  systems with massively-parallel architecture is reviewed.  Computers with a SIMD (single-instruction, multiple-data) and  MIMD (multiple-instruction, multiple-data) architecture are  briefly discussed. This category of architecture is subdivided  in a large number of sub-groups including: systolic massive  architecture, linear massive architecture, a matrix forming  processor massive, etc. The particular features of some  representative architectures and structures of high level  parallel processing with simple and complex processor elements  are examined. Along with various foreign made computers of  average capacity with complex processor elements, functioning of  the ``Intelligent Computer 1'' (IK-1) is described. This is a  parallel multiprocessor system, for general application,  developed in the Ukrainian AS Cybernetic Institute. Bit-  sequential processing and role of Hypercube, Theta-Network, and  Universal Readjustable type communication networks are also  discussed. Figures 3, references 50: 3 Russian, 47 Western</p>

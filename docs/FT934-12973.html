			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Investment trust option for Lloyd's  -A look at a limited liability choice Private investors are being offered the chance to put money into an entirely new kind of investment vehicle - the Lloyd's investment trust. In the wake of this week's vote by Lloyd's Names in favour of plans to admit 'corporate members', merchant banks and securities houses are pressing ahead with plans to lraise Pounds 1.25bn for 16 investment trusts. Although the structure of each of the trusts differs, the idea behind them is relatively simple. They will direct the money they raise into a portfolio of shares and bonds, in much the same way as with any other investment trust. At the same time, however, their capital will be used to support Lloyd's syndicates. If things go well, investors - like Lloyd's Names - can expect to earn a return both from investments and from underwriting. Syndicates can underwrite Pounds 2 in premium income for every Pounds 1 of capital, so the underwriting return alone could be very attractive. A 10 per cent return on underwriting would become a 20 per cent profit for the investor. By 1997, when the Lloyd's trusts report their first underwriting results - in line with Lloyd's three year accounting system - their dividends will include both investment and underwriting returns. Unlike Lloyd's Names, the new trusts will have limited liability for losses; investors are only liable to lose the amount of capital they have committed. However, just as the potential returns are highly 'geared', so are the risks. If underwriting syndicates lose money, investors will also suffer from a sharp fall in their income from investments as their capital is used to pay insurance losses. The recent record reveals that this risk is very real. Lloyd's has lost more than Pounds 6bn since 1988 and specialises in insuring higher risks such as aircraft, energy installations and natural catastrophes, which can produce large claims and volatile results for underwriters. Advocates for the new schemes argue, however, that profitability is returning as syndicates cut their costs and increase their rates. They argue that some syndicates have made attractive profits even over the last five years, and that over the longer-term, Lloyd's has proved to be more profitable than insurance companies specialising in lower risks like cars and houses. Chris Hitchings, analyst with UBS Global Research, calculates that between 1950 and 1989, Lloyd's syndicates were nearly twice as profitable as insurance companies. So how should investors decide between the trusts on offer? The trusts differ in size (ranging from Pounds 280m to just Pounds 8m); their approach to investments (with some managers favouring a higher exposure to equities and others a higher exposure to gilts); and their approach to syndicates (some favour a broader spread of syndicates, while others are more narrowly focused on certain syndicates or sectors). In addition they have different relationships with the Lloyd's agents that have traditionally controlled access to syndicates. CLM Insurance Fund, sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, aims to raise up to Pounds 200m. It has no direct links with either members' agents (which have traditionally handled the affairs of Names), managing agents (which administer syndicates) or combined agencies (which own both managing and members' agencies). Michael Wade, chief executive of CLM, says that agency links can lead to conflicts of interest. If a managing agent had links to an investment trust, he might persuade it to continue supporting his syndicate, even if it were performing poorly, for example. Wade says fund managers should have freedom to transfer their support to syndicates capable of earning the best returns for shareholders. Funds which are linked to members' agents may also have potential conflicts of interest. If a syndicate has a shortage of space, a members' agent would be likely to make the interests of its own Names a priority. Michael Carpenter, of the London Insurance Market Investment Trust (LIMIT), says: 'In the present market environment, schemes relying on members' agents have a conflict between their individual Names and corporate members.' LIMIT, which aims to raise Pounds 280m to support 98 syndicates, is jointly sponsored by Samuel Montagu and James Capel. Another scheme which has no agency links is New London Capital, sponsored by SG Warburg, and advised by Chartwell Re, the third largest fund formed to date, while the Johnson Fry Corporate Insurance Recovery Trust avoids the issue by buying the shares of a range of Lloyd's trusts. On the other hand, many smaller trusts have close links with agents. The schemes differ but their supporters argue that agency connections should give investors improved access to better performing syndicates. Examples include Angerstein Underwriting Trust and Delian Lloyd's Investment Trust, which have links with independent members' agents, and Hiscox Select Insurance Fund, which is connected to a combined agency. Bronek Masojada, of Hiscox, says: 'It would be foolish to deny the conflict, but our scheme brings investors increased access and better market intelligence'.</p>

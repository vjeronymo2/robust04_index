			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEAR SIR  </P> <P> Dear Sir: We haven't met but my father knew you  </P> <P> and spoke of you often, implying an intimacy  </P> <P> on which I perhaps presume. Soon now I too  </P> <P> must make a more formal visit, just as he  </P> <P> knocked, seemingly sure of being received.  </P> <P> I enclose a book I have written. It's mostly questions  </P> <P> he, perhaps, could answer. He once believed  </P> <P> we might communicate. Are there provisions?  </P> <P> If so, would you pass it on to him? If not,  </P> <P> I beg you to forgive the intrusion. We  </P> <P> are uncertain of the protocol. The thought,  </P> <P> whatever the form, is all of courtesy,  </P> <P> and in the hope of hearing from him again.  </P> <P> Till which, with your permission, I remain  </P> <P> etc., and for a while his son  </P> <P> and in some sense I suppose yours also --  </P> <P> John.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The third of "Four Poems," published in the fall, 1988, issue of the literary  quarterly New Letters, 5216 Rockhill Road, Kansas City, Mo. 64110. Miller  Williams, who was John Ciardi's close friend and publisher is now literary  executor of the estate, writes by way of preface: "When John Ciardi died on  Easter Sunday, 1986, he left thousands of pages of poetry in manuscript. Two  years of reading and sorting have been rewarded by a surprising number of  finished poems, a selection from which will be published the week of Easter,  1989, by the University of Arkansas Press. Among these, the most lyrical and  moving of any Ciardi wrote, are four about the God the poet quarreled with for  most of his life, wondering, complaining, loving, and denying. If some irony is  found in Ciardi's Easter death, it takes on a touching rightness in the light  of these poems."  </P></p>

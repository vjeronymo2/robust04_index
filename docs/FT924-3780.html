			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Evode surges 40% to Pounds 10.2m EVODE, the chemical and plastics group fighting a Pounds 94.3m hostile bid from Wassall, the mini-conglomerate, yesterday reported a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the 53 weeks to October 3. Mr Andrew Simon, chairman, said the profits increase, from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 10.2m, underlined the group's argument that Wassall's 80p a share offer undervalued the company. Sales of continuing activities increased to Pounds 239.9m (Pounds 228m). However, the results were overshadowed by Evode's admission that it had been in breach of its interest covenants relating to the Dollars 43m (Pounds 28m) unlisted US redeemable shares since March 1991. This information was not contained in the group's defence document sent to shareholders. Evode said the breach was not important since its two US preference shareholders, US West, one of the US 'baby Bell' telecommunications companies, and GE Capital had waived their rights from the breach of covenants to appoint a director to Evode's board. Mr Christopher Miller, chief executive of Wassall, said 'Evode should explain the breach to their shareholders. I think it is quite extraordinary that it was not mentioned in the defence document.' Divestments and a 17 per cent reduction in working capital reduced Evode's net borrowings from Pounds 46.1m to Pounds 28.5m, giving gearing of 50 per cent. The group also generated cash of Pounds 26.2m (Pounds 16.4m). Mr Simon said the group had rebutted Wassall's claims that Evode could not generate enough cash to finance its commitments while reducing borrowings. However, Mr Miller said the net debt figure excluded Pounds 40.7m of convertible preference shares and the US redeemable shares, which he argues should be included in the final debt figure. Mr David Winterbottom, Evode's chief executive, admitted that 'fashion has turned against the group' over whether the redeemable shares should or should not be included as debt. There was an extraordinary debit of Pounds 17m, being mainly the write-back of goodwill which had been charged through reserves in 1989. Operating profits for Evode's divisions comprised: adhesives and sealants Pounds 2.9m (Pounds 2.2m); polymer products unchanged at Pounds 4.2m; North America Pounds 7.9m (Pounds 5.5m); industrial coatings Pounds 300,000 loss (break-even); other products Pounds 100,000 loss (Pounds 200,000 profit). Earnings per share increased to 5.7p (3.8p). The final dividend is held at 1.8p making an unchanged total of 3.58p. See Lex</p>

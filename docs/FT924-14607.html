			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / German parliament to have Emu veto THE German government has accepted that the two houses of parliament in Bonn will in effect have the final say over the introduction of a single European currency, Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, said yesterday. Before Germany enters the final stage of Emu in 1997 or 1999, parliament will decide on whether the strict preconditions for full European economic and monetary union (Emu) have been fulfilled, he said. The agreement by the government to have such a debate has appeared inevitable since the summer, when the opposition Social Democrats made such a move a precondition for ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Mr Waigel, speaking in the first reading debate on ratification of the treaty, insisted such a vote did not mean a second chance to ratify or reject it, and did not amount to an 'opting out' clause like the special deal for Britain. He conceded, however, that the final stage of Emu, in 1997 or 1999, would not be automatic. 'An investigation of whether the treaty has been fulfilled is the decisive, final step before the beginning of economic and monetary union,' he said. 'Germany will not take part in any currency union in which not every member state has observed the treaty requirements . . . The German government needs a vote by the Bundestag before taking such a decision.' Mr Waigel was clearly at great pains to reassure a sceptical public about the future security and stability of a single European currency, even though a clear majority of the Bundestag is in favour of ratification of the Maastricht treaty.</p>

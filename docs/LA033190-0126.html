			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRIS EYES ARE SMILING AT THE ARBORETUM  </P> <P> If you want to experience the timeless beauty of irises, you might consider  making a reservation at the J. Paul Getty Museum for a look at Vincent van  Gogh's painting of "Irises."  </P> <P> But a simpler way to enjoy the splendor of these flowers would be to attend the  annual Iris Show today and Sunday at Los Angeles State and County Arboretum.  </P> <P> The show, sponsored by the Southern California Iris Society, will feature the  cream of the crop from Southland iris aficionados. The Artistic Division of the  show will display about 50 flower arrangements with irises.  </P> <P> The show also will be an excellent place to get acquainted with irises and  Southern California Iris Society members, who will be on hand to offer advice.  In addition, iris plants -- some in bloom -- will be for sale.  </P> <P> The iris has been savored and cultivated for centuries. In France, where it is  the national flower, the iris is known as fleur-de-lis and is the basis for the  coat of arms of the former French royal family.  </P> <P> The word iris comes from a Greek word meaning rainbow. Irises do come in a  rainbow of colors and combinations -- white, pink, lavender, blue, tan and  reddish-brown. But it is the shape of the blooms that sets irises apart from  other flowers.  </P> <P> The iris has three upright petals called standards and three lower drooping  petals called falls. The falls are frequently a different color from the rest  of the flower.  </P> <P> "Bearded" irises are so named because of a fuzzy patch on the upper part of the  falls, which is the beard; the patch is usually a different color from the rest  of the flower.  </P> <P> Irises are indigenous to the Northern Hemisphere; they do not occur naturally  south of the Equator. They thrive in a wide range of climatic conditions.  </P> <P> Irises fall into three basic classes: bearded, beardless and bulbous.  </P> <P> The bearded irises, the most popular type, produce the most spectacular blooms.  The beardless contain many species, the most important to Southlanders being  Pacific Coast irises, which are native west of the Sierra from Santa Barbara to  Washington. Bulbous irises include Dutch and Spanish irises and are generally  more important to florists than to home gardeners.  </P> <P> The bearded and beardless irises are grown from rhizomes that will produce for  several years without being disturbed, while bulbous irises grow from bulbs  that go dormant in the summer and should be lifted and then planted again in  the fall.  </P> <P> Irises have a large following in the United States, with the American Iris  Society ranking among the top horticultural societies.  </P> <P> This weekend's show will feature prime samples of early varieties of bearded  irises, some Pacific Coast irises and some of the little-known but beautiful  Aril and Arilbred irises. The latter, fairly difficult to grow, are mostly  grown by experts.  </P> <P> The Iris Society also will sponsor a show April 28 and 29 at Santa Anita  Fashion Park mall in Arcadia. This show will feature later-maturing varieties,  and rhizomes will be for sale.  </P> <P> The Southern California Iris Society Iris Show. Today, 11 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and  Sunday from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Los Angeles State and County Arboretum, 301 N.  Baldwin Ave., Arcadia, (818) 446-8251.  </P> <P> </P></p>

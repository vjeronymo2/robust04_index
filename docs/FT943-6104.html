			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: O&amp;Y arm in clash over debt shake-up The US arm of Olympia &amp; York moved yesterday to try to block an attempt by the administrator of its Canadian parent to frustrate the restructuring of its Dollars 5bn debts. O&amp;Y (USA)'s plan to complete its debt restructuring this year was thrown into doubt last Friday, when it emerged that the administrator of O&amp;Y Developments in Canada had moved to fire two of the subsidiary's directors. The Canadian parent, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992, owns 80 per cent of the US company's equity. The move to sack the directors was seen as an attempt to frustrate the US restructuring talks. The board of O&amp;Y (USA) resolved yesterday to contest the firings of Mr Richard Shinn, its chairman, and Mr Willard Butcher, the chairman of its finance committee. The relationship between the US subsidiary and its parent is governed by a protocol drawn up last year by Mr Cyrus Vance, a former US secretary of state. Under this agreement, the administrators' actions regarding the subsidiary can be challenged in US courts by the US company.</p>

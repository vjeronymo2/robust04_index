			<p>CSO     [Text] Bombay, February 4--The next launch of the polar  satellite launch vehicle (PSLV) is tentatively scheduled for  September or October, according to Dr S. Srinivasan, programme  director of the integrated launch vehicle programme of the  Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).    Speaking to this paper here today, Dr Srinivasan, an  aeronautical engineer who has masterminded ISRO's launch vehicle  programmes, said that the failure of last PSLV launch was due to  an error in the software.    Earlier, speaking at the annual symposium on "Space Research  in India: Achievements," organised by the Bombay Association of  Science Education (BASE), Dr Srinivasan said the space age had  come to stay in India and the objectives of India's space  programme would go a long way in meeting the needs of society.    He said that, in the development of satellite launch  vehicles, ISRO had gone step by step. "It has to be developed in  a cost effective manner," he told teachers who had come from  different parts of Maharashtra.    Some of India's top aerospace scientists like Dr George  Joseph, director, space applications centre, Ahmedabad, and Dr  Ramachandran, deputy director of ISRO's Satellite Centre, are  attending the three-day symposium at the Nehru Science Centre.    Dr Srinivasan said the development of a launch vehicle  involved numerous disciplines like aeronautics and mechanical  engineering. He said there would be one more launch of the  augmented satellite launch vehicle (ASLV) later this year and  work had begun on the geo-synchronous satellite launch vehicle  (GSLV).    Emphasising the need of the ASLV programme, he said, it  enabled space scientists to test various systems. "We need  cryogenic engines and we will have it," said Dr George Joseph,  while inaugurating the symposium.    Emphasising the importance of self-reliance in the field of  launch vehicles, he said, the failure of the PSLV would help one  to improve and correct mistakes.    He said that, 30 years ago, when India launched its space  programme people doubted its wisdom. But, when they watch TV  programmes they realise its benefits, he said.    Dr George Joseph later spoke to the audience about remote  sensing programmes and its advantages.    In his presidential remarks, the director of the Homi Bhabha  Centre for Science Education, Mr V.G. Kulkarni, said that Indian  teachers were as good as those in foreign countries.    The director of the Nehru Science Centre, Dr R.M.  Chakraborthy, welcomed the gathering and the secretary of BASE,  Mr P.K.G. Nair, proposed a vote of thanks.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Companies call for merger inquiry reform PROCEDURES for in-vestigating monoplies and mergers by the UK competition authorities are slow in focusing on the real issues, involve duplication of effort and impose an unnecessary burden on managements over an extended period, according to a survey by accountants Ernst &amp; Young. The survey of 25 companies involved in recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiries found the Office of Fair Trading was thought to be too quick to initiate inquiries and gave inadequate explanations of the reasons for references to the commission. The companies also felt the commission collected too much detailed information and that there was a lack of commercial awareness in the OFT and the commission. They also felt that MMC inquiries were too wide-ranging. Issues of little relevance were often left open at a late stage of the inquiry. The majority of the companies felt the OFT and the commission should be merged but many of them wanted to preserve the MMC's independent role. Ernst &amp; Young recommends that OFT investigations should be more in-depth so that they can be either terminated before referral to the commission or passed on for a shorter inquiry. In the recent green paper Abuse of Market Power the government indicated that it planned to increase the OFT's investigatory powers and give the MMC responsibility for handling appeals against decisions of the director-general of fair trading rather than undertaking an investigation itself. Ernst &amp; Young welcome these proposals but say they do not go far enough as they only affect anti-competitive practice and restrictive trade practices investigations. It says there is no logic in merger and monopoly investigations still being undertaken by the commission following an OFT investigation. The accountants say their proposals would significantly reduce the average length of inquiries as well as avoiding unnecessary duplication.</p>

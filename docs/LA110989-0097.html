			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN THRIVES ON PLANTS THAT SELDOM DRINK;  </P> <P> CONSERVATION: XERISCAPE, A WATER-SAVING CONCEPT USING DROUGHT-RESISTANT PLANTS,  IS BEING PROMOTED IN MANY CITIES, ALTHOUGH LONG BEACH IS NOT ONE OF THEM.  </P> <P> Jane Fleming bent down to rub some leaves from one of her short sage plants,  leaving a mint-like scent on her fingers.  </P> <P> "Just smell that. In the morning and at night, with the dew, there's just a  beautiful, beautiful aroma," Fleming said of the small garden surrounding her  Belmont Shore home.  </P> <P> Fleming's garden is healthy and green and aromatic. Her plants have thrived  despite the fact that the last time she watered them was on Labor Day, and the  next time she waters will be June of 1990.  </P> <P> The Long Beach resident has a "xeriscape," an increasingly popular type of  garden that combines various landscaping principles aimed at conserving water.  </P> <P> In Greek, the word xeros means dry. But that does not translate to a bunch of  cacti, tumbleweeds and rocks, xeriscape enthusiasts quickly point out.  </P> <P> In Fleming's garden, for example, there are drought-resistant plants with red,  purple and blue flowers that need only occasional watering and are more  suitable to the desert-like climate of Southern California.  </P> <P> It is a concept that is catching on in cities such as Los Angeles and Santa  Monica, where officials adopted xeriscape ordinances last year, and in Irvine  and other parts of southern Orange County, where new developments feature  better irrigation methods, mulches and plants that need less water.  </P> <P> But in places such as Long Beach, city officials do little to educate people  about the option of xeriscapes.  </P> <P> "Some cities have done nothing at all," said Phil Hitchcock of the Metropolitan  Water District of Southern California. "Long Beach, for example, has no  requirements that I'm aware of. I was not able to find anything for Anaheim and  Fullerton, either. (Such cities) encourage low-water use plants, but it's more  lip service than a requirement."  </P> <P> Steve Ehren of the Long Beach Water Department acknowledged that "it's  something we could do more of."  </P> <P> "I don't want to say that Long Beach is not doing anything," said Ehren, the  department's safety and training officer. He noted that the city has an  emergency water conservation plan that would go into effect in the event of a  drought, and officials have also promoted water conservation in restaurants and  through garden shows. In addition, the city has a xeriscape garden around its  own Water Department building at 1800 E. Wardlow Road.  </P> <P> But it was not through the city that Fleming heard of xeriscapes. Earlier this  year, the retired schoolteacher received a visit -- and a lesson in water  conservation -- from John Griffith, a former student who is now a wildlife  biologist.  </P> <P> "It makes absolutely no sense to plant anything that was not there to begin  with," Griffith said from his home in Michigan. "Everything that happens in her  native garden will keep everything under control." For example, fleas, ants and  snails will stay away because they don't like to eat native California plants,  Griffith explained.  </P> <P> "If you have native plants, which are the pyramid of wildlife, you'll attract  native animals, like butterflies and lizards and hummingbirds," Griffith said.  </P> <P> The idea of a xeriscape is to use landscape designs and plants that fit the  natural environment. Using mulch, for example, keeps soil moist and reduces  watering and evaporation.  </P> <P> The right kind of sprinkler can also make a difference, said Hitchcock, the  principal analyst in the water district's conservation management division. A  drip or trickle irrigation system using narrow, porous tubes that slowly soaks  plants' roots can cut water use by 20% to 50%.  </P> <P> In Southern California, about 50% of the average household's water bill is  spent on watering outdoor landscapes.  </P> <P> "Water is a finite source that will become increasingly expensive as we face  droughts," said Jim Van Haun, a spokesman for the Orange County Water District.  Most of the xeriscape push in Orange County is toward the south, where most of  the new development is taking place, Van Haun said.  </P> <P> The Municipal Water District of Orange County, the primary importer of water  for the county, has sponsored for the last eight years an annual xeriscape  conference, which attracts several hundred landscape architects, contractors,  irrigation specialists, gardeners and homeowners, according to a spokeswoman.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, where city officials adopted a comprehensive ordinance last  year in hopes of conserving water, new developments must submit landscaping  plans that meet a xeriscape point system, said John Stodder, the environmental  affairs adviser to Mayor Tom Bradley.  </P> <P> The city of Santa Monica also adopted a xeriscape ordinance last year affecting  new commercial and multifamily construction that includes landscaping. The new  law limits lawn area to 20% of the landscaping, urges grouping plants with  similar water needs together and calls for the use of water-conserving plants  and efficient irrigation systems, said Atossa Soltani, the city's water  conservation coordinator.  </P> <P> Around the Santa Monica City Hall there are three such gardens, which Soltani  said cost no more to plant than a regular garden but save the city money in  both water and maintenance. Several times a year, busloads of visitors gather  at City Hall and then tour homes with xeriscape gardens in a city-sponsored  tour, Soltani said.  </P> <P> Doug Welsh, president-elect of the National Xeriscape Council, said he has not  had to do much to promote the idea of planting a garden that saves water and  work. In 1978, there was only one educational program in the country promoting  xeriscapes. Today, such programs exist in 36 states, Welsh said from his office  in College Station, Texas.  </P> <P> "We don't even have to try to sell it. It's selling all over the nation," Welsh  said. "Xeriscape is beautiful landscaping. Xeriscape, to me, will one day  replace the word landscape."  </P> <P> WHO TO CALL  </P> <P> For more information and brochures on xeriscape and water conservation call:  </P> <P> * Long Beach Water Department, 426-5951  </P> <P> * Municipal Water District of Orange County, (714) 973-1023  </P> <P> * California Native Plant Society, South Coast Chapter, 378-4715  </P> <P> * California Native Plant Society, Santa Monica Mountains Chapter, 933-893  </P> <P> * National Xeriscape Council Inc., (409) 845-7341  </P></p>

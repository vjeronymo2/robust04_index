Souter should not be treated as a politician and asked about his  personal views on high court rulings during his confirmation hearing. Tom  Jipping, a representative of the group, which backs Souter, said the Senate  Judiciary Committee "should not demand (that Souter) bias himself in public" on  issues he would deal with as a member of the high court. The Souter hearing is  expected to open on Sept. 13.  </P></p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / NZ ahead of target in squeezing inflation THE New Zealand Reserve Bank said yesterday that the country's inflation fell more sharply than expected last year, to levels not expected until 1993. Inflation fell to minus 0.02 in December. The bank, which was given responsibility for handling monetary policy in pursuit of low inflation in 1988, was not supposed to achieve nil to 2 per cent inflation till 1993. Releasing the latest six monthly outlook yesterday, the bank governor, Dr Don Brash, said that 'with hindsight, there could be some validity' in accusations that the bank's monetary targets had been too tight and that this had caused extra business difficulties. The creeping 4 per cent devaluation, since late November, could have been done earlier, he declared. However, he argued that the bank had eased monetary policy substantially during the year. Had the bank acted earlier, the wrong signals might have been sent to the markets about its commitment to low inflation. The bank predicts renewed inflationary pressures following the recent devaluations, and Dr Brash pointed out that the bank would not hesitate to tighten monetary policy. Current settings are comfortably on track to achieve the 1993 target, laying a sound foundation for an improvement in New Zealand's growth prospects. Dr Brash added that underlying inflation rate was estimated to have fallen to an average 1.7 per cent in 1991. It could fall lower over the coming months, before rising to reach a peak of about 3 per cent next year.</p>

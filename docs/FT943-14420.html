			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: Cummins Engine chief stands down Cummins Engine, the US diesel engine maker has laid the groundwork for its executive succession following the announcement that Mr Henry Schacht, chief executive officer, will step down. Mr Schacht has held the top management post at Cummins for 21 years, during which time he has successfully battled to keep the manufacturing company profitable in the face of global competition and domestic economic downturns. He will be replaced by Mr James Henderson, currently Cummins' chief operating officer. Mr Schacht will retain his post as chairman and Mr Henderson will keep his title of president. Mr Theodore Solso, now a Cummins executive vice-president, will assume Mr Henderson's old post of chief operating officer, putting him in line for the chairmanship. Mr Schacht, 59, said he was standing down now, rather than at 65, so the company would avoid the double resignation which would occur if he and Mr Henderson retired simultaneously in six years. 'This management transition reflects the Cummins tradition of orderly change,' Mr Henderson said. 'Henry Schacht and I have worked together for 30 years. 'The transition plan he has developed in concert with the board preserves our working partnership, guarantees management continuity, and assures the ongoing consistent execution of Cummins' highly successful business strategy.'</p>

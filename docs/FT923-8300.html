			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / An anxious dawn for Glorious Twelfth SPORTSMEN and landowners will be anxiously scanning the skies over Scotland and northern England early today as the Glorious Twelfth brings the opening of the grouse shooting season. Shooters are always anxious because the fast jinking birds are extremely hard to hit. Their hosts are worried because commercial prospects this year are mixed. In some parts of Scotland the Twelfth may be marred by a shortage of young grouse, the result of a poor breeding season. On the moors of Yorkshire and Northumberland, grouse are more abundant, but in places the stock has been ravaged by strongylosis, a perennial grouse disease. Yet in spite of recession and the wounds inflicted on some members of the upper-middle classes by losses at Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, demand for grouse shooting has held up reasonably well, according to Mr Peter Hudson of Game Conservancy, the advisory body. While some Britons may not be shooting, the French, Italians and Germans are coming back in force, as are US shooters who booked before the dollar collapsed. The cost to a shooter of driven grouse shooting works out at between Pounds 60 and Pounds 80 a brace (pair), so a group of eight guns may pay Pounds 7,000 for a 100-brace day. Yet according to Mr Malcolm Borthwick (pictured above, with gun) who operates a grouse moor at Raeshaw, south of Edinburgh, 'the viability of the operation is as fragile as ever'. In the cruel economics of grouse shooting, game dealers, who may today offer Pounds 20 for a brace of shot grouse, may be paying only Pounds 4 when the season is in full swing. As always the Savoy Hotel in London will be offering grouse shot at dawn for lunch today, charging between Pounds 9.50 and Pounds 10 a bird.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters believed that the Secretary should provide timeframes and procedures by which to notify borrowers of their approval or denial of loan forgiveness eligibility. The commenters were also interested in knowing the timeframes and procedures that the Secretary will adopt to notify the holder regarding which borrowers will receive forgiveness and when the holder will be given the appropriate funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The borrower will be informed of his or her eligibility for loan forgiveness by the Secretary in a timely manner. The Secretary will take appropriate steps to inform holders of proper procedures. However, the Secretary notes that without knowing the amount of appropriations, if any, that might be available for the forgiveness program and the potential number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of recipients, it is impossible to define those methods in these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters expressed concern about borrower confusion regarding the borrower's repayment obligation if the borrower is eligible for loan forgiveness. The commenters were worried about the period of time between when a borrower applies for loan forgiveness and the holder's receipt of the loan forgiveness payment from the Secretary. The commenters wanted to know how the servicer would be notified that the borrower's loan or loans are eligible for loan forgiveness and whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower would be required to continue to make regular monthly payments in the time period between the loan forgiveness application submission and payment from the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary recognizes the potential problems created by this structure. Because this program is not an entitlement, the Secretary cannot promise an otherwise eligible borrower that funding will be available to award a percentage of loan forgiveness. Therefore, the Secretary reminds the commenters that the borrower is still in repayment on his or her loan, regardless of eligibility for the loan forgiveness unless he or she is in an authorized deferment or forbearance period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter wanted to know if a borrower could participate in both a state forgiveness program as well as this demonstration program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12571  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) precludes a borrower from receiving a loan cancellation benefit under both that program and this loan forgiveness program, the Secretary believes that a borrower participating in the loan forgiveness program under &sect;682.215 is eligible to participate in state forgiveness programs, where allowable by the state.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.215(b)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters believed that in the instances where a defaulted borrower made satisfactory repayment arrangements on the loans in default, a borrower should be allowed to have those defaulted loans forgiven as well. The commenters believed that if the motivation behind the demonstration program was to encourage borrowers to enter into public service, then defaulted borrowers could be further enticed into public service by being allowed to ``work off'' their defaulted loans as well as those not in default.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This issue was thoroughly discussed at the negotiated rulemaking sessions that preceded publication of the NPRM. Given that there may be limited or no funding for this program, the Secretary felt that it would be inappropriate to provide this benefit on loans that are still in default.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter recommended that the Secretary and the guaranty agencies establish a way to easily verify that satisfactory repayment arrangements had been made on a loan that is to be considered eligible for loan forgiveness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary encourages guaranty agencies to provide appropriate information to lenders regarding a borrower's loan status. Additionally, the Secretary anticipates that the National Student Loan Data System will assist in providing this type of information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

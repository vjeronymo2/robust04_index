			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Capitalism at Christmas The world is about to celebrate the most capitalist Christmas in history. Never in 2,000 years has the doctrine of the free market spread so widely across the globe. Communism has been buried, socialism is in deep retreat, and even the hardiest proponents of social democracy are beset by doubt. Adam Smith has vanquished Marx, immobilised Keynes, and turned many thoughts away from Jesus. As to the latter, it may be remarked that while capitalism is by no means incompatible with Christianity, the growth of individualism has been accompanied by a decline in attendance at church. Just as religion is on the defensive, so also democracy and political pluralism, two important doctrines associated with capitalism, are being taken up with less enthusiasm, and in fewer countries, than the system of wealth creation that is now everywhere regarded as the most effective that humanity has yet devised. No known alternative stands ready for the choosing. The present strength of free enterprise is derived in part from the influence over the past 40 years of the Gatt regime, which liberalised trade and unleashed the power of free markets everywhere. The former Soviet polity, so recently a global threat, simply collapsed under the spectacle of such awesome competition. Christmas 1993 follows hard on the heels of new trade accords, which set up a successor to Gatt, and moved trade liberalisation to a higher gear. The result of the successful completion of the Uruguay Round is likely to be an acceleration of production, a greater accumulation of man-made assets, and an entrenchment of the market as the dominant economic force on the face of the planet. Imperfect force It remains, however, an imperfect force. Even the middle classes, who have benefited most from economic growth, are wrestling with unease. Those in jobs fear that they may lose what they have, while those outside note that however rich the super-rich may get, large-scale unemployment persists. Lower down the income scale the picture is far worse. The 1980s created losers as well as winners, as can be seen on the pavements of cities across Europe and the US. In many cases the poor have become poorer, relatively in some countries, absolutely in others. About two-thirds of the world's population have gained little or no substantial advantage from rapid economic growth. In the developed world, the lowest quartile of income earners has witnessed trickle-up rather than trickle-down. Rapid changes The temptation is to respond by calling for a return to some of the comfortable 'certainties' of the past. That would be a mistake. The poor existed under communism, and do even in Europe's most advanced social democracies. The world is changing rapidly; the Atlantic nations in general and Europe in particular face competition from the younger, harsher, more robust capitalism of south Asia. If welfare capitalism is to be sustained, its managers must find new means of controlling its cost, and minimising the cost to employers. Radical policies, centred around the notion of giving the poor a hand-up rather than a hand-out, must be pursued. There will always be clumsy starts, as with Britain's Child Support Agency, which pursues absent fathers for maintenance payments. Such initial difficulties should not deter politicians and economists from seeking to ensure that the fruits of capitalism do indeed reach the lower quarter of western society, as well as the global two-thirds. The evident need is to find new structures that provide accountability, transparency, choice and genuine care for those who cannot manage for themselves. New methods have to be devised at a cost that is not so high that the productive strength of the rest of the economy is drained away. This is easier said than done. Christmas is a time when sentimentality may be guiltlessly enjoyed. But the true spirit of the festival requires that those who desire an economic success built upon something other than foundations of much misery and deprivation engage in the search for policies which are both hard-headed and ethical. Human economic history has not ended with the triumph of the free market. It has hardly begun.</p>

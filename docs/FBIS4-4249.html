			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Li Shiyi (2621 0013 5030): "Why It Is Necessary </F> To Pay Special Attention to Agriculture and Rural Stability"]    [Text] Shortly after the conclusion of the annual National  People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council invited party and government leaders of various  provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to a forum to  discuss agricultural production and rural work. The forum made  it clear from the beginning that stabilizing agriculture and  rural areas is viewed as a basic condition for the smooth  implementation of various major reform measures; for the  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national  economy; and for creating a good economic environment and a  stable social environment.  <H5>  Agriculture and Rural Areas Affect Overall Situation </H5>   Five months ago, in October 1993, the central leadership  convened a rural work meeting and announced 12 major policies,  which were widely welcomed by millions of peasants and  grass-roots cadres. The meeting played an important role in  stabilizing agriculture and rural areas. But problems in  agriculture were not totally solved. Shortly after the important  meeting, something happened: Prices of grain and oil increased  in the south, and the tendency spread from the south to the  north and to the whole country. Increases in grain and oil  prices triggered increases in the price of foodstuffs,  vegetables, daily necessities, services, and industrial goods,  thus, causing a sense of uneasiness among urban and rural  residents. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council  detected the situation promptly and adopted decisive measures.  Various localities swiftly transferred grain and oil to check  rising prices, quickly stabilizing the situation and ushering in  a safe and sound Spring Festival.    This increase in grain and oil prices occurred after a  bumper  harvest. Outsiders were puzzled, and insiders viewed it as an  alarm.    So what is the warning given by the alarm? The warning, in  the final analysis, is that we should never "despise  agriculture."    The CPC Central Committee attaches great importance to  agriculture and stability in the rural areas. In early March, a  national meeting on development and helping the poor was  convened in Beijing, and General Secretary Jiang Zemin delivered  a speech. When he came to the importance of agriculture, he  frankly said that grain must maintain three kinds of stability  and two kinds of balance: stability of farmland under grain,  stability of output, and stability of stock, and a balance of  total quantity and balance among the regions.    General Secretary Jiang stressed: Grain is a special  commodity which has a bearing on the national economy and the  people's livelihood, as well as being a strategic material which  affects social stability. Party committees and governments of  various levels must always pay close attention to grain, which  is a big issue that has a bearing on the overall situation. His  speech revealed the importance attached by the party and the  country to stabilizing the overall situation, while stable grain  production and supplies are a guarantee for stabilizing the  overall situation. This is a long way from just talking  generally about the status and role of grain.    Before this, at the end of January, the central leadership  held a national work meeting on the "shopping basket" and grain  and oil to unify understanding, sum up lessons and experiences,  and adopt measures to increase supplies of farm and sideline  products to ensure market supplies and price stability.    At present, the central leadership has convened a work  meeting on rural areas once again, as well as many other  meetings to repeatedly stress the stability of agriculture and  the rural areas. Some people ask: Is there a problem in this  area? But it does not seem so, for the overall economic  situation is quite good!    The CPC Central Committee and the State Council are  displaying great foresight and are proceeding from the overall  situation; they see a big problem in economic operations.  <H5>  Regarding Industry as Superior to Agriculture Is Indeed a </H5> Cause for Worry    It is true that we have had bumper harvests over the past  several years. Last year was another year of bumper harvests, a  year in which, except for cotton and sugar, output of grain,  oil, meat, eggs, and aquatic products all increased. The annual  grain output exceeded 900 billion jin, a historical record. The  bumper harvests and economic prosperity in rural areas have  created conducive conditions for the sustained development of  the whole national economy, and this is visible to all.    Why must we worry about such good conditions?    Is it because of the panic buying of grain and oil and price  increases last winter? But they have subsided since then!    Outsiders have calmed down, but insiders have not been able  to do so. There are indeed some agricultural production  problems in our country's rural areas that cannot be neglected,  and among them some are very acute: First, paddy rice output in  the south has decreased; second, cotton output in the north  keeps dropping; and third, peasants' incomes are increasing  slowly while food prices are increasing rather rapidly.    Through the phenomenon of decreasing grain and cotton  output, we may see that new conditions and new problems have  arisen in agricultural production, the rural economy, and social  development, and if they are not solved promptly, they could  affect the overall situation. Farmland under grain and cotton  in some provinces and regions has decreased, and output has  dropped. Growing grain is not as good as running industry and  commerce, economic returns are low, peasants' enthusiasm for  growing grain and cotton has decreased, and farmland has become  idle. In particular, some developed regions in the south have  developed their economies, but their grain output has dropped,  and people in some "lands of plenty" have no rice to eat. The  economic pattern where historically "grain is transferred from  the south to the north" is being replaced by a pattern where  "grain is transferred from the north to the south."    Heaven is not to blame for shrinking cotton production in  the  north and grain in the south: it is a problem caused by humans.  And this human problem is manifested mainly by "regarding  industry as superior to agriculture" in many localities. "It  takes more than one cold day for the river to freeze three feet  deep." They offer lip service when they say they attach  importance to agriculture; they take action when they say they  attach importance to industry and commerce. Good farmland has  been used to build factories or has been closed for  "development." The eating away of agricultural resources,  inadequate agricultural inputs, and so on are not individual  phenomena. We may say that looking down on agriculture has  already become a very acute and general phenomenon in current  social and economic life.    A certain viewpoint has become very popular in many  economically developed regions, that is, in the market economy,  so long as they become rich first and have money in their hands,  they do not have to worry about a lack of grain. At a national  grain trading fair last year, a majority of the grain was bought  and taken away by provinces in the south, and 80 percent of the  grain was corn. People in the south mainly eat rice, and corn  can only serve as feed when they buy it and bring it back and  cannot alleviate the shortage of badly needed "cooking rice."  This is a lesson for people who dream about "transferring grain  from the north to the south" and relying on others to grow grain  for them.    There are also some people who think that if the domestic  market is unreliable, we can rely on the international market,  and that so long as we have hard currency in our hands, we do  not have to worry about having nowhere to buy grain. Experts  warn that this is not a way out either. Last year, rice exports  worldwide were about 28 billion jin, which is 80 percent of the  annual rice output of Jiangsu Province. Can this small quantity  of rice meet the urgent needs of a big country such as China?  Also, we have to consider that grain is an international  strategic material and relying on foreign countries means being  controlled by others.    Grain is a problem which must be solved by our own efforts!  <H5>  One Magic Weapon To Stabilize Prices </H5>   Decreasing cotton output in the north and grain output in  the  south have taken place against a background of consistently high  inflation, and the two phenomena have a mutual cause and results  and intensify each other. This situation once again reminds the  people of the country that agriculture is the basis of the  national economy, that stability in the rural areas is the basis  of the stability of society in the whole country, and that the  status of agriculture, the rural areas, and the peasants has a  bearing on the national economy, the people's livelihood, and  the stability of the overall situation.    This year is a crucial year of reform, and both reform and  development need a more relaxed environment. But the price  index has stayed at a relatively high level for two consecutive  years and this is not a relaxed environment. In light of this  situation, Premier Li Peng made a speech at the national work  meeting on the "shopping basket" and grain and oil, expressing  the party and government's concern. Premier Li Peng said that  large price increases are not good for either reform or  development. Maintaining social stability is a prerequisite for  deepening reform and promoting development, whereas properly  doing "shopping basket" work and grain, cotton, and oil work is  of great significance to maintaining social stability. This  year is a year in which our country's economic system reform  will take an important step forward. Smoothly carrying out the  reform requires social stability and stability in the minds of  the people. Big price increases will disturb the people's minds  and cause social instability, affect the smooth process of  reform, and have an adverse impact on the overall development  situation of the national economy. Therefore, controlling  inflation has become an important duty for the government this  year and has been written into the Government Work Report.    How can inflation be controlled? Economists think that  first, we must strictly control the scale of investment in fixed  assets, and second, implement tight financial and monetary  policies. These two measures have already been implemented, but  it will not be easy to control this year's price index within 10  percent.    Is there any other good measure. Yes. One good measure is  to steadily develop agriculture and increase supplies of farm  products. At the end of the 1970's, we began reform in the rural  areas; as a result, agricultural output increased year after  year, rural and urban markets were extremely busy, and reform in  the urban areas became imminent. In the second half of 1989, in  order to curb inflation, the national economy entered a  three-year period of rectification and improvement; because of  bumper harvests in consecutive years, the sustained development  of the rural economy was possible, and the national economy then  changed to a pattern of rapid growth, with the growth rate  exceeding 13 percent for two consecutive years.    Historical experience shows that in a populous country as  big  as ours, the supply of farm products always has a bearing on the  overall situation. For example, 70 percent of the light  industrial products in our country need farm products as raw  materials. When there is a shortage in the supply of farm  products, and thus a rapid increase in their prices, this  triggers inflation. Therefore, to stabilize prices in the  market, we must proceed from grasping the supply of farm  products. A majority of people in our country's rural and urban  areas have relatively low incomes, and they spend most of their  money on daily consumer goods. Prices of grain, oil, and  foodstuffs directly affect their lives. Therefore, grasping the  "rice bag" and "shopping basket" are effective measures to check  inflation. When there is an abundant supply of farm products,  people feel at ease, and the country is then peaceful.</p>

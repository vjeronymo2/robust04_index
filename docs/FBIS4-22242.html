			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Excerpts from the DEN Analytical Center's report on </F> potential presidential contenders in Russia: "Who Comes After  Yeltsin?"]    [Text] It is symptomatic that the leading world  research centers follow increasingly attentively the dramatic  struggle unfolding in the Russian Federation in anticipation of  President Yeltsin's imminent departure from the political scene.  More and more materials on this topic appear on the pages of the  50 most influential periodicals of the world's leading counties.  Questions regarding the current Russian president's state of  health can be heard increasingly often at press conferences of  Western statesmen returning from Moscow....    Meanwhile, the corrupt Russian "democratic"  publications and television continue cheerfully to maintain that  "everything is okay" with Yeltsin. The DEN Analytical Center's  experts, using some methodology of the contents, morphological,  and factor analysis, have studied and sifted through hundreds of  materials published in the mass media, as well as research and  forecasting reports prepared by various science institutions and  special services on the problem "Yeltsin and Who Comes After  Him?"    Below are some excepts from this report.  <H5>  Why Yeltsin Will Soon Leave </H5>   In keeping with the current Constitution, new presidential  elections are scheduled for 1996. Most serious analysts both in  Russia and abroad, however, including CIA "Kremlinologists,"  believe that new presidential elections most likely will take  place much earlier.    The reason is increasingly intensifying problems related to  B. Yeltsin's health. In the assessment of American and German  physicians, the current master of the Kremlin suffers from  pathological changes in the brain caused by complications  following an acute middle ear infection, liver cirrhosis, renal  insufficiency, and lately also rapidly progressing stenocardia.  He periodically undergoes hemodialysis (blood transfusions) and  can no longer maintain a regular work schedule. B. Yeltsin's  periods of normal state of mind increasingly often give way to  deep depression, which can cause certain changes in the logic of  thinking and brings persistent thoughts of suicide. Since  February 1993, the president has had to rest and undergo  treatment for 15 days on average every month.    B. Yeltsin also has fully expended himself as a politician;  in principle, he is no longer able to offer anything to lead the  country out of the wide-scale, systemic crisis (proof of that is  the president's February state of the union address). Having  finally realized the meaninglessness of the October bloody  massacre and the inexorable impending economic collapse, B.  Yeltsin has found himself in political zugzwang. Trying to  maneuver, he only creates the appearance of activity, although  in reality he can no longer change anything even if wanted to.  He simply does not have the proper tools for this: The state  apparat has been practically destroyed by him and his inner  circle in the course of "democratic" purges and "reforming,"  while the remnants of this apparat are extremely corrupt and the  economy is inexorably sliding into a coma, since the real  administrative levers have been lost in the course of Gaydar's  "reforms."    The president's inner circle is perfectly well aware that B.  Yeltsin is broken morally and psychologically, and contemplate  increasingly often his early resignation (according to Sergey  Filatov). What keeps him from this is probably the fear of  culpability--not so much in a moral as in a criminal sense, the  charges of which the new authorities may bring against him  regardless of their political coloration.    In addition, he may be forced to resign under the pressure  of  a mass protest movement, caused by potential avalanche-like  enterprise stoppages, the blood clots of insolvency, growing  unemployment, and a sharp decline in the standard of living.  Strikes and serious mass unrest may reach a critical point as  early as by April-May. It is significant that in this situation  it is precisely those who until recently had been B. Yeltsin's  closest confederates--Ye. Gaydar, V. Shumeyko, G. Burbulis, G.  Popov, Yu. Luzhkov, and even V. Chernomyrdin--are ready to  "surrender" their president in order to shift onto him all the  responsibility for the national catastrophe.    Some Western special services' analysts do not rule out the  possibility of physical removal of B. Yeltsin in the event that  the situation get worse, for the purpose of "tying up loose  ends." As an argument in favor of the probability of such a  variant they cite completely irrational actions of the  president's associates involving various destructive  reorganizations of special services, which has caused a sharply  negative reaction among many staff members of the Main  Protection Directorate, the Vympel special unit, and the Federal  Counterintelligence Service. Besides, these structures also can  be used by the mafia in order to bring their own man to power  with the help of a terrorist act.  <H5>  The `Leader's' Heirs </H5>   Last year B. Yeltsin promised the Russian people "to find  and  nurture" his successor, who could guarantee the continuation of  his  reforms.    One of the first to proclaim himself the successor of the  increasingly infirm leader of democrats was Ye.  Gaydar. He got the presidential seat in his sights, at the  same time disregarding objective circumstances that were not  shaping in his favor. Despite the loud crash of Gaydar's  reforms, which were being implemented without any  thought-through plan and assessment of potential consequences,  the commissar's grandson did not learn any lessons from it.  Repeating the hackneyed free-market incantations during his  election campaign, and having spent about 15 billion rubles [R]  contributed by such financial giants as Menatep, Most-Bank,  Stolichnyy, Tokobank, and Inkombank, he led Russia's Choice to a  crushing defeat. And this is keeping in mind that he had at his  disposal all the capabilities of the state apparat, which was  utilized and directed by S. Filatov.    Nevertheless, Ye. Gaydar, who is very susceptible to the  crudest flattery, undertook to set up his own party, which he  intends to use as a tool in his struggle for the president's  job. More farsighted radical democrats, however--such as G.  Burbulis, B. Fedorov, and others, including old Democratic  Russia hands L. Ponomarev and G. Yakunin--looked skeptically at  this idea. Gaydar does not have much of a chance to create an  effective national party, especially considering that G.  Burbulis, S. Filatov, and others already had announced more than  once the creation of a "Yeltsinite" presidential party but had  failed.    Despite the support of a considerable part of financial  capital, small speculative business, criminal-mafiosi clans, as  well as most of the mass media, as the economic crisis deepens,  Ye. Gaydar's hopes for making it to the presidency become  increasingly ephemeral. It is actually to the advantage of Ye.  Gaydar's competitors that he of all people intends to declare  himself the leader of the radical democratic forces at the  elections. Ye. Gaydar's current fellow travelers and allies--K.  Borovoy, with his Economic Freedom Party, and P. Bunich's  coalition--do not have any serious influence on the population  today.    Most importantly, Ye. Gaydar does not have either slogans  that are attractive for the entire spectrum of public opinion  nor original ideas and plans capable of solving Russia's  problems. It is not accidental that such experienced politicians  in the United Sates as Secretary of State W. Christopher and  Clinton's personal friend S. Talbott have already practically  written off Ye. Gaydar.    Federation Council Chairman V. Shumeyko considers  himself a potential successor to the current Kremlin ruler. So  far he has not officially declared his claim to the presidency,  but inside his inner circle, during drunken parties and in  public baths, he boasts of his tallness and thick hair as the  most necessary prerequisites, in his opinion, for the future  president of Russia.    During the years of B. Yeltsin's rule, V. Shumeyko has  climbed a career ladder from director of a medium-caliber plant  in Krasnodar to deputy speaker of the Russian parliament, and  then a first deputy prime minister, who delivered to the  leader-president the adoption of his new Constitution, which in  turn earned him the place of the first chairman of the  parliament's upper chamber. Truly a glittering career for a  mediocre man, who possesses neither global thinking nor the  serious experience of a major politician and administrator, not  to speak of elementary decency. In his ascent to the pinnacle of  power, he was helped by such personal traits as  unscrupulousness, perfidy, and cynical hedging. That the  notorious international-scale fortune-seeker D. Yakubovskiy is  V. Shumeyko's closest confederate-- and according to wicked  tongues, also his treasurer--speaks for itself.    Now, using his position to establish contacts with the  regions, V. Shumeyko is preparing for himself a base for a  presidential race. At the same time, he has no chances of  winning the fight for the president's job. Influential regional  leaders treat him with barely concealed contempt, while the  general public has not forgotten the general procuracy's  investigation of V. Shumeyko's case on charges of corruption.    The next potential successor to B. Yeltsin and his political  disciple is S. Shakhray, who began speaking of his  presidential ambitions as early as in the spring 1993.    S. Shakhray acts more cautiously today; he learns from  other,  more experienced politicians, and persistently conducts active  organizational work, setting up structures for the election  race. Despite a de facto defeat in the parliamentary elections,  the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES], which he had  created, did pass its first durability test. PARES possesses  weak but nevertheless realistically operating organizations in a  whole number of regions. During the election campaign S.  Shakhray received substantial financial support mainly from  commercial structures controlled by V. Chernomyrdin's group. In  the words of V. Shokhin, spoken in confidence in a small circle,  "....when Serezha (Shakhray) saw that he was not getting  anywhere with the party (PRES), he dropped on his knees before  the prime minister, begging, `I will do everything you say, just  help me.' It was then that V. Chernomyrdin gave him both the  money and the Gazprom infrastructure...."    S. Shakhray for all practical purposes has created the PRES  Central Committee apparat using as a base the Ministry of Ethnic  Affairs and Regional Policy, and uses his official capacity as a  minister to strengthen party positions at the local level. He  strives to expand the infrastructure of his support in the  center and the regions, using K. Zatulin's entrepreneurs union,  and is attempting to set up an information corporation made up  of a number of newspapers, magazines, and radio and television  programs, united by regional and national subject matter.    S. Shakhray displays cynicism, unscrupulousness, and an  orientation on political expediency at any cost. Today he  behaves "flexibly": He proclaims his cooperation with the  communists in the State Duma; he supported the exoneration of  the October events' participants. The work he had organized with  respect to signing a treaty with Tatarstan was completed  successfully and the treaty signed. Also, S. Shakhray skillfully  made use of the idea first put forward by Yu. Skokov--forming  the Russian state in the current environment on a  treaty-federative basis, which allows for the solution of a  multitude of complex ethnic and regional problems. This is  despite the fact that only recently S. Shakhray, together with  S. Filatov, had been a vehement opponent both of the idea and of  Yu. Skokov himself.    S. Shakhray possesses a specific momentary thinking, and the  complex of a provincial Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist  Youth League] functionary who has suddenly found himself in a  high-level job in the capital. He is well known for unrestrained  self- advertising; the desire always to say something in the  mass media-- with or without good reason; handing out numerous  promises, which remain just empty words; and the inability  independently to solve major and complex problems. All of this  makes him rather a lightweight in the eyes of the political  establishment. "For Russians, the short, round Shakhray, with  his magnificent mustache, is more an object of insulting jokes  than a real political figure."    Because of this, it will be difficult for him to change his  negative image in the foreseeable future; keeping also in mind  that he lacks constructive global ideas on how to lead the  country out of the economic dead end, his chances in the fight  for the presidency are extremely low. Besides, over the past few  weeks S. Shakhray's financial support has dropped dramatically.    History has the last laugh: People who make it to the top  are  most often not the most honest and intelligent but the most  crafty and brazen ones. An example: the so-called mayor of  Moscow Yu. Luzhkov (illegally appointed to this job some time in  the past by B. Yeltsin). Actually, today, when he has already  begun his own election campaign, Luzhkov no longer publicly  swears allegiance to the president.    Under Mr. Luzhkov, the capital city turned into a huge  refuse  pit, one of the largest criminal centers in the country. Moscow  is today one of the ten most dangerous capitals in the world.  Just recently, demonstrating his loyalty to B. Yeltsin and  "democratic ideals," Luzhkov several times used the capital city  militia for brutal beatings of old men and children. He is one  of the main figures responsible for the mass murder of Russian  citizens in October 1993.    Now, however, the hour has struck for another merrymaking  feast of political monkeys! Today Yu. Luzhkov presents himself  as the defender of "ordinary people," fights A. Chubays, no  longer threatens "Red-and-browns" with prison and execution. At  a recent February meeting with Afghan war veterans, Yuriy  Mikhaylovich beat himself on his broad chest and sincerely swore  that he "had never been a democrat." And when he was asked how  he felt about G. Yakunin, the capital city mayor said without  blinking an eye: "People like Yakunin should be drowned in an  ice-hole!"    Luzhkov is supported by large banks and companies; the key  role among thenm belongs to Most-bank (Gusinskiy-Luzhkov's  financial group). Gusinskiy himself had been nurtured by that  same Mr. Mayor through famous Moscow food credits! Generally  speaking, in terms of financial clout only Chernomyrdin can  compete with Luzhkov. According to some information, in setting  up his organizational structure Yu. Luzhkov allocated R9 billion  for boosting the land- assembly movement alone. The wags have it  that the authors of panegyrics glorifying Luzhkov, which were  published in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, ROSSIYA, and other  periodicals, each received $10,000 from the generous mayor.  Luzhkov, however, is aware of his very vulnerable spots that may  deprive him of a realistic shot at the presidency.    V. Chernomyrdin is a probable, albeit temporary,  successor to B. Yeltsin in the event of the latter's early  retirement. Having achieved no positive results in improving the  economy and continuing along the general line of Gaydar's course  toward the destruction of Russian industry, V. Chernomyrdin  nevertheless has invested maximum effort in the strengthening of  his support base--the financial-industrial group, which includes  Gazprom, the Imperial Bank, and Lukoil Company. The prime  minister has a serious financial base for a presidential  election campaign and his own loyal people in many bodies of  executive branch. At the same time, he has a rather weak  standing in the mass media, which are mainly controlled by old  (Ye. Yakovlev) and new (O. Poptsov, M. Poltoranin) democrats or  by information concerns (NTV, INTERFAX, the SEGODNYA newspaper,  and others), which are owned by the Most Group and take a  generally anti-Chernomyrdin stance.    Some experts believe that since Ye. Gaydar's resignation, B.  Yeltsin does not have anybody except the current prime minister  on whom to shift the blame for the disintegration of the  economy. If the president does decide to take this step, this  will postpone for B. Yeltsin--although not for long--the  inexorable fate of facing his own culpability.    V. Chernomyrdin does not have any strategy; therefore, he  clumsily maneuvers in search of support: He attempts to get  interaction with the parliament going; is willing to form an  alliance with Yu. Luzhkov; flirts with Yu. Skokov's Producers  Union and the trade unions. All of this is unlikely to help him,  though: He does not have realistic concepts for getting out of  the crisis, and even less so the ability to implement them.    In addition, no one in the current political circles in  Russia has forgotten that it was V. Chernomyrdin's actions that  have led to the bloody tragedy on the night from 3 to 4 October  1993. While G. Burbulis in the Kremlin together with M.  Poltoranin tried to calm down B. Yeltsin, who was already  preparing to flee Moscow, the prime minister organized at the  Staraya Ploshchad a headquarters for the takeover of the House  of Soviets. It was V. Chernomyrdin who saved B. Yeltsin's  regime, and now, "having used him as needed, they may dispose of  him."    In this connection, it is unlikely that V. Chernomyrdin will  make a promising political figure, especially keeping in mind  that it is obvious for both the "left" and the "right" that he  is not capable of effective action.    Thus, in the opinion of leading Western analysts, none of  the  political figures whom B. Yeltsin in principle could proclaim  his heir can be seen today as a favorite at the next  presidential elections. Moreover, all of them already are making  an effort to distance themselves to some degree or other from B.  Yeltsin in order to avoid sharing with him the political  responsibility for the economic collapse and degradation of the  state.  <H5>  The Main Contenders </H5>   If presidential elections were to be held in the next two or  three months, V. Zhirinovskiy would have a very good chance. A  talented populist, he at this point successfully expresses in  his communications the emotional state of the Russian people,  the inner psychological tension of ordinary people accumulated  over the years of the Yeltsin regime's rule.    The success at the parliamentary elections in December 1993  made the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader the  most famous Russian politician in the world after B. Yeltsin. V.  Zhirinovskiy and his party enjoy the support not only of  marginal strata, but also of a number of commercial structures,  including the Neftekhim trading house, a consortium of  Russian-Dutch financial investment companies, and so on. Sharp  criticism of the current regime and demonstration of patriotic  convictions will allow V. Zhirinovskiy to gather a considerable  vote at the upcoming presidential elections (I will repeat: If  they take place within the next two or three months).    Nevertheless, V. Zhirinovskiy cannot realistically count on  winning. His behavior in the parliament and during foreign  trips, his propensity for catchy slogans without any concrete  deeds, and his rowdiness gradually build up an opinion of him  among a considerable part of the population as a cheap politico  demagogue incapable of real deeds. Naturally, this is not  happening without purposeful activity on the part of the  "democratic press"; however, the LDPR leader himself all too  often provides the pretext.    Besides, many of those who voted for V. Zhirinovskiy in the  transient turmoil of the December elections gradually begin to  reorient themselves toward leaders from the CP RF [Communist  Party of the Russian Federation], ROS [Russian All-People's  Union), and so on. A factor that will also work against V.  Zhirinovskiy is that he practically supported B. Yeltsin in the  October events. Besides, the LDPR leader does not have a real  team, any innovative ideas on how to overcome the economic  catastrophe, and so on.    Fearing V. Zhirinovskiy, special agents of the current  regime  rushed, or were implanted, into his inner circle--people who  have links with criminal structures and big "dirty" banking  business. The purpose: If attempts to buy off or completely  discredit the LDPR leader fail, at least influence his entourage.    A serious contender for the president's job today is A.  Rutskoy. In the environment of growing economic  difficulties, for which ordinary people justifiably blame the  president and the government, support for Rutskoy as a  charismatic leader, a fighter and defender of the underdog, who  suffered personally from the antipopular regime, will be  objectively increasing.    If his health permits, A. Rutskoy may lead a united  opposition by becoming its symbol. It cannot be precluded that  in the event of mass unrest and strikes after the forced  resignation of B. Yeltsin, the Federal Assembly as the only  legitimate body in this situation may directly entrust carrying  out the president's duties to A. Rutskoy, since his removal and  arrest were clearly unconstitutional.    The events of the past three years show, however, that A.  Rutskoy, an unquestionably honest and sincere man, has turned  out to be impulsive, uncalculating, and an insufficiently  experienced politician, without a strong team. In the opinion of  some Rand Corporation experts, A. Rutskoy and his closest  confederates were unable in September-October of 1993  objectively to assess and influence the situation and to take  the necessary and effective measures against B. Yeltsin's  anticonstitutional actions, although they had an opportunity to  do so.    One of the analysts in the Russian Federation Ministry of  Defense writes: "It is hard to talk about people who behaved  with dignity and suffered for their mistakes. There is no  guarantee, however, that A. Rutskoy will not again fall for  deception and will not take unfounded actions that will play  into the hands of strategic enemies of Russia." Another weakness  of the vice president is that while proclaiming correct,  patriotic slogans, he does not have enough political and  economic experience as well as organizational skills to develop  and painstakingly implement a clear anticrisis program, without  which the country's revival is impossible. He also does not have  a real political infrastructure.    Unfortunately, detention has not improved the health of the  twice-wounded Afghan war veteran, Hero of the Soviet Union A.  Rutskoy. High blood pressure and other health problems will not  help him, either, to make a successful bid for the presidency,  in the event that he decides to go ahead with it.    Another notable political leader who so far has not  announced  his presidential intentions but certainly has good grounds for  it is the Communists' leader, G. Zyuganov. He heads a  truly broad-based, national party with sufficiently strict  internal discipline.    Despite his practically complete isolation from the mass  media in the course of the December election campaign, the CP RF  achieved good results. The image of G. Zyuganov as a reasonable,  principled man protecting the national interests of Russia has  contributed to the Communist Party's shedding of the bogeyman  image that B. Yeltsin and Democratic Russia had successfully  used to scare the people as late as on the eve of last year's  April referendum. Even in the West, G. Zyuganov is perceived  today as an acceptable leader of a civilized party, rather than  an extremist thirsting for class revenge.    Theoretically, G. Zyuganov's political knowledge and  practical experience of organizational work make him a contender  for the high state post. However, the CP RF's weak financial  base, lack of serious positions in the mass media, and the  persisting negative attitude toward Communists on the part of a  considerable part of society--first and foremost  entrepreneurs--do not allow the party to count on a singlehanded  victory in the presidential elections.    Most likely, it would be expedient for the Communists during  the presidential elections to form a bloc with patriotic and  some centrist forces in order to nominate one candidate, who  then could count on realistic success. In this case G. Zyuganov  and his party colleagues could gain important state jobs in  order to exert effective influence on the political course of  the new president.    One German journalist called Yuriy Skokov "a  serious man, who speaks only when he has something to say." The  former Security Council secretary, and currently the chairman of  the Producers Union, recently announced that he may run in the  presidential elections in 1996.    A vehement opponent of savage experiments on the nation, a  clever and calculating technocrat, capable of putting forward  deep and well-thought-through ideas, Yu. Skokov may become one  of the most promising candidates. It is not accidental that in  December 1993 Ye. Gaydar said that he sees Yu. Skokov as one of  his most dangerous opponents.    Yu. Skokov's personal modesty, decency, laconic speech, and  the high expectations he places on himself and others are to a  certain extent reminiscent of Yu. Andropov and A. Kosygin. Men  like this traditionally are respected by the Russian people.    An economic practitioner and a realist politician, Yu.  Skokov  does indeed have a score of strategic concepts, whose  implementation will make it possible to avert further political  and social polarization in society, to start implementing a  concrete operational plan for stabilizing the economic  situation. He is well known and appreciated by directors of  factories grinding to a halt, and by heads of republics, krays,  and oblasts that are barely making ends meet.    Yu. Skokov's main shortcoming is that he is practically  unknown to popular public opinion in the country, even though in  influential elite circles--military, political, trade union, and  others--he commands respect and authority. In the final  analysis, Yu. Skokov's political fate depends on whether he will  be able to change the trend of being kept in the shadows of  silence. Another shortcoming of Yu. Skokov's candidacy is that  despite his adherence to the idea of a civilized, nationally  oriented market, he does not have well developed links with  entrepreneurial circles.  <H5>  Potential Figures </H5>   S. Baburin, who a few days ago was nominated as a  presidential candidate by the Russian All-People's Union, hardly  has a chance not only of victory but even of making it to the  second round of voting. However, ROS, which was eliminated from  the December election campaign, may take quite a few votes away  from V. Zhirinovskiy at the upcoming presidential elections (by  the estimates of a number of Western experts, S. Baburin may  gather 7-8 percent of the vote). At the same time, ROS'  coalition with the communists, agrarians, and some part of the  centrists oriented toward a strong state, and their joint  nomination of a candidate with an unblemished reputation may  bring the "left" and patriotic forces victory in the  presidential elections.    The Russian "democratic" and the Western media on the  threshold of the December 1993 elections frequently mentioned  G. Yavlinskiy as a favorite. In fact, along with  Russia's Choice, "Yabloko" [the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc]  was generously financed by Most-bank, Stolichnyy Bank, and  others, probably on the assumption that it was safer to bet on  several horses. Yavlinskiy was lauded in all sorts of ways "as a  sober and intelligent free-market reformer" by such leaders of  businessmen's associations as M. Masarskiy and M. Yuryev; M.  Gorbachev supported him in every way possible, including  financially. At the same time, the criticism of the most odious  consequences of Gaydar's reform should have brought him, in G.  Yavlinskiy's design, the support of ordinary people.    However, "G. Yavlinskiy's party" did not achieve the  expected  results. This happened because, as a well-known American  journalist in Moscow put it, "G. Yavlinskiy, not only for you  Russians, but also for us Americans, is the same as Gaydar,  except somewhat slimmer and somewhat smarter. But in essence he  is the same kind of armchair theoretician, with a propensity for  macroeconomic experiments `at any cost'...."    Like S. Shakhray and other "perestroyka chickens," G.  Yavlinskiy is unscrupulous and a big mouth: One day he denounces  B. Yeltsin's September state coup; then on the night from 3 to 4  October on television he urges a merciless crackdown on the  defenders of the Constitution. G. Yavlinskiy's loss at the  December elections was predetermined in many respects by the  fact that a firm idea has formed in the public opinion of him as  a man who lusts for power at any cost. Therefore, despite the  support of Americans who are already turning away from Ye.  Gaydar, and the help of the "democratic press" curators A.  Yakovlev and Ye. Yakovlev, Yavlinskiy was doomed (by the way,  after the December elections the Yakovlev duo also cooled off to  Gorbachev's pet).    The provinces, the Russian backwoods, have a very negative  attitude toward G. Yavlinskiy. That is why he was not able and  probably will not be able to build a national movement, party,  or other structure drawing on a mass support.    One of the most significant factors in the upcoming  presidential campaign may be the nomination of V. Zorkin, the  former chairman of the Constitutional Court. Among the strongest  suits of the current Constitutional Court member V. Zorkin is  his uncompromising moral position, adherence to the letter and  the spirit of the law, and a certain emotional attractiveness of  his personality in the public opinion. He has coalition  potential, which gives him the ability to bring under his  banners a certain part of the centrist and left-of- center  political spectrum.    At the same time, Western experts analyzing the chances of  various contenders for the Russian Federation presidency, also  note certain shortcomings in his position. In particular, he  lacks a serious political infrastructure and does not have an  effective economic strategy for overcoming the current economic  crisis; his financial resources for the dynamic conduct of the  presidential race are unknown; he does not have a team or  experience of leading tightly-knit political groups.  <H5>  Some Conclusions </H5>   ....3. Three problems will be decisive for the upcoming  presidential election campaign in Russia: attitude to the  October tragedy; the extent of corruption at the top; and the  economic crisis theme.    4. A key, but outwardly still latent problem during the  presidential campaign will be the issue not of access to the  highest state position but the ability to utilize this  authority. Therefore, the candidate who will have the best  chances will be the one to provide an adequate answer to two  principal questions: What to do and how to do it....    7. Since the country lacks unarguably personality-based  charismatic leaders (even Zhirinovskiy represents only a weak  type of situation-engendered charisma), much will be decided by  the character and pace of forming electoral coalitions. Of  particular importance in this will be not the size of political  coalitions per se, but the organic nature of their structure.  Many of current unofficial candidates for the Russian presidency  very soon will begin bitter bargaining in order to set the price  at which they will join some or other coalition....    8. Judging by all signs, the emergence of "dark horses,"  that  is, some completely unknown figures, during the presidential  race is extremely unlikely. If this does happen, it would be for  only one reason: the desire of some political players to split  an opponent's coalition (or prevent the creation of an  unacceptable coalition)....  <H8>  * * * * </H8>   The political time of the first president of Russia is  inexorably approaching its end. Quite possibly, Boris Yeltsin  today is one of the unhappiest men in the country. Maniacal  suspiciousness, dark forebodings, fatigue, and pain constantly  press upon this man.    Was he ever sincere? Even if he had been.... "The road to  hell is paved with good intentions." He will also remain in  history as Boris the Bloody.    In October 1988 Yeltsin spoke with inspiration beautiful  words about democracy, freedom, and human rights. In October  1993, children were being killed at his order.    Some time a long time ago, a father told his son some wise  words: "Do not try to get where you do not belong." Boris did  not listen.    B. Yeltsin's presidency turned into a tragedy for the  country, Dramatic events expect the second president.... And  still....    "The future is perfect, for it is unknown."</p>

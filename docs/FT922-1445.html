			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Japan promises closer co-operation with EC JAPAN yesterday pledged closer co-operation with the EC, in a wide-ranging review of its relations with Europe, Stefan Wagstyl reports from Tokyo. The review follows a similar paper published by the EC a month ago containing sharp criticism of Japanese trade practices, and prompting a protest from Tokyo. The foreign affairs ministry has eschewed the chance to hit back in its own review. Mr Hisashi Owada, vice-minister for foreign affairs, is taking a conciliatory line. In response to EC demands for steps to improve foreign groups' access to Japanese markets, the report said the requests should be dealt with under Gatt's Uruguay Round trade talks. The paper welcomed European companies' efforts to enter Japanese markets and improve their competitiveness in high-technology industries. The reviews follow the EC-Japan declaration on bilateral issues signed by Mr Jacques Delors, EC president, and Mr Toshiki Kaifu, then Japan's premier. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Mr Kaifu's successor, is to meet Mr Delors and Mr John Major, UK prime minister and the next European Council of Ministers president, while visiting Europe next month.</p>

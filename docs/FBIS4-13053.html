			<p>BFN     [Text] His Excellency Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah, Omani  minister of state for foreign affairs, has opened the fifth  meeting of the water committee within the multilateral talks  stemming from the Middle East peace conference. The conference,  which was opened at the Muscat Intercontinental Hotel this  morning, is attended by 42 states, in addition to the Sultanate  of Oman, and three international organizations -- the United  Nations, the European Union, and the World Bank.    At the beginning of the four-day meeting, His Excellency  Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah delivered a speech in which he  said: As the Sultanate of Oman today hosts the meeting of the  water resources group within the multilateral talks of the  Middle East peace conference, it strongly expresses its firm  conviction of the importance of continuing the march of peace.    His excellency added that the sultanate's support for the  peace process in the Middle East is based on a longstanding  conviction that resolving the Middle East problem and its crux,  the Palestinian cause, can only be achieved through direct  dialogue and serious talks among the involved parties.    His excellency stressed that the convening of this meeting  reflects the concern of the participant states in continuing  their support and their valuable contribution to support the  peace process. At the same time, he added, the meeting is an  opportunity for the delegations to continue their constructive  discussion, which they began in previous meetings, regarding  water problems in the Middle East.    His excellency the minister of state for foreign affairs  said: The multilateral track of the peace process concentrates  on the details. We, in the water group, however, aim at  preserving the scarce sources of water resources and concentrate  on the importance of developing and creating new techniques in  the service of water. We must realize that the work done by the  water resources group is one of the most important factors of  cooperation among the Middle East countries for many essential  reasons, the most important of which is the limited water  resources in the region. Therefore, the plans for social and  economic development require that all Middle Eastern countries  agree on policies to manage water resources and distribution and  to secure stable water supplies.    His excellency said: In light of this, the Sultanate of Oman  carried out a comprehensive survey to learn about the standards  reached by water desalination research and technology in the  world, which it was charged with by the committee during the  Beijing meeting, to lay down options to reduce the financial  burdens resulting from water desalination.    His excellency said: The document, which will be presented  to you and which was the production of this survey, represents a  distinguished technical achievement by a group specialized  experts and is the result of positive common work thanks to the  valuable cooperation demonstrated by your countries.    He added: On this occasion, we would like to express our  heartfelt appreciation to those experts and to all those  countries who contributed to the success of this study, which  has come up with specific proposals and recommendations which  will be detailed by the Omani delegation participating in this  meeting.    The minister of state for foreign affairs expressed hope  that  this effort will be a successful beginning for serious  scientific research to develop water desalination technology so  that it will be used in ways that will have positive effects on  the economic development in the Middle East. His excellency  noted that such an achievement will also largely contribute to  curbing the danger of potential conflict over water resources.  He added that this trend requires constructive collective  cooperation, especially with advanced industrialized countries  that have genuine experience in this regard.    His excellency said: We have passed the stage in which we  considered the mere holding of a meeting between us an  achievement. We are aware of the fact that these very important  multilateral meetings should be in harmony with what is achieved  in the bilateral tracks of the peace talks by laying down sound  foundations for tangible cooperation over mutual interests and  common views regarding the issues of the region, which are the  main topics of the multilateral talks.    His Excellency Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah stressed that  participants from the region know full well that we have made a  progress in this peace process and reached the threshold of a  new stage that requires initiatives aimed at building bridges  and achieving interconnection among the partners of peace.  Therefore, the multilateral working groups and committees  should work to reinforce their role and efficiency to support  the bilateral track of the peace process and to continue to lay  down practical plans and views that will achieve common benefits  for all parties in an atmosphere of peace and stability.</p>

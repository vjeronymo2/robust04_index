			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> U.S. TO FUND LATINO LANGUAGE PROGRAM  </P> <P> About $1 million in federal money will be used to fund a five-year program to  help Latino youngsters gain language skills.  </P> <P> The program, which begins July 1, will target students in kindergarten through  second grade whose primary language is Spanish, said Gail Reed, director of the  project.  </P> <P> "If a student has strong Spanish skills, they usually make the transition very  quickly and easily into English," Reed said. "But many students come to us  lacking skills in their primary language. (For them) making a transition takes  much longer than it should."  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Education will provide about $215,000 for each of the  five years of the program. The money will pay for classroom costs, as well as a  secretary and three community liaisons who will work with parents to encourage  participation in helping their children learn.  </P> <P> The project will serve about 450 students in bilingual classrooms.

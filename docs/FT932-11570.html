			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / West would take strain of Bosnian deal: Experts estimate 70,000 international troops could be needed to monitor peace IMPLEMENTATION of the Bosnian peace plan brokered by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen in Athens at the weekend will present the international community - and the western allies in particular - with huge problems. The plan, which comes into effect 72 hours after the United Nations Security Council has approved it, probably within the next few days, will require an international force estimated by experts at between 50,000 and 70,000 men. It has been notoriously difficult for the UN to persuade reluctant member nations to contribute the necessary forces for peacekeeping operations round the world. But Nato has come to the rescue in the case of Bosnia by offering to take on the task on behalf of the world organisation. Few pledges have so far been received from individual countries, but Nato planners had some good news at the weekend when the White House announced that the US was working with Nato allies on the creation of peacekeeping ground forces. Such forces could include Americans if a peace accord was implemented in Bosnia, Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said. If Nato becomes the main instrument for peace enforcement in the former Yugoslav republic, that will solve at least one American problem. The US has always been reluctant to place its troops under UN command, but has had no such objections against a Nato commander, not least because the alliance's commander-in-chief is traditionally an American. More difficult, on the other hand, will be the incorporation of any Russian and other eastern European troops into a Nato peacekeeping force, although the problem may well be solved by the reluctance - or inability - of any of these countries to make troop contributions. France, too, has serious reservations about an overall Nato command, since it is not a member of the alliance's integrated military organisation. The problem does not appear intractable, however. The whole peace enforcement operation could still be put under the umbrella of the UN, with Nato acting as its military executant. Another big problem is the speed with which troops would be deployed; they need to be on the ground quickly. Under the plan, all heavy weapons have to be withdrawn from Sarajevo within five days of a ceasefire coming into effect and from all other frontline positions within 10 days. All Serb, Moslem and Croat forces must be withdrawn to the provinces designated by the Vance-Owen plan to their three communities within 45 days. It is clear that all these redeployments will require the presence of UN troops to oversee and monitor them. Yet the logistical problems are enormous, according to Field-Marshal Sir Richard Vincent, chairman of Nato's military committee, and it remains doubtful whether troops can be deployed as rapidly as the peace plan demands.</p>

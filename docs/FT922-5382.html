			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel gets more breathing space EUROTUNNEL earned a temporary reprieve from its bankers yesterday when the syndicate providing Pounds 6.8bn of credit facilities said the company could draw further funds. The company now has a breathing space until August or September - the lenders have said Eurotunnel must try to settle its disputes with the tunnel's building contractors regarding cost overruns before it spends another Pounds 500m. Eurotunnel is likely to have used this money within three months. Eurotunnel had broken its loan covenants and so had to persuade 65 per cent of its lenders to waive a covenant and allow it to go on drawing loans. This level of support from the banks was reached by a clear margin. The deadline for the agreement was yesterday. The waiver was especially welcome to Eurotunnel after a week of uncertainty in which Bouygues, a French contractor in the Transmanche Link builders' consortium, called Eurotunnel's creditworthiness into question. A remark by Mr Martin Bouygues, group chairman, that 'one cannot completely exclude the hypothesis that Eurotunnel will go bankrupt' caused a sharp drop in the share price. Eurotunnel said Mr Bouygues' claims were unfounded. Eurotunnel shares closed 11p higher at 370p. See Lex</p>

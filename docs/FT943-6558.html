			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Philips to boost capacity with Pounds 100m investment Philips Components, the division of the Dutch electrical and electronics group which makes television picture tubes and special ceramics, plans to invest Pounds 100m before 1997 to increase capacity at its UK manufacturing plants. Almost three-quarters of the total will be spent on the company's colour-picture tubes factory in Durham. A further Pounds 10m will be spent on increasing the capacity of its glass-making plant near Blackburn. This will help alleviate the present world shortage of high-quality lead glass used to make cathode ray tubes for television sets and computer monitors. Glass manufacturers cut capacity and investment in this sector during the recession. Mr Wim de Kleuver, chief executive of Philips Components, said yesterday that after comprehensive and often painful reorganisation, Philips UK manufacturing plants were as cost-effective as any in Europe. Several were world-class with a performance equal to that of the best Asian producers. Philips Components, with the company's semiconductor activities, represents about 12 per cent of the group's Fl58.8bn (Pounds 21.7bn) turnover. About 70 per cent of the division's production is sold to customers outside Philips. Last year the division's UK plants produced Pounds 300m worth of product, most of which was exported. Mr de Kleuver said he was concerned that there was a general expectation in Europe that the cost of electronic goods would continue to decline, without an understanding of the nature of the underlying electronics revolution. He was afraid that politicians and the public at large believed electronics technology could be bought as a commodity regardless of source. 'It is critically important that Europe retains competence in key areas,' he said. He cited Philips' co-operation with the French companies Thomson and Sagem and the German chemicals group Merck to develop advanced liquid-crystal displays to challenge Japanese domination of flat-panel display technology. The first displays from the joint venture are expected on the market soon. Mr de Kleuver said Philips' aim was to be among the top five flat-panel producers.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Letter: Government should remove bias against full-time jobs Sir, Edward Balls writes ('A scar that will persist for years to come', February 18) on the high level of unemployment which will continue to exist after the UK economy recovers from the present slump. One reason why the outlook is so pessimistic for the unemployed is, he says, that 'technological change and competition from low-cost producers in developing countries has reduced the demand for unskilled labour other than in low-wage, often part-time employment. These jobs have . . . been mainly taken by female entrants into the labour markets'. Evidence on part-time working is usually cited in support of this view. Since June 1978, well over 2.5m full-time jobs have been lost. Over the same time there has been an increase of more than 1.25m of part-time jobs. Indeed, a third of those in employment now work part-time. This trend is way out of line with other European countries, with Britain currently employing 40 per cent of Europe's part-time workforce. But is this due to the market forces which Edward Balls describes? Or are there particular circumstances in Britain which make such an outcome inevitably unfavourable to those wishing to seek full-time employment? I would suggest that such an outcome is inevitable, given the way the contributions for national insurance are structured. Employees and employers pay no contribution on the first Pounds 54 of earnings. When creating new posts, many employers bear this in mind and often offer part-time rather than full-time posts. Some employers, Burton is a recent example, are now cutting full-time jobs and offering only part-time work. I believe it is time that these national insurance rules were looked at critically. I would hope that the government would consider in next month's budget levying national insurance contributions for employers from the very first pound of earnings. As the move would not be aimed at raising additional revenue (which would be an additional tax on jobs) the overall level of employer contributions would therefore be adjusted to make the move revenue-neutral. Such a simple change would remove the present bias which is working in favour of creating only part-time employment. It would not, of course, prevent employers and employees negotiating packages of less than full-time employment. But it would mean the removal of the current penalty which operates against the creation of full-time posts. Frank Field MP, House of Commons, London SW1 0AA</p>

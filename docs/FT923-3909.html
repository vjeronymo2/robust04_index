			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Italy embarks on road to electoral reform ITALY'S two houses of parliament yesterday took the first step to reforming the country's ossified institutions and unworkable electoral system by agreeing to the formation of a 60-strong all-party commission. The joint commission, headed by Mr Ciriaco de Mita, the former Christian Democrat prime minister, will have six months in which to draw up recommendations. A law will then be submitted to parliament conferring powers on the commission to draft specific proposals for constitutional change. This will turn the commission into a mini-constituent assembly and give it authority. Lack of power to make specific proposals undermined a previous attempt at reform in 1983. The commission results from an initiative by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. In his inaugural address on May 28 he urged parliament to give immediate attention to a commission, to prevent state institutions falling into further discredit. But all parties have recognised that the 1947 constitution was geared to a country emerging from fascism into the cold war at a time when social and economic conditions were profoundly different to now. The system of proportional representation was designed to protect minority parties and discourage the control of monolithic groups like the Communists or disbanded fascists. However, elections this year demonstrated that this system merely encouraged a plethora of small parties and produced unstable coalition governments. The commission will examine the workings of parliament, the nature of the presidency and whether the incumbent be chosen through direct elections, the role of regions and magistrates, direct elections of mayors, and electoral reform. Some of the most prestigious names in parliament were chosen for the commission alongside Mr de Mita, including Ms Nilde Iotti, deputy of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left, who was part of the commission formed in 1946 to write the present constitution. But one notable absentee was Mr Mario Segni, the reformist Christian Democrat who heads the movement to change Italy's institutions by referendum. He argues that parliament is too slow and divided by petty differ-ences to be able to agree on funda-mental reform.</p>

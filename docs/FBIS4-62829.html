			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 18 TASS -- The State Duma today declined  to support its ruling council decision to suspend television  commentator Nikolay Svanidze as requested by the  Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia angered by his remarks in  last Friday's television program "Details" broadcast by Russian  television.    One of the party leaders, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, told the  chamber that his party has repeatedly been the object "of  aggression from the mass media" and insisted that the program  author and commentator, Nikolay Svanidze, be suspended until the  court tries the case.    Vengerovskiy's supporters failed to muster enough votes to  request the leadership of the Russian Television Broadcasting  Company to act accordingly.    The press service of the Liberal-Democratic Party in the  State Duma circulated a report announcing that "all members of  the LDPR group of deputies in the State Duma have filed suits in  the court against Svanidze".</p>

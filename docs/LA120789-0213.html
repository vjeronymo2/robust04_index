			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: MYSTERY OF MAGAZINE ADS HINTING OF PEARL HARBOR ATTACK LINGERS  48 YEARS LATER  </P> <P> Today is Pearl Harbor Day -- the 48th anniversary of the Japanese attack on  Pearl Harbor that brought the United States abruptly into World War II. The  prevalent game to play on Pearl Harbor Day among those of us old enough to  remember was where-were-you-when-you-heard-the-news? But this year's  anniversary reminded me of something quite different, a mystery I've carried  around with me for more than four decades.  </P> <P> In 1944, I was flying Navy transport planes in the South Pacific. Along with  the cargoes we delivered to combat areas, we often carried military passengers,  and during the long hours between islands, I would often turn the plane over to  the co-pilot and go back into the cabin to talk with the passengers. One of  them was a young naval intelligence officer on his way to Okinawa.  </P> <P> We had some engine trouble on that trip and had to lay over unexpectedly in  Guam. The trouble wasn't serious, and we were booked out the next morning. So  my new intelligence friend and I went to the local officer's club to tip a few  before we turned in. And there, over the third drink, he told me a story that  he probably shouldn't have that stayed with me until I was home after the war.  </P> <P> He told me that the Nov. 22, 1941, issue of the New Yorker magazine -- two  weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor -- carried an advertisement that in  retrospect was full of double meanings and was considered by the intelligence  community as a warning to someone about the timing of the upcoming Japanese  offensive. He described the ad as best he could from memory and said it was  accompanied by a pair of dice with the numbers 12 and 7 -- the date of the  Pearl Harbor attack -- exposed.  </P> <P> He had been assigned to investigate the ad and ran into nothing but dead-ends.  It had been placed across the counter in New York and paid for in cash. Both  the main ad and the smaller lead-in ads had been set in type somewhere else and  a matrix pulled for delivery to the New Yorker. The clerk who had accepted the  ads had no recollection of who placed them, and neither the game that was  offered in the double-entendre copy nor the company whose signature was on the  ad existed. So my friend had drawn a total blank, and it was still eating at  him. He was convinced that someone -- for reasons he couldn't fathom -- had  been instructed to convey information about the upcoming attack in this manner.  </P> <P> I never forgot that conversation, and when I returned to college after the war,  I went to the library and found bound editions of the New Yorker. Although it  was only a one-column ad in a thick magazine, it was easy to spot. And it was  every bit as mysterious as the intelligence officer had described it.  </P> <P> The illustration above the ad copy showed an air raid in progress and,  immediately below it, a group of people in an air raid shelter playing a dice  game. The headline is "Uchtung, Warning, Alerte!" And the copy begins: "We hope  you'll never have to spend a long winter's night in an air-raid shelter, but we  were just thinking . . . it's only common sense to be prepared. If you're not  too busy between now and Christmas, why not sit down and plan a list of the  things you'll want to have on hand. . . . "  </P> <P> Then followed a list of items useful in an air raid shelter that concluded with  this sentence: "And though it's no time, really, to be thinking of what's  fashionable, we bet that most of your friends will remember to include those  intriguing dice and chips which make Chicago's favorite game: THE DEADLY  DOUBLE." This was followed by the sign of the double cross: two X's inside a  shield -- and a tag line that the game was available in department stores  everywhere.  </P> <P> Then, scattered throughout the issue, were a half-dozen small ads repeating the  headline and referring to the main ad, surrounding a pair of dice -- one black,  one white -- containing numbers not found on conventional dice on which 12 and  7 and the double cross were prominently displayed. The small ads were signed by  the Monarch Publishing Co., New York. I remembered the assurances of the  intelligence officer that there was no such company and no such game in the  stores, and the ads took on a significance -- and a malevolence -- to me that  has been very real ever since.  </P> <P> It has been many years since I first read those mysterious ads, and when I  remembered them the other day, I went to the UCI library to make sure this  story wasn't some wartime three-martini fantasy. It wasn't. I pulled the bound  copy off the shelf, and there were the ads, just as I remembered them. The  principal ad is on page 70 of the New Yorker for Nov. 22, 1941, and the small  ads are scattered through the book. You can look them up for yourself, just as  I first did more than 40 years ago. And then you can carry the mystery around  in your own head as I have all these years.  </P></p>

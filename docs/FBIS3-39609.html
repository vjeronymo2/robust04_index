			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Newscaster Pia Dijkstra introduction of video report by </F> correspondent Pieter Boonman, identified by screen caption, on  Nelson Mandela's visit to the Netherlands; Mandela speaks in  English with subtitles in Dutch--recorded]    [Text] [Dijkstra] ANC leader Nelson Mandela will leave  behind for a few days now the political tension, the violence,  and the election campaign in South Africa. He is in the  Netherlands for two days for political talks and a for a special  television program on the upcoming elections in April.    Despite the huge domestic problems, Nelson Mandela is  optimistic about the forthcoming first-ever democratic  elections. He does not rule out that the Inkatha movement also  will participate, despite Inkatha leader Buthelezi's statements  that ANC concessions for greater regional autonomy are not  sufficient.    [Begin recording] [Boonman] Nelson Mandela arrived at the  Hilversum television studio tonight for the taping of a special  program. He does not want to discuss the difficult negotiations  with the right-wing whites and the Zulu movement Inkatha.    [Unidentified reporter in English with Dutch subtitles] How  important is a fund-raising evening for the ANC in the  Netherlands?    [Mandela] Well, our visits to the Netherlands have always  been crowned with success.    [Boonman] During the special program, money will be  collected  for election projects in South Africa. [end recording]    [Dijkstra] Mandela started his visit to the Netherlands with  a luncheon at the Catshuis [prime minister's residence]. He  spoke among others with Prime Minister Lubbers and Vice Prime  Minister Kok. Yesterday in Johannesburg, the ANC leader made  promises to the right-wing white organizations and to the  Inkatha movement. He promised them a greater say in the future  South Africa. Inkatha has rejected the offer, but Mandela  remains optimistic.    [Begin recording] [Mandela] As far as my understanding of  his  [Buthelezi] comments, it does appear that he has left the door  open if ANC clarifies the offers it has made. I therefore  believe that it is premature for us to decide that he has  rejected the offer.    [Boonman] Mandela does not rule greater autonomy in order to  draw all parties to the elections.    [Mandela] In a case where you are trying to build a new  country, there can be no final concession. Concessions are  inherent in negotiations.    [Boonman] The Netherlands Government has assured Mr. Mandela  that it would also assist the new South Africa with money. In  an interview with Lubbers and Mandela to be broadcast later  tonight on Nederland-3, Lubbers agrees to pay this price.    [Lubbers in English with Dutch subtitles] I would not  exclude  the possibility of supporting Mr. Mandela as a symbol, not only  because of the elections, but also as a symbol to say: Let us  set out a new course for the future.    [Boonman] Before he leaves tomorrow, Mr. Mandela will meet  with Netherlands businessmen to persuade them to invest in South  Africa. [end recording]    [Dijkstra] Tomorrow morning Nelson Mandela will also meet  Yasir 'Arafat. The PLO leader arrives late today and will be  received tomorrow by Prime Minister Lubbers.</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Survey of International Capital Markets (6): End of the rapid growth - Global swaps have reached their peak THE GLOBAL swaps market, after a number of years of rapid expansion, is undergoing a period of adjustment. Fuelled in the early years by new-issue driven business, the market is now available to a broader range of users for a number of purposes. The market is also facing increasing pressure from regulators, who have expressed some concern about the risks involved in the swaps business. Since the International Swap Dealers Association, the industry's trade body, started tracking volume, the total amount of swaps outstanding has risen from Dollars 900bn in 1987, to an estimated Dollars 4,000bn by the end of 1991. Most analysts believe that this period of rapid growth is coming to an end. 'The rate of growth will slow (in interest rate and cross-currency swaps). Most significant players are in the market now,' explains Mr Malcolm Basing, the association's chairman, and global head of swaps at Swiss Bank Corporation. The changing nature of global markets has forced important adjustments. At its inception, the swaps market took advantage of anomalies between markets to allow borrowers to reduce their funding costs. For example, a UK company needing to raise funds in dollars might have to pay a premium to tap the US market, because its credit was unfamiliar to the relevant investor base. The swaps market allowed such a borrower to tap the most favourable market in terms of investor demand - in this case the sterling bond market - and then to swap the proceeds into the required currency. Swaps, however, were always a smaller portion of the market than interest rate swaps. In earlier years, because retail investors, then numerous, were unsophisticated in assessing the value of bonds, borrowers could often issue fixed-rate bonds and swap the proceeds into floating-rate funds at a level substantially below the London interbank offered rate. But the development of global markets has gradually ironed out these opportunities. The last 10 years have been a period of substantial deregulation, breaking down the boundaries within and between countries, and consequently eradicating arbitrage opportunities between markets. In addition, the growing sophistication of swap dealers themselves means that any opportunities are swiftly arbitraged. 'By its nature, arbitrage removes the pricing gap that was its raison d'etre. I don't believe there will be a return to the sort of arbitrage opportunities available in the past,' Mr Basing says. However, tight swap spreads are also a function of current views on interest rates, and of supply and demand, so changes in market trends should prompt widening spreads. But swap spreads - the differential between the yield on the government bond and on the comparable swap - have now tightened to historically narrow levels, making it almost impossible for most borrowers to swap fixed-rate funds, except at margins often well above Libor. While the proportion of new issue business has waned, other participants have entered the market, as a broader range of institutions have become familiar with swap market techniques. Companies, which used to be concerned merely with finding cheaper ways of raising primary debt, are much more attuned these days to the ongoing management of their liabilities, and frequently use the swaps market to adjust their interest rate. New techniques have been developed, allowing fund managers to swap assets. The developing equity swaps market allows a fund manager to change his exposure without buying or selling assets. For example, a fund manager can gain exposure to the US stock market without changing his physical portfolio by entering an agreement with a counterparty to pay, say, three-month Libor, and to receive the return on the S&amp;P 1000 index. Similar techniques using commodities now allow oil companies - or transport companies which need to consume large amounts of oil - to reduce their exposure to the price changes. Meanwhile, the swaps market is also fighting a rearguard action against regulators. In the US, the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission's re-authorisation Bill, which is winding its way through Congress, will, practitioners hope, provide legal clarification on the status of swaps. Swap market practitioners are keen to have the distinction between swaps and futures enshrined, as they fear attempts to force their business on to regulated off-market exchanges. Such a move in the US market is likely to drive business offshore. Clarifying an earlier statement on the legislation, Mr Gerald Corrigan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, wrote recently to Congressman Dan Glickman: 'My remarks were not intended to suggest that swaps are, or should be treated as, futures. It is exceedingly difficult for me to see how swaps could be traded on organised exchanges, given that so many swaps are custom-tailored for specific purposes and uses.' However, he reiterated his view that 'swaps and other off-balance sheet activities do need a closer degree of managerial and supervisory attention' and suggested 'more systemic and comprehensive application of official capital standards to these activities'.</p>

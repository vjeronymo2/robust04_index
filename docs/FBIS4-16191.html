			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Kovalenko: "Russia Will Cross the Council </F> of Europe Threshold in Early 1995"]    [Text] Strasbourg -- The difficult process of Russia's  entry into the Council of Europe, which has dragged on for two  long years, finally reached its concluding stage today. Now  Russia will apparently join this prestigious organization,  bringing together 32 states, at the very beginning of 1995.  This was stated in Strasbourg by Miguel Martinez, president of  the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly.    Observers present at the Russian parliamentary elections  deemed them "free and democratic." The holding of elections,  together with the adoption of the new Constitution, removed any  doubts and objections concerning Russia's admission.    Moscow has signed a number of key agreements and conventions  of the Council of Europe and has become actively involved in its  activities. Full membership of the organization, Federation  Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko said at a Parliamentary  Assembly session, will help improve Russian legislation and will  provide powerful support in the building of democracy. It will  give Russia access to European programs in the spheres of human  rights, culture, education, information, and ecology. Finally,  by joining the Council, V. Shumeyko stressed, our country will  be able to participate effectively in the shaping of European  policy in all these areas.</p>

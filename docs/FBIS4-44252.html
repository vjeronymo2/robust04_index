			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] The Ankara State Security Court has launched an  investigation in connection with the first congress of the  People's Democracy Party [Halkin Demokrasi Partisi--HADEP].  According to information received by a TRT correspondent from  Nusret Demiral, chief prosecutor of the Ankara State Security  Court, an investigation was started on the grounds that  propaganda against the nation was conducted during the HADEP  congress yesterday. Pointing out that slogans in favor of the  terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization were  voiced during the congress, Demiral noted: We will investigate  whether or not this party is a front organization. Demiral  remarked that the transcripts of voice and video cassettes  recorded during the congress will also be studied within the  framework of the investigation.    Meanwhile, Interior Minister Nahit Mentese announced that  criminal charges will be filed with regard to the first HADEP  congress. In a news conference in Istanbul's Yalova District,  Mentese said that HADEP was established to replace the Democracy  Party, which was banned by the Constitutional Court. Mentese  noted that the statements made in favor of the PKK and Apo [nom  de guerre for PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan] during the congress  constitute a crime and criminal charges will be filed in this  connection. He declared: Our country and nation are  indivisible. No one will be able to divide them.    Mentese explained that the Kurds in Turkey possess all  rights, there is no ethnic discrimination between citizens of  Turkish, Kurdish, Circassian, or Albanian origin, and everyone  is a first- class citizen. The interior minister added: The  Kurds may be second-class citizens in Iraq; but, in our country,  they are first-class citizens.    In reply to a question, Mentese said that the necessary  procedures have been started to convert Yalova into a province.</p>

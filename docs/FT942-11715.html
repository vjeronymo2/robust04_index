			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Charges reduced for Chile's Codelco three Santiago's Court of Appeals on Monday ordered the release from prison of three former sales executive's of Codelco, the state-owned Chilean mining group, and drastically reduced charges against them over futures trading operations that resulted in losses of USDollars 207m. Mr Juan Pablo Davila, Codelco's former chief futures operator, is now charged with causing the company losses by deception, which carries a maximum sentence of 541 days in prison. His two immediate superiors are now charged with being accomplices, for having failed to keep a check on his activities, and face a maximum sentence of 66 days. Previous charges against all three of having defrauded the state were dropped because Codelco workers are not classified as public employees for penal purposes, although the company is 100 per cent state-owned. Those charges could have resulted in five-year sentences, as well as hefty fines. None of the three was had to put up bail as the new charges were not considered sufficiently serious. Mr Davila had been in custody since March 11 and the others since April 8. Codelco, which lost Dollars 13m after tax in 1993, compared with a Dollars 303m profit in 1992, no longer trades futures.</p>

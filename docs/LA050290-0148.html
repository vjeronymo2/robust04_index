			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> A SPECIAL REPORT: SPRING INTO FALL;  </P> <P> ECOWEAR;  </P> <P> NEW COSMETIC REFILLS SAVE MONEY, THE ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P> Beyond no-frills packaging lies an old idea -- refillable cosmetics. (Remember  Granny's ornate refillable compact?) Though cosmetic giants such as Estee  Lauder, Guerlain and Clinique offer refillable compacts ranging in price from  $25 to $125, with plastic-encased refills selling for $6.50 to $28, powder is  no longer the lone refillable.  </P> <P> "A variety of companies are offering at least a few refillable makeup  products," says Diane Consalvi, cosmetic buyer for Nordstrom's Orange County  stores.  </P> <P> One company that combines makeup products in one component is Intelligent  Skincare. It offers a refillable, customized system called the Selector. The  purse-size case, available at Nordstrom, sells for about $15. A variety of  makeup -- sold separately and priced from $5.50 to $16 -- fits inside. There  are slide-out blushes, eye shadows and face powders.  </P> <P> At Body Scents in Sherman Oaks, environmentally responsible customers often ask  for refills of the shop's personal hair and skin products, says Shirley  Wilkoff, shop co-owner. Though such requests are infrequent, Wilkoff expects  they will increase as environmental concerns grow.  </P> <P> "It seems like a good idea, ecologically speaking, but I think it is best to  start with a new plastic bottle after the second refill," says Wilkoff,  explaining that freshness and consistency cannot be ensured without an  absolutely clean container.  </P> <P> Susan Perry, district manager of the Canada-based, cruelty-free Makeup Art  Cosmetics, agrees that reusing containers is problematic. Still, the firm is  doing its ecological best to ensure its plastic containers are reused. It  offers a free lipstick for every six empty Makeup Art containers the customer  returns to its cosmetic counters -- locally, in select Nordstrom stores. Makeup  Art then transports the containers to public recycling centers.  </P></p>

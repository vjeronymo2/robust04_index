			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Setting out to build a republic on bananas - Tim Coone describes Nicaragua's transforming interest in plantations and investment DURING the late 1980s, when the left-wing Sandinista party's grip on power in Nicaragua began to slip, one of the country's several conservative parties sponsored a billboard in the capital, announcing that 'Nicaragua will once again become a republic'. Some comic immediately painted in 'banana' before the word republic. The anonymous graffiti writer may soon be proved correct, although the new republic will not be one of bemedalled generals in dark glasses, being financed by shady, foreign 'banana company men'. The government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro this month passed a new decree which will allow the return of foreign investors in the banana business after a decade of absence from Nicaragua. New investors, as well as the traditional banana transnationals such as Standard Fruit and United Brands, are being invited to establish plantations. The private Nicaraguan growers see in the decree an ideal opportunity to transform Nicaragua's poor export performance, and in the process to make an almost infallible investment in what has become a booming world banana market. Mr Ramiro Gurdian, a plantation owner and president of the farmer's association Upanic, said that 'it is one of the agro-export sectors which gives the quickest return on investment and shows a rapid result on the balance of payments'. Banana plantations, once sown, produce their first harvest within a year. Nicaragua stopped being a major banana producer when Panama disease wiped out the country's principal plantations on the Caribbean coast in the 1930s. The US transnational Standard Fruit Company had purchasing contracts on the Pacific coast with local growers such as Mr Gurdian until the 1979 revolution. From there, they supplied the US West Coast market. As Mr Gurdian pointed out, Nicaragua is the closest point in Latin America to the US West Coast, which has the appropriate soils and climate for banana production. The Sandinistas and Standard Fruit quickly fell out. Unions were legalised. The banana export trade was nationalised and placed in the hands of the state-run company Embanic. A decree was issued by former President Daniel Ortega, giving Embanic a monopoly on any future banana production for export. A price war began in the California market to try to exclude Nicaraguan produce. A 1985 US trade embargo then halted exports altogether. Embanic successfully redirected fruit to the European market, although higher transport costs cut deeply into its profits. The growers and Embanic survived, and Nicaraguan exports are expected to reach 6-7m boxes this year, once again returning to the levels of the mid-70s. Mr Gurdian is confident of further expansion as a result of the new decree. A new foreign investment law, permitting the unrestricted repatriation of profits generated from export earnings, has been passed. Mr Gurdian said: 'We are looking ahead to the creation of the unified market in Europe in 1993'. The market in Eastern Europe has also provided new opportunities. Nicaraguan produce is already going to Poland, through Embanic's independent intermediaries in Belgium. Mr Gurdian is doubling his plantations from 120 to 240 hectares this year. He said that he and the 15 other private growers in Nicaragua 'don't mind the transnationals coming back. We welcome their presence'. It is unlikely that he will be selling to them in the future. He explained that Nicaraguan farmers, with the Colombian private growers' association Proban, are sending a weekly shipment to Belgium through their own outlets inedependently of the large transnationals. Five reefer vessels are chartered. In 1975, the price paid by Standard Fruit to local growers was only USDollars 0.75 per 40lb box. Last year, Nicaraguan growers were selling their produce at an average of USDollars 11 per box, cif in Belgium through Embanic. Even accounting for insurance and freight in the latter figure, returns to growers are some ten times higher than 15 years ago. Mr Gurdian said that the US companies will be looking primarily to supply the US West Coast market again. 'We don't want to enter into battle with them' he said. Only 2,600 hectares are presently planted to bananas in Nicaragua, an area 10-20 per cent of neighbouring Costa Rica or Honduras. At some USDollars 15,000 per hectare to establish a plantation on the Pacific coast, banana production is capital intensive. Nicaragua's remote and poverty-stricken Caribbean coast, offering a shorter route to the European market, would be even more expensive. This route would require finance on a scale which only large foreign companies or banks could muster. It is thus a born-again 'banana republic' that is sprouting new roots in Nicaragua. It is one without thumbscrews or wheezy military bands, but one with new laws and ethics, attuned to the restructuring of the world's banana trade and the new democratic thinking in Latin America.</p>

Coach House's regional manager ordered the  masks removed after the chain was barraged with protests, including calls and  letters from members of the Jewish Student Union at Humboldt State University  in nearby Arcata. The Hitler masks had been on display at the Coach House kiosk  in a Eureka mall. A chain spokeswoman said the store will no longer sell the  masks of Hitler, who ordered the deaths of millions of Jews during World War  II. Elissa Sagle, a member of the Jewish Students Union, said she was pleased  at the decision.  </P></p>

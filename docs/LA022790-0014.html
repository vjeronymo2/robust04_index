			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOW COMES THE HARD PART  </P> <P> It was an uphill struggle, but the election of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro as  president of Nicaragua may eventually look like a relatively easy achievement  when compared to the daunting array of problems facing her new government.  </P> <P> First comes the exchange of power with the current Sandinista regime. Ousted  President Daniel Ortega is being admirably statesmanlike in his public  pronouncements, promising to respect the election results. But Ortega speaks  only for the pragmatists in the Sandinista party, and Chamorro may well need  his help to keep the reins on ideologues like Interior Minister Tomas Borge,  who built the Soviet-style police apparatus in Nicaragua. Ortega must also  persuade his older brother Humberto, the defense minister, to depoliticize the  Nicaraguan army, now little more than a branch of the Sandinista party. A good  first step would be to substantially scale down its 60,000-plus size.  </P> <P> Next comes the challenge of trying to build a government from an unwieldy  coalition of 14 political parties ranging from Communist to conservative. If  Chamorro can't pull it off, she may wind up facing a congress in which the  largest faction is the Sandinistas. That's a scenario for political gridlock  that could reduce Chamorro to a weak political symbol, revered but not  effective.  </P> <P> Then there's the challenge of demobilizing the Contra army created by the U.S.  government to pressure the Sandinistas. There never was much reason for the  Contras to exist, and now there is none. But thousands of them are still  wandering about the hinterlands of Nicaragua and neighboring Honduras, heavily  armed and, in some cases, saying that they will not give up until they're good  and ready.  </P> <P> Which brings us to the issue of Washington's role in Nicaragua, and Chamorro's  toughest problem of all: rebuilding an economy shattered after almost 12 years  of revolution and war. Not all of Nicaragua's financial troubles -- inflation,  unemployment, food and fuel shortages -- are Washington's fault. The thievery  of the old Somoza dictatorship and the incompetence of the Sandinistas'  economic planners contributed to the chaos. But the embargo imposed by the  Reagan Administration hurt by cutting Nicaragua off from its biggest and  closest market for its goods. Opening the U.S. market to Nicaragua could do  wonders for the psyche, not to mention the pocketbook, of the country's  economically battered businesses and workers. The least President Bush could do  is lift all economic sanctions against Nicaragua now.  </P></p>

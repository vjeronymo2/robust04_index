			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Special Report on Second Cars: Spoiled for choice - Load carriers YOU HAVE a young family, dogs, or both. Perhaps, as a keen gardener, you need to carry loads of rockery stone. Or you haunt furniture auctions, hoping for bargains. Whichever the case, you need a roomy estate car. There was a time when, if a Mercedes-Benz 200-300T, Volvo 240/740/940, Renault Savanna or Vauxhall Carlton suited neither your pocket nor your requirements, you were stuck. But, within the past year or two, Ford's Granada (Scorpio) estate has made a welcome (if belated) reappearance; Citroen's champion weight-lifter, the XM estate, was introduced; and two beefy Germans - the Audi 100 and BMW 5-Series Touring, the latter an estate car in all but name - joined the load-carrying ranks. More recently, yet more have arrived. Mitsubishi's Australian-built, front-wheel driven, three-litre Sigma has a huge amount of interior space and combines US-style smoothness with an almost Germanic feeling of strength and swiftness. Toyota's Camry luxury estate car was developed and is being produced in the US from which - like Honda's agreeable Accord estate - it is exported to Britain. And one of the best all-rounders for space and refinement (as well as secure handling) is the new Volvo 850 estate with front-wheel drive. Sadly, the genuine seven-seat estate car - where everyone faces forward and which has a realistic amount of space for their luggage - is a disappearing breed. The splendid Peugeot 505 and Citroen CX Familiale models are no more, though a Renault Savanna with seven front-facing seats is still around. Several large estates, among them the much underrated Rover Montego and various Volvos, can be had with seven seats but the rearmost bench faces backward. When in use, it is suitable only for children up to the age of 12 and takes up all the luggage space. This, too, is the snag with multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) such as the Renault Espace and Nissan Serena. Because recreational 4 x 4s like the Range Rover, Land Rover Discovery and Mitsubishi Shogun are massively broad-shouldered does not mean they have huge amounts of cargo space. They do not. The Range Rover is the worst because its enormous spare wheel is stowed internally; the others do at least have it bolted on to the back door. Bought new, large estate cars can be fairly pricy. A Mercedes-Benz 240T starts at Pounds 23,400, an Audi 100 at Pounds 19,170, and a BMW 5-Series Touring Pounds 21,800. Ford's Granada estate (from Pounds 17,916), the Renault Savanna (remarkably, from only Pounds 10,870 for a 1.7-litre), the Vauxhall Carlton (from Pounds 15,570) and the Volvo 240 (from Pounds 13,395 for a soon-to-disappear Torslanda) are among the best, and least capital-intensive, buys. Those looking for second-hand purchases find that large estates hold their prices better than saloons. Two for which to look out are the Citroen XM and Volvo 940 2.4SE turbo-diesels (Pounds 20,465 and Pounds 20,745 respectively when new). For a combination of price, space, weight-shifting ability and fuel economy, they have no peers.</p>

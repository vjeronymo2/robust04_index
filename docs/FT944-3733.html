			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Architecture: In the spirit of Brunel - Colin Amery gives his opinion on Britain's Building of the Year An amusing architectural conversation took place on the BBC Today programme the other day. On the one hand was Nicholas Grimshaw, architect of the Eurostar Terminal at London's Waterloo Station, on the other was Giles Worsley, editor of the architectural magazine Perspectives. They were there to discuss the award of 'Building of the Year' to the new Waterloo Terminal, in the hope that 'high-tech' and 'traditionalist' would conduct a fierce battle of the styles. It was not to be - perfect harmony reigned. Waterloo Terminal, as we had all noticed, was as traditional as St. Pancras Station. The blood of Isambard Kingdom Brunel flowed in the veins of Nicholas Grimshaw, and all the fuss about the naive ugliness of the 'high-tech' style, or the absence of any referential language in modern architecture, was forgotten. Does this mean that the polarised arguments about contemporary architecture are over? Will modernists and traditionalists lie down together like lambs? I do not think it is as simple as that. The fact that the new Waterloo Terminal has won a place in hearts of the different factions is a recognition of certain common denominators of quality. It is also a recognition of the fact that Grimshaw's big curved shed at Waterloo is based firmly upon designs from the past. It does not break any structural records; it succeeds because it is a pragmatic solution to a series of functional problems. Whether it is great architecture is probably more debatable. The most difficult problem for the architect at Waterloo was to design a roof to cover five railway tracks with no space for any platform on the outermost edge of the station. This means that on one side the track is right up against the side of the shed. To deal with this the roof is made up of two beams that apparently lean on one another as they span the platforms. As the platforms curve and the roof also gets narrower as it comes to the end of the longest platforms, the whole thing takes on the character of a sinuous blue worm that almost appears to move and wriggle to accommodate itself to the awkward site. Much of the credit for this building should go to the engineer Anthony Hunt, who worked so closely with the architect. Between them they managed to turn what might have been seen as the insuperable disadvantages of the difficult site into clear benefits for the design. What I particularly admire are the vigorous joints. Where the great beams hit the ground or each other they are linked by giant three-pin metal fixings. The whole roof can turn at these hinges as the metal expands, or if a hurricane blows. There is also movement in the platforms. As a train arrives the platform moves because it is resting on a series of steel plates, allowing it, and the roof, to roll imperceptibly. Such ingenious engineering deserves to win prizes. But the title 'Building of the Year' was awarded also because the terminal building is popular with travellers. Whether it will work so well when there are more frequent trains and more crowds with more luggage will take time to prove. What has been successful at Waterloo is the simple fact that the place still feels like a railway station. The wish to make travelling by train as much like flying as possible has been almost totally resisted. Certainly there is a real sense of arrival at Waterloo, which is in marked contrast to the very low-key atmosphere at the Gare du Nord. What was the competition for this 'Building of the Year' award? There was another railway station - Manchester Airport Station by Austin Smith: Lord and Partners. There was the brilliant conversion of the Gas Hall in Birmingham into an exhibition space by Stanton Williams; the Tate Gallery at St. Ives by Evans and Shalev and the opera house at Glyndebourne by Michael Hopkins and Partners. There was also a surprising number of new churches and libraries - and a marked absence of new commercial offices. The growth of fundholding general medical practitioners has also caused a considerable increase in the number of new, and frequently well-designed medical practice buildings. One of the best was the Oswald Medical Practice in Chorlton cum Hardy in Manchester. This is a clever mixture of old and new. The basis of the practice is a Victorian house which has been partly restored but has also been added to, with very striking modern additions that contrast rather than adapt to the context. The architects are Hodder Associates. Perhaps the clue to the new catholicity in architecture and the almost worrying agreement between all parties to the stylistic debate is in the willingness to adapt the new to the old. Recently, talking to one of the very best architects in the world who is based in London we shared our disappointment that so many of the schemes applying for help from the Lottery or the Millennium Fund are not brave new buildings but adaptations of old ones. But perhaps that is not such a bad thing - the Waterloo Terminal demonstrates how much the new can learn from the old, and how the result can still be both original and popular.

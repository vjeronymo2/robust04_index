A  Foreign Ministry statement broadcast by official Kabul Radio denied U.S.  charges that Soviet military personnel still seemed to be aiding government  forces. It said the advisers are there "for technical acquaintance with  weapons, but they do not take part in operating the weapons." Soviet troops  pulled out of Afghanistan last February.  </P></p>

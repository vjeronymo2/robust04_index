			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Branson rail plan on brink of collapse PLANS by Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group to start an experimental express train service in competition with British Rail appeared to be on the verge of collapse yesterday. Mr Branson said it had emerged during talks with BR that charges likely to be imposed by the corporation would be too high for the Virgin service to be commercially viable. Virgin is now likely to drop its plans to operate trains on the London-Edinburgh-Glasgow route until after parliament has approved the privatisation of BR. Mr Branson had planned to be the first private-sector operator of express trains on BR's tracks by starting up a service next year before the privatisation legislation. He says the plans are foundering because BR says that, in addition to other charges, its statutes would require Virgin to compensate the corporation for revenues lost as a result of the competition. 'It's like being told you can compete with British Airways on transatlantic routes as long as you compensate them at the end of the year for all the profits they have lost,' Mr Branson said. He said he did not believe BR was being deliberately obstructive. 'I think they have had a good, genuine look at our plans, but they have come up with some problems which may be insurmountable.' Mr Branson said the relevant statutes would be superseded by privatisation legislation. He still hoped to introduce a main-line passenger service, but the hitch would mean a delay of at least a year. The apparent collapse of Mr Branson's plans is the second blow in a fortnight to the government's plans efforts to encourage private-sector participation in running trains. At the end of last month Charterail, a private-sector freight operator, came close to calling in the liquidators. BR said it could not comment on the discussions with Virgin because they were confidential, but the talks were continuing.</p>

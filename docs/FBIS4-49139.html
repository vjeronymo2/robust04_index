			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Zhao Wen (6392 2429): </F> "Motion on the Amendment to the New Territories Ordinance  Should Be Shelved"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 27 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN  SHE)--"Yesterday, the Headquarters for Struggle to Defend Homes  and Clans" of the Heung Yee Kuk [township consultative  council--an organization representing the interests of  indigenous New Territories residents] of the New Territories  held a mammoth meeting and a demonstration of indigenous New  Territories inhabitants, and decided to stage a 10,000-strong  protest march at Victoria Park on Hong Kong Island on 8 May. At  the same time, "The Great Alliance to Safeguard the Traditions  of the New Territories," an organization set up spontaneously by  indigenous New Territories inhabitants, also is planning to  conduct several protest activities. Thus is can be seen that  activities of indigenous New Territories inhabitants to oppose  the motion to amend the New Territories Land (Exemption) Bill  show no signs of declining, but are tending toward gradual  escalation. Various circles in society and the mass media  universally hold that the motion to amend the New Territories  Land (Exemption) Bill should be shelved in order to avoid social  turmoil or a split among the people of Hong Kong.    The formulation of the New Territories Ordinance and the  forms of property rights inheritance of the indigenous  inhabitants of the New Territories have a long historical  background. All previous Hong Kong governors have abided by the  New Territories Ordinance and have respected the forms of  property rights inheritance and other traditions and customs of  the indigenous inhabitants. The Sino- British Joint Declaration  and the Basic Law also give solemn commitments and guarantees to  them. However, owing to the development of urbanization in the  New Territories, the uses of much of the land have changed, and  new variables have emerged in the issue of property rights  inheritance. The Hong Kong Government therefore put forward the  New Territories Land (Exemption) Bill so as to dispel doubts and  misgivings in property inheritance of proprietors of more than  300,000 residential and private houses in the New Territories  without affecting the interests, traditions, and customs of the  indigenous New Territories inhabitants. The New Territories  Heung Yee Kuk and the overwhelming majority of the indigenous  inhabitants were sensible people and expressed their  understanding and agreement. The Heung Yee Kuk also reached a  consensus with the Hong Kong Government.    Unexpectedly, when the Hong Kong Government submitted the  New  Territories Land (Exemption) Bill to the Legislative Council,  Loh Kung-wei, an appointed member of the Legislative Council,  proposed an amendment extending the scope of exemption in the  bill to include village land. This was done without careful  consideration and without first carrying out any consultation.  The Hong Kong Government originally said it would not support  the amendment, but later changed its mind and was in favor of  it. If this amendment is adopted and implemented, the New  Territories Ordinance will exist in name only, and there will be  an impact on the traditions, customs, and legitimate rights and  interests of the indigenous New Territories inhabitants. In  addition, this motion is evidently in conflict with relevant  provisions and commitments in the Joint Declaration and the  Basic Law. It is even more difficult for the indigenous  inhabitants to accept this. Therefore, it is quite  understandable that the proposed amendment has caused strong  resentment and protests among the indigenous inhabitants.    The crux of the issue is that the indigenous New Territories  inhabitants' opposition to the proposed amendment to the New  Territories Land (Exemption) Bill is aimed at safeguarding the  continuity of the New Territories Ordinance and at not  permitting any attempt by outside forces to change their  traditions and customs. The former involves the long-standing  commitments and administrative policies of the Hong Kong  Government, and no change should be made lightly. The latter  involves the issue of changing prevailing habits and customs,  and such changes can be made only gradually, through  consultation. The move by the Hong Kong Government to impose  such changes on the indigenous inhabitants by means of  legislation without any consultation is obviously unwise and  wrong. It has caused disputes and chaos in the life and  internal relationships among the indigenous inhabitants, and to  a certain extent, has caused social unrest and a split among the  people of Hong Kong.    The Hong Kong Government announced some time ago a delay in  submitting the bill to the Legislative Council for examination;  the reason given was to study how many existing regulations  would be affected by the amendment and to study its impact. To  date, however, the departments concerned of the Hong Kong  Government have not yet solicited the views of the Heung Yee Kuk  or the indigenous inhabitants, and the departments concerned are  continuing to divorce themselves from reality and are acting  blindly. Evidently, the escalation of protest activities by the  Heung Yee Kuk and the indigenous inhabitants is caused by their  worry that after its "study," the Hong Kong Government will  cling obstinately to its course, force the amendment through,  present a fait accompli, and compel the indigenous inhabitants  to accept it.</p>

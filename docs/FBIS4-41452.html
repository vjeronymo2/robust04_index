			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsky; Edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin is convinced that  signing of the agreements on partnership and cooperation between  Russia and the European Union will help to remove numerous  discriminations in trade relations with partners on this  continent. Yeltsin voiced this statement on Thursday morning  before his departure to the Greek island of Corfu where he is to  sign this agreement with leaders of the European Union countries  on June 24.    Responding to journalists, Yeltsin said that until now there  have been discriminating measures in the relations between the  Russian Federation and European Union "we had no quotas for  goods export." According to Yeltsin, this draft agreement says  that Russia is recognized as a country with an economy of a  transition type. He also added that the draft agreement with  the European partners establishes the most favored nation regime  in trade.    Yeltsin is convinced that this is a very important fact, as  well as the establishment of precise dimensions in the sphere of  trade and export of goods from Russia.    "Russia will only win thanks to signing of this agreement.  This is the first practical move when Russia enters Europe and  becomes a European country of full value," Yeltsin emphasized.  He made it clear that the draft agreement also determines  concrete volumes of quotas, namely "how much uranium and  aluminium we shall sell." "Earlier we were not allowed to Europe  with these goods and now we have determined how much we can and  must sell. This is very good," Yeltsin said.    Mentioning domestic problems, Yeltsin underlined that he  does  not intend to suspend his decree on measures to combat banditism  and organized crime.    IF Note: On Wednesday the lower chamber of the Russian  parliament recommended to the president to abstain from  introduction of this decree as it assesses this decree as an  anti-constitutional one.    In response to our Interfax special correspondent Boris  Grishchenko on his arrival to Corfu, Boris Yeltsin declared that  "blockade will be lifted from Russia" after the signing of these  documents with the European Union. As he said, it is Europe  "which will be the first to remove this blockade. However, the  blockade on the part of the United States still remains."    The agreement which Yeltsin called "a historic document"  will  be signed on Friday afternoon. It consists of 81 pages.    In Yeltsin's words, it will help Russia to enter the  European  market and the Russian market will be open for Europe. "We  become equal partners for the sake of mutual benefit," Yeltsin  empathized.</p>

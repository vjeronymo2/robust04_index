			<p>BFN     [Text] Prompted by the latest wave of ethnic cleansing in  Banja Luka and the surrounding villages under Serbian  occupation, President of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency Alija  Izetbegovic has written separate letters to the UN Security  Council, UN Secretary General's special envoy Yasushi Akashi, UN  High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata, and President of  the International Red Cross Antonio Samaruga.    There is concrete evidence that every day, Karadzic's  fascists are expelling some 300 Bosniaks and 150 to 200 Croats  from Banja Luka. The exiles are first stripped of all their  property, including their savings and personal jewelry.  President Izetbegovic draws attention to the fact that the UN  Protection Forces, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the  International Red Cross are providing the one-way  transportation, and warns that their duty is actually exactly  the opposite. They are supposed to guarantee all the people's  survival in their home towns and on their ancestral hearths,  stresses President Izetbegovic in letters addressed to the most  prominent UN officials and the International Red Cross.</p>

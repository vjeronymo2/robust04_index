			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Communique" issued by the Political Commission and </F> Deputies of the Peoples Revitalizing Expression and the National  Resistance of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front in  El Salvador; date not given]    [Text] The deputies and members of the Political Commission  of the FMLN, on behalf of the National Resistance, RN, and the  Peoples Revitalizing Expression, ERP, hereby make it known that:    1. We regret the emotional reactions of FMLN comrades over  the fact that a group of FMLN deputies exercised its legal right  to nominate and be nominated for positions on the Legislative  Assembly's Board of Directors.    2. It concerns us that offensive and fallacious attitudes  are being fostered in the internal debate. There is talk of  expulsions or punishment, impossible to apply to something that  is legal and normal for any democratic party in the world. This  attitude projects an image of the FMLN as an authoritarian party.    3. We appeal to the FPL [Popular Liberation Forces], the PC  [Communist Party of El Salvador], and the PRTC [Revolutionary  Party of Central American Workers] to remain calm and to  seriously pursue a new internal agreement. This agreement  should define the terms of the alliance between the two  tendencies that throughout the FMLN's history have existed and  that have had innumerable differences. The war is over. None  of the currents can any longer be a political prisoner for  attempting to maintain the image of a united party that has  never really existed. The political identity of each tendency  is as important as our alliance in facing the right wing.    4. We hereby suggest that there be a mature debate of the  main points that differentiate us, such as the true or apparent  acceptance of a market economy and private property, the  struggle inside the system or control of the system, the  validity or invalidity of Marxist-Leninist precepts, the  acceptance that we are living a new reality in a developing  democratic process while defending the challenging and  confrontational manner of speech or political style.    5. We believe that the parliament's work is a matter of  dialogue, negotiations, and agreements among political parties.  This is why deputies are elected. This is why we never  considered as negative the search for understanding that  comrades in the FPL, PC, and the PRTC undertook with ARENA  [Nationalist Republican Alliance] with regard to holding  positions on the Board of Directors. We want to point out to  you that it was a political error not to make proposals on the  day established for this. Because of this, you projected an  image of rejecting the system that was not positive while you  lost the opportunity for the plenum to chose you. We always  made it known to you that we would nominate candidates if we did  not reach consensus on this point and if the majority tried to  impose nominations on us. We have not acted behind anyone's  back nor was there any need to reach agreement with anyone. We  only nominated candidates according to the deadline, setting  aside for subsequent discussion the problems of the Assembly's  internal rules.    6. The RN and the ERP reconfirm their support for the left  wing's renovation and modernization in keeping with the new  realities of peace, thus effectively defending the popular  interest. We reject challenging and anti-system attitudes that  seek to soothe the ideologically conscious but that do not  produce specific results for the people, while projecting a  war-mongering and conflictive image that alienates the support  of the vast majority. We favor strengthening our credibility as  a political party that is satisfied with the rules of the game  and that accepts and respects its adversaries. In this way its  coming to power does not constitute a threat to any sector of  Salvadoran society.    [signed] ERP and RN Political Commission and Deputies</p>

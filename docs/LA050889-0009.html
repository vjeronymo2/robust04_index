			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COFFEE COMPLAINT  </P> <P> We are certainly a most accommodating people: Not one word of complaint has  been heard concerning the obvious collusion of all major coffee manufacturers  who now sell us 13 ounces of coffee in the same size can that once held a full  pound. The former 48-ounce can now gives us only 39 ounces. Same cost.  Sometimes a little higher.  </P> <P> You have to wonder why this sneaky ploy is OK with everyone, right?  </P> <P> Yet, we're being robbed!  </P> <P> HANNAH SAMPSON  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

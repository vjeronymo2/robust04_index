			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Kunlachada Chaiphiphat in Hanoi] </F>   [Text] Vietnam is prepared to reopen wide-ranging talks on  the diversion of water from the Mekong River and its major  tributaries if they are held in a constructive manner, one of  Vietnam's chief negotiators on the Mekong Committee said on  Monday. Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet is expected to  discuss his country's stand during his meeting with Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai when the Thai leader visits Hanoi from  March 16 to 19, said Hoang Trong Quang, permanent secretary of  the Vietnam National Mekong Committee in an interview with THE  NATION.    Hoang Trong Quang, who stressed he was speaking in a private  capacity, said if Thailand does not agree to Hanoi's  requirements there will be no agreement at all. "In that case,  Vietnam is prepared to leave the committee," he said. "We need  the committee but it must fulfill its function. If it has no  right to make any decision (it is a) committee for what," he  said. Quang said he wanted the Mekong Committee, which comprises  Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, to have a ruling say in  any project that may have negative repercussions on other  riverine states.    The current round of talks on a framework for the committee,  which have dragged on for two years, appeared close to a  conclusion in December after a year marked by squabbling between  Thailand and Vietnam. But negotiations broke down again in  January because of differences between the two countries.  Vietnam reportedly refused to endorse previously agreed points  in the 42-Article framework accord on the sustainable use of  water resources at a meeting of the technical drafting working  group in Vientiane.    Quang said the earlier negotiations had yet to settle the  contentious question of diversion of water from, the mainstream  and tributaries during the dry season, and two points in the  four-point Article Five dealing with the reasonable and  equitable utilization of water.    The National Mekong Committee's chief said Vietnam has  accepted these clauses but wanted the issue of dry season  diversions to be agreed upon by all the riparian states. The  Vietnamese chief delegate said the Thai delegation did not agree  to this at the Vientiane round of talks. "Vietnam has no  intention to place any preconditions but we do not want any use  of the waters causing harm to the other riparian states," he  said.    The secretary said Vietnam had not raised objections to  water  projects in Thailand, in particular the Kok-Ing-Nan project  which will draw water from the Kok River, a tributary of the  Mekong, and channel it via an underground canal to the Chao  Phraya River. Quang said Vietnam only brought up the project  during the Vientiane meeting for comment. "So far we have no  official information about that project," he said.    He said his country has legitimate concerns over the impact  of such projects on the lower reaches of the  four-million-hectare Mekong Delta, which is in danger of drying  up unless controls are implemented over the quantity of water in  the mainstream river.    In contrast to the earlier rounds of negotiation, Quang said  Vietnam has adopted a more flexible stand in regard to the  diversion clause. "It means that the upstream cannot change the  flow regime along the river," he said.    In a separate interview at the Bangkok-based Mekong  Secretariat, officials said the current mandate of the drafting  working group has expired and Vietnam must call for a renewed  mandate from the United Nations Development Programme which is  the main financier of the Mekong Committee's projects.    Under an agreement reached by the committee in Hanoi last  February, the drafting working group was given until last  October to conclude the drafting process.    "Thailand has given considerable concessions with regards to  national sovereignty. They agreed to notify the committee  before using water from the tributaries during the wet season  and to prior consultations during the dry season, according to  one official who asked not to be named.</p>

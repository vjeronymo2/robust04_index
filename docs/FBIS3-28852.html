The BN is set to topple the PBS ruling party  through a master plan for development and the creation of a new  Sabah, transforming the state on par with other states in  peninsular Malaysia. Through BN manifesto and the new Sabah  slogan, the BN has pledged, among other things, peace;  stability; prosperity; high economic growth; and by the turn of  the century, a per capita income of 10,000 [Malaysian ringgit] a  year; eradication of poverty, which is now 23 percent of the  population; and the setting up of a university.    The PBS has expressed confidence through its manifesto that  Sabah is for the strong-willed people of Sabah and continuity in  the voters would return it to power for a fourth consecutive  term.    Political observers and journalists following the BN and PBS  campaigns said that both -- the BN and PBS -- have a 50-50  chance of winning the election.    Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim, who is  campaigning in Sabah for the second time since nomination day on  7 February, is confident that the BN would wrest power from the  PBS. He has said that feedbacks received from all the 48  constituencies showed that the BN election machinery had been  able to counter the opposition claim and its own message had  been accepted by the voters.</p>

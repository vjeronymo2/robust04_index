			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: France seeks to publicise treaty PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand is hoping that today's planned declaration on 'subsidiarity' will combine the minimum of institutional change with the maximum public impact to help sell the Maastricht treaty. It is a strategy which may set him at odds with some EC leaders and the Commission, who favour a clear listing of the respective powers of the EC institutions and national governments. The focus on subsidiarity should take the form of 'a change in behaviour (of EC institutions) rather a new codification of powers,' Mr Jean Musiteli, the Elysee spokesman said yesterday. The principle should be formulated to let people know there would be 'a new break with the EC decision-making machinery as it has functioned up to now,' said Mr Musiteli. The French view is that subsidiarity - the sorting out of who does what in the EC - cannot be achieved in a legalistic way. 'You would have to be a surgeon to try to divide with a scalpel what should be done by the Community and what should be left to member states,' he said. Rather, it should be up to the EC's top politicians, meeting in the European Council, to make political decisions on the political principle of subsidiarity. The aim should be, said Mr Musiteli, 'to reinforce the Community's capacity to take decisions in non-controversial, but essential areas' of policy in and outside the EC. In this light it is ironic that France expects little or no action on two other items on today's agenda - monetary co-operation and the Gatt trade talks. Mr Mitterrand will be content to discuss, in general terms, the European Monetary System. Mr Musiteli maintained that last month's crisis showed there was little wrong with the system itself, but that it was provoked by the dollar's fall and aggravated by the internal economic problems of some EMS participants. This week's failure of US and EC negotiators to produce a breakthrough in the Gatt talks avoids placing President Mitterrand in awkward isolation on agriculture. French officials continued to claim yesterday there was never any question of Mr Mitterrand boycotting the summit. For Mr Mitterrand to have left his chair empty in Birmingham would, for one thing, have raised fresh questions about his health.</p>

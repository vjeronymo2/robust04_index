			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Maksim Shiryamov report under the "Behind the Scenes" </F> rubric: "A Quiet Coup in State Duma"]    [Text] The latest meeting of the Russian parliament's lower  chamber has seen a palace mini-coup of sorts, as a result of  which actual levers of power in the State Duma will soon be  concentrated in the hands of one man.    This was said to your correspondent by Georgiy Zadonskiy, a  prominent parliamentary figure. Exploiting the inexperience of  a vast majority of the deputies, he explained, a document was  imposed on them without discussion that turns the modest State  Duma speaker into its president.    He meant the decree "On Providing Support for the State  Duma's Activity," which gives Chairman Ivan Rybkin powers to  form the chamber's staff. The chief of staff, who, among other  things, takes care of the parliamentarians' social and consumer  needs, was subordinated directly to the parliamentary speaker,  and comrade Ivan Rybkin, whose powers have until recently been  limited to a humble steering of meetings, suddenly got powerful  leverage for purposefully manipulating the deputy corps from  behind the scenes.    However decent a figure the current parliamentary chief may  have been cutting so far, it is still fresh in everyone's mind  how extremely modest Ruslan Imranovich [Khasbulatov] was "at the  beginning of glorious endeavors." [title of a novel about Peter  the Great] But the temptation "to go down in history" turned  out to be too irresistible. This is why the democrats, who  initially just stood gaping, are intent on ringing a bell in  that regard at the nearest State Duma plenary meeting.</p>

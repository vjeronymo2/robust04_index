			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAHANGA RESURFACES A DAY LATER  </P> <P> Gidamis Shahanga, who led Sunday's Los Angeles Marathon for 26 miles, then  dropped out of sight, surfaced Monday at a press conference, saying the heat  had forced him to slow his pace. He finished fourth.  </P> <P> Shahanga wasn't the only casualty claimed by Sunday's high temperatures, but  his was the most dramatic fade. Shahanga, from Tanzania, said he was in control  until the 20-mile mark.  </P> <P> "I missed the water stations at 23 and 24 miles," he said. "I think that  affected my performance. I felt so very tired that I had to walk. If I had  gotten water, I don't think we would be talking like this."  </P> <P> Shahanga said he missed getting water at 23 miles and didn't see the water  station at 24.  </P> <P> Art Boileau, who won in 2 hours 13 minutes 1 second, said he felt fine. He was  not as affected by the heat as Shahanga, who set a fast early pace. The women's  winner, Zoya Ivanova of the Soviet Union, whose time was 2:34:42, also said she  had no lingering effects from the heat.  </P> <P> Ivanova answered Sunday's burning question: Would Soviet officials allow her to  keep the luxury car she had won? Yes. Her order of a burgundy sedan would be  shipped to her home in the southeastern Soviet Union, where, she said, not even  the mayor had such a car.  </P> <P> Marathon President Bill Burke said he was pleased with the fourth annual race,  which drew 18,861 entrants.  </P> <P> "We need more time," he said. "Now we have the money, we have the recognition,  we have the athletes. We just need more time to mature."  </P> <P> Channel 13's marathon coverage averaged an 11.8 Nielsen rating and a 34 share,  the best sports rating of the day in Los Angeles. The Lakers on Channel 2 drew  a 7.4 rating and a 22 share, the Dodgers on Channel 11 a 5.9 and a 16.  </P> <P> Last year's L.A. Marathon on Channel 13 averaged a 12.5 rating and a 34 share.  </P></p>

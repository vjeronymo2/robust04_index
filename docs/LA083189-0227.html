			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> WILKINS TO GET $2.9 MILLION A YEAR  </P> <P> Hawks star forward Dominique Wilkins has a new five-year $14.5-million contract  that he says will allow him the peace of mind to "just go out and play ball."  </P> <P> The contract, to be signed today, will pay the 29-year-old Wilkins an average  of $2.9 million a year. Hawks President Stan Kasten agreed to set aside the  remaining two years of Wilkins' current contract, which pays him $1.4 million a  year.  </P> <P> Wilkins, the Hawks' crowd favorite and leading scorer last season, had sought a  salary of $3 million a year but said he has no problems accepting the lower  deal.  </P> <P> "I'm signing and I'm happy," Wilkins said. "I'm not complaining. I've got  security. I think I did pretty good for a guy with two years left."  </P></p>

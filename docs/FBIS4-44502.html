			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Southbound Policy and Market Expansion Beyond </F> Southeast Asia"]    [Text] The most prominent characteristics  in Taiwan's society in the past several years is that most of  the major changes invariably start from the civilian sector  which often plays the dominant role in developing the whole  situation. The responsible department of the government either  remains indifferent or sternly rebukes and adopts all kinds of  measures to oppose the changes. When the whole situation has  changed and what is done cannot be undone, the government  department would reverse its attitude, admit the facts and even  humbly regard such changes as an important government policy and  a major achievement of the government. This is true about the  mainland policy which affects Taiwan's economic future and the  relations between the two sides of the Straits. Even a more  typical example is the southbound policy which attracts the  attention of the whole society.    The southbound development of Taiwan's civilian industries  had already become more obvious even 10 years ago. This trend  had reached a peak about six to seven years ago. A large number  of Taiwan's export processing industries had suffered from the  sudden deterioration of Taiwan's own business environment. At  the same time, some Southeast Asian nations had readjusted their  foreign policies to improve their investment climate in order to  attract more foreign enterprises to establish factories there.  Their wages were ten times cheaper than that in Taiwan. These  favorable terms had posed an irresistible appeal to Taiwan's  export processing industries which were suffering from labor  shortages and soaring labor costs. As a result, Taiwan's  medium-sized and small enterprises went after such a good  opportunity like a flock of ducks, whipping up a high tide to  make investments in Southeast Asia. However, during that period,  the responsible government department was worried. It believed  that the exodus of a large number of export enterprises would  empty out Taiwan's industries. In addition, if these processing  enterprises move their equipment, technology and even orders and  markets to these nations having a lower labor cost, their action  would pose a serious threat to those enterprises which stayed in  Taiwan, and further destroy Taiwan's economy. Therefore, the  emphasis of the "southbound policy" at that time was how to  prevent enterprises from leaving Taiwan, constrain them to make  investments abroad and force them to leave the roots of their  industries in Taiwan. However, reality is grim. No matter how  much effort you exert to urge these enterprises to stay, most of  the export processing industries which had constituted Taiwan's  main force in exports left the island in a short period of a few  years. Naturally more and more export processing enterprises  have now moved from the south to the west and regard mainland  China's southeast coastal areas as a more favorable location for  their future development.    At a time when a large number of Taiwan's businessmen had  gradually lost their interest in Thailand, Malaysia and other  countries, several government departments suddenly reversed  their attitude, and began to shout aloud that they would  adequately support and aid those who invested their money in  Southeast Asia. Furthermore, hoisting high the banner of  "southbound policy", the president visited Indonesia, Thailand  and Philippines to carry out his vacation diplomacy during the  Spring Festival this year. For a short time, the cry to go south  was louder than ever before, and became the focal point of the  nation's policy.    Nevertheless, when this southbound banner was hoisted high,  the total investments of Taiwan's businessmen had decreased.  Moreover, problems had cropped up in those countries to which  the government encouraged Taiwan's businesses to invest.  Anti-Chinese riots suddenly broke out recently in Indonesia with  a population of 200 million which has always regarded itself as  the leader of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Even  now, riots have not been completely controlled. Such riots pose  a direct threat to the Taiwan investors' lives and properties.  As a result, their investment enthusiasm, which is not so warm  to begin with, would certainly cool off. Recently Taiwan's  businessmen had diverted their attention to Vietnam where the  wage scale remains extremely low and efficiency is the highest  in the Communist community in changing its economic structure.  However, since the United States lifted its embargo to Vietnam  in February this year, Vietnam has become a new focal point of  the major U.S., Japanese and European enterprises. The kind of  predominance enjoyed by Taiwan's businesses in Vietnam no longer  exists. The price of land in Vietnam is increasing, and there  are gradually less preferential treatments given to foreign  investors. The terms of making investments there are far less  favorable than before. This is another typical example of a  situation whereas this good prospect is like the evening glow of  the setting sun even if there is full support from the  government.    Perhaps, there is no need for us to worry about the changes  in Taiwan's southbound policy. On the contrary, they may provide  us with an opportunity to expand our market beyond Southeast  Asia. In despite of the adverse situation in countries which are  the targets of our southbound policy such as Thailand, Malaysia,  Indonesia and Vietnam, South Asia will undoubtedly remain the  area where it is full of vitality in today's world. It will  definitely be an action of passivity and self-immolation, if we  cannot join the other nations in taking the full advantage of  the sign of vitality in South Asia. Southbound market expansion  is a task that we must work hard to fulfill. However, we must  not restrict our activities to a designated area or sphere, and  limit ourselves to the aforementioned several nations. The  brightest star in South Asia today is India which has a  population as large as 800 million. It already has a fine  market, a sound legal and democratic system, an abundant supply  of cheap, English-speaking labor and a favorable geographical  position between Europe and Asia. India has adopted the policy  of improving the investment climate and opening to the outside  world since last year. This policy has indeed created a fine  condition for India to develop itself. It is also one of our  southbound targets which must not neglect.    We must not restrict ourselves to the several target  nations, when we study our southbound policy. In fact, we should  not limit ourselves to expanding our market southward. Because  our southbound policy, on the surface, can be used for the  economic benefits of our enterprises and as diplomatic  bargaining chips of our government. However, its true meaning is  to not only help more developing nations develop their export  processing industries with which they may increase their  purchasing power and promote the world's economic prosperity,  but also make use of the chain effect of the upper-stream and  downstream industries to expand the sales of Taiwan's products  and services and promote its economic development. As far as  this purpose is concerned, the gradual changes for the worse in  Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam indicate that the aforementioned  task has been basically fulfilled. We should now divert our  financial resources and manpower to other backward nations which  badly need development. We must not restrict ourselves to South  Asia only. Our banner should spread out in the south, the west,  the north and the east and in any area with a great potential  for future development, which awaits our assistance. This is the  major stride that we should make.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A four-cable bridle attaches the canopy bridle to the airplane primary structure. The cable lengths are designed to provide the best airplane touchdown attitude. The cables are routed externally and covered with small frangible fairings from the fuselage exit holes to the attach points.The applicants must supplement the FAA-approved Flight Manual as part of the STC. The supplement will describe the system, define the operating envelope with appropriate warnings, and define required system maintenance and inspection information. A separate FAA approved Operating Manual describing the previous items will be provided for those airplanes that do not have an FAA-approved Flight Manual.Recommended placards should be located near the pull handle in clear view of the pilot to identify the system and operating envelope, state deployment actions, and provide appropriate warnings. A warning placard should also be located on the canister near the rocket motor. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The installation of parachute recovery systems in part 23 airplanes was not envisioned when the certification basis for these airplanes was established. In addition, the Administrator has determined that current parts 21 and 23 do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for a parachute recovery system; therefore, this system is considered a novel and unusual design feature.Special conditions may be issued and amended, as necessary, as part of the type certification basis if the Administrator finds that the airworthiness standards designated in accordance with &sect;21.101(b)(2) do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards because of the novel and unusual design features of the airplane modification. Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 after public notice, as required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29(b), effective October 14, 1980, and become part of the type certification basis, as provided by &sect;21.17(a)(2).Special conditions are proposed for flight test demonstrations. These requirements would ensure that the parachute recovery system will perform its intended function without exceeding its strength capabilities. These requirements would also require that demonstrations be made to show that the parachute will deploy in various specified flight conditions.Special conditions are proposed for the occupant restraint provisions where applicable. These requirements ensure that airplanes modified with a parachute recovery system are equipped with a restraint system designed to protect the occupants from injury during parachute deployment and ground impact.Special conditions are proposed for the parachute performance. The requirements would ensure the following: (a) The parachute complies with the applicable section of TSO&hyph;C23c (SAE AS8015A) at the critical airplane weights, (b) the parachute deployment loads do not exceed the structural strength of the airplane, (c) the system will provide a ground impact that does not result in serious injury of the passengers, and (d) the system will operate in adverse weather conditions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

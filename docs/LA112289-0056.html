			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CONVENTION CENTER TO THROW PUBLIC PARTY  </P> <P> Think of it as moving into an almost completed new house. You can use the  bathrooms and the living room, but forget the kitchen and the outdoor patio.  Now picture more than 100,000 people dropping in for a visit.  </P> <P> That's akin to what the people at the San Diego Convention Center are faced  with as they prepare to formally open the new $160-million facility Friday  morning, the first day of what's billed as a weekend-long "Community  Celebration" ending late Sunday afternoon.  </P> <P> The center may be rough around the edges, but workers will be toiling around  the clock to finish and polish what they can (cleaning, hammering and carpet  laying were going full-bore Tuesday) for grand-opening ceremonies starting at  11 a.m. Friday. The center will be open from noon until 9 p.m. Friday, 10  a.m.-9 p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> "The opening of the San Diego Convention Center is an event that has been long  awaited by many people," said James Granby, president of the Convention Center  Corp. "It's only fitting that the citizens of this community be the first to  enjoy it."  </P> <P> The first event at the center actually took place Tuesday night, at a party for  700 put on by the San Diego Unified Port District, the agency paying for the  center's construction. The food was trucked in, though, as it will be when the  first paying guests arrive, because the center's huge kitchen will not be ready  for another month. Also waiting for completion next month is the  107,000-square-foot floor under the center's distinctive Teflon-coated tent  roof.  </P> <P> Other than those areas, though, most of the center will be open for inspection  by the public, and, with the exception of food sales, just about everything  else, from admission to the entertainment, will be free. If center officials  are correct and more than 100,000 people show up over the three days, parking  could present a problem. A series of outlying parking lots serviced by free  shuttle buses have been reserved.  </P> <P> The first 100,000 people who show up will be given a free color poster of the  center, donated by Union Bank, and the Convention Center Corp. will pass out  another 200,000 commemorative buttons, as well as balloons. Convention center  officials estimate that as many as 160,000 people will attend the opening, but  they concede that is only a guess.  </P> <P> The 254,000-square-foot main floor of the center will contain about 1,000  display booths, given over to nonprofit groups and government agencies. Also on  display will be military equipment such as an armored personnel carrier landing  craft, a helicopter and plane, fire trucks, classic cars and the city's new  50-foot portable jail.  </P> <P> Entertainment, ranging from an Irish tenor to African dancers, will be held  throughout the three days inside the center and in the outdoor amphitheater  facing the bay. Fireworks shows are set for 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday.  </P> <P> "The building is not totally done, but we're going to put on the best program  we can," said Convention Center Corp. spokeswoman Donna Alm.  </P> <P> Many of the city's civic leaders are expected at the opening ceremonies outside  the front of the center on Harbor Drive, and the King Committee for Justice is  expected to picket, protesting that the center was not named after the Rev. Dr.  Martin Luther King Jr., the slain civil rights leader. The King issue sparked a  political debate that ended when the Board of Port Commissioners voted against  the name change last summer.  </P> <P> The committee wants a woman, a Latino and a black appointed to the Board of  Port Commissioners, which is now made up of seven white male appointees, as  well as more jobs and contracts for minorities at the Port District.  </P></p>

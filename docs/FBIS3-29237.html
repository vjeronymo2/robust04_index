			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial report] Tokyo TV Asahi Network in Japanese at  0100 GMT on 13 February, during its weekly "Sunday Project"  panel discussion program, carries a 36-minute live interview  with Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura by Soichiro  Tahara, freelance political commentator and moderator of the  program. In the interview, Takemura comments on such issues as  the 11 February Hosokawa-Clinton talks, prospects for Japan-U.S.  relations, tax reform, and the current political situation.  Other participants in the panel discussion program -- Kyoto  University Professor Masaaki Kosaka, New York City University  Professor Yoshihiro Tsuyumi, Tokai Research Institute Director  Kenji Mizutani, INSIDER magazine chief editor Hajime Takano, and  co-moderator of the program Shinsuke Shimada -- occasionally  join the interview.    In connection with the Washington summit, Takemura says  Hosokawa was pessimistic about the results of the talks even  before his departure for Washington, saying: "I think he rather  thought it is difficult to narrow the gap between Japan and the  United States over the numerical target issue." In describing  Japan's stance toward the numerical target issue, Takemura says:  "Both Japan and the United States are market economy nations  and enjoy the free trade and market systems. So, we thought it  was totally impossible for the government to set up detailed  target figures for the private sector and exercise public  control over the market, because such a policy threatens the  very foundation of the nation's economic system. Since we had a  bitter experience from the semiconductor talks, we thought we  must clearly convey our position this time."    When asked about the Japanese Government's immediate tasks  to  redress worsening relations with the United States, Takemura  says: "Japan should not only adhere to its position. From the  viewpoint of the United States, Japan's trade surplus of over  $130 billion is actually a huge amount. The United States is  angry because the trade surplus is constantly growing. We must  take some action concerning the issue, and we should be fully  aware of Japan's responsibility. Fortunately, the rate of  Japan's trade surplus showed a slight decrease in the third  quarter of 1993. The rate was over 3 percent of Japan's gross  domestic product at its peak, but it is currently declining to  below 3 percent. According to the government's latest economic  forecast, the rate is expected to drop to 2.8 percent in fiscal  1995. So, we should continue all efforts to lower it through  such measures as market liberalization, expansion of the  domestic market, and deregulation. I think it is important to  keep telling the United States that the Japanese Government  intends to lower the trade surplus, and it is actually being  lowered."    In response to a question asking how long the two nations  need to cool down in preparation for the next round of the  framework talks, Takemura says it would take "six months, at the  longest," because Hosokawa and Clinton will see each other at  the Group-of-Seven summit in July, and the two nations have an  accord to carry on the summit talks biannually. He says Japan  will prepare its own action plan by then to obtain U.S.  understanding of Japan's efforts for reducing the trade surplus.    Turning to the tax reform issue, Takemura describes the  reason for his negative attitude toward Hosokawa's proposal for  raising the consumption tax. He states: "I think everyone,  including members of the Liberal Democratic Party, generally  agrees on the need for tax reform. However, the proposal was  made as a surprise announcement." He thus notes that the  Hosokawa proposal was made with inadequate consideration for the  current economic situation and for the position of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan, the largest group in the coalition  government.    Regarding Japan-U.S. policy coordination on a possible  embargo against the DPRK, Takemura notes he thinks Hosokawa is  well aware of the legal difficulties in preparing effective  sanctions. He says: "The prime minister is being careful about  this issue as he said Japan's action would be determined within  the limitations of the law. I think that means Japan will  follow the decisions of the international community within the  limitation of laws and the Constitution."</p>

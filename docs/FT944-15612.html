			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Cuba arrests raiding party Cuba said yesterday its security forces had captured a raiding party of seven armed Cubans from Miami who landed by launch on a causeway near Caibarien on the island's northern coast early on Saturday. The Interior Ministry said the seven, who wore camouflage uniforms, shot dead a local fishermen. Three of the raiders were wounded in a shootout with the security forces. The ministry described the seven as mercenaries, and the incident in Villa Clara province as a 'strange attempt of armed infiltration coming from the US'. It occurred a week before Cuban and US delegations were due to meet in Havana to review a bilateral immigration accord signed on September 9. In January 1992 Cuba said it executed by firing squad one of three Miami Cuban exiles captured landing with arms and explosives on the north coast.</p>

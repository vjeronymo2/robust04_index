			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Letter (1): Smaller companies put at risk by insider dealing plans Sir, The 'Tougher legislation on insider dealing' (September 9) has serious implications for smaller quoted companies. It will lead to a further withdrawal by institutions from funding smaller and medium-sized UK companies, just at a time when their requirement for funds is at its greatest and their ability to raise money from the banks is limited. Institutional investors in smaller companies have become increasingly concerned by the lack of liquidity in the shares of these companies. The effect of the legislation will mean that neither stockbrokers nor institutions will be able to have direct contact with companies except in respect of published information, and the institutions' compliance departments will probably insist that institutions do not buy shares on the recommendation of brokers, given that the brokers might have had some direct contact with the company. For these reasons, institutions will withdraw from direct investments in smaller companies, liquidity will decline, and institutions will be unwilling to fund placings, rights issues, etc. In the long term, no doubt, methods of financing can be devised similar to those in the development capital industry, which will provide equity funds for companies. However, by the time this change in our system occurs many worthy companies will either have gone to the wall or have been unable to pursue attractive commercial opportunities through lack of funding. I strongly advise directors of smaller quoted companies to lobby the government to change its mind. William Drake, Granville Davies, Mint House, 77 Mansell Street, London E1 8AF</p>

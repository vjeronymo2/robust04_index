			<p>BFN     [Text] The 37th session of the Commission for Narcotic  Substances, the leading UN body for control over narcotics, is  under way in the Austrian capital, attended by a Belarusian  delegation. The delegation's report provided an analysis of the  situation in the field of drug abuse in Belarus and measures  taken in this sphere at the national level. Concrete facts were  cited illustrating attempts by the international drug Mafia to  use Belarus for the transit of drugs from the East to the West  as an alternative to the traditional Balkan path. This path is  currently much more difficult to use in light of the fighting in  that region. Belarusian representative Mikalay Syerada  positively assessed the fruitful cooperation of the Republic of  Belarus with the UN bodies and voiced hope that Belarusian  efforts will receive adequate support from the United Nations.</p>

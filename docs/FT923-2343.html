			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / France gets tougher in prisons dispute THE French government yesterday issued suspension notices against a dozen more striking prison officers in an attempt to end the industrial dispute that has wrought havoc in the prison system, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. After the breakdown earlier this week of national negotiations with the warders' unions, the government is trying to negotiate on a regional basis. The justice ministry claimed the strike was waning, with 99 of France's 182 jails affected yesterday against 140 on Tuesday. French prison officers are demanding more staff and better security after a series of attacks by prisoners culminating in the murder of two officers within the past six weeks.</p>

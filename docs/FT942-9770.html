			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Falling sales take toll on Japanese watchmaker Citizen Watch, Japan's largest volume watchmaker, yesterday reported a sharp drop in full-year taxable profits, due to declining sales and a prolonged fall in capital investment. Pre-tax profits fell by 36.8 per cent to Y10.6bn (Dollars 1.03bn) in the year to March, easily wiping out the previous year's small rise, on turnover down by 7.4 per cent to Y233.7bn. Net profits fell by 36.5 per cent to Y6bn. Citizen warned that the outlook for demand was sluggish, while price competition and the yen's value were 'unpredictably difficult'. The group strengthened plans to cut costs and streamline production over the year and will continue to do so in 1994. It expects sales this year to fall further, to Y215bn. Watch sales, just under half total turnover, fell by 4.9 per cent to Y113.6bn, on a 9.7 per cent rise in unit production to 204.8m watches, implying a sharp contraction in margins. Titanium watches and watches linked to J-League professional soccer did well in Japan, but the yen's sharp rise produced poor export results. Information equipment and parts, just under 30 per cent of sales, saw a 6.8 per cent fall in turnover to Y69.5bn. Notebook computers and printers performed well after cost reductions and product improvements, but sales of floppy disk drives declined. Electronic equipment sales fell by 6 per cent to Y33.4bn, dragged down by poor performances in liquid crystal displays and portable televisions. Aggressive marketing for industrial machinery failed to stimulate demand, with many industrial companies burdened with surplus production capacity. As a result, that sector's sales fell by 23.7 per cent to Y13bn. Citizen will maintain its dividend at Y9 per share, which is just over twice covered by earnings of Y19.2 per share, down from earnings per share of Y30.65 in the previous year.</p>

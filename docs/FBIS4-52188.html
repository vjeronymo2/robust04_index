			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sinister Intention"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  accuses the Japanese reactionaries of revealing their scheme to  stage a comeback to Korea by crying for "regional security"  together with the South Korean puppets and talking about  "responsible countermeasure."    In a signed commentary on the South Korean puppet defence  minister's trip to Japan, the paper says:    During the Japan trip of the puppet defence minister of  South  Korea, the first of its kind ever, measures for "regional  security" to cope with the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK were  discussed.    If Japan is truly concerned for "regional security" it must  take issue with the United States which poses a grave threat to  peace and security on the Korean peninsula with a large number  of nuclear weapons while laying artificial obstacles to the  settlement of the nuclear issue, as well as its servants the  South Korean puppets.    The Japanese reactionaries plan to inveigle South Korea and  countries in the Asia-Pacific region in their "comprehensive  security sphere," because it is expected that their "security"  by the United States cannot be guaranteed in "case of  emergency." Their recent military confab with the South Korean  puppets was within this framework.    The tightening of the military tieup between the Japanese  reactionaries and the South Korean puppets is a threat to peace  and security in the Asia-Pacific region.    That is why the Asian peoples are heightening vigilance over  the intensified military collusion between Japan and South Korea.    The Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppets must  not act rashly.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Bargain-bin stocks disappear from stores NOT FAR from the cut-price knitted cardigans and the racks of unfashionable coats, the Nomura Securities counter at the Daimaru department store in downtown Osaka has its own specials - stocks at three-year lows and entire sectors at heavy discounts to the market average. But Japanese wanting to shop for stocks in a department store had better hurry. The Nomura outlet in Daimaru will close next month, and other brokers are closing their counters as rapidly as they were opened in the late 1980s. Yamaichi Securities, one of Japan's Big Four brokers, opened 10 'sales offices', as distinct from branches, after the finance ministry agreed in 1985 that a department store or railway station was an appropriate place for a securities counter. Yamaichi has closed all 10 this year. Another of the Big Four, Daiwa Securities, has closed three department store offices in the past two months and has seven sales offices left. Nomura's 20 sales offices will be reduced to 14 by the end of next month, and the rest are under review after a first half in which none of Japan's 14 leading brokers expects to report a profit. The 'sales offices' were a way around finance ministry restrictions on the opening of branches, and were able to operate as long as the department store was open. One drawback was the expense of installing an electronic stock board and computer equipment, but, more importantly, the ministry 'guided' the brokers to limit their sales activities. Ministry officials insisted that the staff, unlike branch employees, could not knock on doors in the local district. Store-based brokers were also told not to sell 'risky or speculative products', such as options and futures. 'We thought the customers would come to us, but they didn't,' a Nomura planning manager said. The broker found that the shoppers who wanted to talk stocks or bonds were already Nomura customers, while other potential clients were intimidated by the open-plan style of the stores and wanted more privacy when talking about personal finance. These outlets were further bruised when ordinary Japanese, already made wary by falling prices, became reluctant to purchase stocks after the surfacing of several scandals, including that of brokers' links to gangsters and the compensation of corporate clients for stock losses.</p>

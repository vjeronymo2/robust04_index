			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rallies as buyers return at lower levels Wall Street US blue chip stocks rallied yesterday amid relief that investors had failed to follow through on Friday's big sell-off, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 34.90 ahead at 3,906.32, aided by bargain hunting and a wave of program trading. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.95 better at 471.76, even though declining issues outnumbered advances by 1,176 to 1,021. The Nasdaq composite, after spending most of the day in negative territory, struggled back to 779.21 for a gain of 1.93. New York SE volume, at 348m shares, remained very heavy. The market began the day on a defensive note after Friday's 96-point rout. Overseas activity brought a measure of encouragement, suggesting that the equity downturn, triggered by the first tightening of US monetary policy in five years, was not picking up momentum. The direction of the US Treasury market was unfavourable, however. Prices across the maturity range declined as traders prepared for an influx of new supply later this week and the possibility of more bad inflation news on Friday, when the Commerce Department unveils the producer price index for January. Amid these crosscurrents, early activity was choppy, with the Dow bellwether index swinging from as many as 10 points down to 12 points ahead. Near midday, however, relief over the Dow's resilience began to dominate sentiment. Bargain hunters were soon piling into some pivotal stocks, including IBM, which gained Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 54 1/4 , and Walt Disney, Dollars 1 5/8 better at Dollars 46 5/8 . Many of the cyclical issues contributing to the market's recent rally regained their stride. Alcoa added Dollars 2 at Dollars 78 1/8 , General Electric Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 108 and Union Carbide Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 25 5/8 . Automobile issues showed improvement, General Motors advancing Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 63 and Ford Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 68 5/8 . Financial and banking stocks, which were among the hardest hit by the Federal Reserve's move, opened weaker but firmed as the session progressed. JP Morgan ended Dollars  7/8 up at Dollars 69 3/8 and Bankers Trust Dollars  1/2 ahead at Dollars 82 1/2 . On the Nasdaq, the afternoon rally was led by Apple Computer, up Dollars 3 1/8 at Dollars 36 1/4 . Canada Afternoon selling whittled away a substantial morning gain in Toronto, leaving the TSE 300 index a net 1.5 up at 4,448.7. It was more than 20 points ahead in the early afternoon, but retreated as gold shares lost 3.7 per cent on a fall in the bullion price of USDollars 6.30 an ounce. Declines led rises by 484 to 332 after volume of 75.6m shares. Canadian Pacific rose CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 23 5/8 on fourth-quarter results.</p>

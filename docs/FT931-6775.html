			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Write-downs expected to hit Ladbroke Ladbroke Group's 1992 pre-tax profits, due out on Thursday, are expected to show a substantial fall following the first above-the-line write-down of its Pounds 1bn property portfolio. The write-down is estimated at 15 per cent, or roughly Pounds 150m. Previous provisions have eroded balance sheet reserves, causing the latest cuts in valuations to be taken as a charge against profits. Before property provisions, profit is forecast to fall from Pounds 210m to less than Pounds 190m. The provisions do not represent an outflow of cash. When Mr Cyril Stein, chairman, was asked about the prospect of a property write-down last September, he commented that if one were made, it would only be 'a book entry'. It would not affect the final dividend, which the board was planning to hold at 6.23p, making a total of 11.15p. The figures are expected to include gains of about Pounds 40m from hotel sales - a profit source vulnerable to the new FRS 3 accounting rule. While Ladbroke's Hilton International hotel chain continued to experience difficult markets last year, analysts are hoping to hear that the pound's devaluation has brought signs of life to London hotels. On the other hand, Texas Homecare, the DIY chain which was the star performer in 1991, is thought to have suffered a downturn since black Wednesday.</p>

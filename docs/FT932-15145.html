			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Call to cut prices of CDs THE CONSUMERS' Association last night call for restrictions on imports of cheaper compact discs from the US to be lifted and the savings passed on CD buyers. The association is to give evidence today to the first hearing in the Commons national heritage committee's investigation of CD prices. Last night it produced a list of discs with UK prices higher than those in the US. The MPs will also be hearing evidence from rock groups which are demanding lower prices for their own CDs. WH Smith, Britain's biggest record retailer, will present evidence on April 22. Mr Derek Prentice, Consumers' Association assistant director said: 'CDs are a rip-off. CD buyers in the UK are a small-scale, high-profit, largely captive market. Exchange rates and other factors cannot explain the persistent gap between the cost of CDs in the UK and US.' The association called on the Office of Fair Trading to investigate the 'possibly anti-competitive effects' of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, which it said was used to block imports. The British Phonographic Industry said that although it might cost just Pounds 1 to manufacture the disc, other expenses such as copyright fees, recording sessions and cover designs added to the cost.</p>

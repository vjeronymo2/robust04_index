			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> RECYCLING NETS CARSON TRASH PACT FOR 1 FIRM  </P> <P> With one South Bay city after another grappling with the costs of  state-mandated recycling, Carson has come up with a new wrinkle to pay for a  citywide program that goes into effect July 1.  </P> <P> In return for providing free curbside recycling service, Western Waste of  Gardena has been granted an expansion of its residential trash franchise with  the city to cover all commercial and industrial waste as well. The move freezes  out other waste hauling companies, which currently pick up nonresidential trash  in the city.  </P> <P> City officials estimate that the commercial and industrial contract, which has  renewable options for Western Waste, will produce gross annual revenues of $5  million for the company.  </P> <P> The push for recycling stems from a state law that mandates a 25% reduction in  trash delivered to landfills by 1995 and a 50% reduction by 2000. Most South  Bay cities either have a recycling program in place or are making plans to  begin one soon.  </P> <P> Officials in three South Bay cities that have recycling programs said in  interviews that they do not have a similar arrangement linking their recycling  program to a franchise expansion.  </P> <P> At Tuesday's City Council meeting, Ron Pfeifer, district manager of BFI Waste  Systems, complained that the council had not sought bids before it awarded  Western Waste the exclusive commercial and industrial franchise on June 5.  </P> <P> Acknowledging that there is no legal bar to awarding an exclusive franchise  without competitive bidding, Pfeifer said it is unfair and that BFI stands to  lose about $1 million in commercial and industrial trash collection fees in  Carson.  </P> <P> "We take a marketplace that generates $5 million in revenue annually and give  it to (Western Waste) without a bid, and not only give it to them, but give it  to them as an evergreen contract," with renewal rights, he said.  </P> <P> "I'm from Chicago. I haven't seen this sort of stuff since Mayor (Richard J.)  Daley died."  </P> <P> But his complaint was to no avail.  </P> <P> Mayor Pro Tem Kay Calas said that BFI had the city's residential trash contract  for a number of years and that Pfeifer was complaining now only because he was  not the chosen one.  </P> <P> Councilman Michael Mitoma added that BFI is in a poor position to object,  because it has had a trash contract in Hermosa Beach for 22 years without  bidding.  </P> <P> Richard Heredia, president of the Carson/Dominguez Business Council, a group of  two dozen Carson businesses that monitors council actions, said at the meeting  that the council should have notified businesses that trash collection was  coming up before the franchise expansion was approved.  </P> <P> "The business council is concerned that the City Council's action takes away  the right to choose a vendor." Heredia said. "There was no notice given to the  business community."  </P> <P> Heredia added that businesses are fearful that their rates will be raised, in  part to cover costs of the recycling program.  </P> <P> But Mitoma said state law provides a five-year grace period that protects  existing trash-hauling fees and arrangements, if a city awards an exclusive  garbage contract. "It's a win-win situation," he said.  </P> <P> That provision means that, although the exclusive franchise will officially go  into effect on July 1, it could be up to five years before Western Waste takes  over all existing contracts.  </P> <P> In choosing to expand Western Waste's franchise, the council rejected an  alternative to charge residential customers $1.25 a month for the recycling  program.  </P> <P> Carson officials reported contacting 14 Southern California cities about  recycling programs.  </P> <P> Officials in Redondo Beach, Manhattan Beach and Rancho Palos Verdes said in  interviews that they were unaware of an arrangement quite like Carson's.  </P> <P> Ken Montgomery, Redondo Beach director of public works, said his city will  probably select a small number of firms eligible to collect commercial and  industrial trash. Those companies would then compete for customers. Montgomery  said he expects that some trash collection firms will offer free recycling in  bidding to get on the city's approved list.  </P> <P> "They might throw that in to get the business," he said.  </P> <P> Redondo Beach, which began its program last July, charges residential customers  $1 a month per housing unit for recycling.  </P> <P> In Manhattan Beach, the City Council put the trash contract out to bid and  selected Western Waste to handle all residential and commercial waste,  according to Carson officials. The charge for recycling is 70 cents a month per  unit, but 50 cents is returned to customers as long as more than 50% of the  city's households participate in the program, according to a Manhattan Beach  official.  </P> <P> Since the program started Dec. 4, participation has been above 50%, the  official said.  </P> <P> In Rancho Palos Verdes, which started its recycling program in 1988, the fee is  $1.38 a month, an official said. Torrance charges $2.18 a month in a pilot  program, according to the Carson study.  </P> <P> In Burbank, residents are not charged for the recycling program, and the city,  which bought and maintains trucks and containers, receives funds from the trash  collector, the Carson report said.  </P> <P> In Walnut, the recycling charge is $1.20 a month, according to the report.  </P> <P> No recycling programs were reported in Inglewood, Gardena, Cypress, Huntington  Beach, Cerritos, Long Beach, Buena Park and Lakewood.  </P></p>

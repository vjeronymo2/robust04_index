			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Disappointment at Depfa-Bank over rating level Depfa-Bank, Germany's largest mortgage bank, yesterday expressed disappointment at the decision by Moody's to assign a long-term debt rating of Aa3 to its Eurobonds. The unsolicited rating is at least two notches below the market's perception of the bank, whose full name is Deutsche Pfandbrief- und Hypothekenbank. In the past year Depfa has raised more than Dollars 3bn in a variety of currencies in the Eurobond market at spreads commensurate with strong double-A rated institutions. 'We are disappointed by the rating,' said Mr Gerhard Bruckermann, the member of Depfa's management board responsible for treasury fund management and for public sector loans. He added that he had been surprised that the Moody's analysts had not asked any material questions during discussions with Depfa's management board. The meetings took place in late January as a result of a letter which Moody's sent Depfa in December saying that it was about to assign a rating on the basis of publicly available information. Moody's said its rating reflected the changing risk profile of Depfa, its wholesale franchise and dependence on wholesale funding, as well as the structural subordination of the senior unsecured debt in relation to its secured German mortgage bonds (Pfandbriefe). Analysts said Moody's appeared to be penalising Depfa for both its current low profitability and for the diversification strategy it was pursuing to enhance the bank's earnings. 'I think Moody's has taken a step too far,' said one analyst.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (10): The periphery draws nearer to the centre - Charles Batchelor looks at Europe's changing map The opening of the Channel Tunnel and a fixed rail link between Britain and the Continent will provide a welcome boost for the European Union's transport policy. Previously fragmented programmes were brought together in a white paper published in 1992 which set out proposals to promote the use of rail and sea and canal shipping transport and to rein in the rapid growth of road and air journeys. In physical terms the Channel tunnel represents a further link in the transport chain which seeks to connect peripheral regions with the centre and reduce geographical barriers to travel. Elsewhere in Europe road and rail links are being established between Denmark and Sweden, additional rail tunnels are planned to link northern and southern Europe through the Swiss Alps and Spain and France through the Pyrenees. After many years during which planning for road, rail, air and sea transport took place in isolation, the European Commission produced its outline of a common transport policy in December 1992. The creation of the single European market on January 1, 1993 had given additional impetus to the project. One of the main problems it sought to overcome was the imbalance between the different means of transport. The rapid growth of road transport, in particular, had led to a decline in the use of other networks, notably rail, increasing congestion and damage to the environment. Passenger travel within the EU has risen by 85 per cent over the past 20 years, mostly in the form of private car journeys, which account for 79 per cent of all travel. Freight shipments have increased by half but road transport now accounts for 70 per cent of goods transported while rail and inland waterway transport have declined in relative terms. One way of encouraging the use of rail, particularly for freight purposes, is to encourage the development of integrated transport systems so that goods can be moved by road for part of the journey and then transferred to rail, ship or barge for the long-haul section of the route. This requires investment in special rail wagons to carry trucks and trailers and in terminals for handling the transhipment of containers and the like. Speeding up journeys can also make rail attractive to both passengers and freight. High-speed trains running on dedicated or upgraded tracks are reducing inter-city times for business and leisure travellers while improved track and handling facilities can speed up freight shipments. At the same time the commission is keen for travellers to bear the full cost of their journey through the use of road tolls and the harmonisation of duties on the different types of fuel. Car travellers are rarely made aware of the cost of their journey at the point of use while rail travellers are very aware of the price of their ticket. The International Union of Railways (UIC), which groups railway organisations from around the world, believes that the active promotion of rail transport and substantial investments to modernise the network would result in a healthier transport balance. It believes the growth in rail travel in western Europe could increase to 3 per cent a year compared with a l per cent rise in road transport and a 4 per cent rise in air traffic. If nothing is done rail travel growth would remain stuck at l per cent a year while road transport would grow by just over 2 per cent and air by 6 per cent, a recent report by the UIC's strategic planning committee calculated. Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU, has increased the pressure for a shift towards rail freight. A referendum last March produced a vote in favour of a complete ban on transit lorry traffic through the Alps to take effect in 2004. This added urgency to plans already under consideration to build two new high-speed north-south rail lines through the Alps connecting Basle with Milan. Two new tunnels would be drilled at a low altitude so that trains would not have a steep gradient to climb and could maintain speeds of up to 125 miles an hour. One line would go under the Gotthard pass, the most highly travelled transit route today, while the other would go through the Lotschberg south of Bern and continue on the existing rail tunnel under the Simplon pass. Work is expected to start in 1996 for completion in 2007. The Swiss believe that existing tunnels will be able to cope with traffic displaced by the lorry ban from 2004. Despite attempts by the EU and neighbouring countries to shift traffic off the roads the transport white paper recognises the important role of an efficient road network. As part of its transport planning the EU has drawn up a blueprint for a Trans European Road Network (TERN) to be completed by 2002. This is a network of high-speed roads, motorways or four-lane dual carriageways, linking the main ports and cities of Europe and tying peripheral regions more closely into the centre. Cities of 500,000 inhabitants and more would have external ring roads. The announcement of this programme has caused concern in parts of the UK where local communities fear that all roads on the TERN system will be upgraded to motorways, though this has been denied by the UK department of transport. The EU plans to devote additional resources to creating this network but it will be expected to fit into national road building programmes. An important gap in European road and rail networks which will shortly be closed is the sea barrier between the islands of Denmark and between Denmark and Sweden. A combined tunnel-bridge taking both rail and road traffic between the Danish islands of Funen and Zealand is due to be completed within the next year or so while plans are also far advanced for a 10 mile-long crossing of the Oresund between Copenhagen and Malmo. The crossing, also a combined bridge/tunnel, could be completed by about 2000. The highly visible physical links between the different parts of Europe such as the Channel Tunnel and the Oresund crossing are finally being completed. But it will take far longer and cost even more to create a healthy balance between the established transport networks in Europe.</p>

			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Future based on a Maxmin maxim - Plans to revive Laura Ashley's flagging fortunes WHATEVER ANYONE else might think, Jim Maxmin is quite clear that the Laura Ashley group is not a retailer. In spite of running 547 shops in 26 countries, the chief executive of the fabrics and furnishings group believes that Laura Ashley is a brand, not a retail concept. Its salvation lies in marketing the unique allure of Laura Ashley, whether by posting the name above its retail outlets or licensing it on an ever-expanding range of products - stretching from bed linen to perfumes. By doing so, Mr Maxmin believes Laura Ashley can revive its fortunes by carving out a lucrative and defensible market niche. Rivals may be able to match the company's products and run their operations more efficiently. But the Laura Ashley lifestyle concept gives the company a distinctive and intangible edge. 'If it costs money you can replicate it,' runs one of Maxmin's maxims. Similar tricks have already been learned and patchily applied by other international 'retailers' such as Benetton, which has built up a vast network of licensed stores throughout the world by concentrating on promoting brand image and product. It makes its money by taking a margin on supplying its products to its licensees. But Mr Maxmin's sweeping strategic visions contrast sharply with the nuts-and-bolts phrases about gearing and cost cutting that pour from the mouths of the accountants who now run the UK's other struggling retail chains. The differences are most visible in the companies' annual reports. While Next may have produced a basic stark black-and-white effort completely devoid of colour, Laura Ashley's latest offering was wrapped in a lyrical photograph of rolling English hills. 'Our mission is to establish an enduring relationship with those who share a love of the special lifestyle that is Laura Ashley. We will act so as to protect the integrity of that relationship and to ensure its long term prosperity,' it ran. Such lofty concepts are hardly likely to appeal to hard-bitten institutional fund managers, who have seen the company collapse from peak profits of Pounds 23.1m in 1988 to post-exceptional losses of Pounds 9.1m last year on sales of Pounds 260.7m. But many analysts, at least, have been won round to Maxmin's unconventional way of thinking in the year that he has been in the job and believe that - in the long term - Laura Ashley is indeed capable of generating very attractive returns. 'I think they can improve their performance very considerably even without a bounce in the economy,' says Paul Deacon, retail analyst at Goldman Sachs, the US stockbrokers. 'The business has been run so badly that there are an awful lot of internal changes they can make to lift the gross margin. Run properly, it should be a very high value-added business. You do not have to look out too far to see them achieving sales of Pounds 500m with profits around Pounds 50m - although that may be stretching the imagination a little at the moment.' There are two distinct means by which Laura Ashley can achieve this turnaround. The first is to do better what it already does. The second is to expand where it does it. Since joining Laura Ashley a year ago, Mr Maxmin has made much progress in implementing his SFA programme aimed at Simplifying the company's structure, Focusing on its strengths and Acting to improve its profitability. Mr Maxmin argues that the company does not have the skills or the necessary financial strength to be at the leading edge of manufacturing, distribution technology or information systems and should therefore simplify its business by sub-contracting these functions to outside experts. In March, Laura Ashley agreed an innovative 10-year Pounds 150m deal with Federal Express effectively handing over responsibility for its distribution arrangements to the US logistics group. The degree of mutual trust is startlingly high: a Federal Express director now regularly attends Laura Ashley board meetings. The Federal Express deal will lead to substantial cost savings. 'Ultimately Fedex will be able to direct products straight from our supplier in Hong Kong to our shops in Frankfurt or Vienna rather than going through the UK,' Mr Maxmin says. Laura Ashley clearly has much to aim for in improving its core UK operations, which account for 38 per cent of sales, but it also has much to gain from expanding abroad. 'Our major strategic priority will be to diversify away from the UK and build up our profits base overseas. We want a minimum of 120 shops in Europe within a four to five year time horizon. We have 60 shops at the moment,' Mr Maxmin says. Mr Alphons Schouten, who runs the company's mainland European businesses, says that to be successful abroad most retailers have found it necessary to position themselves further upmarket than in their own backyard. The company's pricing policy, which varies by as much as 20 per cent across its European markets, reflects the need to position itself differently in each market. 'We do not want our retail price to reflect our cost price. It should never be a mathematical exercise. You have to come at it from a consumer's perspective. We cannot be out of sync with our competitors,' he says. Operating in Europe also requires great operational flexibility. The range of the products varies depending on the characteristics of each national marketplace. 'Our two big markets are Germany and France. Germany has primarily been garments and France has been home furnishings,' he says. In northern Europe most people have their bedrooms painted blue. In the south it is pink. 'A German sleeps on a pillow 80cm by 80cm. A Dutchman sleeps on a pillow 60cm by 40cm. A Belgian will have 60cm square. What pillow cases should we stock in Maastricht?' asks Mr Schouten. It takes much time - and considerable management skill - to adapt to different markets and Laura Ashley is now placing the emphasis on gradual learning rather than rapid growth. But Mr Maxmin argues that it is better to build up a stronger, more profitable business over the long term than attempt to move too quickly and destroy the brand. 'To be whimsical for a moment, we are dealing with part of England's national heritage and I am not into raping or pillaging,' he says.</p>

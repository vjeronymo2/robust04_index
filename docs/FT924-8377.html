			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Body scanners keep Oxford in health STRONG DEMAND for body scanners helped Oxford Instruments, which makes the equipment in a joint venture with Siemens of Germany, report a marginal increase to Pounds 4.26m in interim pre-tax profits. However, core businesses suffered a sharp drop, with the operating profit tumbling by Pounds 1m to Pounds 797,000. Turnover fell from Pounds 49.7m to Pounds 45.1m. Mr Peter Williams, chairman and chief executive, said he was pleased with the results achieved in 'these difficult times and difficult circumstances'. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.4p, payable from earnings 0.2p up at 5.9p. The group expected the difficult trading conditions to continue into the second half, Mr Williams said, with only 'insipid signs of recovery in the US'. About 33 per cent of group sales are in the US. Oxford Magnet Technology, which was incurring losses in 1989 before the creation of a joint venture with Siemens, contributed Pounds 2.9m, against Pounds 2.3m last time. Mr Williams could not explain the continued buoyancy of the scanner market. 'There has been no sign of the recession there,' he said. He added, however, that perhaps a note of caution on the outlook for scanners was to be recommended, 'but we also said that a year ago'. Profits were also boosted by a Pounds 370,000 gain on interest receivable to Pounds 500,000. Oxford finished the first half with net cash of Pounds 3.3m. Two of Oxford's three loss-making businesses were returned to profit in the period. The remaining loss-maker, Plasma Technology, had cut its deficit substantially. The group had no orders for its much-touted synchrotron - a device that enables semiconductor manufacturers to pack more circuits onto microchips than with conventional systems. The prototype, being used for research by IBM, had been successful and Oxford was building a second on spec. So far it had cost about Pounds 4.5m. COMMENT The main message from Oxford appears to be steady as she goes. The slight bias towards the second half and exposure to the dollar market also offer some encouragement that forecasts of between Pounds 8m and Pounds 9m for the full year could be achievable. The worries might centre on the decline in the core businesses and just when the axe will fall on the body scanner market. Efforts to shore up the core business slide have produced patchy results, and it is unlikely anything more significant will be achieved without general economic recovery. Nevertheless, the shares - on a prospective p/e of about 16.6 - are looking more reasonable than they were in the heady days of the 1980s. Current investors might see some outperformance in the near future, but there might not be enough there yet to tempt buyers.</p>

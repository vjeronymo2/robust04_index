			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 6 Apr (TANJUG) -- The commander of the  main headquarters of the Srpska republic army, general Ratko  Mladic, said today that "the Muslims' mad venture in the Gorazde  area has failed".    "I hope that they have learned a lesson," Mladic said.  Explaining the talks today with General Michael Rose, the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commander for former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mladic stressed in a statement for TANJUG  that an agreement had been reached to send some military  observers to Gorazde.    We suggested to Rose that he organize a meeting of the  warring sides because we have nothing to discuss with them,  either about Gorazde or about anything else. We are not at war  with UNPROFOR, but we are open to discussion on all issues,  including the discussion of Gorazde with the Muslim side, with  UNPROFOR's mediation, general Mladic said.</p>

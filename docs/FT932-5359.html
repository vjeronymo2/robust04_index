			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Direct investment abroad falls 18% JAPANESE foreign direct investment fell by 18 per cent in 1992 as the downturn in the Japanese economy and the slump on the Tokyo stock market continued to take its toll on manufacturing companies' ability to finance international ambitions. Foreign direct investment fell from Dollars 41.6bn (Pounds 26.8bn) in 1991 to Dollars 34.138bn in 1992, according to figures published by the finance ministry. In 1990 foreign direct investment from Japan was worth Dollars 56.9bn. However, the continued steep fall in overseas investment masked important shifts in the destination of Japanese capital outflows. While investment in the US and Europe fell, investment in Asia rose from Dollars 5.9bn to Dollars 6.4bn. Investment in Asia accounted for 18.8 per cent of all Japanese foreign direct investment, up from 12.4 per cent in 1990. Over the same period the share of Japanese investment in the the US declined from 45.9 per cent to 40.5 per cent of the total, while Europe's share fell from 25.1 per cent to 20.7 per cent. Investment in the US dropped from Dollars 18bn in 1991 to Dollars 13.8bn last year. Investment in Europe dropped from Dollars 9.4bn to Dollars 7bn but the UK maintained its share of Japanese investment. Japanese companies made 197 direct investments in the UK last year worth Dollars 2.9bn, compared with 22 investments worth Dollars 3.4bn in 1991. Investment in the Netherlands fell from Dollars 1.9bn to Dollars 1.4bn, while spending in Germany dropped from Dollars 1.1bn to Dollars 769m and in France it fell from Dollars 817m to Dollars 456m. Investment in Asia surged with the scale of investment rising markedly. In 1991 Japanese companies made investments in Asia worth Dollars 5.94bn. Last year they made investments worth Dollars 6.42bn. The main beneficiary was China. Investments there rose from Dollars 579m in 1991 to Dollars 1.07bn last year. China accounted for 3.1 per cent of Japanese foreign direct investment, up from 0.6 per cent in 1990. While Asia is gaining at the expense of the US and Europe, China is the overall winner regarding investment within the Asia region. Japanese direct investment fell in Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and the Phillipines. Investment by Japanese manufacturing companies fell from Dollars 12.3bn to Dollars 10bn. Chemical industry investment rose from Dollars 1.6bn in 1991 to just over Dollars 2bn, but electronics industry investment overseas fell from Dollars 2.2bn to Dollars 1.8bn and the automotive industry dropped from Dollars 1.9bn to Dollars 1.18bn.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Leading insurer to close NZI Bank GENERAL Accident, one of the UK's leading insurers, is to wind down its New Zealand bank subsidiary, NZI Bank, ending its unprofitable foray into Australasian banking. Mr Barry Holder, general manager of GA, said of the decision: 'This is a positive but a possibly unpalatable move.' GA acquired the bank when it bought a majority stake in NZI Corporation in June 1988. It will retain control of NZI's insurance subsidiary, which is one of New Zealand's biggest insurers, as a base for developing its activities in the Pacific Basin. GA's overall losses as a result of the deal are expected to amount to at least Pounds 200m. Mr Holder said that GA had been seeking a buyer for NZI Bank soon after acquiring majority control of the company. GA was taken aback by the deterioration of the bank's loan book, sustaining operating losses of more than Pounds 70m between 1988 and 1990. Mr Holder accepted yesterday that the acquisition of the bank had been 'a mistake'. GA had now restored the bank to profitability - pre-tax profits of NZDollars 7.8m (Pounds 2.6m) were recorded in 1990. However, it had been unable to find a buyer and was now seeking to unload the bank's Australasian loan portfolio, cash management accounts in New Zealand and a merchant bank in Singapore. Mr Holder said that the bank was now fully provided for against any future losses that might arise on its remaining business. 'I do not expect any further surprises,' he said. NZI Bank chairman, Mr Jim Macaulay, said he expected most of the 27,000 depositors would accept repayment within six months. But, if the loans could not be sold, it would take up to five years to wind down the bank totally. The bank handed out redundancy notices to 90 of its 360 staff yesterday and will be terminating the contracts of a further 30 employees before the end of the week. Mr Macaulay said the closure should be seen as the first move in a shake-out of the overcrowded New Zealand banking sector, which was deregulated in 1987. The number of registered banks had risen in that time from four to 21. Editorial Comment, Page 18; Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (12): Emphasis on productivity - Industrial development OF Asia's four dragons, Hong Kong is the only state whose government has not tried to transform an efficient low-cost manufacturing base into a high technology production line which can compete head-on with Japan and the US, writes Simon Davies. Fourteen year's after the door to China was opened, much of Hong Kong's industrial heritage has been transferred into offices and shopping centres, rather than gleaming new factories. The laissez faire prop against which the Hong Kong government has leaned since 1841, has prevented it from adopting the ambitious strategies that spawned the computer components and telecommunications products of Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. But as Hong Kong continues to evolve into a financial and services centre, the pressures of some of the highest land and labour costs in Asia appear to have give the government second thoughts about its stance. Mr Ricky Fung, acting director general of the government's Industry Department, stands by the philosophy of 'minimum intervention, maximum support.' In spite of this, the government is taking serious measures to encourage the inflow of overseas technologies, so that Hong Kong can retain some kind of industrial base. BY the end of December 1992, 565,100 people were employed in industry, compared with 870,000 in 1986. Mr Fung said the government does not believe in saving industries that are not competitive; in a territory which has to import labour to meet the demands of a voracious economy, there is no political pressures to save jobs. Instead, the emphasis is on productivity rather than head count, and Hong Kong has been faring well in this respect. Productivity increased by 18 per cent last year, and it is now 80 per cent higher in real terms than it was a in 1983. This reflects the fact that the majority of industries have been relocating production facilities, and those that cannot, have been replacing workers with machinery. The resultant boost in productivity helped achieve a minimal increase in domestic exports during 1992 to Dollars HK234bn. This trend is continuing. Nomura Research Institute estimates that Hong Kong retained imports of capital goods amounted Dollars HK73bn Kong last year, indicating the level of new spending on machinery. This represented an increase of more than 20 per cent from 1991 - outpacing growth in retained imports of raw materials and consumer goods - and it suggests that the outlook for productivity remains positive, in the short-term at least. In order to encourage this trend, the government has toned down its laissez faire inclinations to permit a new applied research and development scheme. This is a Dollars HK200m fund, which will match the investment of any start-up company which fulfills certain criteria, in exchange for an equity stake. This represents the first step towards direct government funding for research and development, and by implication, the creation of a Government industrial policy. But it is a very tentative step, and local industrialists believe that in the longer-term Hong Kong will not be able to compete in anything other than niche manufacturing. Mr Patrick Wang, managing director of Johnson Electric  -one of the world's largest manufacturers of micro-motors - says that as a manufacturing base Hong Kong can be more meaningfully compared to Switzerland than to other south-east Asian countries. Johnson is one of the few Hong Kong industrial companies which has succeeded in competing with the Japanese in high-technology production. It produces motors for consumer electronics products and car accessories from plants in China, Thailand and Switzerland. The company still employs 1,000 people in Hong Kong, and this represents a crucial base for leveraging the cheap production facilities in China, where it employs 7,000 workers. But Mr Wang argues that 'to survive, we have to think and act more like the Swiss.' Johnson's plant in Switzerland has operating costs around double those of Hong Kong, but the differential is shrinking fast. The key, according to Mr Wang, is that Hong Kong has to focus on technical proficiency, rigid cost control and more creative use of technology. The government is making some effort to help this. It has provided a Dollars HK250m grant for an Industry and Technology Centre, a new University of Science and Technology was recently completed, and plans have been initiated for a Dollars HK2.8bn science park (government contributions would be much lower). In addition, its industrial estates in Tai Po and Yuen Long provide land for high-tech industries at significantly below market rates. But for many of Hong Kong's manufacturers becoming 'Swiss' is not an option. Mr Jack Lau, managing director of Tomei International, one of Hong Kong's largest consumer electronics manufacturers, argues that 'for the traditional low-end manufacturers, there is no choice. Relocating to China is a matter of survival'. As industrialists gain further experience of China production, they are finding that the workforce has more to offer than just cheap export processing. Hong Kong companies are recruiting Chinese science graduates for research and development projects, further replacing the role of Hong Kong's domestic industry. However, there have been a few successes in importing industry. The German media giant, Bertelsmann, recently purchased a 55 per cent stake in Sonopress Asia, a compact disc manufacturing company. Mr Henry Chow, managing director of Sonopress, says the venture has been a success, but its full potential is in the eventual opening up of the China market. The company has capacity to manufacture 17m compact discs a year, and already controls around 40 per cent of the Hong Kong market, but at present China is effectively off-limits. Mr Clive Weedon, head of research at Nomura, suggests that domestic manufacturing is going into inevitable decline - 'as 1997 approaches, it is difficult to envisage Hong Kong providing any more than support services for the Pearl River delta, along with some specialised niche production.'</p>

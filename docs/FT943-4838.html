			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Private finance projects 'need bigger return' Rates of return on privately financed infrastructure projects will need to be 10 per cent to 15 per cent if schemes are to proceed, the government was warned yesterday by one of Britain's biggest construction companies. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, said the expectations of potential investors of a reasonable rate of return remained higher than those of ministers. The government, which is under severe pressure to reduce public borrowing, last year sponsored a Private Finance Working Group led by Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, in an attempt to resolve some of the difficulties preventing privately financed schemes from going ahead. Mr Dwyer said yesterday: 'The gap between us has narrowed but it needs to be closed further if investors are to be persuaded to support these projects.' Contractors such as Wimpey have taken the lead in bidding individually and forming consortia to tender for privately financed roads, railways, hospitals, prisons and student accommodation. Mr Dwyer said: 'In spite of a lot of debate, very few schemes have started. We need some positive examples if investors are to be persuaded that the rewards will be worth the risk.' Investors would expect higher internal rates of return than the 3 per cent or 4 per cent expected by utilities. 'There is a lot of risk involved if contractors and investors are to be expected to take on the liability for the cost of a prison riot when they might have no control on what prisoners they took,' said Mr Dwyer. He expected many of the first privately financed schemes to be smaller projects such as prisons and hospitals rather than large road and rail schemes. Large transport schemes often involved complex planning and political issues which made them difficult to cost and involved a higher risk for investors. Wimpey is among a number of UK and continental European companies bidding for four privately financed road schemes costing a total of Pounds 380m. They were announced last month by Mr John Watts, roads minister. Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman of Amec, which is also among the bidders for the four road schemes, said: 'We are getting closer but more progress needs to be made. Potential investors need to see that there are some winners out there or they won't bother.' Lex, Page 22 Wimpey results, Page 25</p>

			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (22): Landmark for privatisation - Case study / Esaote 'This buy-out is based on expansion,' affirms Andrea Oberti, general manager of Esaote, the Genoa-based medical equipment maker. 'Many buy-outs aim to produce results through restructuring and cuts. Esaote intends to continue growing and this is underlined by the commitment to maintaining annual research and development spending at more than 8 per cent of turnover,' he adds. Mr Oberti was one of four senior managers who helped set up Esaote in 1981 and who led the MBO operation that was finalised in July. It is probably Italy's most significant transaction this year. With a L55bn (Dollars 36m) price tag, it is substantial by Italian standards. But it is also a landmark for privatisation in Italy, the seller being the Finmeccanica sub-holding of the IRI state holding corporation. Established as the Biomedical Division of the IRI-Finmeccanica Ansaldo company, after sophisticated medical equipment had been identified as a strategic growth sector, it made profits within three years. The Montedison-Farmitalia subsidiary, Ote Biomedica, was acquired at the end of 1986 and Esaote formally established as a joint stock corporation in 1988. 'Our mission is to provide niche markets with leading-edge technology in equipment offering high performance to price ratios,' says Mr Oberti. Esaote is European leader in the production of ultrasound diagnostic equipment. 'We have recently launched a magnetic resonance imaging system dedicated to extremities of the body. This will allow the costs of scans to be reduced by two thirds, an important selling point given the squeeze on health service spending,' he says. Revenues of L20bn from the magnetic resonance imaging system will help Esaote reach an estimated L207bn sales this year, from L177bn in 1993. Net pretax profits are expected to be L9bn, a healthy increase on L4bn in 1993 though still falling short of the L12bn and L14bn posted in 1992 and 1991 on sales of L179bn and L161bn respectively. Esaote has been a steady profit-earner. Why was it privatised? Carlo Castellano, chairman and managing director, says: 'The medical equipment sector was defined as unstrategic when the Amato government unveiled its privatisation programme in July 1992.' IRI-Finmeccanica appointed Wasserstein Perella as advisers in autumn 1992 and a trade sale was sought. But the trawl for potential buyers was unsuccessful. 'None of the offers examined in February 1993 was satisfactory. Some fell short on price, while others failed on operational and industrial factors. So the privatisation was suspended. This was very worrying. The suspension created uncertainty and was damaging for the company's image,' says Mr Castellano. The MBO began a year ago when Mr Castellano and three colleagues teamed up with Sofipa, Mediocredito Centrale's merchant bank, which headed a group of investors. A letter of intent was signed in January and the contract, which became effective in July, followed in May. 'There were many difficulties. Italy seems impermeable to innovative financial operations like MBOs. Corporate and fiscal aspects are complex,' explains Mr Castellano. With the transaction concluded, he and his three senior colleagues, and Esaote's 20 other managers, hold a 10 per cent stake in the company's L30bn equity. Sofipa has 21 per cent, Advent International 32 per cent, IPEF 17 per cent, Arca Merchant 16 per cent and Euroventures Italy 4 per cent. Senior debt amounts to L25bn. The next step will be a L1bn bond issue with warrants, planned for the year-end. This will be open to all the company's employees, 520 in Italy and a further 110 in other countries, thereby allowing full participation in the privatisation operation. And for Esaote's financial investors the exit route already seems clearly signposted. 'Stock market quotation is the aim,' says Mr Castellano.</p>

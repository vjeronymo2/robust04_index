			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Treasury projections play second fiddle to party politics: How Norman Lamont asked economists to 'massage' PSBR figures IN THE week before this year's Budget statement on March 10, the lights in the Treasury's imposing building in Whitehall were burning especially late. Several Treasury economists were kept at their desks until midnight in an effort to comply with a particularly direct request from Mr Norman Lamont about the projections for the public-sector borrowing requirement that the Treasury was to publish with the Budget. In an internal note, the chancellor had told the economists to 'massage' the figures to show a zero PSBR by 1996-97, to put the markets in better heart ahead of the general election planned for April 9. The note is now buried away in Treasury files, but its existence has been verified by someone close to the Treasury forecasting process. Contacted about the note, the Treasury said it could neither confirm nor deny whether it had been sent, as what went on in the forecasting process was an internal matter not for discussion with outsiders. Details of how the note came to be drafted and the work that it sparked off provide some indication of the largely hidden pressures that can be brought to bear on Treasury economists to make their judgments fit the political requirements of the ministers they serve. News of the manoeuvrings come at a delicate time for the Treasury. During this long recession, it has been attacked by some politicians and industrialists for making over-optimistic forecasts. The Treasury is now examining whether more contacts with outside economists and business people could lead to more accurate economic assessments. Also, some MPs and former Treasury officials have raised questions about the whole process of Treasury forecasts. They want the procedure to be made more transparent, to clarify to what degree the Treasury's projections are influenced by pure economic reasoning, as opposed to judgments by politicians. In the past year, there has been increasing interest in 'de-politicising' Treasury forecasts, handing the job of making them to an independent external body. About 40 economists at the Treasury are involved in its economic projections, which cover areas such as growth in gross domestic product, inflation and the balance of payments. They are answerable to Mr Alan Budd, chief economic adviser, and are split into two teams. The first is headed by Mr Colin Mowl and is responsible for short-term forecasts, up to 1 1/2 years ahead. The second group, headed by Mr Chris Riley, is concerned with longer-term assessments of up to five years ahead. The numbers produced by this second group are always called in Treasury parlance 'projections' rather than 'forecasts' - but they have to be consistent with the shorter-term predictions of Mr Mowl's team. In making forecasts, which it publishes twice a year, the Treasury has to strike a difficult balance between giving an honest view of the future and being reasonably optimistic in a way that will help the government's political fortunes. It is generally accepted that the forecasts will have a political spin. The Treasury insists that ministers reserve the final judgment on what to publish in the forecasts, after taking advice from officials. The March forecast came at a crucial time, just before the general election, when the government's fortunes were directly tied to thoughts about whether and at what pace economic recovery would take place. Few members of the electorate read Treasury forecasts - but their indirect impact is large. Treasury projections set the broad tone for much City thinking about economic trends - which is then translated into a view about the economy that has an impact on the population as a whole. Thus Mr Lamont knew that the Budget forecast could be an important factor in determining the government's chances of pulling off an electoral victory. The chancellor had already let it be known within the Treasury that he would be ill-disposed to see too low a number put on likely economic growth for 1992 and 1993. That led the Treasury economists to publish in March a projection for GDP growth in 1992 of 1 per cent. Although not wildly at variance with City forecasts at the time, this was described by one Whitehall insider as 'the high-growth scenario with knobs on'. The Treasury also opted in the Budget for a projection of about 3.1 per cent for growth in 1993, well above the City consensus at the time. Today - after seven months in which forecasts both in and out of the Treasury have become more gloomy - the general expectation in the City is that the economy will contract by about 0.8 per cent this year with growth of 1.3 per cent pencilled in for next year. However, after taking care of the Budget growth forecasts, Mr Lamont and his senior advisers stumbled on a new obstacle. It concerned the PSBR, which in recent years has risen rapidly, partly as a result of high social security spending and reduced tax income because of the recession. Under the initial projections worked out by Treasury economists, the PSBR in 1992-93 would rise to more than Pounds 32bn, with deficits kept at high levels in each of the following five financial years. When the economists read Mr Lamont's note - sent on his behalf by Mr Jeremy Heywood, his principal private secretary - they tried to stick to his request for a zero deficit by 1996-97. It was left to a small group in Mr Riley's team to try to come up with the numbers. They attempted to adjust projections for public spending downwards and those for government revenues upwards, to come up with relatively small numbers for the PSBR for the years ahead. However, as they burned the midnight oil, the economists found they could not bring the PSBR down to nil without making it obvious to the financial markets that the numbers had been rigged. That was because of the way that the spending and income figures would have become implau-sible. They therefore struck a compromise in which the PSBR projection for 1996-97 was set in the Budget statement at Pounds 6bn, above Mr Lamont's target but substantially less than the figure of about Pounds 16bn that had been pencilled in originally. Other numbers for the profile of the PSBR were reduced in a similar fashion. As they changed the numbers, the Treasury economists appeared to approach the exercise with grim relish. 'You have to hand it to the Treasury economists,' said one person close to the department. 'Lots of people fiddle numbers but the Treasury does it in a particularly professional way.'  ----------------------------------------------------- PSBR (POUNDS BN)  ----------------------------------------------------- Year    Published projection    Initial projection            in March Budget     by Treasury economists  ----------------------------------------------------- 1992-93           28                   32-35 1993-94           32                   40 1994-95           25                   35 1995-96           19                   29 1996-97            6                   16  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yi Hong-ku, ROK deputy prime minister and </F> minister of the National Unification Board, by senior CHUNGANG  ILBO reporter Pak Chun-yong in Seoul on 10 May]    [Text] [Pak Chun-hyong] You designed the proposal of the  Korean common race when you were the National Unification Board  minister from 1988 to 1990. The present government has laid out  a three-stage and three-principle policy represented by the  following steps toward reunification: reconciliation and  cooperation, alliance, and reunification. Are these two  conceptions different?    [Yi Hong-ku] The Korean common race proposal and the  reunification method based on the three-stage and  three-principle policy are same in nature.    President Kim Yong-sam's mentioned the phrase "within the  frame of the Korean common race" while announcing the  reunification method in July 1993. As hinted by this, the  government's reunification policy includes three separate steps  to achieve the Korean common race.    In other words, the three steps are virtually included in  the  Korean common race and the government's reunification policy has  made this clearer.    Accordingly, in spite of four years before I returned to the  office of the unification minister, I can invariably push ahead  with the reunification policy since it has not been changed at  all.    [Pak] It sounds as if there has been no big change in the  government's policy on North Korea. The new government  attempted a fresh approach toward relations with North Korea.  The opinions, however, have been divided into conservative and  radical views as the nuclear issue was aggravated. How will  you, as the minister of the National Unification Board, overcome  this problem?    [Yi] There are two important things to think about. First,  there were such big incidents as the collapse of the Soviet  Union and the unification of Germany. They were not usual  incidents. They mean the end of the age of ideology and doctrine  that lasted for 100 years. As a result, we came to have the  imminent task of solving the problem of the Korean peninsula, an  outsider from the post-cold war stream of the world history, in  a peaceful way, not by war.    In light of this point, we must, as soon as possible, free  ourselves from the old dogmatic ideas not only in relations with  North Korea, but also with the entire society.    Unfortunately, however, some of our younger generation, who  are expected to be the most advanced, are still obsessed by the  dogmatic ideology that prevailed in the early 20th century.    However, the lack of any definite plan in freeing oneself  from dogmatism may result in a vacuum. Accordingly,  civilian-led education on details of reunification is keenly  required for creating a ripened civic sense in preparation for  reunification.    Right after the World War II, the German Government also set  aside a large budget for the people's political education  programs to raise the people as mature civilians.    [Pak] Some people feel the government needs to adjust its  North Korean policy after reevaluating the policy of linking  South- North economic cooperation with the nuclear issue as no  progress is being made in South-North relations because of the  nuclear issue.    [Yi] I believe that the government's position is very  reasonable. The problem is an order of priority. The  government believes that there is nothing more important than  the North Korean nuclear issue in present North-South relations.  In other words, the government gives the highest priority to  resolving the nuclear issue in its North Korean policy. This is  because the nuclear issue is a matter of the nation's existence,  not a matter of ideology. I do not mean, however, that the  government will dogmatically interpret the meaning of the  "settlement of the nuclear issue." It is not the position of  the government to indefinitely delay the settlement of many  North-South issues, including North- South economic cooperation,  until the complete settlement of the nuclear issue. Nuclear  transparency is a key factor in resolving the nuclear issue. We  can say that in conformity with developments, the government has  formulated a stage-by-stage plan to deal with North Korea,  including North-South economic cooperation, on the assumption  that the way to resolving the nuclear issue can be discovered in  several months, instead of several years.    [Pak] It must be sure that Pyongyang's goal is to improve  relations with Washington. People say that many problems --  including the nuclear issue and the easing of tensions on the  Korean peninsula -- can be simultaneously solved only if the  United States improves relations with North Korea. What do you  say about this?    [Yi] The government has already formulated its policy based  on such a direction. A few weeks ago, our government even  withdrew its policy on the exchange of North-South special  envoys.    Because there has been no progress in North Korean-U.S.  talks  as a result of our government's call for the exchange of special  envoys, we could not but make a bold decision to withdraw it.  This was not even thinkable in the past. Without the people's  cooperation and their consciousness as citizens, this cannot be  possible, either. However, the problem is North Korea's  attitude.    The U.S. Government is well aware that North Korea wants to  establish diplomatic relations, as well as to gain economic  support from the United States. However, Pyongyang has not yet  decided on its position on abandoning its nuclear development --  which it uses as a card for establishing diplomatic relations  with the United States.    Finally, we can say the settlement of all the problems --  North- South dialogue, U.S.-North Korean relations, and North  Korean- International Atomic Energy Agency relations -- depends  on North Korea's choice.    The government's basic North Korean policy should be  formulated in a direction in which it can be profitable to North  Korea in the trends of world history.    [Pak] Some people think eliminating North Korea's  distrust of the external world could be one of the means to  change North Korea.    [Yi] North Korea's adjustment to the post-cold war era does  not mean it has to become like South Korea. It will be rather  closer to China.    If North Korea wants to readjust using the Chinese model, we  will directly and indirectly help make the changes in a way that  will not disgrace or burden North Korea.    [Pak] Regarding the repatriation of Yi In-mo after much  dispute, although a survey by the National Unification Research  Institute shows 79.2 percent of the people support the decision,  some people think it was a mistake as North-South relations fell  into a stalemate.    North Korea has recently demanded the repatriation of  unconverted long-term prisoners Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan. What  is the government's position on this?    [Yi] The issue of unconverted long-term prisoners should be  considered from various angles, not separately. Our people  repatriated Yi In-mo on a humanitarian basis.    However, North Korea took him to every corner of the country  and held people's rallies. That is not a humanitarian but  political act under the excuse of humanity.    Furthermore, we also have 400 people who have been abducted  to the North, including the 12 crew of the fishing boat  Tongjin-ho, which was kidnapped in 1987.    As mentioned a few days ago by Kang Yong-hun, president of  the South Korean Red Cross, our position is to make a package  discussion covering all the pending humanitarian issues of the  North and the South irrespective of the format, be it Red Cross  talks or other talks.    [Pak] North Korea recently proposed to the United States to  replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement. How  would the government react to this?    [Yi] It contains a more strategical meaning aimed at  blurring the focus of the nuclear issue. We look forward to  responsible acts by North Korea.    We will adhere to the policy of resolving this issue through  direct negotiations between the parties concerned in the South  and the North.    Article 5 of the basic agreement between the South and the  North stipulates that mutual efforts will be exerted to  transform the armistice situation to a peaceful one, and that  the current Armistice Agreement will be abided by until the  advent of a peaceful situation.    [Pak] I understand that the government's decision to accept  North Korean loggers is noteworthy because it was based on a  policy to separately handle the regime and the people. Would  the principle of differentiating the North Korean people from  the regime be applied continuously in the future?    [Yi] Basically, North-South issues have a contradicting dual  composition of a confrontation system and the efforts to resolve  the confrontation through dialogue. The loggers issue is an  example.    Therefore, the government plans to prudently solve the  problem taking both the humanitarian aspect and North-South  relations into consideration. It is true that this may sound  like a contradiction.    I think politics is virtually to efficiently and reasonably  lead such a contradictory situation.</p>

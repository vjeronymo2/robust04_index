			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Civilian MoD cut may miss target Senior defence officials admitted yesterday that the Ministry of Defence might not meet its target of cutting 20 per cent of civilian staff by 1995-96, David White writes. However, they rejected charges made by the all-party Commons defence committee that the ministry would be lumbered with 'an unaffordable civilian-manned infrastructure'. The 20 per cent target, foreseen under the 1990 Options for Change reforms, was designed to match cuts in the armed forces. The officials said, however, that this was not necessarily an overriding aim. In many cases it was cheaper to fill posts with civilians than members of the armed forces.</p>

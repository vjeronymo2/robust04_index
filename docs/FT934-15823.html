			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Broker resigns in row over enhanced scrip dividend FORTY MINUTES after Aut-omated Security (Holdings)'s profit warning appeared on Stock Exchange screens yesterday, de Zoete &amp; Bevan announced its resignation as its joint broker. The swiftness of the broker's announcement suggests a fierce row had blown up between it and the company. The argument is over the company's enhanced scrip dividend, announced in July. De Zoete, part of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the integrated securities house, said that it had advised ASH to cancel the share issue, which comes into effect on Wednesday next week, because of the sharp fall in the share price yesterday to 102p. It said it resigned when ASH refused to take its advice within the timescale it set. ASH said yesterday that the scrip dividend remained in place, but would be kept under review and a decision whether to proceed with it would be taken by next Tuesday on the basis of what is best for the company and its shareholders. The scrip issue is still conditional on the new shares being admitted to the Official List. This is usually a formality, but the Stock Exchange could in theory refuse their admission if it found grounds to do so. It is also expected to look at the company's share price movements ahead of the warning. Under the enhanced scrip shareholders were offered either a cash interim dividend of 3.05p or a 50 per cent higher dividend in shares, worth 4.58p. The scrip dividend was approved by shareholders at a special meeting on September 29, and 87.5 per cent of shareholders elected to take the shares instead of the cash dividend. This would save the company Pounds 3.1m in cash and Pounds 900,000 in advance corporation tax which is not payable on scrip dividends. On Tuesday this week the reference price for the scrip - the price used to calculate how many shares would be issued to meet the dividend payment - was set at 142p. Shareholders who took the scrip dividend are in effect buying new shares next Wednesday at 142p, 40p above the current market price. Shareholders with 24.3 per cent of ASH's shares decided to accept the scrip dividend but take advantage of BZW's offer to buy and place their new shares. The price set for this placing of 892,000 shares was 136p. Investors who bought those shares are now nursing heavy losses. It is thought that BZW itself may have been left with some of these shares, which might explain its anger. Furthermore, BZW dreamt up the enhanced scrip dividend idea and has arranged them for 14 clients. It therefore has an interest in maintaining the integrity of the product.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 11 -- A new situation is forming in  Russia after the December elections. A new professional and  social base takes shape. Gennady Burbulis, member of the State  Duma, president of the Humanitarian and Political Sciences  Centre "Strategia" (strategy), said in an interview to ITAR-TASS.    He said that the new political reality is "the part of the  pragmatically-minded population that for various reasons kept  from engaging in active politics, but on whose specific activity  the stability, meaningfulness and constructiveness of all  undertakings in Russia will depend in future."    Regarding his quitting Russia's Choice faction, Burbulis  said: "I have not as much quitted Russia's Choice as I meet  halfway the new reality. I objects to its being overlooked."    Burbulis believes there is no need to cling to slogans and  ideological values that have been used for three years now. "The  activity of Russia's choice is quite justifiable, but it risks  to go into a dead alley unless the changed situation is taken  into notice," he said.    Burbulis regards as a new political force, first of all, the  December 12th group in the duma. He said there are also quite a  few deputies in other factions upholding the same positions.    Regarding his political career, Burbulis said he is not  going  to become a leader of the new political force. "I shall be  pressing for its recognition and unification on a constructive  basis and I shall be promoting the emergence of new leaders," he  said.</p>

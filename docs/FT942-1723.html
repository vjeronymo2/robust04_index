			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Quotas for EU TV programmes come under fire Television quotas in European Union countries are damaging development of Europe's audio-visual sector and work against the interests of the film producers, rights holders, artists and technicians they are supposed to protect, according to a report published today. Prepared by consultants London Economics on behalf of Sony Europe, the report argues that quotas are anti-competitive, harmful to the promotion of European television production, a drag on the creation of jobs and culturally ineffective. Its findings come amid indications from the European Commission that it is willing to consider changes to the existing broadcasting directive. This directive recommends that EU-based TV channels allot at least half their broadcasting time to European-made programmes 'wherever practicable', excluding time allotted to news, sports, games, advertising and teletext services. It also says at least 10 per cent of programming budgets should be devoted to European works from independent producers. Earlier this week Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, commissioner responsible for the audio-visual sector, said proposed changes to the directive would not be anti-American and quotas would not be tightened. The existing quotas are intended to nurture Europe's broadcasting industry, and protect social and cultural values from the strong competition of cheap US imports. But the report - based on studies of TV in France, Germany and the UK - says quotas are anti-competitive as they do not affect the programme output of well established channels such as the BBC, ZDF and TF1 (which already exceed quota requirements), but that of new entrants. 'Quotas make it more difficult for new entrants to compete, either by reducing the attractiveness of their schedules as a result of switching out of imported programming, or by forcing up their programming costs,' says the report.

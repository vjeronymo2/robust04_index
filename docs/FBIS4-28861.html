			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Don't Run Riot"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- Japanese Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata, far from making an official apology for the police  raid on the Kyoto Headquarters of the General Association of  Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and search of houses of  Chongnyon officials and other places, blared that "there was  nothing wrong in the precedures of the search."    Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says that this  revealed once again the craftiness and effrontery peculiar to  Japan.    Recalling that a situation resembling that on the eve of the  past Korean war has been created in Japan now, the analyst says:    The Japanese reactionaries should know clearly what a  country  the DPRK is, what a people the Koreans are and how great our  might is. And they must not doubt the will of our people who  mean what they say.    Should Japan join in "sanctions" against us, whether she  takes the van or is inveigled into it, we will regard it as a  declaration of war and then she will not be able to evade a  deserved punishment. This warning is anything but an empty word.  The Japanese authorities should ponder over the lot in which  Japan would find itself, if this warning of ours is carried into  practice.    The Japanese reactionaries must not run riot but promptly  stop their hostile policy against the DPRK and the repression of  Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan. This advice is quite beneficial  to Japan.</p>

			<p>920804 FT  04 AUG 92 / Adverts anger Bolger NEW ZEALAND'S prime minister, Mr Jim Bolger, has responded angrily to advertisements to be launched by the Australian Labor Party in the state of Victoria. The advertisements feature New Zealanders complaining about low wages, inadequate social welfare and poor business prospects, blaming their government's free market policies for the problems. They warn that Victorians would feel similar pain if the opposition Liberal Party won the election. The Liberal Party is presenting a package of state and federal policies similar to those in New Zealand, including a goods and services tax and a deregulated labour market. The adverts will launch the Victorian state election campaign in October. Mr Bolger said the Victorian state government was desperate to find someone else to blame.</p>

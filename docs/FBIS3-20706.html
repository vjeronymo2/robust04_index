			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Gheorghe Prisacaru, member of the Central </F> Executive Bureau, head of the International Department of the  Party of Social Democracy of Romania, by Constantin Benga; place  and date not given: "Connecting to Western Democratic Values"]    [Text] [Benga] Recently, the contacts of the PDSR [Party of  Social Democracy of Romania] with French political groups have  become quite frequent. What is the explanation for this  development?    [Prisacaru] As a government party, the PDSR bears, to a  great  extent, responsibility for the foreign policy promoted by the  Government of Romania. However, from this point of view, it is  known that one of our priority objectives is connecting to  Western democratic values, including those of the French. The  development of Romanian-French relations responds not only to  the call of history but also to the requirements of the period  in which we are living. We are sure that France can give more  active support to the reform process and the integration of  Romania into the European structures and that our Latin sisters  cannot remain indifferent to the enhancement of the role of our  country as a factor of stability in our zone. There is no doubt  that the state visit which President Ion Iliescu will make to  France in April is part of this process. Democratic political  groups in both countries can contribute -- through dialogue and  cooperation -- to the promotion of fruitful collaboration in a  wide variety of fields.    [Benga] What political groups did you meet with during your  recent visit to France?    [Prisacaru] Let me begin with the French Socialist Party  which, like the PDSR, ascribes to modern social-democratic  values. The discussions with Gerard Fuchs, member of the  Executive Bureau, secretary for international affairs of the  French Socialist Party, proved the usefulness of this meeting  for a better knowledge of the objectives and concerns of the two  parties. Of course, the French Socialist Party, which became an  opposition party after the recent elections, is especially  concerned with defining objectives, both in domestic and  international policy, which would permit the recovery of lost  political capital and, at the same time, of its electorate. The  impressive street demonstration in Paris on 16 February. in  support of public and lay education, of which the French  Socialist Party was one of the main organizers, proved this. The  approaching elections for the European Parliament offer the  Socialist Party the opportunity to present the preponderantly  European option which it established at the time of the last  party congress in November 1993, at which the former prime  minister, Michel Rocard, took over the leadership of the party.  The hosts demonstrated a special interest in learning about the  current political situation and the development of the process  of transition in Romania as well as the way in which the PDSR  intends to supersede existing difficulties. We also met with  Jean Claude Mignon, deputy in the French National Assembly and  national secretary for the Eastern Democracies in the Assembly  for the Republic Party (RPR), which is currently the governing  party. The artisan and president of this party -- Gaullist in  essence --is Jacques Chirac, the mayor general of Paris, and the  current prime minister of France, Eduard Balladur, belongs to  this party. I must confess that I had an extremely pleasant  surprise when, during my discussions with the RPR  representative, I noted not only a genuine interest in gaining  the proper perception of the socio-political situation in  Romania but also a great desire to continue the dialogue on the  ways to promote a closer Romanian-French collaboration. Finally,  the third group with which we had discussions was the Movement  of Leftist Radicals (MRS), one of the oldest French political  groups, which has parliamentary repesentation, and which gave  France a far from negligible number of political personalities.  Few people know that the MRS is one of the first parties --  before the appearance of some distinct groups -- to be concerned  about ecological issues. Not affiliated with any existing  international organization -- neither socialist, nor liberal,  nor Christian-Democratic -- the MRS supports the idea of the  establishment of a structure of centrist parties which,  especially in the northern countries of Europe, enjoy  considerable popularity. Both sides expressed a desire to  continue to exchange opinions on matters of common interest.    [Benga] From what you have said, it appears that you will  not  limit your contacts in France to the Socialist Party. Is this a  more general option for the PDSR?    [Prisacaru] Indeed, this is a basic option of our party. Of  course, we are assigning the proper importance to the promotion  of cooperation with the socialist and social-democratic parties  which are members of the Socialist International or are  interested in associating with it in one form or another.  However, this does not mean that we are not promoting a dialogue  with other democratic political groups. The relations which the  PDSR has with parties outside the socialist spectrum in Greece,  France, Great Britain, Spain, or Italy are proof of this option.  In any case, in the eyes of these groups, the PDSR is neither  "cryptocommunist" nor "antireformist." On the contrary, they  evaluate the PDSR not so much on the basis of such statements,  as, in particular, on the basis of its concrete actions which  prove its total commitment to expanding the democratic  processes, establishing the state of law and the market economy,  stopping the decline and, in the future, raising the standard of  level of the population. We presented such aspects to our French  hosts so that our partners would get to know us better and would  have the most accurate picture of Romania.    [Benga] Were you invited to the French Communist Party  Congress?    [Prisacaru] We received an invitation to the congress but  our  party did not attend. We are awaiting with interest the  decisions of the congress regarding the orientation of its  program and the principles of organizing the party, keeping in  mind the fact that this represents the interests of a certain  segment of the French population. Dialogue and cooperation with  this leftist French party remain an open possibility. Everything  depends on the identification, in the future, of common options  which would promote the development of Romanian-French relations  and peace and security in the world.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> NBC Shuffles Lineup: NBC has announced several changes in its prime-time  lineup, including moving the comedy series "Alf" to Saturdays at 8 p.m. and  bringing back "My Two Dads" on Mondays at 8 p.m. "Alf" will replace "227,"  which will go on hiatus, to return to the schedule later in the season. The  changes, which are scheduled to go into effect the first week of March, are the  first of a series of shuffles that will make room for tryouts of "close to a  dozen" new NBC series, according to NBC Entertainment President Brandon  Tartikoff.

Joe Clark, UN secretary general's special  envoy in Cyprus, met with President Rauf Denktas at noon today.    In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said that a  document was submitted including certain changes within the  framework of the views and concerns expressed by the Turkish  Cypriot side. Pointing out that he cannot comment on the  document before studying it, Denktas noted: We will see if the  changes effected are satisfactory after evaluating the document.    Asked if any progress was achieved, Denktas responded that  the talks are continuing and it is not right to comment before  reaching a conclusion. In reply to a question, the president  remarked that the Greek Cypriot Administration accepted the  proposal to have two gates at Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airport, adding:  The customs procedures at the Turkish Cypriot gate will be  undertaken by us. Nothing will be signed unless this is  accepted.    Noting that he did not receive an invitation to go to New  York, Denktas said that every day and every week is important  with regard to negotiations, but one can say that this is a very  important week.    Answering a question on how the negotiations will be  affected  if there is change in government in Turkey in the wake of local  elections, Denktas explained that the talks are conducted within  the framework of Turkish policy and they cannot be interrupted  because of a change in government.    In his statement after the meeting, Clark reported that he  submitted to Denktas a written document relating to observations  and concerns raised during the last two weeks of the proximity  talks. Pointing out that this document will be discussed during  tomorrow's meeting, Clark responded to a question by saying that  Denktas and Greek Cypriot leader Kliridhis have not been invited  to New York. Clark added that he cannot make any predictions  concerning the leaders' meeting in New York. If the New York  meeting is to be constructive, Clark declared, progress must be  achieved in the proximity talks in Lefkosa. Asked if Denktas  displayed a positive attitude during today's meeting, Clark said  yes.    After the talks, the Turkish Cypriot delegation led by  Denktas held a meeting to assess the document submitted by the  United Nations. The proximity talks will continue tomorrow as  well. Denktas will hold a meeting with Clark at 1100 tomorrow.  Clark met with Kliridhis over luncheon today.</p>

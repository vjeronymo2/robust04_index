			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COVERAGE OF ALZHEIMER'S EXHIBIT  </P> <P> Dear Mr. Wong:  </P> <P> I am writing to compliment you on the excellent and informative article in the  Nov. 2, 1989, issue of Orange County Life entitled "Painting the Past." Your  coverage of the art exhibit of works by Alzheimer's patients was thorough, very  professional and very much on target.  </P> <P> The exhibit, called "Memories in the Making '89," is a new and unique idea, one  which is breaking ground in the areas of patient communication and research. It  has given those who view the artworks an opportunity to see into the "windows  on the soul" still alive in the patients devastated by this disease.  </P> <P> Thank you for writing about this event in such a sensitive way. Your coverage  has allowed us to reach many new individuals who may not have known about us  and what it is we do for Alzheimer's patients and their families. On behalf of  the board of directors, I thank you for helping us remember those who no longer  can remember.  </P> <P> G. Kent Barnheiser,  </P> <P> Executive Director, Alzheimer's Assn.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`Focus on Austria's Security'"] </F>   [Excerpt] Four days before the European Union [EU]  referendum a series of statements on the various aspects of EU  accession was made on Wednesday [8 June]. Federal President  Thomas Klestil, Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak, and Defense  Minister Werner Fasslabend concentrated on security.    At an information rally "Youth for Europe" in Vienna,  Klestil  emphasized that as far as the EU entry is concerned the main  focus would be Austria's security. He pointed out that the  Germans and French alone engaged in 27 battles against each  other, "while today war between the two great European peoples  had become unthinkable." Klestil also argued that, as a small  country, Austria was unable to deal with such new threats such  as mass immigration, organized crime, or risks related to  nuclear power, by itself.    Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak said that Austria's  accession to the EU will increase the security of our country.  After EU entry, the judicial authorities would be able to  directly cooperate in the sphere of criminal investigations to  fight organized crime. According to Loeschnak, Austria can also  expect support from the EU on immigration policy: "After all,  it is indeed hard to understand that one and the same person  should file applications for asylum in several states, while the  various states shift the burden of illegal immigration to one  another instead of joining forces and seeking solutions  together." Moreover, Austria, which has made the greatest  contribution to the temporary accommodation of Bosnian war  refugees, can expect at least some easing of the situation from  fair, European-wide burden sharing.    Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend expects EU membership to  enhance security. Many Austrians underestimate the danger of  possible crisis spots in the region. For Fasslabend it is clear  that an attack against an EU member state is less likely than  one against a state outside the European system.    A "no" in next Sunday's EU referendum would not mean the  rejection of something new but rather a departure from Austria's  present course, Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek said. Austria's EU  accession is the logical consequence of its current cooperation  with the west European states, with which one must react to the  political changes in Europe and economic developments. Busek  also stressed that all over countries are joining together in  regional blocs, as the United States and Mexico have done.  Austria must not remain alone in these developments. We have  to provide for security in our country. "In the cold war"  Austria "benefited from its situation" and was well protected,  "but now one must not expect other states to fight for us only  because we are so nice or because of our Lipizzaner stallions."  The vice chancellor is convinced that within the EU our country  would be protected by the other states, while the EU would  hardly fight as actively for third countries.    Transport Minister Viktor Klima pointed out that even within  the EU there would be enough room for Austria to pursue a  transportation policy of its own. Austria should continue to  play the pioneering role it has played so far in this sphere  even once it is a EU member, and not pursue a narrow-minded,  isolationist policy.    On Wednesday, the three presidents of the Nationalrat, Heinz  Fischer, Robert Lichal, and Heide Schmidt repeated their appeal  to the electorate to turn out in as large numbers as possible  for the 12 June referendum. The poll is one of the most  important decisions in the Second Republic, and every citizen  should participate in it after fairly weighing all arguments in  favor against those against membership; Sunday's vote should  neither be a decision on the government nor on the opposition  but a vote on Austria's future.

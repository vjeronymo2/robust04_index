			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Mexican deputies and senators have condemned foreign  intervention in Mexican affairs. The congressional Permanent  Commission has referred to the fact that the U.S. House of  Representatives has instituted a series of hearings to evaluate  the status of human rights in various places in the world,  including the events in Chiapas.    Despite certain coincidences, the six Mexican political  parties have failed to reach a consensus, however; consequently,  two different points of agreement were produced to establish the  position of the Mexican Congress. Senator Gustavo Salinas has  read a statement in the name of the PRI [Revolutionary  Institutional Party], the PPS [Popular Socialist Party], the  Cardenist Front for the National Reconstruction Party, and PARM  [Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution].    [Begin Senator Salinas recording] The congressional  Permanent  Commission hereby rejects absolutely the idea of hearings being  held in the U.S. House of Representatives to debate matters that  are exclusively Mexican. Such activities cannot be permitted to  lead to intervention in our country. [end recording]    PRD [Party for the Democratic Revolution] Deputy Alejandro  Encinas spoke in the name of his party and PAN [National Action  Party].    [Begin Encinas recording] We think it is desirable for the  Mexican Congress to call for public hearings on violations of  human rights, particularly against Mexicans living in the United  States. This is a duty we should do as responsible citizens.  [end recording]    During the Permanent Commission session, it was agreed that  no special sessions will be held in February and that a  consensus should be sought among all parties.</p>

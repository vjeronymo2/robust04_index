In an address to the International Affairs Institute, which  also served as an occasion to review his tenure as Italy's  diplomatic chief, Andreatta observed how "there is a fundamental  intolerance towards institutional questions" in European Union  member states, "even among the original members. When the  question was raised to prepare for the inter-governmental  conference to modify the institutions almost no one, except  Italy, appeared in favor of speeding up the time table."    The Italian diplomatic chief went on to add how only now,  with the conclusion of membership negotiations with Sweden,  Norway, Finland and Austria, "have we, in a most casual way,  been able to guide things towards a commitment in Corfu (the EU  summit ending the Greek duty presidency in June) where  government chiefs will appoint their permanent representatives  to the committee which must prepare the inter-governmental  conference."    Andreatta then went on to list some possible alternatives  for  institutional change, including "...an Upper House, one of  government representatives, with a leadership in which some  Member States, given their size and presence in the EU, become  permanent members" as well as members "which represent the  continuity of action."    Andreatta's proposal is that of the "hard core" approach  which has been under discussion for several months, in which  several states push forward and even go beyond the path set down  in the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. "At present," the  foreign minister observed, "the debate on the hard core must  take into account Britain, which is irreplaceable in Europe."    The Italian diplomatic chief went on to recall how some of  "the most important steps we have taken in the last decade have  been thanks to Britain. Sometimes Britain's opposition has  helped the European Community move forward.... I would not like  the hard core approach to leave out one of the most original and  important Member States."    According to Andreatta, the 1996 inter-governmental  conference on institutional reform will represent a turning  point for building a united Europe and "the series of duty  presidencies, between Germany's and Italy's, will set the pace  for those which must govern these processes."    "But the times are not easy ones to modify and accelerate  the  European process" Andreatta concluded, in reference to the  intolerance to institutional reform "...but occasions like  these, which could even lead to failure, must be exploited and  those with more to offer should perhaps try to offer more."</p>

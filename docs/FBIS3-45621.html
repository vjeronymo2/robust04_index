			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Guangzhou Mayor Li Ziliu Stresses Deterioration </F> of Sino-British Relations Will Unavoidably Affect Economic  Interests"]    [Text] Guangzhou Mayor Li Ziliu indicated that Guangzhou's  large-scale construction projects will be open for tender by  foreign companies on the basis of the principle of fairness.  However, the authorities will also take into consideration the  political background of the relevant foreign companies, and  those which attempt to impair the interests of our country will  not be welcome.    Li Ziliu noted at a public occasion in Macao that after  China  and France have resumed normal diplomatic relations, French  companies can join the others in tendering for all construction  projects in Guangzhou on the basis of mutual benefits and  equality. However, French companies missed many opportunities  during the initial stage of Guangzhou's subway construction.  Now, they are mainly engaged in software projects.    Li Ziliu added: Generally speaking, Guangzhou is mainly  concerned with the real strength of the companies concerned when  assessing their tenders. However, "if Sino-British relations  continue to deteriorate, the economic interests of both sides  will unavoidably suffer losses," he indicated.</p>

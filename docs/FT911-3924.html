			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (15): It all depends on the number of chips - Semiconductors, when is a computer company not a computer company MR Bernard Giroud, vice-president of Intel, takes strong exception to anyone calling his organisation a computer company. By contrast, Mr Tom Beaver, vice-president of Motorola, positively insists on his organisation being called a computer company. Regardless of how they prefer to be styled, both of these leading US semiconductor manufacturers now make products which used to be made by computer companies. As computer companies concentrate on profitable activities such as software and systems integration, semiconductor companies such as Intel and Motorola are spending more of their time manufacturing computers. Ten years ago, the computer companies simply provided customers with their computers. Now the task of traditional computer companies has shifted, says Mr Giroud. 'The end user is asking for more software, more assistance, more training,' he says. As computer companies have moved away from their older manufacturing role, Intel, the world's leading manufacturer of microprocessors, has moved in. 'We are doing what an ICL or a Nixdorf was doing 10 years ago,' Mr Giroud says. 'We are making the central processing unit that ICL used to make 10 years ago.' The reason he insists on Intel not being called a computer company is that it does not deal directly with the end users of computers. 'A computer company is a company that sells solutions to the end user. We supply hardware to the system integrators. They supply the technology to the end user, combined with the software. We are not in competition with Compaq, Hewlett-Packard or IBM.' Motorola, America's biggest semiconductor maker, sees itself as being more directly involved in the computer industry. Mr Beaver says the company regards itself as a manufacturer of standard computers, along with their operating software. The only area in which Motorola is not involved is in the provision of applications software. Five years ago Motorola established a separate computer division, which Mr Beaver heads. One of the reasons why Motorola wanted to move more decisively into computer manufacture was to help influence the debate over common operating standards. The computer industry worldwide has seen a move away from computers which are unable to communicate with those provided by other manufacturers. Customers are increasingly insisting on common standards or open systems. They are demanding that different manufacturers provide computers that can talk to one another. Motorola makes computers which use A T &amp; T's Unix operating system. The move from proprietary to open systems provided Motorola with what it saw as a commercial opportunity. 'We saw a lot of computer companies struggling through the transition from proprietary to open systems. We saw a lot of them deciding to become niche companies, specialising in banking, insurance, what have you. They're letting someone else build the hardware. We saw that as an opportunity because our corporation is good at competing in commodity products. We make computers as a commodity item,' says Mr Beaver. Mr Beaver says he sees the world computer industry today as being divided into three groups. The first consists of companies providing a mixture of computers adhering to both their own and to common operating standards. He says the American companies IBM, DEC, Unisys and Hewlett-Packard belong in this category, along with Siemens of Germany. The second group consists of companies providing computer systems to clients in particular fields, such as banking or law, and contracting out much of the hardware manufacture. He puts Wang of the US, Olivetti of Italy, Philips of the Netherlands and Nixdorf of Germany (now part of Siemens) in this group. The third group consists of companies providing products for the open systems market. NCR, Intel, A T &amp; T, Sun Microsystems and Compaq - all of the US - fall into this category, as do most of the Japanese computer companies. So, he says, does Motorola. Participating in a commodity market, he says, these companies have to sell computers on the basis of price and performance. The move by many computer companies away from manufacturing is not the only reason that some chip companies have become computer manufacturers. Mr Giroud points out that technological developments mean that computers use fewer and fewer chips. 'At the moment, you take two chips from Intel, eight chips from someone else, add the memory, and you have a personal computer. In 1984 or 1985, you needed 170 chips plus the memory to make a computer. In 1993, the 10 chips plus the memory you need today will become one chip plus the memory,' Mr Giroud says. As the number of chips used in computers shrinks, semiconductor makers effectively become computer manufacturers. 'What we are doing is we are putting a PC on a chip,' Mr Giroud says. 'The chips we are designing now have 4m to 5m transistors.'</p>

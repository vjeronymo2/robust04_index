			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Fan Liqing (5400 7787 7230) and Fang Jin (2455 </F> 3866)]    [Text] Beijing, 2 Feb (XINHUA) -- Tang Shubei, executive  vice chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait [ARATS], and Zou Zhekai, vice chairman and secretary  general of the ARATS, held the second round of working  discussions this afternoon with Jiao Renhe [Chiao Jen-ho], vice  chairman and secretary general of Taiwan's Strait Exchange  Foundation [SEF] on implementing the agreements of the "Wang-Gu  [Ku] talks." The discussions made some progress. In addition,  the two sides exchanged opinions on how to place the relevant  economic topics on the agenda.    Giving a briefing to reporters at the end of the discussions  today, Tang Shubei said: The two sides pragmatically and  earnestly discussed relevant issues concerning the  implementation of the "Joint Agreement on the Wang-Gu Talks,"  and made progress in two aspects. The two sides confirmed the  "Agreement on Establishing a System of Making Contacts and  Holding Talks Between the Two Organizations," and reached  unanimity on the procedure on facilitating mutual visits by  personnel of the two organizations in accordance with the  agreement. The two sides would strive to make the agreement  effective on 4 February after the wordings are checked. The two  sides agreed that ARATS Deputy Secretary General Sun Yafu and  relevant personnel would hold further discussions with SEF  Deputy Secretary General Xu Huiyou [Hsu Hui-yu] and relevant  personnel, on the common understanding on three routine issues  reached during the ARATS-SEF talks in Taibei [Taipei] and on  issues concerning the Tang Shubei-Jiao Renhe talks. In  addition, the two sides exchanged opinions in general on how to  place on the agenda the relevant economic topics specified in  the "Joint Agreement on the Wang-Gu Talks." ARATS Deputy  Secretaries Zhao Zhengyu and Li Yafei, as well as SEF Deputy  Secretary General Shi Qiping [Shi Chi-ping], were separately  appointed to form a working group to exchange opinions tomorrow.    As Jiao Renhe and his entourage visited Beijing  Municipality's Zhongguan Village New Technological and  Industrial Development Experimental Zone this morning, this  afternoon's discussions opened with Jiao Renhe's impressions of  Zhongguan Village. Jiao Renhe said he was deeply impressed by  the village and felt that there was very great potential for the  village's development. He said: During the visit, I saw Mr.  Jiang Zemin's inscriptions for the experimental zone: "Bring  into play the intelligence and wisdom of Chinese intellectuals  to develop high technology industries and advance toward the  21st century." Jiao Renhe felt that the statement was well  made. If the intelligence and wisdom of the Chinese people were  brought into play, China would definitely develop more  vigorously. Jiao Renhe said: The process of Taiwan's economic  development is also the experience of the Chinese people in  bringing into play their intelligence and wisdom. While the  mainland may draw on some of these experiences for reference,  Taiwan too needs to learn from the mainland in some aspects.  Tang Shubei said: The development of the people-run Zhongguan  Village's scientific and technological undertakings is an  achievement of the mainland's reform and opening up. Each of  the two sides of the Taiwan Strait possesses its own advantages  in science and technology. The mainland has numerous  achievements in scientific and technological researches but has  not done enough in transforming them into commercial products.  Taiwan has done a very good job in transforming scientific and  technological achievements into commodities. If the two sides  could learn from each other and strengthen their cooperation, it  would definitely be conducive to the joint promotion of  cross-strait scientific and technological undertakings.    During the discussions, Tang Shubei gave a fairly detailed  briefing on the mainland's advocation on developing cross-strait  economy, and forwarded suggestions on ways to strengthen  cross-strait economic cooperation. Tang Shubei said: We feel  that all the various agenda items specified by the "Joint  Agreement on the Wang-Gu Talks" should be implemented.  Currently, cross-strait economic exchanges and cooperation is  an important content in cross-strait relations. Last year's  cross-strait economic and trade exchanges showed that increased  Taiwanese investments in the mainland is helpful to the  mainland's economic development. On the other hand, Taiwan's  ability to maintain a foreign trade surplus is also directly due  to the development of indirect cross-strait trade. It has been  proven in practice that the principle determined by the "Wang-Gu  talks"; that is, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should  strengthen cross-strait economic exchanges as well as supplement  and benefit each other, is correct. The two organizations  should be responsible to the people on both sides of the strait  and should hold consultations on relevant issues at an early  date.    During the discussions, both sides felt that cross-strait  cultural exchanges should be further broadened. The ARATS  thanked the SEF for warmly receiving responsible persons of  seven central press units during their visit at the beginning of  this year. The ARATS will continue to send responsible persons  and senior journalist delegations from the mainland's press  units to Taiwan for visit, and is ready to warmly receive visits  to the mainland by responsible persons of Taiwan's mass media.  The ARATS will also promote cross-strait exchanges and mutual  visits between young people and students.    Replying to a reporter's question, Tang Shubei said: The  experiences in cross-strait cooperation among the mass  organizations in the past three years have shown that it is  feasible to avoid [hui bi 0932 6699] sensitive political issues  at this stage. In accordance with this principle, the two sides  signed the "Jinmen [Quemoy] Agreement" and "Agreement on the Use  and Verification of Notary Certificates Between the Two Sides of  the Strait." It has been proven that if the two organizations  were sincere to solve problems and insisted on the principle of  holding discussions on people-to-people basis, ways of solving  routine problems acceptable to the two sides could be found.    While giving a briefing to reporters on the discussions,  Jiao  Renhe said: At today's discussions, the two organizations  exchanged opinions on the three agenda items in their Taibei  talks. The discussions of the two sides were quite specific and  their exchange of views was very thorough. The two sides  expressed their wishes to find ways for solving problems. He  expressed the hope that more progress would be achieved during  the next two days' discussions.</p>

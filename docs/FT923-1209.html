			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Tec to subsidise company pay bills SOUTH Derbyshire Training and Enterprise Council is to offer small manufacturing companies a wage subsidy to help them retain employees. The scheme, announced yesterday, is believed to be the first time any of the 82 Tecs - which administer government training schemes in England and Wales  -has offered to help companies to meet their wage bills. Ms Joy Street, South Derbyshire TEC chief executive, said: 'In many cases, firms are having to let people go in order to cut costs when they need the same people to help pull them clear from recession. 'For example, a manufacturing company with 20 employees which because of the current conditions is considering shedding three jobs could receive a subsidy of up to Pounds 25 per week per job for six months.' Tecs have a limited budget for local initiatives, although most of their resources are devoted to paying for Employment Training and Youth Training. Costs of the South Derbyshire scheme will be met from the Tec's reserves. Officials said detailed qualification criteria for the new scheme had still to be worked out. Contact was being made with banks and accountants to obtain lists of companies requiring help.</p>

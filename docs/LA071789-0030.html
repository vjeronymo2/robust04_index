			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israel's chief of staff has ordered an inquiry into reports of violence within  one of the country's elite army units. A military spokesman said the order by  Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron followed a military court verdict last week in the case of  a soldier who said he shot himself in the leg after being persecuted by fellow  recruits in the Givati infantry brigade. Testimony at the trial included claims  of violence among soldiers in the brigade, including verbal and physical abuse  of officers. Official military sources said the accusations related to only  one, since-disbanded company in the brigade.  </P></p>

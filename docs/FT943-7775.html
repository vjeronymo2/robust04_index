			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Books: Huxley's hobby-horses THE HIDDEN HUXLEY: CONTEMPT AND COMPASSION FOR THE MASSES edited by David Bradshaw Faber and Faber Pounds 17.50, 255 pages As the pieces re-printed in The Hidden Huxley make clear, Aldous Huxley was a push-over for a great many crackpot ideas as well as sensible ones. His genius was to absorb abstruse ideas and to promote them as ironic paradoxes. David Bradshaw, who is working on a fresh life of the author, causes us to ask whose side Huxley was really on in his celebrated anti-utopian fantasy, Brave New World (1932). Bradshaw points to Huxley's hitherto neglected admiration for the work of the American journalist HL Mencken, the co-editor of The Smart Set periodical, 'the most celebrated adversary of mass-democracy in the English-speaking world'. Huxley gave laudatory coverage to Mencken's book Prejudices in the Athenaeum arts and literary weekly and sent Mencken his novel Crome Yellow, which was duly praised for its masterly irony. Bradshaw shows Huxley approvingly echoing Mencken's division of society into an elite of ability and the toiling masses and finds Huxley similarly welcoming HG Wells's world-order headed by a ruling caste of Samurai. Bradshaw also quotes from Huxley's Athenaeum column and reprints his later pre-second war journalism in support of philosophers such as Pareto, who contributed significantly to the ideology of fascism. In later life Huxley found his guru in that enigmatic character Gerald Heard, with whom he was in contact when he moved from Europe to California in 1937. Heard appears as the mystic Propter in Huxley's novel After Many a Summer (1939). Time Must Have a Stop (1944), set in pre-war London and Florence, preached asceticism and showed the direction in which Huxley's thought had moved, as did his study of consensus among the religions of mankind, The Perennial Philosophy (1946). His Doors of Perception (1954) describing his experience with the drug mescalin, became a bible of the Beat Generation. He also turned at this time to history, in studies like The Devils of Loudon (1952), where he found object-lessons for the madnesses of the present in the past. One of his greatest gifts was for conversation. In a live recording made in 1961, Personally Speaking, he talks uninhibitedly about writing as a career, Freud, DH Lawrence, drug-taking, mysticism - all his pet hobby-horses. The voice is an upper-class sing-song in which every syllable is clearly enunciated rising in a crescendo as his conclusions are rammed home. He argues, for example, that advances in the arts often come about in an inexplicable and unprecedented manner rather than as a response to historical circumstances. 'Out of the blue' he said, 'Chaucer developed individual psychology . . . art has its own internal logic'. In his own case, however, his art - quasi-mysticism apart - was highly dependent upon events in the external world.</p>

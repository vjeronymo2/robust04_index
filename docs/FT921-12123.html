			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Union Carbide suffers Dollars 28m loss A SPIKE in raw material prices plus Dollars 220m of special charges associated with a restructuring programme caused Union Carbide, the big US chemicals company, to suffer a Dollars 28m loss in 1991, compared with a Dollars 308m net profit in 1990. The company took a Dollars 70m pre-tax (Dollars 46m after-tax) fourth-quarter special charge. This was for severance payments and facility consolidation costs associated with its previously announced restructuring. Costs associated with the proposed spin-off of its industrial gases business were also part of the special charge. Union Carbide suffered a Dollars 63m loss in the fourth quarter of 1991, compared with a Dollars 7m net profit in the last quarter of 1990. Fourth-quarter sales, restated to reflect the not-yet-completed spin-off of the industrial gases business, were 14.6 per cent lower at Dollars 1.15bn. For the whole of 1991, on the same basis, sales were 7 per cent down at Dollars 4.88bn. Last September, Union Carbide said it would cut its workforce by 5,500 as part of a cost-cutting programme that aims to reduce annual expenses by Dollars 250m by 1994. First-quarter earnings were reduced by the serious disruption caused by an explosion that killed several workers last March at a chemicals plant in Seadrift, Texas. Mr Robert Kennedy, Union Carbide's chairman, said the company had accelerated its cost-cutting. He said the fourth-quarter results, even excluding the special charges, reflected very competitive market conditions and a spike in raw material prices - especially for polyethylene and ethylene glycol - that reduced profit margins. On Wall Street, Union Carbide's share price closed at Dollars 24, down Dollars  3/8 .</p>

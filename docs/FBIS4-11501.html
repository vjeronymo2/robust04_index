			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Congressional Human Rights Committee, the  president of the Council for Peace, and the National  Coordinating Board for Human Rights arrived today from Tingo  Maria. They all agree that human rights violations were  committed against civilians but they could not agree whether  they were committed by the military or by the Shining Path [SL].    The investigation they conducted in the combat area  established that the reported bombardments did not take place.  Moreover, Huallaga Front official sources have reported that  antisubversive operations, which were suspended on 22 April,  will be resumed in the next few days.    [Begin unidentified reporter recording] The Congressional  Human Rights Committee, which traveled to Tingo Maria to verify  human rights violations charges, returned to Lima today.  Although they did not enter the theater of operations [as  heard], where it is believed there are more victims, the  legislators agreed that human rights violations were committed.  They disagreed, however, on who was responsible.    The six legislators and the journalists who traveled to the  site were shocked yesterday at finding seven bodies in the  village of Moyuna, on the left bank of the Huallaga River. The  identity of these bodies has yet to be established. Only two of  the bodies were taken to Tingo Maria.    Peasants who escaped from the conflict area have reported  that several clashes between the SL and the Army have taken  place in the area in the last few days. [passage omitted]    In view of these reports, this morning, the Congressional  Commission visited Mohena, which was believed to have been  bombarded and where allegedly more bodies were to be found.  This was later denied. In Mohena, the legislators met a  soldier who was wounded when he stepped on a booby trap a few  days ago. After staying in Mohena for 10 minutes, the  legislators headed for Aucayacu where they interviewed more  settlers who escaped from the conflict area in [words  indistinct].    Journalists toured sites inhabited by peasants who were  forced to support the SL. They found destroyed huts, remains of  lamps, scales, coca leaves, and [word indistinct] used to  manufacture cocaine hydrochloride. As it is well-known,  antisubversive operations were suspended as of 22 April but they  will be resumed within the next few days.    It has been learned that of the 180 subversives who were  found in the area, 35 have regrouped and are now in [name  indistinct]. For the time being, SL activity in the Huallaga  area has been curtailed. It is expected the SL will be defeated  in the next few weeks. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Bumper harvest adds to Japan's rice troubles This summer's hot weather in Japan has brought the best harvest in eight years. Unlike last year, when the rice harvest index fell to 74 after heavy summer rains and typhoons, this year's crop is expected to produce an excess of 1.4m tonnes above projected consumption. However, this is not entirely good news: the agriculture ministry is struggling to rid itself of foreign grains left over from this year's emergency imports. Last year's poor harvest caused a shortage of Japanese rice in February, triggering panic buying among consumers. More than 1m tonnes of Thai and Chinese long grain rice, which is unpopular with consumers, are said to be held in the warehouses of wholesalers and the government. Some retailers, unable to sell the foreign rice, have been dumping it in bagfuls in unused fields, and one Buddhist temple in central Japan has become famous for the many people who come there to feed the pigeons with long grain rice. The surplus is expected to remain for several years. In the wake of last year's poor harvest, the government eased the rice-reduction policy established in 1971 to prevent an oversupply. As a result, farmers who were forced to turn their paddies into vegetable and fruit fields have resumed growing rice. Another headache for the ministry is the partial opening of the domestic rice market next year under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The government will allow imports of up to 4 per cent, or 400,000 tonnes, of the market; this will be raised gradually to 8 per cent over six years. Moreover, farmers in rice-exporting countries, including the US and Australia, which supplied the 2.6m tonnes of emergency imports, are demanding that Japan import the same amount from this year's harvest. To add to the confusion, the government is trying to revamp the regulated distribution system by relying more on market forces. Earlier this month, an advisory council to the ministry proposed that the Staple Food Control Act be reviewed for the first time in 52 years. While this is expected to provide consumers with cheaper rice, it could also mean that inefficient rice farmers and wholesalers will be forced out of business. The good news for the government stemming from the rice saga may be the Y155.2bn (Pounds 1.01bn) in profits made by its food agency from selling foreign rice to distributors at three times the import price. The government says the profits will be given in subsidies to farmers suffering from last year's poor harvest.</p>

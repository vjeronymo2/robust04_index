			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 16 (CNA) -- Taiwan's crude steel  production lagged behind South Korea's in 1993, the Council for  Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) reported Saturday [16  April].    However, Taiwan's steel consumption topped that of South  Korea, CEPD officials noted.    The officials said South Korea was the world's sixth largest  crude steel producer in 1993, with an output of more than 33  million tons. Taiwan ranked 15th with 12 million tons, they  said.    Both countries completed the establishment of state-run  steel  mills in the mid-1970s, they pointed out.    In terms of per capita crude steel consumption, Taiwan  consumed an average of 916 kilograms in 1993, compared to South  Korea's 643 kilograms, they said.    Moreover, they pointed out, South Korea exported 50 percent  of its crude steel output, while the ratio in Taiwan was below  10 percent.    They attributed Taiwan's strong demand for crude steel to  the  ongoing six-year national development plan.</p>

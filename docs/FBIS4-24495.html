			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- A ranking government  official said on Friday [27 May] that cultural exchanges between  Taiwan and Mainland China, frozen after the Qiandao Lake  murders, may resume next month.    Su Chi, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),  told a seminar that MAC will hold a meeting in June to discuss  the resumption of cultural exchanges with the mainland.    Earlier this month, the cabinet-level MAC put a hold on cash  it had planned to use to finance cultural and educational  exchanges with the mainland to protest Beijing's callous  handling of the Qiandao Lake crime.    Twenty-four Taiwan tourists, along with two mainland guides  and six crewmembers, were robbed and killed on the lower deck of  a pleasure boat ferrying them across the scenic lake in Zhejiang  Province, eastern China, on March 31.    Beijing denied that the killings took place and did not make  any arrests until Taiwan threatened to comprehensively review  the existing ties between the two sides.    The mainland security authorities have charged three and  arrested a fourth suspect in the mass murder. The move, however  failed to thaw the frozen ties as many questions surrounding the  deaths remain.    "The distrust and psychological trauma that have been  brought  to the general public is most worrying for long term relations,"  Su warned.    "To narrow the widening cultural and social differences,  special efforts from both sides are needed ... and cultural  exchanges, among others, are believed to be the most effective  remedy," Su said.    The Government of the Republic of China [ROC] in 1987 lifted  its decades-old ban on visits to the mainland by Taiwan  residents for family reunions. Since then millions of local  people have visited the mainland.</p>

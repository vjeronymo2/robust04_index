			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Eastern promises HSBC Holdings' 19.8 per cent net return on shareholders' funds makes it look a paragon of virtue compared with other UK banks. The figure exceeds the targets that many banks simply dream about. Yet, despite the prominence accorded to this measure of performance in yesterday's interim figures, it is not a reliable guide to how the bank is doing. For a start, any bank with a large business in a relatively high-inflation centre such as Hong Kong should expect a high return on capital. HSBC benefits from abnormally low provisions, thanks partly to the large release of earlier provisions by Marine Midland. Midland Bank's tax losses also make for an unusually low tax rate. The first half compares with a period when HSBC did not own Midland and had large provisions on its exposure to Olympia &amp; York. Exchange rates were also markedly different then. So the underlying picture is all the harder to discern. Satisfactory, but not outstanding, appears to be the prosaic truth. Certainly Chinese retrenchment suggests doubts about the growth prospects in Hong Kong. HSBC itself admits it needs to restrain mortgage lending there. While there appears no imminent risk of higher interest rates, HSBC could face a rapid increase in bad debt provisions if any shocks emerged. First-half bad debt provisions totalled only Pounds 50m in the Asia Pacific region where group assets are Pounds 66bn. HSBC must hope that declining provisions at Midland Bank would compensate if good times in Asia come to an end. It would be pushed to offset any profits shortfall with another large increase in dealing profits. More generally, HSBC is much closer to the peak of its earnings cycle than the typical UK clearer. Its 2.6 per cent operating return on risk assets is nothing out of the ordinary, comparing with 2.5 per cent at Barclays and 2.7 per cent at Lloyds. There does not seem to be much reason for the shares to out-perform the sector.</p>

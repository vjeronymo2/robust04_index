			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Tangled nets in Europe THE NEW French government will quickly have to bring France's unruly fishermen to heel. International disputes, particularly between neighbours, cannot be solved by such unacceptable behaviour as the seizure of ships and the abduction of naval officers. The malaise of the European fishing industry is much wider than the French fishermen seem to realise. The target of their wrath, cheap imports not only from the UK but particularly from Russia, coupled with demands to ban trade, is misplaced. The underlying problem is that too many fishermen are chasing too few fish. This structural problem has merely been exposed by the recent collapse in fish prices, more the result of the recession than Russian imports. Banning imports would both harm EC consumers, 30 per cent of whose fish comes from outside the Community, and divert attention from the underlying problem. The industry's plight is largely the result of advances in technology. Fishing has become an industrialised business, using electronic gadgetry, powerful motors and giant nets. These allow whole schools of fish to be targeted and then scooped out of the sea. But governments have not been willing to face up to the impact such leaps in productivity have on the numbers of people who can be fruitfully employed in the industry. Instead, they have tried to put off the day of reckoning by handing out subsidies. The result has not only been a waste of taxpayers' money but the dissipation of the sea's wealth through overfishing. The more intensively the sea is fished, the fewer fish can be caught because stocks cannot be replenished quickly enough. This is why North Sea stocks of cod and haddock fell by 83 per cent in the 20 years to 1990. The EC is belatedly trying to stop the rot. It has agreed a four-year plan to cut the Community's fishing fleet by 8 per cent, by paying for some boats to be decommissioned and requiring others to be tied up in port for up to six months. While some action is better than none, the plan is woefully inadequate given that scientists estimate that the fleet's capacity should be cut by 40 per cent. The problem is that the sea has traditionally been seen as a common resource exploitable by all. Fishermen therefore have an incentive to fish as intensively as possible, although this is contrary to their collective interest. The allocation of tradeable fishing rights to individual fishermen offers a possible solution. Such an approach, which has been tried in Australia and New Zealand, curbs overfishing and boosts fishermen's incomes. Those leaving the industry also receive compensation, because they can sell their rights to those who remain. However, moving to such a system in Europe would be complicated by the Common Fisheries Policy. Under this, the European sea is divided into zones. In each zone, an annual limit is set for the total allowable catch for each species of fish, which is then split into national quotas. Quotas are determined by wrangling in the Council of Ministers with policing left to member states. The result is a European fish map even more balkanised than that proposed for Bosnia. Widespread cheating on quotas has bred mistrust, so undermining the chances of effective collective action. But governments have little incentive to cut back overfishing unless others do the same. However, the difficulty of creating a more rational system is no excuse for not trying. As a first step, member states should allow the Commission to oversee policing so that individual nations have confidence that others are not cheating. Introducing satellite technology would make this policing effort more effective. As a second step, there should be a more ambitious scheme to buy fishermen out of the industry. This would cost large sums of money. But the money could be recouped if those remaining in the industry were sold tradeable fishing rights once the market was brought back into balance. By increasing the sea's natural wealth, such an approach would benefit taxpayers, consumers and fishermen.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWEEPS TARGET GANGS, DRUNKS AND 'JOHNS'  </P> <P> Los Angeles law enforcement agencies conducted three crime sweeps this weekend  targeting gang members, drunk drivers and men who solicit acts of prostitution.  </P> <P> Gang-related shootings continued, despite more than 285 arrests by the police  task force called "Operation Hammer." Although 216 suspected gang members were  arrested, four separate gang shootings accounted for six gunshot wound victims  this weekend, police said.  </P> <P> The task force, introduced by police Chief Daryl F. Gates last year, has been  conducting periodic sweeps on weekends in areas where gangs have been most  active. The latest shooting occurred early Sunday just hours after the  Operation Hammer task force ceased its operation.  </P> <P> An unidentified man was wounded in the head in a gang-related drive-by shooting  in the El Sereno area east of downtown, Hollenbeck Division Sgt. George Spitzer  said. The victim was standing near Edison Street and Monterey Road at about  5:30 a.m. when he was hit, Spitzer said. The man, whose name was not released,  was treated at the scene by paramedics.  </P> <P> Anonymous witnesses reported the gunman's license plate number and about an  hour later police arrested a suspect at Mission Road and Valley Boulevard and  recovered the gun allegedly used in the shooting, Spitzer said. The suspect's  name was not available, police said.  </P> <P> In another weekend sweep, about 70 Los Angeles police and California Highway  Patrol officers arrested more than 200 suspected drunk drivers in the downtown  area and surrounding streets, Central Traffic Division Lt. Dan Hills said  Sunday.  </P> <P> Arrestees were processed through the Police Department's Immediate Booking and  Release System, which allows officers to quickly return to patrol duties after  detaining suspects. Arrestees with no outstanding warrants are held in two  mobile buses that serve as temporary holding tanks until they are picked up by  relatives.  </P> <P> In a third task force effort, 24 men were arrested Friday night and early  Saturday for soliciting acts of prostitution on 7th Street between San Pedro  Street and Central Avenue.  </P> <P> The Newton Division "Trick" Task Force concentrated on arresting the male  customers of prostitutes. The sting operation included six female police  officers who stood on the sidewalk and -- without provocation, police said --  got solicitations from men in cars and pedestrians, authorities said.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The harvester's goal should be to bring the fish to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> internal temperature of 40  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (4.4  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) or below as soon as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible after the fish dies to minimize the risk of histamine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production. Cooling fish below 59  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (15  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C), and preferably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below 50  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (10  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C), greatly reduces the growth of populations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the bacteria that are most likely to cause histamine formation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 7, p. 95). Once bacterial growth has begun, temperature at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or below 41  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (5  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) halts bacterial growth, although enzymatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> histamine formation may slowly continue (Ref. 7, p. 95).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, in proposed Appendix B, section 3.a.1., the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is recommending a slightly lower flesh temperature of 40  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (4.4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) or below. This temperature is consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations of safe temperatures in other sections of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulation. Nonetheless, FDA specifically invites  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on the appropriateness of this temperature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix B, section 3.a.1. recommends that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time/temperature history from the vessel be on a lot-by-lot basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and defines a lot as a discrete storage compartment on the vessel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in keeping with industry practice. A lot typically reflects a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day's catch. Because a boat's catch can be subject to varying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions and treatment from day-to-day, the time/temperature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records should be specific to each lot.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the time/temperature records suggest that, for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular lot, the conditions on the vessel were likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause, or significantly contribute to, the formation of histamine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the fish, or if no adequate time/temperature records exist for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that lot, the guideline provides that a representative sample of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fish from the lot be analyzed for histamine Appendix B, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.a.2.ii.B.). The samples should be collected on a statistically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valid sample schedule because variations in time/temperature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abuse are likely at various points in a ship's hold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second control, organoleptic examination by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor for decomposition, should be performed regardless of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what the time/temperature records show (Appendix B, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.a.2.). First, decomposition is a form of adulteration under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 403(a)(3) of the act. Second, as indicated earlier, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organoleptic examination provides a screening mechanism for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual fish. It is possible for the conditions on the vessel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be good but for some fish to develop decomposition anyway.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, also as stated earlier, an examination for decomposition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides a way to verify the time/temperature records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA recognizes that an organoleptic examination of each fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be highly impractical. Consequently, the guideline calls for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an examination of a representative number of fish to achieve a 95  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent certainty that the total number of fish in the lot that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhibit decomposition does not exceed 2.5 percent. (The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significance of 2.5 percent is addressed in the preamble  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion of Appendix B, section 3. a.2.iii. and a.2.iv.) Using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this approach, the number of fish examined will be reasonably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> close to the total number of fish, so that the goal of screening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual fish is preserved to the maximum extent practicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, FDA expects that this representative sample will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large enough so as to provide a sufficient verification of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time/temperature records for the entire lot.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix B, section 3.a.2.i. provides that no fish flesh  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that exhibits any organoleptically detectable decomposition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be used for food. Aside from the clear violation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 402(a)(3) of the act presented by such decomposition, the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health risk presented by decomposition in scombrotoxin forming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species is unacceptable. While the existence of decomposition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not mean that scombrotoxin is present, it does mean that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process has begun that can lead to the presence of scombrotoxin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over the shelf life of the fish or fishery product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In some instances, e.g., large fish such as tuna, isolated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parts of the fish will exhibit decomposition but other parts will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be free of decomposition. FDA recognizes that it is possible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remove those parts of a fish that have decomposition and salvage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the remainder. Appendix B, section 3.a.2.i. provides for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reconditioning so long as a histamine examination is performed on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the flesh that is free of decomposition. FDA believes that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> histamine test is prudent under such circumstances to verify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scombrotoxin forming processes are not at work in that flesh.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The guideline also provides for how the processor should use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organoleptic examination and time/temperature records in tandem  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine whether fish or fishery products from scombroid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forming species are fit for further processing or should first be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to a histamine examination. If no decomposition is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found, and the time/temperature records show that conditions on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the vessel were unlikely to cause, or significantly contribute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to, the formation of histamine in the fish, all the fish from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that lot may be further processed or directly entered into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commerce (Appendix B, section 3.a.2.ii.). If, as stated earlier,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time/temperature records are inadequate or indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions that could cause histamine, the processor should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> always conduct a histamine analysis on a representative sample  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regardless of the decomposition findings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

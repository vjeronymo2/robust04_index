			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Arts: Nikolayeva plays Bach - Recital In four recitals in the Wigmore Hall this week Tatyana Nikolayeva is playing Bach's 48 Preludes and Fugues, The Well-Tempered Klavier. It is a leisurely progress - each book shared between two evenings - but Nikolayeva's burgeoning following (all seats sold well in advance) hangs on every note. Her current popularity is difficult to explain; there is a whole cadre of pianists from the former Soviet Union who are now making new careers in the West, but only Nikolayeva has caught the imagination, even raising comparisons (surely exaggerated) with her approximate contemporaries Emil Gilels and Sviatoslav Richter. Meanwhile Nikolayeva continues to play Bach just as doubtless she has for the best part of 50 years. There is a take-it-or-leave-it integrity about its plainess, with little obvious attempt at interpretation. The occasional bout of point-making, an unexpected accent or a quickening in the middle of a movement, seemed more the result of a change of focus than an element in a carefully pre-planned scheme, just as phrases sometimes lost their purpose as if Nikolayeva's concentration had wavered momentarily. Perhaps it is the lack of adornment in her approach that seems so attractive; maybe for the post-modern sensibility simplicity equals spirituality, and the same record buyers who eagerly snap up Nikolayeva's recordings are also those who consume the works of Gorecki and Tavener. Her playing seems fresh because she offers nothing new, just old-fashioned reassurance. There are no frills, and no thrills either - Nikolayeva offers neither the technique fastidiousness nor the interpretative insights of, say, Richter or Glenn Gould, the finest Bach pianists of our age; a fan would describe her piano tone as richly mellow, an agnostic might find it monochrome and dull. Yet she certainly projects an intellectual honesty; whether that in itself will be enough to ensure it survives is the big question. Wigmore Hall; further recitals tonight and tomorrow</p>

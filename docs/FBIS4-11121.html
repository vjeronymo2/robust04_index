			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 20 Apr (EFE) -- Chilean President Eduardo  Frei today compared the return to democracy in Chile and the  Czech Republic -- which took place simultaneously and in a  civilized manner, free of any bloodshed.    Frei said this during a dinner party to fete Czech Prime  Minister Vaclav Klaus who arrived from Buenos Aires today for a  three-day official visit to Chile.    Frei said that the Chilean and Czech Governments "uphold  broad respect for human rights and fully enforce the multiparty  system."    The Chilean chief of state pointed out that "both countries  enjoy a similar degree of development and uphold the  effectiveness of an open international trade which is not  discriminatory. They are against restrictions that prevent it  from being clear."    Frei added: "In the four years since March 1990, Chile and  the Czech Republic have come closer on several issues and have  made efforts to build solid and fruitful relations."    Chile and the former Czechoslovakia resumed diplomatic  relations at the ambassadorial level on 11 March 1990, when  Patricio Aylwin's civilian administration assumed power, ending  almost 17 years of General Augusto Pinochet's military regime.    Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus will meet with Chilean public  and  private sector officials and will end his visit to Santiago on  22 April with the signing of a broad cooperation agreement in  the areas of culture, education, and science.</p>

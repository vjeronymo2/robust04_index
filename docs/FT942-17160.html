			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Australia Air splutters on the runway - A look at the international airline's struggle to launch a service to China Will Australia Air International, the fledgling carrier which a year ago won the rights to fly between Australia and China, ever take to the skies? As Australia's first - and only - start-up company to be given an entree into the international aviation market, its progress is being monitored closely by the business community and politicians alike. It is now over two years ago since Mr Bob Collins, then federal minister for transport, heralded a 'new era' in Australian aviation, committing his country to a competitive, deregulated system on both domestic and international fronts. The domestic experience was quickly soured by the failure of Compass, the only entrant to attempt a new nationwide operation. It went out of business in March 1993, leaving Ansett and Qantas (which acquired Australian Airlines) with a duopoly. But now the focus has switched to the international arena. Here, the liberalised regime envisaged that a newly-formed International Air Services Commission (IASC) would distribute future international aviation rights among existing and new operators, effectively ending Qantas' long-standing monopoly on non-domestic services. It was as a result of this process that Australia Air, which occupies offices in a Sydney suburb and is owned by Mr Colin Hendrick, a local businessman, picked up the China rights in March 1993. Its initial plans sounded encouraging - a weekly China service, linking Beijing and Sydney, to begin last autumn. But Australia Air is still spluttering on the runway. In theory, the China rights are attractive. There is only one carrier, Air China, which flies directly between the two countries. Yet, according to Australia Air, some 75,000 Australian tourists visited China last year and business links between the two countries are expanding rapidly. Direct flights, rather ones which involve a stopover in Hong Kong, ought to find a market. Australia Air claims that the first hiccup came when it discovered that Qantas was still the 'designated' carrier under the Sino-Australian air services agreement. The larger airline flew the route in the mid-1980s but had pulled out of the market in 1987. A spat then developed over how many designated carriers could exist on the Australia-China route, which was only sorted out in November. 'Obviously, it took longer than anyone had anticipated,' admits the IASC. Hiccup number two was, and to a large extent still is, money. In its initial application, Australia Air envisaged backing of around ADollars 55m (USDollars 27m). However, attempts to raise this sum outside Australia - and to interest US investment banks - have failed. Belatedly, the would-be carrier has considered the possibility of a stock market flotation, and called in County NatWest and Turnbull &amp; Partners as advisers. The viability of this plan has yet to be tested. In recent releases, Australia Air has given the impression that the float is already underwritten. However, County says that while there are some conditional arrangements in place, it would not enter a formal underwriting agreement until it had a fair idea of the likely sub-underwriting commitments. It is still testing the waters. In the meantime, the IASC is demanding to see the colour of Australia Air's money before it will let the carrier take off. An attempt to persuade the IASC to allow the airline to start operating on the back of underwriters' commitments failed. Instead, the IASC stipulated that Australia Air should have at least ADollars 28.87m in the bank, and the remainder of the ADollars 55m potentially available through calls on partly-paid shares. This has prompted Australia Air to plead for more time, and the IASC has provisionally approved a three-month extension, meaning that the float must be completed by end-June. In the meantime, the operational side seems to be more straightforward, although the initial arrangements depend heavily on sub-contractors. Australia Air says that it would lease a Boeing 747, complete with crew, from New York-based Tower Air, with Cathay Pacific responsible for catering and Qantas for ground-handling, aircraft maintainance and staff training. Many observers think that Qantas is embarrassed by the loss of the rights, and is scurrying to reclaim some ground through such deals. It opposed the recent IASC extension, offering to pick up the rights if Australia Air failed to meet the end-March deadline. In justification of the IASC's role to date, officials point out that it has managed to push some significant international rights in Ansett's direction, especially in the Asian region. But the domestic duopoly situation seems all too likely to rule in the international arena as well. And that does not quite equate to the competitive situation everyone hoped for.</p>

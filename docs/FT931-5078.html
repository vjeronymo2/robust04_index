			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Surge in confidence among UK directors, IoD reports FURTHER evidence that the economy may be slowly emerging from recession comes today from the Institute of Directors, which reports a surge in confidence in Britain's boardrooms. The IoD survey conducted among 305 directors - more than half of them chairmen and managing directors - follows a concerted weekend effort led by Mr John Major, the prime minister, to boost confidence that economic recovery is under way. The feeling among ministers that recovery has begun has strengthened their conviction that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will announce in next week's Budget a rise in personal taxation. Speculation is growing that Mr Lamont will unveil a phased package of increases including curbs on income tax allowances for the higher paid and an extension of value added tax. A staged move to restrict personal and other income tax allowances to the basic rate of tax would eventually raise several billion pounds. Mr Lamont's colleagues also expect domestic fuel and some other zero-rated goods and services to be included in the value added tax net. The more optimistic economic outlook is helped by fresh signs of a boost to exports following sterling's devaluation after its suspension from the European exchange rate mechanism. British construction steel manufacturers are reporting a 15-fold increase in invitations from foreign customers to bid for work, with firm orders now starting to flow through. Separately, the Confederation of British Industry claims there has been a continuing fall in unit labour costs which should help manufacturing competitiveness. Last week, the housebuilding industry reported a rise of one-fifth in the sale of new homes during the first eight weeks of 1993, while figures for new car registrations suggested that a revival in the car market is gathering momentum. The IoD says that over half the directors asked in January and February were more optimistic than in December about the economic outlook for 1993, compared with 10 per cent in October. Directors are even more buoyant about prospects for their own businesses, with 60 per cent expecting an improvement in trading. But the IoD warns that, unless consumer confidence also rises, economic recovery will remain weak and fragile. Most companies do not expect that an upturn in business will reduce unemployment over the next six months but only 10 per cent believe that their workforces will be cut further. Despite rising business volumes, profit levels remain squeezed, with companies unable to pass on increased costs to customers.

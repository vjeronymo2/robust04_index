			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yegor Gaydar, leader of Russia's Choice, by </F> Mikhail Gurevich: "Yegor Gaydar: `The Period of Reform From  Above Has Ended'" -- place and date not given]    [Text] [Gurevich] At present we have a new political  landscape. A president who is ever more trying to play the role  of supreme arbiter, "the father of the nation." A government in  which the "practicalists" [praktiki] have effectively  overpowered the "marketeers." A parliament that is still  divided into several parts: the even firmer democrats and the  even more rabid "reds and browns." What next?    [Gaydar] It is easier for me to talk about the main, pivotal  line in economic policy, which will be taking shape in the next  few months, not about the movement of figures. I do not believe  very much in the apocalyptic forecasts predicting an immediate  economic catastrophe resulting from the new government's  actions. I still believe it will have enough common sense not  to do what sectoral lobbyists demand. It seems to me more  likely that the government, under pressure from conflicting  interests, will pursue a policy of half-measures, half-steps,  first stepping up the inflationary process, then putting the  brakes on somewhat. Inflation will be fairly high -- 20 to 25  percent a month -- and people, realizing the essence of  inflationary taxation, will start adapting themselves to the  conditions of inflation, while the process of declining actual  money supply will naturally continue.    [Gurevich] That is to say, instead of an ineluctable, speedy  catastrophe you forecast a prolonged agony that may just as well  result in a catastrophe, which this time may break out by the  next presidential elections.    [Gaydar] This development of events may, of course,  assuredly paralyze Russia's chances of economic growth. If  someone in fact sincerely believes in the existence of  nonmonetary methods of combating inflation...    If there is readiness to exchange the well-being of one's  own  citizens for an expansion of the sphere of Russia's imperial  influence, one may get mixed up in ill-conceived currency unions  -- why not? But I am certain that only an economically stable  Russia with a strong currency could be a point of attraction for  its neighbors.    [Gurevich] I have also heard another version of your  resignation: It was a combination thought out together with the  president and designed to bring down Chernomyrdin in the end.    [Gaydar] It's like Tolstoy wrote [in "War and Peace"]: the  first column is marching, the second column is marching...    [Gurevich] Do you plan to focus on working at the State Duma  now?    [Gaydar] I am a leader of the "Russia's Choice"  parliamentary  faction, and I will use this position to defend policies of  which I am confident. Presently the actual leverage of  authority is, of course, held by the government. A compromise  situation where both lines of economic development coexisted  within one government is a thing of the past. Society will be  fully able to assess the results of its work.    [Gurevich] The trial-and-error method in this situation is a  cruel experiment.    [Gaydar] The reason I resigned was precisely because  certainty in terms of responsibility is also an insurance. The  period of reform from above in Russia has ended; further  movement will be determined by the initiative and pressure from  the bottom up.    [Gurevich] Back to the State Duma: Some people are leaving  your faction.    [Gaydar] I think this is natural. The situation has  changed; a faction that was seen by many people as a government  faction is no longer such, the political landscape has changed.  I do not see any tragedy in the fact that some people have  decided that working in other groups would be more advisable.  An overwhelming majority of the faction members, however, are  unanimous in their commitment to the program principles of  "Russia's Choice."    [Gurevich] Rumors have been circulating about Gennadiy  Burbulis' leaving your faction; he is still a prominent figure...    [Gaydar] Gennadiy Eduardovich has not said anything about  his intention to go over to another faction.    [Gurevich] Is the president still accessible to you and  people who share your views? For it turned out that he did not  even know that he was scheduled to meet with Fedorov on Monday.    [Gaydar] I know that the president wants reform to continue,  that he takes it close to heart. In many instances he supported  us in resolving very difficult and contentious questions. The  president works within the limits of reality, though -- he is  not a tsar, not our Lord, not even a general secretary. He  should heed the balance of forces in society, think about  stability.</p>

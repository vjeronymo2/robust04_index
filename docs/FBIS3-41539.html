Cui Tiankai, a Chinese delegate to the UN Second Committee  (Economic and Financial), told the committee that the Rio  Declaration and Agenda 21 adopted by UNCED are milestones, but  the consensus reached in Rio de Janeiro last year has yet to be  translated into action.    ``In spite of the numerous efforts made by the international  community in the follow-up of UNCED,'' Cui said, ``they fall far  short of the requirements for the effective implementation of  the various decisions of UNCED.''    He said that the developed countries should fulfill their  commitment and take practical actions by strengthening official  development assistance and creating a favorable international  economic environment for the economic growth of the developing  countries.    The developed countries should also provide them with new  and  additional financial resources for environmental protection and  transfer to them on favorable terms environmentally-sound  technologies, said the Chinese delegate.    He noted that the level of official development assistance  from the developed countries has stagnated and in some cases  even declined in recent years.    This has rendered more elusive the prospects for reaching  the  targets on financial resources and the transfer of technology as  set by the Rio Conference, he added.    ``Failure to reverse this trend is bound to erode the Rio  consensus and reduce the agreements reached at the conference to  a mere scrap of paper,'' he said.    Cui said the relevant UN working groups to be set up by the  commission on sustainable development should conduct in-depth  studies on the developing countries' needs for funds and  technology.    These groups should also identify the obstacles to the  access  of the developing countries to funds and the transfer of  technology, and come up with viable recommendations on how to  overcome those obstacles.    He called on the parties concerned to reach an appropriate  agreement on the restructuring and replenishment of the global  environment facility so that necessary conditions can be created  for the facility to play its expected role in the followup of  UNCED.</p>

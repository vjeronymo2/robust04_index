Tun Mustapha, 75,  smarting from the rejection of his leadership by his former  associates in the United Malays National Organization (UMNO),  quit as federal cabinet minister and UMNO member two weeks ago.  Although he then announced his intention to retire from  politics, his supporters here say that Bapak Tun (Father Tun),  as he is popularly known will make it clear on his return that  he wants Sabahans to reject the NF in state polls on February 18  and 19.    His followers are planning a hero's welcome for him to rival  the large crowds which met Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir  Mohamed on his visit here on Monday. They plan to put up  pictures of Tun Mustapha and Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Joseph  Pairin Kitingar from the airport to Tun Mustapha's nearby  Tanjung Aru house.    The intention is to send a message to Sabahans that Tun  Mustapha, still revered by sections of the state's Muslim  population, gives his blessings to Datuk Kitlngan's Parti  Bersatu Sabah [PBS or Sabah United Party], which is seeking a  fourth term in office against the might of Dr. Mahathir's NF.    Many Sabahans believe Tun Mustapha still retains  considerable  influence and could make the difference in marginal  constituencies where UMNO is challenging the PBS. His alliance  with Datuk Kitingan, his followers believe, will dispel the  long-held suspicions of his supporters against the PBS which is  fielding three of Tun Mustapha's sons in the elections.    Tun Mustapha and Datuk Kitingan were once bitter enemies but  according to one senior civil servant here, who is familiar with  Sabah politics, people would not be surprised if the two teamed  up. "In Sabah, more so than anywhere else, there are no  permanent enemies and no permanent friends in politics," he  said. Even Dr. Mahathir alluded to this in his parting news  conference yesterday when he was asked to comment on whether he  trusted one of the NF's staunchesl critics, former Deputy Chief  Minister Datuk Yong Teck Lee. Datuk Yong quit the PBS two weeks  ago to form a new party, the Sabah Progressive Party, which Dr.  Mahathir accepted into the coalition yesterday.    Dr. Mahathir replied: "In politics, sometimes we fight,  sometimes we make friends. Today, we have one opinion,  tomorrow, we change to another."</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fowler attacks Polly administrator over party cash SIR NORMAN Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, last night attacked Touche Ross, the Polly Peck administrator, for taking 18 months to reply to the party's letter giving details of donations received from companies associated with Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman. As the government rejected a Labour assault on 'sleaze and corruption' in the party's funding, Sir Norman hoped the accountants would now 'start dealing with us and will not seek to pursue this through the newspapers.' The party confirmed last night Touche had asked for the return of the Pounds 440,000 donated by Mr Nadir's companies, but said the approach contained no evidence the funds had been stolen. The party is to consult its lawyers before replying. It has pledged to return the money if it can be proved it has been stolen. This latest twist to the saga came as the Tories maintained in the Commons that financial support for political parties should be left on a voluntary basis and not made a compulsory burden on the taxpayer. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, told MPs that Labour's hidden agenda in the row over Conservative finances was to get its 'paws' on the public purse by forcing the introduction of state funding for political parties. Labour's financial 'crisis' had left it eager for the taxpayer to 'bail out their sinking ship', he said. Both Mr Hunt and Sir Norman attacked Mrs Margaret Beckett, the Labour party deputy leader, for choosing to lace her opening speech with 'rumour' and 'innuendo'. It was a 'shabby, irresponsible, miserable' speech of which he thought Mrs Beckett would one day be ashamed, Mr Hunt said. Mrs Beckett repeatedly sparked pandemonium on the Tory backbenches with the forthrightness of her allusions to recent reports about the alleged trading of contributions for honours and the extent to which the Conservative party is funded by undisclosed or foreign donations. For as long as the Conservative party would not reveal where it got 'more than 50 per cent' of its money from, Mrs Beckett said, the suspicion would exist that the damage that would be done if voters found out must be 'even worse' than the damage being in-flicted at the moment. While Mr Hunt attacked Labour's links with the trade unions, Mrs Beckett maintained that the 'heart of the matter' was that a wide range of allegations could be made because of the 'secrecy' that surrounded Tory party accounts. She said that the Hartley Investment Trust - the company which had given the largest ever recorded donation to the Conservative party - had broken the law by twice failing to file its annual accounts on time. Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the powerful Tory 1922 committee of Tory backbench MPs, was a director of the company, she said. After the debate ended amid a noisy storm of accusations and counter-accusations, a Labour motion expressing concern at Mr Nadir's donations and urging the government to begin proceedings against companies making undeclared political donations was defeated by 291 votes to 250, a government majority of 41.</p>

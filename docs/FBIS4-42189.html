			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "EU Support to </F> Ukraine for Closure of Chernobyl Must Be Part of Global G-7  Action"]    [Text] The General Affairs Council decided that the  European Union [EU] would attend the G-7 summit in Naples (8-10  July) with a clear concept of assistance to Ukraine in the  energy sector. This Community initiative aims to ensure the  equitable international sharing of the financial burden  represented by the closure of the Chernobyl power station and  the parallel construction of (two) new nuclear power plants.  The EU acknowledges that the problem of the closure of the  Chernobyl station is a top priority from the standpoint of  closer relations with Ukraine and that the question of this  republic's energy supply also deserves to be considered at the  earliest opportunity. It is in this spirit that the Commission  has suggested that the EU, as part of an internationally  coordinated effort:     -  Aid Ukraine to finalize the  construction in progress of two new power stations, as long as  Kiev agrees to eventually shut down Chernobyl;    -  Accept, given  Kiev's point of view that Chernobyl cannot be closed before  other new stations are operational, that the TACIS [Technical  Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States] programme  help finance essential safety improvements and the subsequent  closure operations;    -  Agree to take over part of the construction  cost of new stations in the form of a EURATOM [European Atomic  Energy Community] loan, Ukraine being eligible to receive such  loans following the Council decision of 21 March. According to  the Commission, funding possibilities by this means currently  total a little more than ECU1 billion (for all the Member States  and third countries). The work of the Committee of Permanent  Representatives resulted in the following guidelines, which were  subsequently confirmed by the Council:     (a) more comprehensive study is still essential in order to  evaluate the extent of the financing needed for the closure of  Chernobyl and the scope and urgency of Ukraine's energy supply  needs. In this regard, several Member States highlight the need  for this country to adopt a global energy strategy;    (b) with regard to principles, several Member States are of  the view that, instead of favouring the construction of new  power plants, it would be better to encourage Ukraine to develop  the rational use of energy and alternative energy sources. This  point of view is not shared in full by the Commission, which,  based on Kiev's view that this construction is imperative due to  the urgency of ensuring the country's energy autonomy, considers  that it would be unrealistic to envisage short-term solutions in  another direction, which could also call into question the very  objective of the shutdown of Chernobyl;    (c) with regard to the possible financing of new power  stations through a EURATOM loan, the Twelve consider that it is  vital to examine whether the financial conditions for the use of  such a loan (risk, guarantees, etc.) are acceptable, keeping in  mind that, due to the amounts involved, an important part of the  available funding would thus be mobilized for Ukraine alone.  Moreover, Coreper [Committee of Permanent Representatices of  the Council] has pointed out that if the EC decides to launch a  new international initiative and to use the EURATOM loan in this  context, the loan would involve high amounts and would imply a  corresponding guarantee provision in the Community budget;    (d) since this matter involves TACIS financing of safety  improvements and of the subsequent closure of Chernobyl, Coreper  has voiced doubts about the sufficiency of available funds for  this purpose. Moreover, the question of the applicability of  TACIS regulations has also been raised, as some Member States  have pointed out that it would be advisable for TACIS to  contribute to the building of a "sarcophagus" and the supply of  equipment. The idea of intervention by the EBRD [European Bank  for Reconstruction and Development] Nuclear Safety Fund was also  suggested. The problem of Chernobyl and Ukraine's energy supply  is fundamental but is only one aspect of the action envisaged by  the European Union in regard to this country. Also at issue are  the signing of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, the  eventual link between this signature and Ukraine's adherence to  the Nuclear Arms Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), as well as  specific support for Ukraine's agriculture.</p>

These actions show initial results in the form of a  preliminary cooling of the overheated economy and the beginning  of a readjustment of the overly confused finance and banking  order. Nevertheless, a fundamental turn around of the disarray  in the finance and banking order and laxity in finance and  banking discipline requires full reform of the economic system.  Specifically it requires pervasive reform of the finance and  banking system.  <H3>  I. Finance and Banking System Reform Holds an Extremely  Important Position in Overall Economic System Reform </H3>   China's economy has developed rapidly as a result of more  than a decade of reform and opening up to the outside world. The  economic system has also undergone profound changes, one  evidence of which is the increasingly important position and the  increasingly marked role of finance and banking in the overall  operation of the national economy. As the country's national  income distribution structure, national savings structure, and  investment and financing structure change, and as the degree of  commercialization, monetarization, and use of credit in the  economy became greater and greater, the finance and banking  sector has become the main channel for raising capital, for  financing, and for distributing funds in society. It has become  the main supplier of construction funds in society. Today, a  substantial percentage of funds invested in fixed assets  throughout society come from the finance and banking sector, and  more than 90 percent of enterprises' working capital comes from  the finance and banking sector. During the past several years,  the absolute figure increase in bank credit each year has  greatly exceeded fiscal expenditures for economic construction.  The finance and banking sector has made an outstanding  contribution to development of the national economy. At the same  time, finance and banking has become the main means of  regulating the movement of currency and capital (value). It has  become the most important hub for the country's macroeconomic  regulation and control. Through currency and credit policies,  and the use of both direct and indirect regulation and control  measures, including the scale of credit, relending, savings  reserve funds, interest rates, and exchange rates, the state has  regulated total social demand, has striven to keep the currency  stable, and has spurred coordinated development of the national  economy. One study shows that virtually all the economic  fluctuations of the economy during the past several years have  resulted from fiscal and financial policy regulation, and that  financial policy has played a more important role than fiscal  policy. One might say that after more than a decade of reform,  the position of accountant for plan and cashier for government  finance that the finance and banking system occupied under the  traditional system has changed fundamentally. Finance and  banking policy and its macroeconomic regulation and control  effect have become of greater and greater decisive importance.    It is because of reform that the importance of finance and  banking in the national economy has become greater and greater.  Therefore, the important position of finance and banking system  reform in overall economic system reform has increasingly  aroused a high degree of serious attention and widespread  concern. In many important ways, however, finance and banking  system reform has advanced with difficulty. This difficulty has  become a major impediment to progress in reform of  macromanagement and reform of the economy as a whole. Progress  in finance and banking system reform directly influences and  limits progress in overall economic system reform.    Truly, with the intensification of economic reform and  widening of the opening up to the outside world during the past  14 years, quite a few achievements have been made in financial  system reform. Today's finance and banking system has changed  quite markedly from the traditional system. A finance and  banking system has taken shape in which the Chinese People's  Bank plays the leading role, the national banks are the main  entities, and finance and banking institutions of various kinds  exist together, and in which the division of labor is  coordinated. A financial macroeconomic regulation and control  system has been preliminarily built that applies economic,  administrative, and legal means to control finance and banking.  Financial markets dominated by lending markets and national bond  markets have begun to form. Financial opening up to the outside  world is expanding steadily. Nevertheless, since finance and  banking cover a wide area, which makes for great difficulty in  reform, progress in reforming the financial system is still  fairly slow. Reform has yet to make real headway on some  pervasive and fundamental problems. The finance and banking  system is unable to meet needs for development of a socialist  market economy. This shows up mostly in the following ways: The  Chinese People's Bank has not yet become a true central bank.  Macroeconomic regulation and control of finance and banking is  feeble. China's specialized banks handle both routine commercial  business and transactions made for policy reasons. Thus, they  cannot become true finance and banking enterprises. The entire  banking system lacks competitiveness and vitality. Financial  markets lack standardization. Cutting up of markets and mutual  market blockading are serious problems. Effective supervision  and control are lacking. Financial regulation and control  methods, including the regulation and control of interest rates,  retain a strong administrative fiat coloration. These problems  impair implementation of national macroeconomic policies, and  they hamper the further intensification of economic reform and  healthy development of the national economy.    Therefore, acceleration of financial system reform, and  increasing the intensity of financial system reform in order to  spur broad and in-depth economic system reform have become  problems currently in need of urgent solution. But in what  direction should finance and banking system reform be  intensified? To meet the needs of a socialist market economy, as  well as to solve deep-seated problems in the country's finance  and banking realm, the basic goals of China's finance and  banking system reform should be as follows: 1) Amplification of  the basic functions of the Chinese People's Bank to build a  strong central bank regulation and control system that  independently executes monetary policy; 2) separation of  financing for policy reasons from financing of a commercial  nature to build a finance and banking system in which  state-owned commercial banks are the main entity, and various  kinds of finance and banking institutions exist at the same  time; 3) standardization of financial market operation to build  a financial market system that is uniformly open, has orderly  competition, and is strictly controlled; and 4) straightening  out of different interest rates to build a capital pricing  system founded on the central bank interest rate.  <H3>  II. Amplification of Chinese People's Bank's Basic Functions  To Build a Strong Central Bank Regulation and Control System  That Independently Executes Monetary Policy </H3>   As the nation's central bank, the Chinese People's Bank  should faithfully discharge its basic functions like central  banks elsewhere throughout the world. On the one hand, it should  independently draw up and execute (implement) monetary policy,  apply various means, control the currency supply, regulate  currency demand, guard against inflation, and maintain the  stability of the currency and the entire macroeconomy. On the  other hand, it should strictly control and supervise finance and  banking institutions, employing policies and laws to regularize  all finance and banking activities to ensure that finance and  banking institutions operate in a healthy and secure way.    Although the Chinese People's Bank nominally became  responsible in 1984 for performing the functions of a central  bank, it is still a very long way from meeting the standards and  requirements of a true central bank. This shows up prominently  in the following ways: First, the People's Bank continues to  engage in day-to-day financial activities such as handling  special loans for economic and technical development, loans for  the old, the young, and for people living in border regions or  impoverished areas, loans to assist the needy, and loans for  gold production. This often mires it in irksome routine currency  credit matters, which impedes completion of its basic functions.  Second, since the government also checks on the profitability of  the People's Bank, instituting a profit retention system for the  bank, the People's Bank and its branches and sub-branches are  strongly motivated to make a profit by running all kinds of  businesses that compete for profit with the "civilian sector."  Thus, the bank loses its detached position. Third, the Chinese  People's Bank is subject to too much administrative interference  from top to bottom. It lacks the independence it should have.  For example, the central government frequently overdraws and  borrows from the People's Bank. In particular, the strong  influence and interference of local governments at all levels on  People's Bank branches and sub-branches (that is, the so-called  "localization of central bank actions") seriously impair the  People's Bank's performance of its functions. Fourth, the  People's Bank's macroeconomic regulation and control mechanism  is deficient. It lacks effective means of regulation and  control. Fifth, the People's Bank lacks sufficient independence  in the drafting and execution of monetary policy. The twin goals  of "developing the economy and stabilizing the currency"  frequently mean that the People's Bank must passively meet the  needs of "economic development"; thus, it is unable to attain  the goal of "stabilizing the currency." (Examples include the  several bouts of inflation that have occurred during the past  more than a decade). Sixth, the People's Bank lacks effective  supervision and control over financial activities throughout the  country. This is also an important reason for the current  disarray in the financial order and the laxness of financial  discipline.    Therefore, the principal goal and task of Chinese finance  and  banking system reform is to make the People's Bank into a real  central bank in fact as well as in name, using this as a basis  for the founding of a strong central bank regulation and control  system that independently executes monetary policy. This being  the requirement, problems in the following several regards must  now be solved properly:    1. Draw up laws and regulations that clearly specify the  functions of the People's Bank to regulate its conduct. As the  authoritative institution for state financial control, the most  important task of the People's Bank is to carry out national  monetary policy, to control the issuance of currency, to  regulate currency supply, and to ensure implementation and  exercise of a uniform monetary policy throughout the country. As  the bank's bank, or the "ultimate lender," the People's Bank  should generally provide finance capital only for the head  offices of national commercial banks. It should not engage in  day-to-day financial business or business of a commercial  nature. As current agencies of the head office of the People's  Bank, branches and sub-branches at the provincial (or municipal  and autonomous region) level or below should no longer handle  the routine issuance of credit, or the scale of credit  readjustments. Instead, it should shift its work emphasis to  greater financial supervision and control, financial  investigation and statistical research, management of the  national treasury, affiliated bank settlement of accounts, and  foreign exchange control.    2. Straighten out relations between government finance and  the banks, putting an end to the correlation between fiscal  deficits and currency issuance to begin to build a macroeconomic  mechanism of mutual coordination and mutual checks and balances  between the People's Bank and public finance. Since the advent  of reform, disarray in the fiscal and financial systems, and the  mixing of fiscal and banking functions has been extremely  serious. This has shown up most prominently in a matter that has  already attracted notice, namely "forced nationalization of  credit funds" (such as huge government overdrafts on and loans  from the People's Bank, and the banks bearing responsibility for  disbursements that the government should make but does not make,  or compensation that the government should pay but does not pay.  It has also appeared in bank issuance of so-called  "stabilization and unity loans" and government initiative in  making government loans" (such as fiscal units' use of the  intermittent funds within budget and funds they control outside  of budget to set up government financial credit institutions and  to found various kinds of development corporations.  Alternatively, government directly invests in various local  corporations, or plays a direct role in financial activities  such as the buying and selling of negotiable securities, real  estate development, trusts, and leasing). The damage this causes  is rather severe. The main way to straighten out relations  between government finance and the People's Bank lies in  legislation that prohibits the government from borrowing or  overdrawing funds from the People's Bank, the government solving  its problem of a shortage of funds resulting from making  pay-outs before obtaining receipts through the issuance of  short-term government bonds. Government deficits must be made up  through the issuance of medium and long-term government bonds.  At the same time, the People's Bank should increase its  regulation and control of the basic money supply, and maintain a  high degree of funds liquidity. It should use the market  mechanism to take money out of and put money into circulation as  economic development places demands on the money supply. Yet  another point must be raised in connection with the relationship  between banks and government finance, and that is the need for  earliest possible elimination of the profit retention system and  the system for the surrender of tax receipts by the People's  Bank and its branches and sub-branches. A People's Bank  independent financial budgeting and control system should be set  up instead, all profits that the People's Bank realizes being  paid to the central government treasury, and all of its losses  being borne by the central government treasury.    3. Increase the independence of the central bank. The  central  bank independence issue is an issue of the relationship between  the central bank and the government. Because of differences in  economic development and the evolution of the central bank in  separate countries, the independence of the central bank in the  exercise of functions and powers is not the same in different  countries of the world today. In the United States, Germany, and  Sweden, the central bank is very independent. It is not  responsible to the government, but to the legislative body. Its  leaders are not members of the cabinet, and its policies are  generally free from government interference. In the United  Kingdom, Japan, and France, the central bank is subordinate to  the government; however, in the drafting and implementation of  financial policies, it maintains substantial independence. In  most of these countries, a fairly detached policymaking  organization is set up within the central bank. Examples include  the board of directors of the Bank of England, the policy  committee of the Bank of Japan, and the National Credit  Committee of the Bank of France. Why should the central bank be  largely independent? The main reason is that governments  generally have a pronounced short-term attitude. They frequently  place too much emphasis on short-term economic growth, attaching  more importance to it than to currency stability. If the central  bank is largely independent, it can avoid such a tilt,  effectively carry out monetary policy, and ensure currency and  price stability, thereby creating conditions for long-term,  stable economic growth. Generally, the countries in which the  central bank is largely independent are also the ones in which  the currency is stable and the economy is rather well-developed.  As the nation's central bank, the People's Bank should be  substantially independent. The government should ensure that the  People's Bank has the authority and the responsibility to  conduct an independent monetary policy. It should have the  authority to regulate currency circulation to ensure that the  basic stability of the renminbi. Under the present circumstances  in China, the People's Bank implementation of monetary policy  under leadership of the State Council helps bolster central bank  macroeconomic regulation and control for better and faster  development of the nation's economy. As China's market economy  develops, and as the central bank matures and improves,  practical experiences will have to be summarized and a decision  made on the basis of actual circumstances as to whether the  People's Bank's current subordination requires readjustment or  change. In addition, in order to avoid People's Bank branches  and sub-branches being subjected to local government  interference, the approach of setting up People's Bank branches  and sub-branches in key cities, that is, a transregional set-up,  may be explored and tried out to set the stage for  implementation of a central bank uniform currency policy.    4. Perfect the People's Bank's regulation and control  mechanism. The ultimate goal of the central bank's currency  policy is to keep the currency stable in order to advance  economic development. In addition, as the market economy shifts  into high gear, going from no development to development, the  People's Bank will have to change from mostly direct to mostly  indirect methods of regulation and control. Under present  conditions, the state must be prepared for active trial, reform,  and perfection of the People's Bank's indirect ways and means of  regulation and control. This includes the gradual setting of  interest rates by the market, gradual institution of a  multi-tier savings reserve system, expansion of rediscounting,  and trial operation of open market business. Along with this  must be speedy establishment of a People's Bank investigation  and study information system, and the perfection of a People's  Bank system for preparing statistics, analyzing, and forecasting  currency supply and the entire macroeconomy to provide  scientific data for the formulation of monetary policy.    5. Better People's Bank supervision and control of monetary  policy implementation, financial market operations, and  financial institutions' actions for the building of a normal  financial order. This requires, first of all, paying close  attention to the drafting and perfecting of financial laws and  regulations, including the drafting of a "Central Bank Law," a  "Commercial Bank Law," a "Negotiable Instruments Law," and an  "Insurance Law" to provide guidelines for financial operations,  and laws on which the People Bank can rely to exercise  supervision and control. In addition, the People's Bank must  increase its auditing and supervisory forces, improve its  auditing and supervisory skills, and exercise strict supervision  and control over both banks and non-banking financial  institutions to ensure healthy and orderly finance and banking  activities in the country, control of the country's finance and  banking being regulated according to law.    It must be pointed out that in the process of changing from  a  planned economy to a market economy, making the People's Bank  regulation and control system sound, and perfecting its  regulation and control mechanism is also a gradual, step-by-step  process that cannot be done in haste. Furthermore, in this  process, finance and banking activities and conduct may also  exhibit a very marked transitional coloration. For example, when  conditions do not exist for the implementation of indirect  financial regulation and control means or for them to play a  role, traditional direct financial regulation and control  methods (such as the use of caps on credit) may have to be  retained for a period. In short, we must proceed from actual  conditions and circumstances in the transformation of the  People's Bank's functions and the building of a new central bank  regulation and control system, and avoid the creation of  "vacuums" and loopholes in the macroregulation and control of  finance and banking that may lead to loss of macroeconomic  control.  <H3>  III. Separation of Policy Financing From Commercial  Financing To Build a Financial System in Which State-Owned  Commercial Banks Are the Main Entities With Many Kinds of  Financial Institutions Existing at the Same Time </H3>   Thanks to more than a decade of reform, China's finance and  banking system has undergone very many changes. The traditional  banking system characterized primarily by "great uniformity" has  given way to the current banking system in which many kinds of  finance and banking institutions exist at the same time,  including the four major specialized banks, nearly 10 regional  commercial banks, a number of insurance companies, trust  investment corporations, negotiable securities corporations,  finance companies, and rural and urban credit cooperatives.    The current finance and banking system is still incomplete,  not soundly based, and contains numerous problems, principals of  which are the following:    1) The specialized banks combine two functions in a single  body, namely, they handle both business done for policy reasons  and commercial transactions. This combining in a single body of  two kinds of business is bound to produce a blurring of the  character, the functions, and the responsibilities of the  specialized banks, and create confusion in their actions. When  called upon to do business of a policy nature, they usually  emphasize that they are "commercial banks," and they stress  their autonomy and their interests. When called upon to act as  commercial banks, and to seek to maintain funds in balance, they  frequently emphasize that they are policy banks. The result is  to put themselves in position to gain both the favored treatment  accorded for performance of policy functions and the rights of  finance and banking enterprises while shouldering neither the  duties of policy banks nor the responsibilities of financial  enterprises. In fact, because the two kinds of business are  bundled together, the specialized banks are frequently subjected  to control from a higher level and from local governments. This  makes it difficult for them to become economic entities that  make their own operating decisions, that are responsible for  their own profits and losses, that bear their own risks, and  that exercise self-restraint. Such a system does not facilitate  central bank macroeconomic regulation and control. (For example,  impelled by the administrative interference of local governments  and their own interests, the specialized banks frequently divert  to the development of local industry funds that are intended for  policy purposes such as the procurement of agricultural and  sideline products. Meanwhile, they blame the central bank for  the shortage of credit, thereby forcing the central bank to  expand the issuance of currency). Nor does this system  facilitate smooth implementation of national industrial  policies. (Acting out of their own interests, the specialized  banks frequently do not apply low profit, high risk policy  credit on time or in the full amount to the intended purpose, or  they divert it to other uses, thereby hampering smooth  implementation of national industrial policy). Loans for policy  purposes are usually issued by the government for designated  purposes. Actually, however, they become a large common pot of  funds whose good or bad use, or large or small loss for which no  one is responsible. Consequently, the specialized banks usually  do not make sure to control policy loans closely, and units  using the funds also lack the sense of responsibility they  should have then they use the funds. Thus, returns from the use  of policy loans are extremely low.    2) The specialized banks do not compete with each other;  they  lack vigor and vitality. The professional division of labor  among the four specialized banks has become a professional  advantage for each. Professional monopoly enables each of the  specialized banks to gain commensurate monopoly profits without  having to make any special effort or provide special services.  This greatly weakens the operating zeal and the creativity of  the specialized banks. In addition, the professional monopoly  also leads to the sequestering of funds, and the splitting up of  financial markets, which both stifles the vitality and  efficiency of the financial system and lowers the effectiveness  of central bank macroeconomic regulation and control.    3) Not only do the specialized banks exercise monopoly in  the  division of labor realm, but in the entire finance and banking  system too, the state-owned specialized banks exercise a high  degree of monopoly. Currently the four state-owned specialized  banks account for 90 percent of the personnel employed in  finance and banking nationwide, for 98 percent of the network  outlet points, and for 84 percent of financial assets. They  monopolize 75 percent of the savings and loan business in  society. Other banks and nonbanking financial institutions  simply cannot compete with the four state-owned specialized  banks; consequently, efficiency and quality of service in  China's finance and banking business has declined.    Solution to the above problem requires reform of the present  system of financial organization to improve it gradually. This  includes earliest possibly founding of policy banks; changing  the specialized bank's operating mechanism to make them into  true commercial banks, and steadily developing nonbanking and  other than state-owned financial institutions.    First is earliest possible founding of policy banks. The  founding of policy banks is the key to separating policy  financing from commercial financial to solve the problem of  national specialized banks combining two kinds of business in a  single institution. It would break the direct link between  credit provided for policy reasons and basic money, ensure the  People's Bank's initiative in regulating and controlling basic  money, and would play a not to be underestimated role in  straightening out the relationship between public finance and  the People's Bank, and in truly transforming the operating  mechanism of the specialized banks. It would enable them to  become true commercial banks and both a finance and banking  system and finance and banking organization suited to the needs  of a socialist market economy. This is a major part of the  intensification of finance and banking system reform.    Policy banks are financial institutions specifically  responsible for handling policy loans. Thus, all policy loans  should be within their professional purview. The main kinds of  policy loans for which state-owned banks are responsible at the  present time are the following: 1) state investment loans for  investment in the development of basic industries and basic  facilities; 2) loans for the stabilization of agricultural  production that the state directs banks to issue for grain,  cotton, and edible oil reserves, for contract procurement of  agricultural and sideline products, and for the development of  agriculture; 3) buyer and seller loans provided for China's  import and export of large complete plants; 4) some important  special loans that the state directs banks to make to support  and promote the economic opening up and development of certain  regions. These include loans for the development of science and  technology, loans for the aged, the young, people living in  border areas, and people living in impoverished areas, and  discounted interest loans to help the needy. Such business  should be conducted by the policy banks whose founding is  contemplated (The State Long-Term Development Credit Bank, the  Bank of Agriculture, and the Import-Export Credit Bank).    The crux of good operation of policy banks lies in better  management and supervision of policy loans, all possible being  done to improve returns from the use of policy loans. First, the  area of responsibility for policy loans must be defined. Both  the banks and the users of the loans must bear the risk and the  responsibility for the loans, user unit garnishing, diversion,  or defaults on policy loans, and loan losses resulting from bank  mistakes being punished so as to ensure that policy loans are  issued and used for the purposes, in the amount, and at the  interest rate that the state designates, as well as to ensure  complete repayment at the designated time. This will avoid the  present situation in which responsibility for policy loans is  not fixed, and both risks and losses are borne entirely by the  state. At the same time, the policy loan supervision and control  system and the supervisory mechanism must be perfected. Policy  banks must regularly report to the appropriate People's Bank and  Ministry of Finance units the issuance of loans and their  intended uses. The People's Bank and units concerned must also  audit, supervise, and check on policy loan bank's business  policies, and how well the value of state-owned funds is being  protected and increased. In short, policy banks would not  compete with commercial banking institutions, but they would  still have to improve administration and management so as to  ensure preservation and increase in value of state-owned assets.    The founding of policy banks is an extremely complex and  daunting task requiring careful planning, painstaking  organization, and prudent implementation.    Second is the transformation of the specialized banks into  true commercial banks. One important goal in founding policy  banks is the shedding of specialized banks' policy financing  functions, allowing them to concentrate on commercial financing  to operate in accordance with the modern commercial bank  operating mechanism.    Modern commercial banks are a form of a bank related to a  developed market economy. Although commercial banks have  developed differently in every country of the world, commercial  banks share some common characteristics around the world: 1)  they employ a modern juridical person corporation as their basic  form of enterprise organization, and their basic operating goal  is maximization of the rights and interests of shareholders,  that is, greatest profit and least risk; 2) commercial bank  business consists mostly of industrial and commercial savings  accounts and short-term loans; however, they are increasingly  becoming full service banks; thus, they are termed "financial  department stores"; 3) commercial banks provide exchange and  payment services mostly through the handling of check  withdrawals from current deposits. Thus they have the ability  and the mechanism for creating currency and expanding credit.    The transformation from specialized banks to state-owned  commercial banks must be based on China's national circumstances  while taking into account the successful experiences of foreign  commercial banks. This means doing the following:    1) Appropriate splitting up of the specialized national  banks. Some banks are too large. Even after becoming commercial  banks, they would still be able to maintain a monopoly.  Consideration should be given to the appropriate splitting up of  some specialized banks in order to overcome the business  monopoly of secondary level banks. They might be divided into  several independent accounting regional commercial banks  responsible for their own profits and losses. Once the  specialized banks have been reorganized as commercial banks, the  specialized division of labor among them should be dismantled.  The overlapping of business should be permitted to encourage  fair and normal competition.    2) Clarification of equity relationships. The shortcomings  of  China's specialized banks today are largely attributable to  uncertain equity relationships. Equity relationships might be  clarified in any of several ways, but on the basis of the way  both domestic ad foreign banks operate, the stock system might  be a rather ideal choice. Institution of the stock system in  commercial banks would help the separation of government  administration and enterprise management, and it would help  increase equity limitations, thereby making banks financial  enterprises having authority to make their own decisions, that  seek to attain balance, that bear their own risks, and that are  responsible for their own profits and losses.    3) Strict regulation of commercial banks business. In  today's  world, banks are providing more services, more complete  services, and more international services. However, given the  management level of China's banks and the state of development  of China's financial markets, commercial banks might better not  engage in the insurance, trust, and negotiable securities  businesses in order to shield them from the risks of doing  business in negotiable securities and trusts and for the sake of  the stable development of securities markets and the national  economy.    4) Simultaneous with commercial banks own control over the  ratio between assets and liabilities, the central bank should  also increase supervision and control over commercial banks,  both to prevent financial disarray stemming from inept bank  management and also to prevent an overly rapid expansion of  commercial bank credit and an ensuing intensification of  inflation.    In addition to the state-owned commercial banks, China's  commercial banking system also includes the Bank of  Communications, and the China Trust Enterprise Bank, the Shekou  Zhaoshang Bank, the Shenzhen Development Bank, the Fujian Xingye  Bank, the Guangdong Development Bank, the Guangda Bank, the  Huaxia Bank, the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, and the  contemplated Chinese Rural Cooperative Bank (formed from the  removal of business functions from the Bank of Agriculture for  incorporation into rural credit cooperatives), and the City  Cooperative Bank (a bank to be trial operated using urban credit  cooperatives as a basis). These commercial banks exist outside  the state-owned, state-operated system. They operate under a  stock system or they are a fully funded subsidiary of an  enterprise bloc. They also exist outside the specialized bank  framework of an administrative district-established institution.  Instead, they serve an economic area. In their operation, they  also avoid the "large common pot" operating style of the  specialized banks. They practice the internationally common full  service banking and control over the ratio between assets and  liabilities; thus, they have become a "new family" possessed of  substantial vim and vigor in China's finance and banking system.  In overall terms, however, these institutions have little power.  Therefore, when improving them, we should encourage the  operating of more regional commercial banks, and gradual opening  of the development of nonstate owned financial institutions.    In addition, we must boldly and actively bring foreign banks  into China on the principle of reciprocity and mutual benefit;  however, the scale and the pace of their introduction must be  consistent with China's financial management level and the legal  climate. At the same time, greater control must be exercised  over the operations of foreign-owned banks.    Third is steady development of nonbanking financial  institutions. The creation of a finance and banking organization  system that meets the needs of a market economy, and that is  fully competitive and imbued with vitality requires not only the  founding of policy banks and the conversion of national  specialized banks into commercial banks, but also the  development of nonbanking financial institutions to bring about  a situation in which various kinds of financial institutions  exist together.    There are two main reasons for the development of nonbanking  financial institutions: one is to meet the multifaceted savings  and investment needs of different economic entities. The second  is to serve as a competitor with the commercial banks. This will  help increase pressures on the commercial banks, and stir the  initiative, zeal, and creativity of the commercial banks,  thereby increasing the operating efficiency of the financial  system as a whole.    During the past more than a decade of reform, we have  actively examined and tried out the development of nonbanking  financial institutions, and we have reconstituted or developed a  large number of nonbanking financial institutions such as  insurance companies, trust and investment companies, negotiable  securities companies, financing and leasing companies, and  enterprise bloc financial companies. Nevertheless, some problems  that cannot be ignored remain. One is that such institutions are  very limited in number and scale by comparison with banks.  Second, the kinds of such institutions is incomplete. Third,  affected by the traditional economic model, quite a few  nonbanking financial institutions retain remnants of and prolong  the use of the operating methods of the large national banks.  They lack flexibility and autonomy.    The development of nonbanking financial institutions faces  three tasks: One is improvement. The transformation of  nonbanking financial institutions must be speeded up to meet the  needs of a socialist market economy. The intensification of  reform should serve to change their operating approach, their  style of operation, and their management system to enable them  gradually to make their own operating decisions, be responsible  for their own profits and losses, shoulder risks themselves, and  develop themselves. At the same time, governments and financial  control departments at all levels must simplify administration  and delegate authority. They must give nonbanking financial  institutions the operating autonomy they need, thereby creating  conditions for them to go all out in controlling the ratio  between assets and liabilities, or controlling asset risks.  Second is development. This means using the existing foundation  to innovate, and to develop standardized and diversified  nonbanking financial institutions, and the borrowing of foreign  experiences to increase the kinds and numbers of China's  non-banking financial institutions. Third is better supervision  and control. The central bank must increase supervision and  control over nonbanking financial institutions regarding their  capital, their scale of business, and their methods of operation  to prevent their disturbing and damaging the financial operating  order.  <H3>  IV. Standardization of Financial Market Operation, Building  Financial Markets That Are Uniformly Open, Compete in an Orderly  Fashion, and Are Strictly Controlled </H3>   Financial markets are markets for the borrowing and lending  of money, and for the buying and selling of all kinds of  negotiable instruments and negotiable securities. On the basis  of the time limits set by financial instruments, financial  markets may be divided into money markets (also termed  short-term funds markets), and capital markets (also termed  long-term financial markets). Money markets are financial  markets that deal in money funds financing for up to one year.  They include bank short-term savings and loan markets,  commercial paper acceptance and discounting markets, short-term  national bond markets, and same trade short-term lending  markets. The latter two are jointly termed negotiable securities  markets.    The founding of financial markets that are uniformly open,  that compete in an orderly fashion, and that are strictly  controlled holds important significance for the development of a  socialist market economy. As an important integral part of the  market system, the basic function of financial markets is the  flexible transfer of funds from surplus to shortage areas, and  from low yield to high yield areas. This requires the use of  various channels and various methods to mobilize and gather  together funds to maximize the amount of funds available. At the  same time, it requires use of the market optimization mechanism  to permit the optimum allocation of funds. Therefore, financial  markets are not only an effective way in which to improve the  utilization of funds and thus increase society's economic  returns, but are also necessary for optimum allocation of social  resources and rational readjustment of the industrial structure.    Thanks to more than a decade of reform, China's financial  markets have seen some development. This is manifested primarily  in the following: 1) Varying degrees of development of money  markets (including same trade short-term lending markets and  negotiable instrument discounting markets), and capital markets  (including stock markets and negotiable securities markets); 2)  market media institutions (such as negotiable securities  companies, negotiable securities exchanges, the negotiable  securities quotation system, negotiable securities registration  companies, and negotiable securities rating companies), which  have gradually become more diversified; 3) market entities have  become more numerous: government, enterprises, individuals,  banks, and non-banking financial institutions all entering the  market to become both market fund suppliers and users; and 4)  market control has gradually become more regulated by the law  and regulations.    At the same time, however, we must also realize that the  overall level of both money markets and capital markets is still  relatively low. Both still have fairly serious and glaring  problems. An example is the inter-bank trade short-term lending  markets, which have not yet formed a national inter-bank  discounting market status center to provide responsive feedback  that transcends the banking system. As a result, national funds  discounting channels have narrowed, in addition to which  information does not flow smoothly making discounting costs  higher. They exceed the time limits, uses, and interest rate  ceilings that the People's Bank sets for inter-bank discount  funds, as well as the discounted funds that exceed discounted  fund inputs as a percentage of all savings or capital. Funds  converted to credit funds in the name of discounting are issued  as loans in the form of credit, or discounted funds are used to  make up for the shortage of working capital in enterprises or to  make up for the shortage of investment in fixed assets. The long  lack of distinction between long-term funds and short-term funds  has resulted in the flow of large amounts of funds from money  markets into capital markets and real estate markets. The  long-term use of short-term funds is extremely common  everywhere, and it upsets the order of financial markets.  Another example is the stock market where shares have been  issued or indiscriminately issued without the approval of  government departments concerned. Stock market self-discipline  is poor, falsification and deception occurs, insider trading  takes place, stock market speculation is rampant, the juridical  entity stock market is separate from the individual stock  market, and the A shares market and the B shares market are  separate. Other examples may be found in the price formation and  the financial instruments interest rate mechanism in financial  markets. Problems in financial markets also stem from  administrative distortions, which hamper rational flow of all  kinds of financial instruments, and macroeconomic regulation and  control.    With the establishment and development of China's socialist  market economy, a nationwide uniform, open, competitive, and  orderly financial market becomes a priority task. First, we must  use the formation of inter-bank discounting markets in every  jurisdiction as a foundation for earliest possible establishment  of a nationwide inter-bank discounting market system. Nationwide  inter-bank funds discounting supervision and control must also  be intensified so that inter-bank funds discounting is done  according to law, in a standard way, and scientifically to  eliminate disorder in funds discounting. In perfecting money  markets, the main entities in the market and their behavior must  be clearly defined and standardized, and the direct link between  money markets and capital markets must be severed to prevent the  use of short-term funds for long-term purposes. This will enable  money markets to become monetary policy instruments that the  central bank can use, and main markets for the regulation and  control of basic currency and the money supply. Improvement of  negotiable securities markets includes improvement of national  bond markets, and regularization of securities markets,  particularly enhancement of the stock markets. Transformation of  the enterprise share system must serve as a basis for  regularizing the issuance and circulation of stock shares to set  the stage for a common juridical person and individual stock  market, and A share and B share markets. The regional funds  boycotting and the departmental separatism stemming from  regional or departmental protectionism must be changed at once  to allow the free flow of funds and negotiable securities to  give full expression to the overall performance of financial  markets. In particularly, more must be done to build a legal  system to enhance financial market control. The state must  respond to the needs inherent in financial market operation by  issuing standard guidelines in the form of laws and regulations  about conditions for entry into financial markets, and behavior  of the main market entities. It must control, guide, coordinate,  and supervise financial trading activities, using its influence  on financial market credit costs, credit distribution, and  credit structure to balance financial market supply and demand,  to reduce market fluctuations, to stabilize the financial order,  and to avoid adverse effects on the overall economy resulting  from the chaotic behavior of financial markets.    As was said above, the second obstacle to current  development  of financial markets is the price of capital. Serious problems  continue in the setting of interest rates by administrative fiat  and on the basis of structural distortions. Specifically, the  two-track interest rates (meaning the low interest rates of the  central bank and all specialized banks, and the high interest  rates of money and capital markets) have become the root of  numerous problems in China's financial and economic life today  (such as funds shortages, but large amounts of funds circulating  outside the system; loss of macrofinancial control; disarray in  the financial order, or even incipient corruption). Overheating  of the stock market, the wild rise in real estate prices, and  the fall in the renminbi exchange rate are all attributable to  the two-track interest rates. In short, the activation of  interest rate measures and reform of the way in which the market  sets interest rates are sluggish. Two seemingly contradictory  considerations or apprehensions exist. One is the supposition  that enterprise can continue to obtain funds from the large  national common pot, and thus there is little sensitivity to  whether interest rates are high or low. The second is the  supposition that enterprises will be unable to stand a rise in  interest rates. However, first of all, even though the  state-owned economy remains insensitive to interest rate  changes, in the final analysis, we have a rather large and  rapidly growing nonstate-owned economy that is fairly sensitive  to interest rates. In particular, city and countryside  individual savings accounts are extremely sensitive to interest  rates. This has been attested to by the rise in fall in savings  during the past several years. Second, China has a funds  shortage. At the officially set price for funds, bank interest  rates are relatively low, and even were they raised slightly,  they would still be quite low. If enterprises cannot stand even  such interest rates, that means that low interest rates are  maintaining low efficiency, and at the cost of doing harm to the  interests of savings account holders. This low-interest policy  that violates efficiency principles and fairness principles  cannot continue. Changing the banks officially set too low  interest rates and distortions in the interest rate system will  require merging the present two-track interest rates to a single  track on which the market sets the interest rate to straighten  out interest rate relationships. All interest rates must reflect  time, cost, and risk differences. Rational differences in  interest must be maintained, and an interest rate system must be  formed based on basic interest rate of the central bank that is  adjusted from time to time to reflect the market interest rate,  and that fully reflects the character and needs of a market  economy.    30 September 1993    Comrade He Dexu [0149 1795 2485] provided material and  helped  with the drafting of this article using my line of thinking as a  guide.

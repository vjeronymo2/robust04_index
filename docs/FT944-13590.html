			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / US orders show modest increase US durable goods orders rose by a modest 0.1 per cent in September compared with August, mostly because of big new contracts in the defence sector. The month saw a 21.7 per cent increase in orders for military ships and tanks, more than twice the 10.8 per cent advance of the previous month. Last month's increase in the overall index, according to the Commerce Department, is the second in a row, the seventh this year and the 12th in the last 14 months. New factory orders are 14 per cent above the level of the corresponding month last year, while the third quarter result produced a 1.5 per cent increase on the April-June period. The volatility in defence orders has produced large swings in durable goods orders in recent months. The August performance was yesterday revised upwards to a 6.4 per cent gain from 6.1 per cent, while in July orders dropped by 3.9 per cent. Defence buying meant that the transportation component rose 2.1 per cent in September. Excluding this sector, the index dropped 0.6 per cent, after a 2.5 per cent rise in the previous month, with orders for industrial machinery and equipment falling by 2.5 per cent. New orders for non-defence capital goods, a more reliable indication of the state of manufacturing, rose 0.5 per cent in the month, following a 3.4 per cent increase in August. The modest rise in durable goods orders was in keeping with the picture of continued robust economic growth, US analysts said yesterday, agencies add from New York and Washington. 'There is still a lot of momentum in the economy,' said economist Ms Cynthia Latta of DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic forecasting company in Lexington, Massachusetts.</p>

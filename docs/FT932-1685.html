			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Two leading Japanese groups consider tie-up THE SAISON Group and the Seibu Railway Group, two of Japan's largest conglomerates, are considering a business tie-up ranging from satellite television to credit cards. The negotiations also come as Saison's flagship company Seibu Department Stores is hit by the sharp fall in consumer confidence, especially in top-of-the-range items. The retailer recently started a restructuring programme, including the demotion of all board members. Seibu Department, which is not stock market listed, is understood to have posted a pre-tax loss for the year to last February. Saison is led by Mr Seiji Tsutsumi, while his half-brother, Mr Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, who regularly features in lists of the world's richest men, heads Seibu Railway Group, the railways and leisure empire. The business tie-up is seen as a reconciliation between the two men, who for years have been portrayed in the Japanese press as bitter rivals. The two groups are looking to establish a new satellite television channel, using a new BS-4 satellite, where Seibu Railway, which holds a pro-baseball team, will supply sports software, while Saison will provide entertainment and arts information. Seibu Railway and Saison are looking to combine each others' credit card business. Saison's credit card currently has some 10m holders, while Seibu Railway has a credit card network for its hotels. The groups may consider integrating their hotel businesses. The Seibu Railway Group owns Japan's largest hotel network, while Saison bought a stake in Inter-ontinental Hotels in 1988. Seibu Department Stores plans to reorganise operations. The move highlights the severe problems Japanese retailers are facing as the current economic downturn is affecting consumer spending. Seibu, the core operation of the Saison group, which includes Seiyu, the supermarket chain, currently has debts of around Y320bn (Dollars 2.93bn). It said it was considering postponing future openings of new outlets and reorganising its affiliates.</p>

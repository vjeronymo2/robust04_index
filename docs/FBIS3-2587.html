NPC Chairman Qiao Shi told a preparatory meeting Wednesday  that the session "is extremely important since it is convened at  a time when China is establishing a socialist market economic  structure and marching on the road of modernisation," XINHUA  reported.    Nearly 3,000 delegates to the 13-day second session of the  eighth NPC are expected to approve the economic and social  development plan and the budget for 1994, as well as examining a  draft budget law, NPC spokesman Zhou Jue told journalists.    The delegates are also to study Premier Li Peng's government  work report, likely to focus on efforts to cool the overheated  economy.    Zhou said that this year the NPC and its standing committee  "will accelerate the pace of legislation so as to roughly put in  place the legal framework necessary for the establishment of the  socialist market economy."    Some 152 pieces of legislation, of which 53 relate to  economic reform, are due to be dealt with in 1994, compared with  19 and 12 respectively last year.    A Western diplomat, however, doubted the NPC would succeed  in  laying the legal framework for a socialist market economy this  year, saying much of the planned legislation covered relatively  minor issues. Legislation in vital areas like banking and  securities would take longer than originally planned, as the  Chinese authorities were now taking a "reality check" on the  amount of preparatory work necessary, the diplomat said.    Zhou made no mention of any banking legislation and  acknowledged that problems remained in progress towards a  long-awaited securities law. "Securities is a new subject so we  lack adequate experience to cope with it," Zhou said, adding  that "more careful study" was needed.    Qiao said the NPC session would be guided by the theories of  senior leader Deng Xiaoping and the communist party's basic  line, thereby indicating that political reform was not on the  agenda.    NPC spokesman Zhou appeared to rule out consideration of  long-standing proposals to replace legal clauses on  "counter-revolutionary crimes" -- frequently used to detain  dissidents -- with references to specific violations.    "Counter-revolutionary crimes as contained in China's  criminal law refers to crimes that endanger state security," he  said. "I think for such crimes that endanger state security it  deserves punishment in every country."    Zhou also defended the NPC's reputation as little more than  a  rubber-stamp body [as received], saying the system of China's  parliament "fully suited the national conditions of my country."  "China's National People's Congress is different from  parliaments in other countries and we will not mechanically copy  the experiences of others," he said.    In a vivid reminder that dissenting views will not be  entertained, China has recently launched a crackdown on  political activists, detaining them or escorting them from the  capital to ensure the NPC's smooth running.    The 163-member NPC presidium, elected Wednesday, includes  89-  year-old Deng -- who retired from his last official post in 1990  -- as well as President Jiang Zemin. Deng, who looked frail and  dazed when he appeared in public last month for the first time  in one year, was also a member of the 1993 NPC presidium but did  not make an appearance.    The NPC, created in 1954, is elected every five years and  convenes an annual plenary session. Its standing committee  meets several times a year to examine and adopt laws.</p>

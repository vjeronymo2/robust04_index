			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROUTE FOR COCAINE OUTLINED IN REPORT;  </P> <P> DRUGS: A DEA INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENT TELLS HOW A RECORD 21-TON HAUL SEIZED LAST  FALL WAS BROUGHT ACROSS THE BORDER IN THE TRUNKS OF CARS.  </P> <P> The record 21 tons of cocaine seized at a San Fernando Valley warehouse last  fall was smuggled across the U.S.-Mexico border at El Paso, 650 pounds at a  time in the trunks of Mercury Marquis automobiles, according to an intelligence  report obtained by The Times.  </P> <P> After being stockpiled in the Texas border town, the cocaine was then shipped  to Los Angeles in refrigerated big rigs in massive loads of several tons each,  according to the Drug Enforcement Administration document.  </P> <P> The authoritative account differs sharply from previous reports, in which  investigators theorized that the Mexican operatives who masterminded the  operation evaded U.S. border guards by hiding their cocaine in hard-to-search  commercial vehicles or dividing it among human "mules" who crossed into the  United States illegally.  </P> <P> Instead, the DEA report indicates, the cocaine brought into the United States  by the mammoth smuggling operation was simply driven on hundreds of occasions  directly past U.S. Customs agents, from whom it was shielded only by the steel  lid of a Ford Motors trunk.  </P> <P> The document makes no criticism of Customs' actions in the case, but a recent  General Accounting Office report faulted the agency for relying on a computer  database incapable of providing border agents with adequate warnings against  suspicious individuals or vehicles.  </P> <P> "There is an increased risk that known or suspected law violators may enter the  United States undetected," the GAO report concluded.  </P> <P> The new details about the smuggling operation from Colombia to a Sylmar  warehouse were contained in a report warning of Mexico's increasing role as a  transit point for U.S.-bound cocaine.  </P> <P> The report by the DEA's Office of Intelligence asserts that the cocaine had  been flown into Mexico near Juarez by Colombian trafficking organizations and  was to be delivered from Los Angeles to Colombian distributors in Southern  California, New York and Florida.  </P> <P> In a pattern that has come to be typical, it said the cross-border smuggling  was "facilitated" by Mexican organizations operating as key middlemen.  </P> <P> The report indicated that the 21 tons recovered in Los Angeles last Sept. 28  and an additional 60 tons that had passed through the warehouse in the previous  six months had been concealed "in the trunks of cars (usually Mercury  Marquises) in quantities of roughly 300 kilograms per shipment and driven  across the border."  </P> <P> Hector Tapia Anchondo, the alleged ringleader, and six others have been  arrested in connection with the smuggling inquiry. DEA spokesman Bill  Ruzzamenti said that the agency could not comment on the intelligence report  because the case has not yet come to trial.  </P> <P> The document, dated February, 1990, and marked "DEA-sensitive," also provides  new details about a wide range of other smuggling methods used to ferry cocaine  into the United States in a number of huge shipments seized by American  authorities last fall.  </P> <P> Most surprisingly, the intelligence report asserts that the nearly five tons of  cocaine seized last October in a Harlingen, Tex., stash house had crossed into  the United States by small rafts floated across the Rio Grande River at  Bluetown, Tex.  </P> <P> The report describes land smuggling as "the current method of choice" and warns  that "the cocaine threat at the U.S.-Mexico border is complex and  multifaceted." The document was drafted before the discovery last week of a  273-foot underground tunnel used to smuggle cocaine from Mexico into Douglas,  Ariz.  </P></p>

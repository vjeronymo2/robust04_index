			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL SOUTHERN SECTION SEMIFINALS  </P> <P> DIVISION II  </P> <P> Santa Barbara 28, Canyon 27 -- Chris Wilson's extra-point attempt sailed wide  left by about a foot in overtime, giving Santa Barbara a victory before 8,000  fans at Santa Barbara High.  </P> <P> Wilson had been successful on 33 extra-point kicks this season.  </P> <P> With Canyon leading 21-14, the game appeared to be over when Santa Barbara  quarterback Poncho Rentereria fumbled the snap on fourth and goal at the one.  </P> <P> But the officials ruled Canyon was offside, giving Santa Barbara another  chance. Then, when the Dons failed to get off a play before time ran out, the  officials ruled the clock should not have been started. So the Dons got one  more chance, and Rentereria passed to Derek Elbert for the tying touchdown.  </P> <P> Under the California tie-breaking system, each team gets a chance to score from  the 10 in the overtime.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara scored first, with Renteria, who finished with 16 completions in  20 attempts for 191 yards and three touchdowns, zipping a 14-yard completion to  Simon Banks for a touchdown on second down.  </P> <P> Canyon scored on fourth down, with Tim Beidle passing 14 yards to tailback  Chris Peery. But Wilson missed the PAT.  </P> <P> "It came down to the last play. That's the way it should be with two good  teams," Santa Barbara Coach Lito Garcia said. "But we were fortunate."  </P> <P> Canyon held a 21-14 lead with 3:51 to play after a 17-play, 80-yard drive that  began in the final minute of the third quarter and chewed up 9:07 of the clock.  Peery, who rushed for 92 yards in 19 carries, ran 23 yards for the touchdown.  </P> <P> Canyon (8-4-1) was attempting to win its fourth Southern Section title in the  seven years.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara (12-1) will play Pasadena Muir, a 9-3 overtime winner of Thousand  Oaks Friday night, in the Division II title game next Saturday.

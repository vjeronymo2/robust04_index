			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- Anglican Archbishop  Desmond Tutu said on Tuesday [19 April] the sun was shining over  South Africa at news the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] would take  part in the elections. "It is just like a dream. I am just  over the moon. This new dawn was going to be one that was  overcast but now the sun is shining," he said in a statement  from Cape Town. "We are not going to cease giving thanks to  God. We have a God of surprises, who performs miracles all the  time."</p>

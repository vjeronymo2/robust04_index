			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Israel seeks a better deal from EC - Improved terms wanted for farm and high-tech products ISRAEL and the European Community are negotiating a comprehensive agreement which will reduce Israel's Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) trade deficit with the EC and give the Jewish state substantially improved access to the EC market and Community programmes in research and development. Israel, however, has voiced strong criticism about the slow progress and the unfavourable EC response to Israel's request for improvement in the access of agricultural and high-technology exports to the European market. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, accused the Community this week of 'dragging its feet' in improving economic ties with Israel in the wake of the historic Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. For several years Israel has been pushing the EC, its main trading partner, to update and improve their 1975 free trade agreement. Israeli officials say new EC agreements with other countries and changes in Israel's production have eroded the concessions of the 1975 agreement and in some cases made it obsolete. Israel is also concerned about the growing trade deficit with EC countries. Last year Israel exported goods worth Dollars 4.5bn to the EC and imported Dollars 9.5bn. The trade deficit with the EC, which is expected to widen this year, accounted for 86 per cent of Israel's total trade deficit in 1992. Israeli officials say the EC had been holding back from revising the agreement until Israel made substantial progress on Middle East peace talks. Last month's peace agreement paved the way for the preparation of a Commission mandate, which lays the framework for negotiations. The mandate is before the Council of Ministers which is expected to approve it in its meeting in December. Bilateral negotiations will then begin, leading to a final agreement late next year. Under the mandate the new 'association' agreement, similar to EC agreements with eastern European and Maghreb countries, will significantly update and improve Israel's ties with the EC. Among the new provisions will be Israeli full associate membership of EC research and development programmes, the inclusion of trade in services and bidding for public procurement contracts, an institutionalised political dialogue, and co-operation in customs, environmental policy and the fight against drug trafficking. Israel has welcomed the prospect of a new agreement, and has praised the EC role in responding with a quick Dollars 600m (Pounds 397m) aid budget for the occupied territories. It is, however, disappointed the EC has not responded positively to its call for revision in the conditions that determine the access of Israeli high-tech products, agricultural goods and textiles into the EC market. For high-tech products Israel was hoping the EC would revise the rules of origin and agree to a mutual recognition of standards, tests and certificates which currently act to bar Israeli products. In agriculture it wants an improvement in the trade of fresh and processed products to increase tariff quotas, shift existing quotas to new products, provide for the export of new products not covered by the 1975 agreement - such as exotic fruits - and let cut flowers enter the market on the same terms as those from countries like Kenya and Zimbabwe. Israel, which last year sent Dollars 470m in agricultural exports to the EC, also wants the EC to include more products that use water-efficient technology. On textiles Israel is calling for equal terms to those enjoyed currently by east European and Maghreb states. 'We are asking for quick and bold decisions and not arguments over every percentage point,' an official said. 'Sometimes it seems to us that Europe wants to give birth without having any pains.'</p>

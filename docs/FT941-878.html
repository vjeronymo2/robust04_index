			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): Caradon acquisition in the spotlight - Other Companies Caradon, the building products group which last year bought RTZ's Pillar business for Pounds 800m, is expected to show a slight rise in pre-tax profits for 1993 from Pounds 125.7m to around Pounds 128m to Pounds 130m when it reports on Wednesday. However, there will also be an exceptional profit of Pounds 100m on the sale last year of the group's 25 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox, the packaging group. Pillar will only have contributed for two months, but shareholders will look for clues as to how it is performing. Pearson: City analysts expect the media group's pre-tax profits to have increased from Pounds 151m in 1992 to between Pounds 201m and Pounds 215m for 1993 when results for the year to December are announced today. The results may take some of the pressure off the share price which has dropped from a high this year of 735p to 615p, with a particularly sharp drop in the past week. The fall does not seem to have been triggered by any event and trading volumes in the shares have been low. Redland: Europe's biggest roof tile producer, reports on Thursday and is expected to have increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 221.5m to Pounds 270m last year on a strong performance in Germany. Ciba: The biggest of the 'big three' Swiss pharmaceuticals companies, reveals 1993 results tomorrow that should shed light on demand trends in continental European markets. Results from the industry division - Ciba's other two main divisions are agricultural and healthcare - will be the first under the magnifying glass as investors hunt for evidence of an end to price weakness. Taylor Woodrow: As the results season for construction and building materials companies continues, as much attention will be focused on current trading conditions as on the actual figures. Tomorrow it is the turn of Taylor Woodrow and analysts expect pre-tax profits of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m, compared with a restated loss of Pounds 94.5m for 1992, which included Pounds 51.5m of property provisions. Blenheim: The exhibition organiser whose shares have almost halved over the past year, is expected tomorrow to report profits of between Pounds 42m and Pounds 45m for 1993. That compares with profits of Pounds 49.7m for the 16 months to December 1992. Blenheim Group's two big biennial exhibitions fell into last year and analysts are forecasting lower profits of between Pounds 40m and Pounds 43m in 1994.</p>

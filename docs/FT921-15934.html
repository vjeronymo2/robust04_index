			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Observer: Sun, sea and slag Today's edition of Holiday Which?, the UK Consumers' Association guide to the best and worst of tourist deals, features nine of what it calls 'the worst resorts in the world', including Pattaya in Thailand - 'runs Bangkok a close second as the world capital of sleaze'; Gzira in Malta - 'rubbish everywhere'; Kanoni in Corfu - 'located at the end of the runway of Corfu Town's airport'; and Sunny Beach, Bulgaria - 'marauding gangs of thugs. . . an influx of pimps, prostitutes, drug-dealers and black marketeers'. After slagging off eight of the nightmare spots, Holiday Which? attempts to redress the balance by offering a much better local alternative. But interestingly enough the magazine fails to offer a Bulgarian improvement on poor old Sunny Beach. Holiday Which? tells Observer there is a simple explanation; 'we agonised over this, but the only merit of Bulgaria's Black Sea coast is its cheapness. It conjures up your worst nightmares of Spain in the 1960s'. Some things glasnost just cannot cure.</p>

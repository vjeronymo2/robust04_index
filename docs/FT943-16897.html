			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Canada dials up long-distance network price war - Deregulation is shaking up the telecoms market and squeezing local services A seemingly insignificant change in the way Canadians make their long-distance calls, which takes effect today, could prove to be the key which opens the country's entire telephone network to competition. Since regulators cleared the way in 1992 for competition in the long-distance market, any telephone user seeking an alternative to Stentor, the firmly-entrenched consortium of local phone companies, has had to dial an access code of up to 17 digits. Stentor's fledgling rivals have blamed this finger-numbing exercise for the consortium's continued domination of the long-distance market, where it still enjoys a 92 per cent share. From today, however, the local companies must give their competitors equal access to the long-distance network. Whichever service subscribers choose to use, they will simply dial the prefix '1' for a long-distance call. The change has been accompanied by a blizzard of advertising and a bewildering variety of cut-price offers, reflecting the newcomers' view that equal access is their opportunity for a breakthrough. Today's changes mean that 'at least at the consumer level, the playing field gets somewhere near to being level', says Mr George Harvey, chief executive of Unitel, the biggest of Stentor's new rivals, which is 20 per cent-owned by the AT&amp;T of the US. Unitel predicts its share of the long-distance voice market will climb over the next two to three years, from between 4 and 5 per cent to 15 per cent. Bell Canada, the biggest Stentor partner, which provides local services in Ontario and Quebec, acknowledges it could lose at least 20 per cent of its market share by the end of this year. However, many of the new arrivals are not expected to survive a ferocious price war. There have already been some acquisitions and mergers among the dozens of resellers which lease lines in bulk from the telephone companies and then offer cut-rate services to subscribers. Stentor and its members have responded far more vigorously to the threat of competition than AT&amp;T did when its hammerlock in the US was broken a decade ago. Bell Canada has not only cut its basic long-distance rates by 30 per cent since 1987, but also offers a host of special deals to frequent users. Business customers can get discounts of up to 60 per cent. The phone companies also have the advantage of being able to track every subscriber's calling patterns. The long-distance price war is bound to have ripple effects in the local market. Stentor's members have traditionally used the rich pickings from their long-distance monopoly to subsidise local services. A Toronto household pays a basic telephone service fee of only CDollars 16.57 a month. All local calls are free. The Canadian Radio-television and Tele-communications Commission (CRTC), which regulates telephone services, rejected an application by Bell Canada last year to raise basic-service rates. Long-distance services generated CDollars 6.4bn (USDollars 4.6bn) in revenues last year. Bell estimates that 15 cents a minute of its revenues, or a total of CDollars 1.7bn in 1993, is channelled into local services. The cross-subsidy in the US is only about 3 cents. The telecoms have so far managed to boost local revenues by selling a plethora of high-margin optional features, ranging from phones which display the origin of an incoming call, to beeps which alert a caller to another call on the line. This business is unlikely, however, to compensate for the diminishing cross-subsidy from long-distance services. 'There is a pressing need to move towards local rates which more closely reflect their underlying costs,' says Mr Richard French, Bell's vice-president for corporate development. 'The long-distance market can no longer sustain the levels of contribution required to support basic service.' This argument is reinforced by growing competition from wireless phone services, as well as the impending entry of cable-TV companies into the local phone business. It is the cable operators who have the potential to threaten the telephone companies. Cable service is already available to 95 per cent of Canadian homes, the highest penetration in the world. Holding prices for local services far below cost is a disincentive for cable companies to enter the local market. Bell will introduce an important local-service reform in 1996 by shifting business subscribers from a flat rate to volume-based pricing. It maintains that four-fifths of its customers will see either no change or a reduction in their phone bills. For the remaining 20 per cent of high-volume users, however, charges will rise. Stentor's long-distance rivals will not escape the debate on local-service pricing. They currently pay a fee, set by the CRTC, for connections from the local networks. The phone companies earlier this year asked the CRTC to allow them to 'unbundle' the components required for equal access, with a separate charge applied to each one. The aim is clearly to make competitors pay more for the use of their facilities. Unitel, however, questions Stentor's cost-allocation methods, and is equally hopeful the CRTC will sanction a reduction in fees. The commission is expected to rule on the request this autumn, shortly after it releases a separate report on the regulatory framework for the telecommunications industry. Whatever the CRTC's conclusions, nobody doubts today's change in long-distance dialling is merely part of a much wider shake-up in Canada's entire telephone system over the next few years.</p>

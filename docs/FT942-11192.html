			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: US listing for PT Indosat stake The Indonesian government is to list 25 per cent of PT Indosat, the state-owned telecommunications group, in New York. It has hired Merrill Lynch as lead underwriter. The American depositary receipt issue will introduce one of Indonesia's largest companies to the international financial community and will mark the first time an Indonesian company has listed shares overseas before doing so at home. A further 10 per cent of the company will be listed on the Jakarta stock exchange. PT Danareksa Sekuritas will manage the domestic share sale. Brokers in Jakarta estimate Indosat will raise at least Dollars 500m in New York. Mr Tjahjono Soerjodibroto, Indosat's president, said the share placement would take place in the second half of this year. Indosat is one of Asia's most profitable companies. In 1992, the company's assets were valued at Dollars 690m. It employs about 1,600 people. Mr Soerjodibroto said that figures were not available for last year but the telecommunications company had a healthy track record. Indonesia will invest Dollars 10bn over the rest of the decade to expand telecommunications across its archipelago of nearly 14,000 islands. The decision to list overseas was prompted by the fact that the Jakarta stock exchange limits share prices to 15 times earnings. Merrill Lynch is believed to have advised Indosat to sell its shares at about 30 times prospective 1994 earnings in New York. However, not everyone is convinced that selling shares abroad is Indosat's best option. Some local officials and brokers argue that a larger portion of the shares should be sold in Jakarta to stimulate development of the local stock market.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Slovene Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle on his way  back from Chile -- where he attended the inauguration of  President Eduardo Frei -- stopped over in New York last night.  Uros Lipuscek reports about his talks at the UN Headquarters:    [Begin Lipuscek recording] Last night's talks between  Slovene Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle and French Ambassador to  the United Nations Jean-Bernard Merimee, who is presiding over  the UN Security Council this month, and Brazilian Ambassador to  the United Nations Raoul [name indistinct], president of the UN  Sanctions Committee, have proven that, at the moment, there is  no chance of the UN Security Council exempting Slovenia from the  arms embargo.    The president of the UN Security Council, according to  Peterle, showed understanding for the Slovene views and proposed  that the Slovene diplomacy continue the debate concerning this  problem with the leading members of the UN Security Council.  The Slovene foreign minister said that after the signing of the  Partnership for Peace agreement, which we recently signed with  NATO, and a successful development of the U.S. diplomatic action  for the solution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, some  objections toward Slovenia have disappeared in this sense.    Because of all this, the Slovene foreign minister believes  that we are on a good way to having the UN Security Council  exempt Slovenia from the arms embargo; however, one cannot  specify exactly when that will happen.    In the UN Security Council, Russia and Great Britain are  categorically opposed to Slovenia's exemption from the embargo,  while the French position is unclear. At a time when Russia is  evidently still not ready to fully support the latest U.S.  diplomatic initiative for solving the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, there seems to be absolutely no chance of  Russia agreeing to, for example, the exemption of Slovenia from  this embargo. Slovenia will stay on the former Yugoslavia train  regarding weapons purchases until the superpowers have agreed on  a uniform policy in the Balkans -- that is, when the solution  for the Balkan crisis is in sight. That, despite the latest  U.S. initiative, is still not in sight. That was also confirmed  by last night's talks of Slovene Foreign Minister Peterle at UN  Headquarters. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> A VETO IS THE CHOICE OF REASON;  </P> <P> THE 1990 CIVIL RIGHTS BILL SHOULD BE CALLED THE CHARTER FOR INSTITUTIONALIZED  RACISM.  </P> <P> Ten days ago, on a social occasion, I asked Ronald Reagan how he accounted for  the higher popularity among blacks of George Bush, given that both Reagan and  Bush have fought discrimination for years. He clutched into his reminiscent  mode and recounted that in his boyhood, in Illinois, the gravest crime was any  gesture of racial discrimination; and that as governor of California, he had  appointed more blacks to public office than "all governors of California before  me, cumulatively."  </P> <P> So I repeated the question: How did he account for the relative popularity of  George Bush?  </P> <P> His answer: "He replaced me."  </P> <P> This amused me, and I tucked it away in the memory as a non-answer to a  question probably unanswerable. And then this week I saw an account of Vernon  Jordan's speech at the commencement exercises of George Mason University, in  Fairfax, Va., where he threatened Bush with the loss of what black support he  has if he vetoes the pending 1990 civil-rights bill. The Washington Post  reported: "Jordan, addressing 3,700 graduates at the university's Patriot  Center, drew applause and laughter when he said, 'My friend the President and  his advisers should not be complacent about polls showing high approval ratings  among blacks because George Bush is benefiting from simply not being Ronald  Reagan.' "  </P> <P> Reagan, in his own way, so often uncanny, had not exactly explained why his  popularity among blacks hovered in the vicinity of 10%, but did explain why his  successor's hovers at about 56%.  </P> <P> The plot, unhappily, thickens. It is widely predicted that President Bush will  not veto the pending civil-rights bill, having extracted from Sen. Edward M.  Kennedy (D-Mass.), its principal sponsor, a couple of cosmetic accommodations.  The bill should be called the 1990 Charter for Institutionalized Racism in  America. That, quite simply, is what it is.  </P> <P> The bill wanders about a great deal, seeking to overturn several Supreme Court  rulings that have sought to reorient civil-rights law in the direction in which  it was launched in 1964. What Vernon Jordan and Sen. Kennedy are primarily  concerned about is the Supreme Court decision that held that to plead a  violation of your civil rights by simply adducing a statistical disparity  against ethnic representation in that community isn't enough to put the onus on  the employer. The Supreme Court said, in effect, that if John Doe wants to sue  Harry Smith for firing him, or for failing to hire him, then he has to prove  that Harry Smith was racially motivated in this decision.  </P> <P> What had been happening before the Supreme Court's reversal were lawsuits in  which employers were presumptively guilty of racial (or sexist) prejudice,  never mind the circumstances. The modus operandi, under the new law, would ask  for nothing much more than the statistical disparity from which would follow  the presumption of the employer's guilt of practicing discrimination. Thus if  the community is 15% black, and the fire department is only 10% black, the fire  department becomes guilty of a violation of the civil-rights law, except under  extraordinary circumstances.  </P> <P> It is the dream bill of the racial quota system. An employer would face the  following choice: Hire with strict reference to ethnic residential patterns, or  face a lawsuit, a jury trial, lawyers' fees conceivably in excess of years of  your income. Meanwhile, the plaintiff becomes the employer of last resort of  the legal community. Every minority member not hired or fired is at liberty to  call that telephone number, and an eager lawyer will file suit for a million  dollars on a contingency basis.  </P> <P> And: "Even though their profession profits monetarily from increased government  regulations," writes Susan Mandel in National Review, "35 top  industrial-psychology professors sent senators a letter in March on the subject  of the test that makes 'business necessity' the only justification for job  qualifications that contribute to racial imbalance. They called the test 'a  technically infeasible, subjective standard which the psychological profession  and employers cannot meet or even define.' "  </P> <P> Leaving us with? The most important challenge to right reason by George Bush.  He will, or will not, veto the institutionalization of racism in America.  </P></p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Libel action may be dropped AN apology by the New Statesman and Society for repeating unfounded allegations about his private life could pave the way for Mr John Major to drop his legal action against the magazine. Ministerial colleagues suggested last night that the prime minister is ready to withdraw his libel writ against the magazine if a retraction expected in this week's edition is given equal prominence to the original article. An unconditional apology - along with payment of legal costs - was also likely to persuade Ms Clare Latimer, the owner of a North London catering company, to drop her parallel action against the New Statesman. Downing Street refused to comment on the case, but Mr Major's colleagues said that he had no interest in seeking punitive damages from the magazine. Action is, however, expected to continue against Scallywag, a satirical periodical.</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Smokers face 30% price rise French smokers, banned from many public places by strict new laws, face another blow: a 30 per cent rise in tobacco prices next year, Alice Rawsthorn reports. They are the latest target of the government's efforts to cut the spiralling budget deficit. Early yesterday, parliament voted to raise the price of tobacco 15 per cent on January 18, and another 15 per cent on May 24. This means France's smokers will have to pay FFr13.70 (Dollars 2.56) for a packet of 20 cigarettes next month, and FFr15.75 from May. The government stands to gain an extra FFr4.5bn in revenue.</p>

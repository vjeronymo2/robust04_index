			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> A Times reader recently complained in Jack Smith's column that alphabetical  telephone numbers, such as DIAL-DWP, take too long to dial.  </P> <P> "By the time you have searched out the letters," said Ray G. Coutchie, "you  could have punched the numbers out, had your conversation and hung up."  </P> <P> Coutchie added: "This particular item has bugged me for some time."  </P> <P> Funny, how times change.  </P> <P> Three decades ago, many Californians were upset over the disappearance of  letter prefixes from their phone numbers. HOllywood, for instance, was replaced  by 46, ATlantic by 28, and VErmont by 83.  </P> <P> Ma Bell's "digitalization" campaign inspired the formation of the Anti-Digi  Dialing League in San Francisco and the Utility Users League in Los Angeles,  which fought valiant, if unsuccessful, battles.  </P> <P> The dismay was in part nostalgic.  </P> <P> San Francisco attorney Melvin Belli said that dropping a letter prefix was like  "tearing down a stately Victorian mansion and replacing it with a a parking  lot."  </P> <P> But there was also fear that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to  remember a seven-digit number.  </P> <P> A Pacific Telephone vice president inadvertently lent credence to that theory  when he was questioned by an attorney for the Utility Users League at a hearing  in 1964.  </P> <P> "Don't you have trouble remembering seven digits?" the attorney asked.  </P> <P> "None at all," the vice president replied.  </P> <P> "Please tell me your license plate number," the attorney said.  </P> <P> The vice president recited the three letters on his plate but couldn't remember  the three digits.  </P> <P> Speaking of letters and numbers:  </P> <P> Michael Tscheekar of Westchester challenges anyone to pronounce the name of the  street sign on La Cienega Boulevard (in accompanying photo).  </P> <P> "One Hundred Elevenst?" Tscheekar asks. "One Hundred One-One-Est? Or what?"  </P> <P> Or what seems easiest.  </P> <P> "Something's Fishy" is the headline in Alaska Airlines magazine above an item  about a Fishermen's Fiesta scheduled this weekend in San Pedro.  </P> <P> "Fishy" in more ways than one. The magazine says that San Pedro is "just north  of Los Angeles."  </P> <P> As the Duke demonstrated to the Hulk, the pen is mightier than the headlock.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian, a Sacramento middleweight, signed a bill that in effect  decreed that Hulk Hogan, Junkyard Dog, Brutus Beefcake and other professional  wrestlers are entertainers, not athletes.  </P> <P> The bill, introduced by Assemblyman Richard Floyd (D-Gardena), stripped the  state Athletic Commission of its control over wrestling, despite howls of  protest from the grapplers.  </P> <P> "It ain't a sport, it ain't an athletic contest," Floyd explained.  </P> <P> He pointed out that it was ridiculous to have physicians present at wrestling  matches.  </P> <P> "It would make more sense to have them at rock concerts," he added. "There's  more violence there."  </P> <P> Perhaps Floyd has unwittingly hit upon an idea: A state Rock 'n' Roll  Commission.  </P> <P> The calendar says it's fall, but spring is still in the air, judging from the  personals column in the newspaper LA Weekly.  </P> <P> The publication, which divides its entries into categories, drew 186 ads in its  current edition, compared to 118 in May.  </P> <P> LA Weekly's latest Hubba Hubba Barometer breaks down this way: "Men Seeking  Women" (104), "Women Seeking Men" (34), "Men Seeking Men" (33), and "Women  Seeking Women" (12).  </P> <P> Biggest percentage gainer was a fifth category that increased from one to three  entries.  </P> <P> It's labeled "Either."  </P></p>

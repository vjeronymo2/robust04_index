			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FILE: USING OFFICE MACHINES AT HOME  </P> <P> Richard Enkelis is a Redwood City, Calif., attorney who owns three  IBM-compatible PCs. One is in his office, another is on his secretary's desk  and the third is at home.  </P> <P> He does most of his work at the office, but sometimes needs to take work home.  Instead of stuffing floppy disks into his briefcase, he enters a single command  on his office computer, leaves it running and heads for the parking lot. When  he gets home, he continues working at his office machine, using his home PC as  a remote terminal.  </P> <P> Both Enkelis' home and office machines are equipped with modems and are running  copies of Co-Session, a remote access program from Triton Technologies of  Iselin, N.J. With Co-Session, Enkelis's home machine has access to all the  resources of his office system, including his files, software, local area  network and laser printer.  </P> <P> Enkelis, like many attorneys, uses WordPerfect to write his briefs and legal  pleadings. He has copies of WordPerfect on his office and home machine, but  some of his files reside only on the office system. Co-Session allows him to  access or transfer those files by phone.  </P> <P> Once he has transferred the files he needs, he disconnects the modem and  finishes the work using WordPerfect on his home PC. When finished, he logs back  on to the office machine and, using his office's local area network, prints the  document on the laser printer on his secretary's desk. It's ready when she  arrives in the morning.  </P> <P> Enkelis also uses Co-Session to provide computer support to the Human Awareness  Institute, a nonprofit group in San Mateo, about 15 miles from his office.  Sometimes the institute staff needs help generating reports with PC-File, its  database program. When that happens, they issue a command that puts their  machine into host mode. That way, Enkelis can take over the machine from his  home or office to format and print the report.  </P> <P> Co-Session is one of several remote access programs. Others include Carbon Copy  from Microcom Software of Norwood, Mass., and pcAnywhere from Dynamic  Microprocessor Associates (DMA) of New York.  </P> <P> Timbuktu from Farallon Computing of Emeryville, Calif., and Carbon Copy Mac  from Microcom provide similar benefits to Macintosh users. Like their IBM PC  counterparts, these programs give you access to all the commands and resources  of a remote Macintosh, even if you're thousands of miles away.  </P> <P> Timbuktu and Carbon Copy Mac can also be used to transfer files between Macs  that are connected via modem. If the Mac on the other end is connected to a  network, the remote user gets access to all of the network's services,  including printers, hard disks and gateways to other computer systems. For all  practical purposes, it's the same as being in the office.  </P> <P> Another DMA program, pcMacterm, allows Mac users to control remote IBM  PC-compatibles via a network or phone line. The IBM-compatible programs run in  a window on the Mac, while Mac programs run in other windows. It's possible to  copy and paste data between the PC and Mac and use the Mac to access resources  on the PC's network, such as laser printers or hard disks.  </P> <P> Remote control programs are ideal for training. A trainer, for example, could  temporarily take over the screens of remote users to demonstrate a particular  task. The trainer could use the same software to look over the users'  shoulders, electronically speaking, as they perform a task. The local area  network version of Timbuktu allows a teacher to view the screens of several  remote machines at a time, each in its own window.  </P> <P> Such software can be valuable for people who provide technical support services  to other users. I have a San Francisco-based colleague who uses one of these  remote access products to maintain a local area network for a bank in the  Philippines. He is able to trouble-shoot problems and make software  modifications without having to board an airplane. He has even used the dial-up  system to install software on one of the hard disks on the bank's network.  </P> <P> Software companies could use such programs to help their customers  trouble-shoot problems. A technician, for example, could take over the screen  of a customer's computer to try to locate a problem or demonstrate proper use  of the software.  </P> <P> In some cases, the programs come with separate host and remote packages. In  others, you need to buy a separate copy for each machine.  </P> <P> The only downside to these programs is that they can be slow. A typical 1,200-  or 2,400-bit-per-second modem will allow you to connect the two machines, but  running software via a modem can be noticeably sluggish, especially if the  software uses graphics -- as is always the case with Mac software. A speed of  2,400 bits per second may be adequate if you're using the remote program just  to transfer files or issue a few commands to the host system. But if you plan  to run software from afar, you're much better off with 9,600 bits per second.  </P> <P> I'm now using a Courier HST 9,600 modem from U.S. Robotics and have been  impressed with its speed and performance. If you get a 9,600-bits-per-second  modem, be sure it offers MNP-5 or V.32 error correction and data compression.  These protocols allow the modems to compress data at both ends, increasing the  effective speed -- an important plus if you're trying to control a remote  computer. Both the host and remote computer must be equipped with such modems  to take advantage of their speed.  </P> <P> Farallon offers a $1,295 Timbuktu Remote Access Pack, which has a  9,600-bits-per-second modem, along with a copy of Timbuktu and a Remote-WakeUp  Cable. The cable allows a remote user to turn on a Macintosh II via a phone  line.  </P> <P> Computer File welcomes readers' comments but regrets that the author cannot  respond individually to letters.

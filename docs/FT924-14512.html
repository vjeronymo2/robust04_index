			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Arson fraud bill is Pounds 100m a year FIRES set by fraudsters are costing insurance companies more than Pounds 100m a year - 10 per cent of the total payout last year - according to the Arson Prevention Bureau. The APB, an information and lobby group jointly backed by the insurance industry and the Home Office, said yesterday: 'An increasingly significant number of fires are attempts by policyholders to obtain money fraudulently.' The APB published a booklet yesterday that provides insurers with a step-by-step guide for dealing with suspected fraudulent arson claims. Arson accounted for about Pounds 500m of the Pounds 1.02bn paid out by insurance companies in fire claims last year. Mr Douglas Woodward, of the APB, said: 'For many years we thought fraudulent arson accounted for about 10 per cent of all arson fires. Information coming to us now indicates that it now amounts to at least 20 per cent.' Concern about arson costs led the insurance industry to set up the APB in February last year to improve its understanding of the issue. Mr David McIntosh, a solicitor who has worked with the APB, said the incidence of fraudulent arson was rising as more businesses were hit by recession. 'The fact is that people are burning their way out of financial difficulties,' said Mr McIntosh. Mr Neil Kelly, a loss adjuster who has worked with the APB, said businesses with a high level of borrowing or those that were dependent on a current fashion or fad were particularly exposed to fraudulent arson. Retailers, advertisers, estate agents, travel agents and companies dependent on one supplier were also proving vulnerable. Companies that have expanded rapidly or borrowed heavily are also typically at risk. Mr McIntosh urged insurers to resist claims where they suspected arson. However, he said it was sometimes difficult to persuade judges to take the issue seriously. 'Judges just don't seem to appreciate just how prevalent fraudulent arson is,' said Mr McIntosh. Fraudulent arson: insurer's considerations. APB, 140 Aldersgate St, EC1A 4DD.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Letter: Not dissatisfied with adviser Sir, While it is true, as reported by Clive Cookson ('BTG sell-off likely to see only two bidders' February 19), that our joint venture with Sir Ronald Mason has withdrawn from the bidding process for BTG, the inference drawn that we are dissatisfied in any way with Price Waterhouse is incorrect. In extremely difficult circumstances imposed by government on the privatisation process, Sir Ronald Mason and I found the PW team to be unfailingly helpful and highly professional. We would like to record our thanks to them. The tortuous and constrained process imposed by government has, no doubt, been affected to some extent by the imminent general election. However, the twin objectives of obtaining the highest price, while requiring continued investment in new technologies, may be unattainable through a venture capital route and privatisation. P N Homer, director, James Finlay Bank, 10-14 West Nile Street, Glasgow G1 2PP</p>

Afterward, al-Bishari stated that he and the secretary  general discussed several recent Western statements, including  one by U.S. President Bill Clinton that Libya constitutes a  threat to the United States' national security and another by  the British defense secretary that Libya is seeking to build a  nuclear bomb.    Al-Bishari voiced astonishment at these statements, pointing  out that Libya is a small and peaceable nation of under 4  million people. He pointed out that Britain never discusses  Israel, which has 200 nuclear warheads, refuses to sign the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and opposes the removal of  weapons of mass destruction. At the same time, al-Bishari said,  the Arabs are urging that the Middle East be turned into a  region free from such weapons. He pointed out that President  Muhammad Husni Mubarak has made an appeal to this effect.    Al-Bishari added that he briefed the Arab League secretary  general on the latest developments in the Libyan-Western crisis  and the League's role in averting Western threats.    Al-Bishari said Libya is consulting with the members of the  seven-member Arab committee and the Arab League Secretariat with  the aim of holding a meeting of the seven-member committee on  the sidelines of the Arab League Ministerial Council meeting  next March. He noted that the aim is to find an acceptable  solution that safeguards Libya's sovereignty and independence  and averts any tension in the region.    Concerning the Libyan proposal to try the two Libyan  suspects  in the Hague, al-Bishari said this proposal was submitted by the  suspects' legal counsel committee, since the issue is a legal  one and concerns the two suspects and their lawyers.    Al-Bishari asserted that Libya, as a state, wants the trial  to be held at the International Court of Justice but to be  presided over by a Scottish tribunal if Scotland agrees. He  announced that this is the most flexibility that Libya can show.    He recalled that his country has taken numerous initiatives  since the crisis began and added that Libya does not reject the  principle of holding a trial because it believes that a trial is  bound to reveal the truth. He said Libya is convinced of its  two citizens' innocence and that the world will learn the truth  and realize how great an injustice has been done to the  peaceable Libyan people.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: Bluff King Hal, sunny side up / Enjoy a quirky view of Henry VIII AT THE church of San Martino which overlooks the bay of Naples, the sharp-eyed English tourist discovers a disquieting view of our history. A faded fresco shows Henry VIII watching as a group of Carthusian monks are hanged, drawn, and quartered. The artist was more accurate than perhaps he knew. In 1535 Henry did indeed go to Tyburn Hill, with his Court, to watch the agony of those brave souls who dared to put their duty to God before their king. The map of Henry VIII's London had some exceedingly black spots, recently brought home to me by Susan Brigden's fine and deeply considered book, London and the Reformation (OUP Pounds 55; 676pp; forthcoming in paperback). There was Tyburn for traitors, Smithfield for the burning of heretics, and the Tower of London where so many of Henry's victims were racked and knelt to the executioner. But a few miles down-river from Traitors Gate, Henry's palace at Greenwich was a different world. Such is the impression left by Henry VIII at Greenwich, the provocative new exhibition at the National Maritime Museum (until 1 September; sponsored by the Sunday Express). Henry VIII at Greenwich is the star event of the Year of Henry VIII which commemorates the king's birth 500 years ago in June. However, the trouble with 'Bluff King Hal' from the marketing point of view is that the moment you go beyond the level of jokes about Henry's six wives, he becomes a tricky beast to package, especially abroad. The English Tourist Board must surely be relieved by the idiosyncratic focus which Dr David Starkey, distinguished historian of the Henrician court, has given the Greenwich show. You will find no reference to dismembered Carthusians, none to the fate of Thomas More - since 1935, St Thomas More as he is to Catholics. Of course, the difficulty with history is always knowing what to leave out. Dr Starkey's presentation is emphatically not the regular view of a reign, nor of a man. Imagine, for instance, what they would say at school to an essay on Henry which left out Cardinal Wolsey, Cromwell, the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and Parliament. Instead, Starkey gives a subtle presentation of Henry based on his times at Greenwich. The Maritime Museum is close to the site of the Tudor palace of Placentia, Henry's birthplace and his principal residence for two decades after fire destroyed the medieval palace of Westminster in 1512. However, royal life at Greenwich was largely about rest and recreation, banquets and hunting. So we find Henry sunny side up. Nothing today remains of the Tudor palace although the designers have struggled manfully to evoke its splendours. Dr Starkey has structured his view of Henry around events more-or-less connected with the palace - the Field of the Cloth of Gold, when Henry sallied forth to meet Francois I of France, is a bit of a jump. The French connection is strongly underlined. There are some splendid manuscripts from France and, for the first time, bilingual captions in French and English. Jousts, treaties, a royal christening, the New Year's Day present-giving ceremony, serve as the basis for 'historical tableaux' which group a very fine collection of paintings, miniatures, books, manuscripts, armour, and treasures. The detritus of domestic life is not forgotten either, with dog-collar and a tennis-ball found lodged in some rafters. Although I doubt whether the visitor on the hoof is likely to take it in, these ingenious tableaux lead us on a symbolic journey through the palace rooms. This conforms to the topographical analysis of power much in vogue with historians. Such matters become a good deal clearer if you buy the catalogue, a series of pithy, well-written essays with the title Henry VIII. A European Court in England. So we pass, in theory at least, from the Tilt-yard where magnificent armour evokes the great jousts of 1517, to the Royal Library, the Presence Chamber, and the Bedchamber. Here Henry's jousts between the sheets with his German such a flop. The cheery Henrician music stops at this point. Instead, in a slightly obvious crowd-pleasing strategem, we hear a reading from a memoir by Sir William Butts, the royal doctor. The king had protested to Butts that the fault was not his virility - he had experienced two wet dreams, a phrase left in Latin - but Anne's repulsive body. A portrait of poor, plain Anne from St John's College, Oxford is one of the exhibition's unexpected delights. The painting was considered a late copy until it was cleaned two years ago, and found to be 16th-century. It could even be one of the portraits produced for Henry's envoys to Cleves when the king was deliberating which of the two princesses there should be his fourth wife. The portraits were rejected on the grounds that German fashion did not reveal enough of a lady's anatomy. Holbein the Younger, Henry's court portraitist, was duly sent from London to record the lady although, as everyone knows, Holbein's genius made too much of the 'Flemish mare's' best points. Although Holbein's image of Anne was sadly not loaned to Greenwich, there are 14 of his beautiful drawings of Henry's courtiers from the Queen's collection. Nothing can overshadow Holbein's superb painted portrait of Sir Nicholas Carew in his armour, from the Duke of Buccleuch's collection. Carew, friend of Henry's gay youth, has a niche in the tableau which evokes the spectacular reception in 1527 for the ambassadors from Francois I. The pageantry comes across remarkably well, thanks to the Black Book of the Order of the Garter and the series of beautifully illuminated peace treaties which took artists and scribes three days to prepare. Again, I noticed how a focus on courtly junkettings ironed out the monster's wrinkles. Eleven years after he sat to Holbein, Carew was sent to the Tower accused of being a conservative. In prison he read the Bible in English and realised 'for the first time the sweetness of God's holy word.' Carew went to the block rejoicing in his conversion to the new faith. Carew's conscience may pass without comment, but at least the king's does not. In his famous psalter, he is represented as King David and meditating in his bedchamber. Less well-known is his boxwood rosary from the Chatsworth collection, carved for the king by a Flemish craftsman. Each bead of the Ave has five tiny roundels carved with texts and images of the sybils and prophets. The last bead, the Pater, is only the size of a golfball but it opens to show two devotional scenes carved in deep relief, one of the Virgin in glory. The Royal Clock Salt is huge and magnificent. Henry's personal suit of armour is awesome and, as ever, one marvels that the royal warhorse could even trot under all its gear. Yet of all the objects in this clever, cock-eyed exhibition, the rosary is surely the most intriguing. Huge old Henry, 54 inches round the waist, telling his beads in his palace beside the silver Thames; it may not be the dominant image left by Henry VIII at Greenwich, but it is there, all the same.

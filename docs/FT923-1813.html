			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / The fiscal roots of market turmoil: America The communique released by the Group of Seven leading industrial countries over the weekend was singularly unimpressive even by this august body's own undemanding standards. The three paragraphs offered neither an analysis of why markets are in disarray nor an outline of possible cures. The statement's vacuity reflects the inability of US and European policymakers even to agree on the character of current problems. From a US perspective the turmoil in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) is a sideshow. Because foreign trade has always been a relatively minor component of the US economy, Americans have never taken exchange rate systems that seriously. They believe sacrifices may be worth making to achieve ultimate ends, such as economic growth, but not in defence of particular currency arrangements. When former President Richard Nixon broke the dollar's link with gold and summarily wound up the Bretton Woods exchange rate system in the early 1970s, he incurred the wrath of neither the American public nor US academics - who happily embraced the floating dollar. Given this history, most US analysts privately welcome the de facto realignment of the ERM that is now under way. They never understood why Britain was so determined to impose Germany's abnormally high interest rates on an economy saddled with US levels of personal and corporate debt. And most believe the UK economy will do better with a domestically-oriented monetary policy. Americans are preoccupied principally by lack of growth and jobs rather than by currency gyrations. The US Treasury's repeated warnings about growth are not just a reflection of the imminent presidential election. They reflect a different history - the US economic psyche was scarred by the Great Depression rather than by hyper-inflation. The fact that all three economic blocks - the US, Japan and Europe - are simultaneously facing hard times greatly worries Washington. While a global slump is not expected, it is not seen as impossible. Perversely, the monetary restraints imposed by German unification may have encouraged complacency in Europe. Policymakers appear convinced that growth will revive if only they can find a way to reduce interest rates. In the US scepticism runs deeper because the Federal Reserve has already cut rates aggressively. The US went into recession with short-term interest rates of about 8 per cent - a level about which Britain can still only dream - and has since slashed them to 3 per cent. Yet the results have been profoundly disappointing. The economy has still not recovered decisively from recession: indeed, uniformly poor figures indicate that the very sluggish growth of recent quarters may again be tailing off. It was thus not surprising to hear Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury Secretary, declare over the weekend that the cure for the currency instability worrying Europeans was nothing less than action to meet the US's number one worry: lacklustre growth. History, however, reveals no clear link between growth and exchange rate stability: when the dollar plunged in the mid- to late-1980s, the world economy was enjoying a brisk recovery. Mr Brady's call for policies to restore global growth was just a coded demand for further German interest rate cuts. The US demands are logical: an easing of German monetary policy would soothe currency strains, prompt somewhat faster European growth and improve US export prospects. But US analysis skirts the core of current problems. The lack of balance between monetary and fiscal policy is the underlying cause of both slow growth and currency instability. If Germany had financed the costs of unification mainly through tax increases rather than borrowing, German inflation and interest rates would be much lower and the ERM would not have blown apart. Germany's fiscal error was as serious in its way as the US's refusal in the late-1960s to raise taxes to finance the Vietnam war. The American mistake led to a decade of high inflation; Germany's has contributed mightily to what may prove a decade of stagnation. The US, meanwhile, should have ended the boom of the 1980s with a sizeable budget surplus. It could then have used fiscal policy to counter the 1990-91 recession. Had it done so the Fed would not have had to cut interest rates so sharply, the dollar would have been stronger, and the strains on the EMS would have been greatly reduced. The link between structural fiscal deficits and slow growth is even clearer. In the US, labour force growth has dwindled. The rate at which the economy can expand is thus determined mainly by productivity improvements which in turn reflect levels of savings and investment. The US is unable to grow faster than a meagre 1-2 per cent largely because huge deficits are draining already inadequate levels of domestic savings. Chronic US (and now German) deficits have greatly exacerbated a worldwide shortage of savings, pushed up long-term interest rates, and undermined global growth prospects. You will read nothing of this in the pusillanimous G7 communique. The only mention of fiscal policy is an approving reference to higher public spending in Japan. Given such leadership, the world perhaps deserves its problems.</p>

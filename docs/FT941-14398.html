			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Venezuelan brewer taken over Universal Breweries, the majority shareholder of Brazil's Brahma beer group, has bought control of CA Cervecera Nacional, Venezuela's second-largest beer producer. Brahma, which will operate the Venezuelan beer maker, plans to launch new products in Venezuela and introduce its popular Brahma Chopp beer. Details on the transaction were not disclosed. Brahma's presence in Venezuela, part of an international expansion programme, should provide strong competition for Empresas Polar, whose Polar beer dominates around 90 per cent of the domestic market, and Cervecera Regional, another producer. Polar is owned by the Mendoza Fleury family, while Regional is controlled by the Cisneros group. Cervecera Nacional shares are listed on the Caracas stock exchange, but are not actively traded. Both Brahma and Polar are among the world's largest brewers. Cervecera Nacional was once the leading Venezuelan beer producer but was overtaken by Polar in the 1970s. Nacional has 6 per cent of Venezuela's beer market and 34 per cent of the market for 'malta', a non-alcoholic malt beverage. It also exports to the Caribbean. While Venezuela is a relatively small market, with a population of 20m, beer is a big seller. Beer output in 1992 was more than 72m litres, or 61 per cent of all alcoholic beverages sold.</p>

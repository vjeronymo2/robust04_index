			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (5): The search for common ground  -Differences remain over economic and monetary union BY THE end of this year, if all goes to plan, Europe should reach a broad consensus on how to proceed towards the final phase of economic and monetary union (Emu) around the end of the century. But to reach this common view, officials from the 12 European Community countries will have to close some large gaps in thinking on what the union should eventually look like and the pace at which it is to be achieved. In the third and final stage of Emu, according to the plans of much of Europe, responsibility for pan-European monetary policy is due to be handled by a single European central bank which would be independent of governments. It would also administer a new, single currency. In this form, Emu would fit in with the increased integration over the past 20 years of European commerce and industry. Advocates say it would follow on logically from the idea of making Europe a single market place - the goal of the EC's 1992 programme to eliminate trade barriers. But beyond the rhetoric, a number of problems remain. The forum in which these will be discussed is the EC's intergovernmental conference on Emu, which started in Rome in December last year and which will continue throughout 1991 in the shape of meetings roughly every two weeks between EC officials. The main disagreements concern: The detailed timetable for Emu. All 12 EC countries, except Britain, accept the idea of a European central bank linked to existing national central banks - which would also be politically independent and operate as branch offices of the main central bank. Some countries, led by France, want the new bank to be set up in the so-called stage two of Emu, starting in 1994, though Germany favours waiting until 1997. That would allow time for the economies of individual countries to come closer together to the point when an all-embracing monetary policy for the whole of Europe made sense. France fears, however, that much of the momentum towards Emu could be lost if plans for a central bank are delayed. The idea of a two-speed Europe. An argument which has gained much ground over the past year is that those countries whose economic performances, especially in the area of inflation, are reasonably similar could go ahead almost immediately with a form of Emu, leaving other nations on the periphery. This point of view, expressed most forcibly by Mr Karl Otto Pohl, president of the German Bundesbank, would put Germany, France, the Benelux countries and, possibly, Denmark in the 'inner core'. Britain, Spain, Greece, Portugal, Eire and Italy would be on the outside. Though many argue that this arrangement makes a great deal of sense, it has been attacked on political grounds by the nations which under such a system would see themselves as 'second class citizens', excluded from the benefits of inner-core Emu membership. The role of the Ecu. As an alternative to the notion of setting up a European central bank in stage two, Britain has proposed a European Monetary Fund (EMF), whose main task would be to administer a new, common European currency, the hard Ecu. This would differ from the existing basket Ecu, based on the main European currencies. The UK's EMF/hard Ecu plan would provide Europe with experience of using a common currency, in parallel with existing currencies, prior to any decision about moving to a single financial unit. Britain has indicated that the EMF could ultimately evolve into the European central bank envisaged by the other EC nations. Although much of the rest of Europe has its doubts about the practicality of the hard Ecu, some countries, among them Spain, have appreciated the usefulness of the UK proposals in providing a focal point for debate about the speed with which Emu should come about. Germany, meanwhile, has come out strongly against the hard Ecu and the EMF, though it favours 'hardening' the existing Ecu to encourage the currency's use, perhaps by freezing its composition. Fiscal policy. Some believe that the idea of a pan-European central bank to handle monetary policy needs to be accompanied by a centralised approach throughout Europe towards tax treatment and intergovernmental transfers. One fear is that, without a set of arrangements for channelling large amounts of government cash from the richer parts of Europe to the poorer regions, the single monetary bloc could lead to a rapid division between Europe's 'haves' and 'have nots'. Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, says: 'I don't think that people in Europe have realised the extent of the the transfers which might be needed under Emu to avoid social disruption.' He adds that once Emu has taken place, parts of countries such as Greece and Spain with low incomes could gain from this kind of arrangement. It could be modelled on the system in Canada, under which the relatively poor province of Newfoundland receives large payments from central government funds. Some see a cooling in enthusiasm for the concept of Emu, partly a result of the economic slowdown that has affected Britain, France and Italy in particular over the past year. There is also more of a mood of caution - sparked largely by the problems which have emerged this year in bringing together eastern and western Germany - about moving too quickly to an economic union for the continent as a whole. However, Mr Wolfgang Reinicke, a political economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, says that the pace of European integration at a business level will push the discussion about economic union and make this virtually unavoidable. 'Europe has almost reached the point of no return (in moving towards Emu),' he says. 'But the way this is achieved may be less clear-cut than people initially thought.'</p>

The Director General of the Science and Technology Agency,  Satsuki Eda, presented the paper to the cabinet Tuesday morning.    The paper includes a special section on plutonium use in  advance of Monju's scheduled April 1994 criticality, the moment  when the reactor's fuel achieves a chain reaction.    The reactor, at Tsuruga in Fukui Prefecture, uses plutonium,  which is 260,000 times more radioactive than uranium.    The paper states that since plutonium is a byproduct of the  burning of uranium, there is no intrinsic difference between the  two substances.    But the paper notes that the nation's standards for  acceptable irradiation levels also pertain to bone and lungs,  which absorb plutonium easily.    At Monju, for example, the paper said that even if a major  accident occurs -- an event it said is technically impossible --  safety measures are so tight that nearby residents would receive  less than the allowable levels of radiation.</p>

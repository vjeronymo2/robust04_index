			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (2): The shift towards intervention - Merging the work done by the Foreign Office and the DTI is at the heart of the government's approach. James Blitz looks at changes which may represent a new era of British trade policy / The UK, Active Government Involvement Talk about British exports with any official from the UK government, and the conversation is likely to be punctuated with sighs, groans and moans. But Ray Mingay, the Director-General of Export Promotion at Britain's Department of Trade and Industry, is unusually enthusiastic when he talks about the UK's trade balance, which has been in the red for nearly a decade. 'We are engaged in the biggest export promotion initiative that this country has ever seen,' he says. 'Our continental rivals have a competitive advantage over us in this field, but we are doing everything we can to make up the ground.' Mr Mingay's predecessors rarely talked with such optimism. For most of the past 15 years, Britain's business men and women have complained about the conservative government's lax, hands-off attitude to promoting the country's business interests overseas. For many industrialists, the British government has a crucial role to play in helping find export markets in an increasingly competitive world. And economists believe that the balance between imports and exports must be redressed if Britain is to enjoy a sustained economic recovery. But recent secretaries of state at the DTI, in particular the late Nicholas Ridley and Peter Lilley, now Social Security Secretary, have been keen Thatcherites and advocates of laissez faire, arguing that export promotion, like everything else in the economy, should be regulated by the market - and that government has no role. Enter Michael Heseltine, Britain's latest incumbent in the post of Trade Secretary. Two years ago, he promised to intervene in trade policy over breakfast, lunch and tea. Both he and Richard Needham, the trade minister, believe the state can and must promote business overseas. They have pioneered new policies, galavanising their department's officials and introducing bold new initiatives. At the heart of Mr Heseltine's new approach has been a merging of the work done by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the DTI. Until recently, both departments operated separately, with the DTI promoting policy initiatives while trade counsellors in British embassies helped businessmen on the ground. By co-ordinating their functions, the information DTI now gives to businesses about trading conditions has been sharpened up, and a far more comprehensive service is offered. The merger of FCO and DTI operations has also been crucial in promoting several other schemes: More than 70 'export promoters' have been hired from the private sector on two-year secondments to travel to countries which offer business opportunities for Britain, and advise Britain's companies on how to operate there. The DTI has further enhanced its expertise on potential markets by ensuring that at least one official is in charge of promoting trade opportunities in each of Britain's top 80 markets. The number of 'one-stop shops' retailing the Export Promotion Department's products in the UK is increasing. Eleven regional offices in Britain now advise local companies on how to export. Officials say that this number could rise to 40 by the end of the year. The enthusiasm in the department is impressive. But results are difficult to assess. The main indicator of success is, of course, the trade balance, although this has been clouded in recent months by the lack of statistics on UK trade with the EU. DTI officials say they have internal targets for the 'export promoter' initiative but it is too early to say what has been achieved in this area. But that has not stopped some businesses picking holes in what the DTI is doing. Some say that the two-year secondment period for export promoters is too short, and that once they have achieved their expertise, they are required to return to the private sector. Others are perplexed by the aim of having one DTI expert for every country with trade potential. 'Do we really need a DTI expert on Iceland?' asks one businessman. 'Wouldn't it be better to concentrate more efforts on the really big markets, especially south-east Asia?' Mr Mingay, acknowledges, too, that there is little net new cash for export promotion. Spending on staff costs and services has hovered around the Pounds 170m per annum mark for several years. 'What we don't believe in is improving things by just throwing money at them,' he says. But at the heart of exporters' concerns is the belief that Britain has much to do to catch up with European competitors such as France and Germany, where state support for exporters has been a way of life for decades. Angela Conning, who is in charge of export promotion at the Confederation of British Industry, also maintains that British premiums for export guarantee cover are often more expensive than in France and Germany. Strong traditions of regional government in Europe mean that export promotion help is more carefully filtered to companies outside the big cities. Rules for granting funds from Britain's Aid and Trade Provision to help trade with developing countries are also far more stringent than in Germany. 'If a French company wants help winning a contract order for the glory of France, then their government will find that money,' says Miss Conning. 'In Britain's case, there is more likely to be less help, and, more often than not, two companies competing for a single bid.' But, however justified, the complaints are not as vehement as they used to be. And even the most dynamic export promotion scheme could not compensate for a long tradition of laissez faire in only a couple of years. 'Whether we should have been here before is simply of no interest to me,' says Mr Mingay. His concern is to ensure the new approach of his ministers works as well as possible. Only time will tell whether it has ushered in a new era of British trade policy.</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RED INK IS NOW BLACK AT LOS ALAMITOS  </P> <P> The new owners of Los Alamitos Race Course, to the astonishment of many, find  themselves in a rather unusual position -- on the brink of profitability.  </P> <P> The track, in recent years considered a white elephant, was sold to Hollywood  Park in 1984 for $58 million. But it wasn't long before it was so deep in red  ink that the survival of the parent Inglewood track was threatened.  </P> <P> Lloyd Arnold and Chris Bardis, who represented harness racing interests, won a  bitter struggle to buy the track and adjoining property for $72 million last  November. Some viewed the purchase as foolhardy.  </P> <P> But a funny thing happened on their way to bankruptcy.  </P> <P> Many bettors who had stopped coming to Los Alamitos returned. Attendance and  handle at the harness meeting increased 25%. Arnold, in a spirited salvo  directed at the former owners, even draped an "Under New Management" sign  across the back of the grandstand.  </P> <P> After four months, Arnold and Bardis sold half of the track, which consisted of  125 of the 297 acres they had bought, for $16.5 million to the quarter horse  interests who had opposed them in the original purchase. Ed Allred's Quarter  Racing, Inc., made the purchase, and R.D. Hubbard took an option for a quarter  of the track from Quarter Racing, Inc. Allred and Hubbard had made a series of  legal maneuvers a few years ago that made the track very difficult to operate  under any ownership.  </P> <P> So, Arnold and Bardis were suddenly partners with men they been feuding with  for more than a decade.  </P> <P> Then, Arnold and Bardis sold the golf course property next to Los Alamitos to  Dye Design, a Colorado golf development corporation, for $34 million. Dye plans  to build an upscale golf resort on the site. Hollywood Park had shut down the  golf course, claiming it had little value.  </P> <P> Arnold and Bardis are in negotiation to sell two parcels of land to undisclosed  buyers for $6 million and $8 million. All of which still leaves Arnold and  Bardis with 44 acres, 33 of which can be developed for offices and businesses.  Independent realtors estimate the value at about $1 million an acre.  </P> <P> So did Lloyd Arnold, an unassuming track manager with country charm, and Chris  Bardis, a Sacramento lawyer, merely get lucky or were they men of great vision?  </P> <P> A little of each, it turns out.  </P> <P> Arnold, Allred and Bardis, in separate interviews, each claimed little credit  for the track's recent success. Instead, they chose to allege that Hollywood  Park officials mismanaged the track.  </P> <P> "We've cleaned up the track because it was filthy," Arnold said. "We're  treating people like we want them to come. It's just common sense that you have  to treat people right. You have to feed them good food at a reasonable price,  and you also have to have a clean facility."  </P> <P> Bardis pointed more directly at Marje Everett, the chief operating officer at  Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> "They just botched it up so bad, it was an easy act to follow," Bardis said.  "Everything you could conceivably do wrong, they did. Where (Everett) did  nothing to enhance racing, we did a lot. Where she was closing down golf  courses, we were putting them up."  </P> <P> That theme is somewhat explained and partially colored by the recent  announcement by Hubbard that he plans to stage a proxy fight to take over  control of Hollywood Park. Hubbard would even choose not to exercise his option  to buy a quarter of Los Alamitos if the California Horse Racing Board sees his  ownership in both properties as a conflict.  </P> <P> Hubbard was in the Soviet Union, where his art collection was on exhibit and  could not be reached.  </P> <P> Don Robbins, executive vice president of Hollywood Park, reached in Northern  California Thursday, said, "It is unfortunate that they (Los Alamitos owners)  have decided, for whatever reasons, to engage in personal attacks.  </P> <P> "We are delighted that they are doing well. But they aren't doing quite as well  as their public relations releases would have you believe. They just recently  completed a summer quarter horse meeting in which the on-track handle was down  10% from what it was at the same time the previous year that we had it.  </P> <P> "Obviously, they have benefited from a change in legislation that allows them  to send their racing program signal state wide (to off-track betting  facilities); we were confined to Southern California. Also, they are running  12- and 13-race programs, where we used to run nine and 10."  </P> <P> Los Alamitos, like most race tracks, is more valuable as real estate than as a  gambling facility. The selling of property has been a key to making the deal  work. When all of the non-race track property is sold, Arnold and Bardis will  have, basically, acquired the race track for nothing and still a profit of  about $25 million.  </P> <P> "They did a nice deal; they are smart," said Jeff Rhodes, who was commissioned  by Hollywood Park to sell the property to Arnold and Bardis. "They were in  control and they are going to make a lot of money eventually. But with all the  legal problems the track had, it was still a courageous deal."  </P> <P> The legal problems were solved when Arnold and Bardis went to Allred and  Hubbard and offered to make them partners in a marriage of necessity.  </P> <P> When Arnold, Allred and Bardis were asked if they ever envisioned themselves  being partners, each answered with an emphatic, "No!"  </P> <P> "Chris Bardis is the last guy I ever thought would work with us," Allred said.  "I didn't know him, but I detested everything about him. Now, I consider him a  good friend and a close ally."  </P> <P> Arnold echoed the sentiment.  </P> <P> "I would be lying if I said I thought we'd ever be partners with Doc Allred,"  he said. "There was a lot of skepticism on our part and a lot of skepticism on  their part. They didn't totally trust us and we didn't totally trust them. But  now there is trust and the partnership is working."  </P> <P> In fact, the owners have been fighting more with their respective horsemen than  with one another. Several harness drivers filed suit against Arnold when he  imposed minimum driving standards in an attempt to improve the quality of  racing. Arnold eventually won the suit in Los Angeles Superior Court.  </P> <P> Arnold recently announced that he would be running a harness racing meet at  Pomona's Fairplex Park, starting Oct. 26, in the first step toward establishing  year-round racing in Southern California. The meeting will directly oppose the  quarter horse meeting at Los Alamitos and probably will cut into its handle.  </P> <P> "We supported their position at Pomona very strongly, but I couldn't get my own  (quarter-horse) horsemen to support it," Allred said. "The horsemen don't  understand that we have to do this to benefit both breeds, and that we also  need to run elsewhere to get year-round racing."  </P> <P> Allred would also like to run at Fairplex and later at a proposed race track he  would build in Riverside. The California Horse Racing Board will hear final  arguments on Fairplex racing at its monthly meeting today.  </P> <P> "The harness horsemen have been more helpful to us than our own people," Allred  said. "In fact, our own people have been in opposition to us. While I'm  certainly not a harness person, I've gained a new respect for the cooperation  that we've gotten from them and wish our own people were in the same league."  </P> <P> The final obstacle for the owners is to get the attendance and handle to higher  levels. During the first harness meeting last spring, Arnold needed an average  nightly handle of $825,000 to break even. He averaged $818,000 a night,  including off-track wagering. Because the track deals in only 8% of the handle,  the rest going back to bettors and the state, his loss was about $560 a night.  </P> <P> The quarter horse meeting has a break-even point of $925,000 a night and the  track averaged $1.03 million, leaving a $1.4-million pretax profit.  </P> <P> Off-track betting is the eventual answer. The owners hope to one day have  daytime off-track betting at Los Alamitos, a move opposed by Santa Anita and  Hollywood Park. Los Alamitos was able to conduct off-track wagering during  parts of the Del Mar meeting and made about $15,000 a day.  </P> <P> A symbiotic relationship exists among all breeds and, although conventional  wisdom says off-track wagering during the day will affect the handle at night,  the added income is necessary if nighttime racing is to continue.  </P> <P> "It's going to take a year or two to get there," Bardis said. "Things were  pretty much down in the dumps, and it's not going to happen overnight. I'm not  predicting a big recovery for the harness or quarter horse people until the  latter part of next year."  </P> <P> Even at that, it's a recovery that seemed next to impossible just a year ago.  </P></p>

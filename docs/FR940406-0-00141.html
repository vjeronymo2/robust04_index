			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)(7) Where vehicles are of a type which cannot be divided into evaporative/refueling emission families based on the criteria listed above (such as non-canister control system approaches), the Administrator will establish families for those vehicles based upon the features most related to their evaporative and/or refueling emission characteristics. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)(8) through (b)(1)(vi) [Reserved]. For guidance see &sect;86.096&hyph;24. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(1)(vii)(A) Vehicles of each evaporative/refueling emission family will be divided into evaporative/refueling emission control systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The Administrator will select the vehicle expected to exhibit the highest evaporative and/or refueling emissions, from within each evaporative/refueling family to be certified, from among the vehicles represented by the exhaust emission-data selections for the engine family, unless evaporative and/or refueling testing has already been completed on the vehicle expected to exhibit the highest evaporative and/or refueling emissions for the evaporative/refueling family as part of another engine family's testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) If the vehicles selected in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(vii)(B) of this section do not represent each evaporative/refueling emission control system then the Administrator will select the highest expected evaporative/refueling emission vehicle from within the unrepresented evaporative/refueling system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) For high-altitude evaporative and/or refueling emission compliance for each evaporative/refueling emission family, the manufacturer shall follow one of the following procedures: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The manufacturer will select for testing under high-altitude conditions the one nonexempt vehicle previously selected under paragraph (b)(1)(vii)(B) or (b)(1)(vii)(C) of this section which is expected to have the highest level of evaporative and/or refueling emissions when operated at high altitude; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) [Reserved]. For guidance see &sect;86.096&hyph;24. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(ix) through (e)(2) [Reserved].

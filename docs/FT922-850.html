			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Scottish MPs press for Lanarkshire aid SCOTTISH MPs yesterday marked the cessation of steel production in Scotland by pressing the government to step up its assistance to Lanarkshire - the area surrounding the condemned Ravenscraig steelworks at Motherwell, David Owen writes. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, called on the government to take legal powers if necessary to ensure British Steel took responsibility for dealing with 'the legacy of dereliction they are leaving behind'. Above, Mr Dewar meets children from Braidhurst High School during a lobby of parliament by a delegation from the Motherwell area.</p>

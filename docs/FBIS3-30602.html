			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Feb 5 (TANJUG) -- German Chancellor Helmut  Kohl on Saturday accused Croatian President Franjo Tudjman of  violating international law by sending regular army troops to  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and threatened to suspend all economic aid  to Croatia. "Whoever changes borders through the use of force  cannot count on the support of Germany," Kohl said in the so far  sharpest statement addressed to Croatia, according to foreign  news agencies. Kohl spoke at a meeting of around 200 ranking  Western officials and security experts in Munich. Kohl, whose  country had wholeheartedly supported Croatia's forcible  secession from the former Yugoslav Federation, said he would  "not support anyone who oversteps the limits of normal,  acceptable behaviour under international law."    Germany was the one to push the then European Community into  recognizing Croatia in early January 1992. The U.N. Security  Council on Thursday threatened to introduce sanctions against  Croatia because of the presence of its regular army troops in  the war-torn former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    According to U.N. estimates, between 3,000 and 5,000 regular  Croatian Army troops are fighting on the side of Bosnian Croats  against the Muslims.</p>

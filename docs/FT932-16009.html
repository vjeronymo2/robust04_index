			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / World Trade News: Virgin to double size of its fleet VIRGIN Atlantic Airways, the UK long-haul airline, has confirmed it will double the size of its fleet by leasing four new Airbus A340-300 and four Boeing 747-400 aircraft. All eight will be leased from International Lease Financing Corp, based in Los Angeles and part of American International Group. Virgin has also taken an option on a new-generation Boeing 777 from ILFC and is negotiating directly with Boeing to acquire up to four 777s for delivery after 1996. The acquisitions will help counter criticism of the airline that its fleet of Boeing 747s is too old. 'By the middle of the decade, our passengers will be flying one of the world's youngest fleets to a growing number of destinations in the US and further afield,' said Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman. Mr Jean Pierson, Airbus Industrie's managing director, said the order was an important breakthrough in the UK airline business. A Pounds 4bn order British Airways had placed with Boeing in 1991 triggered an Airbus complaint to the European Commission. The first Airbus delivery to Virgin will be in October, with the Boeings coming next year.</p>

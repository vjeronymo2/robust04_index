			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / People: Atterton joins Guinness Mahon David Atterton, 66, an industrialist and former director of the Bank of England, has been persuaded to come out of semi-retirement and take on one of the more challenging jobs in the City - the chairmanship of Guinness Mahon Holdings. Guinness Mahon, now owned by Japan's Bank of Yokohama, has been looking for a new chairman for some months to replace Geoffrey Bell, 53, who is retiring after five years at the helm. Like many small merchant banks, Guinness Mahon's loan book has been been hit by the recession, but it has been recapitalised and with a strong parent and a new management team it is keen to re-establish its name in London merchant banking circles. Although Guinness Mahon is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a Japanese bank it intends to maintain its own identity and has been keen to recruit a figurehead who commands respect in the City. Headhunter firm Norman Broadbent was hired to find a suitable candidate. Atterton has the right credentials. A former chief executive of Foseco, he has sat on the boards of Marks and Spencer, 3i, and Barclays Bank, as well as the Bank of England. He remains a director of Rank Organisation and British Coal. In addition, he describes himself as a Japanophile who speaks 'idiot' Japanese. He was one of the first British industrialists to set up a subsidiary in Japan which he chaired for 20 years. He says that the idea of chairing a Japanese subsidiary in Britain appealed to him. Although the initial idea was that he would do one day a week at GM, he expects to do 'significantly more'.</p>

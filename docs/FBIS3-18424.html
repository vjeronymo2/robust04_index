"The downing of the four Serbian aircraft happened after a  clear breach of the no-fly zone over Bosnia set up by the United  Nations. All the sides know the consequences of breaking this  no-fly ban. The aircraft refused to comply with warnings from  the U.S. NATO aircraft before they were shot down," a statement  from Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal said.    The foreign minister pointed out that there have been a  growing number of violations of the flight ban over Bosnia. The  action was carried out on the basis of a resolution by the UN  Security Council on 31 March 1993, and NATO was asked to  implement the resolution on behalf of the United Nations.    "It is important that the ban on flights be upheld, if UN  resolutions are to be credible," Godal said.</p>

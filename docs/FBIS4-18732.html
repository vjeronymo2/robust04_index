			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 11 (AFP) -- France called Monday [11  April] for an urgent relaunching of the Bosnia peace process as  weekend NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serbs besieging the  UN-protected Goradze enclave met with a chorus of approval from  Western states.    Speaking on the Europe 1 radio station, Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe said: "What worries me is that the diplomatic  process is stalling. What I want, and it is relatively urgent,  is for the diplomatic process to be reintegrated into a coherent  format.    ``A (peace) plan exists, the European Union's,'' he said,  refering to a plan for the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina into  three mini-states and a conditional and phased lifting of  sanctions against Serbia, accused of backing Bosnian Serb forces.    Juppe said negotiations should "resume on that basis and I  invite all parties, including the Serbs. The only possible  solution (to the war) is (to be found) around the negotiating  table." The French minister is due to hold talks later Monday  with Yasushi Akashi, the UN special representative in Bosnia, a  Foreign Ministry spokesman here said. Juppe welcomed Sunday's  strikes by two U.S. F-16s, but said "they were delayed a bit too  long."    In Bonn, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said the  action  by North Atlantic Treaty Organisation fighter-bombers was  "justified, necessary and proper. Gorazde is a particularly  dramatic case, it is right and proper that this action took  place," Kinkel told public service WDR radio. "I hope that the  (Bosnian) Serbs will finally understand, or else NATO could be  forced to intervene again," he warned, adding that the Moslem  enclave in eastern Bosnia was a "new important symbol after  Sarajevo."    Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas said she was  "pleased that NATO planes have now intervened to stop the Serb  invasion of Gorazde and protect the civilians and UN personnel  in the area." But she was critical of the United Nations'  recent inaction in the region, saying more decisive action  "could have been displayed earlier."    The Netherlands also expressed support for the action in a  statement released in The Hague by the Foreign Ministry.    Earlier Russian President Boris Yeltsin called for the UN  Security Council to discuss the NATO air strikes against the  Serbs and said Russia must be consulted prior to such attacks,  the ITAR-TASS news agency said.    "I insisted and I insist that such questions as shelling of  Serb positions cannot be decided without talks beforehand  between Russia and the United States," ITAR-TASS news agency  quoted Yeltsin as saying prior to his departure for a visit to  Spain.    Kinkel meanwhile called on Russia to use its influence with  the Serbs to halt the offensive on Gorazde, which occupies a  strategic site on the road from Belgrade to the self-styled  Bosnian Serb capital of Pale.    The Serbs on Monday announced they were suspending all  contacts with the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in protest at  the air strikes.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Guinness chief raises Pounds 2.87m from options Mr Anthony Tennant, chairman of Guinness, the drinks group, made a profit of Pounds 2.87m last year by exercising options on about 900,000 shares granted to him after he took over the chair in 1987. Mr Tennant, who is to retire at the end of this year, sold most of the shares at about 500p each, having been granted the options at prices ranging from 150p to 180p. The group's annual report, published on Tuesday, showed that he still holds 145,838 shares and has options on a further 312,090, which must be exercised within 12 months of leaving the company. Mr Tennant, who has taken Guinness from a market capitalisation of Pounds 3bn to Pounds 11.5bn and raised pre-tax profits from Pounds 408m to Pounds 956m during the past five years, was paid a total of Pounds 781,000 in salary and performance-related bonus last year, a rise of 19 per cent in line with the rise in group profits.</p>

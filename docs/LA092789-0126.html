			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INGRAM MICRO D BUYS BELGIAN SOFTWARE FIRM TO GAIN BASE IN EUROPE  </P> <P> Intent on becoming a big player in the fast-growing European computer market,  Ingram Micro D has acquired a Belgian software distributor for an undisclosed  sum.  </P> <P> Chairman Linwood A. (Chip) Lacy said the company's purchase of Brussels-based  Softeurop will serve as "the critical base in our European expansion strategy."  </P> <P> Ingram Micro D, based in Santa Ana, is the leading wholesaler of personal  computer products in the United States. Softeurop is a leading distributor of  American-made software products in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.  </P> <P> Softeurop, to be renamed Ingram Softeurop, will be owned primarily by Ingram  Micro D. However, the Belgian firm's current management will retain a small  ownership in the company, said Mark R. Briggs, Ingram's chief financial  officer.  </P> <P> Briggs said Ingram Micro D, the company formed in April by Nashville-based  Ingram Industries' acquisition of Micro D of Santa Ana, has had only modest  sales in Europe up to now.  </P> <P> "We intend to become a major player in the European market in the next several  years," Briggs said. "The European market is growing very fast, and the  penetration of personal computers (into homes and offices) is less than in the  United States."  </P> <P> Briggs described the European market as "very fragmented," with distributors  concentrating on particular countries and not the continent as a whole.  </P> <P> "There's really no one handling European distribution in a country-to-country  way," he said. "We think the reduction of trade barriers in Europe in 1992  provides untapped potential."  </P> <P> Ingram's Lacy said the company has been evaluating the European marketplace  "for some time . . . looking for just the right solid, successful company with  which to join forces."  </P> <P> He said Softeurop made an attractive acquisition because it has "a history of  success, strong management, an aggressive strategy to expand . . . and an  organization that executes smoothly."  </P> <P> Softeurop, founded in 1983, is the leading distributor of software manufactured  by Microsoft, Lotus Development and Ashton-Tate in Belgium, Luxembourg and the  Netherlands. The company also has a subsidiary in France.  </P> <P> "By 1995, we expect Ingram Softeurop to be the major, full-assortment  distributor of microcomputer products throughout Europe," Lacy said.  </P></p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Rise in drachma hits shares The Greek drachma, bolstered by high interest rates, rose yesterday against both the D-Mark and the dollar, but banks said the currency crisis was causing a severe liquidity squeeze. It closed at Dr147.5 to the D-Mark, up from Dr149 on Tuesday, and at Dr244.4 to the dollar, up from Dr245.1. However, investor nervousness prompted a wave of selling yesterday on the Athens stock exchange, fuelled by rumours that the government plans to issue a one-month treasury bill with an interest rate of more than 30 per cent. The index dropped by 5.5 per cent to a two-year low, bringing losses for the week to around 10 per cent. Brokers said many investors were disposing of mutual fund holdings in order to invest in short-term government paper. Analysts said government efforts to defend the currency by raising short-term interest rates to triple-digit figures had proved successful, but only at the expense of stifling the banking system. The drachma has been under pressure for the past 10 days, since the government decided to lift capital controls. One banker said: 'It's a grim situation. The interbank market is practically dead after 10 days of pressure and would-be borrowers are being turned away.'</p>

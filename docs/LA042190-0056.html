			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FIRST MEASLES DEATH IN COUNTY IS CONFIRMED;  </P> <P> EPIDEMIC: SECOND VACCINATIONS ARE BEING URGED FOR CHILDREN AS THE COUNTY  RECORDS 625 CONFIRMED OR PROBABLE CASES OF THE DISEASE THIS YEAR.  </P> <P> An autopsy has confirmed that measles killed a 10-year-old San Diego boy in  February, making him the first county resident to die in an epidemic that has  intensified over the last two months.  </P> <P> Blood test results this week confirmed that Hector Lopez had measles, and not  some other disease that might have contributed to his Feb. 22 death, Deputy  Coroner Robert Engel said Friday. The cause of death is listed as measles, with  complications from inflammation of the heart.  </P> <P> By the middle of this week, 625 confirmed or probable cases of measles had been  recorded in San Diego County this year, said county public health officer Dr.  Donald Ramras.  </P> <P> That is nearly 40% higher than occurred in 1982, the last year in which there  was a significant outbreak.  </P> <P> County and state public health officials say they know what they would do to  stop San Diego County's epidemic if they had the money:  </P> <P> * Give a second dose of measles vaccine to every schoolchild who hasn't had two  doses and perhaps also to every child entering junior high or college this  year.  </P> <P> * Conduct aggressive immunization campaigns in low-income communities.  </P> <P> * Hold mass-immunization clinics in schools and other community locations.  </P> <P> * Open public health clinics at night and on weekends for immunizations.  </P> <P> "There's absolutely no question a second dose should be done. None," said  Ramras. "Our advice that we give is based on what we think is best for San  Diego. But what we, the health department, can offer to the people who come to  us is predicated on what we get through the state."  </P> <P> But even $5.8 million more for the entire state, approved Wednesday by the  governor, will not allow such steps to be taken, said John Dunajski, assistant  chief of the California immunization program.  </P> <P> The extra money will barely cover what had been an expected shortfall of funds  for first-dose measles vaccine, Dunajski said.  </P> <P> The state, under a federal program, provides low-cost measles vaccine to  counties. But the number of doses subsidized through this federal effort has  stayed the same, even as demand has increased. The federal government, though  recommending the second dose, only provides the low-cost vaccine for first  doses.  </P> <P> In Dallas, where 1,931 cases of measles have occurred so far this year, the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control is sponsoring a massive immunization project  today at 19 sites.  </P> <P> In San Diego, county health clinics, strapped by years of funding shortages,  give immunizations only a few hours a week, and no special immunization hours  are planned.  </P> <P> Instead, public health nurses have concentrated on quick investigations of  every suspected measles case, said Sandy Ross, immunization project coordinator  for the county.  </P> <P> The investigators give isolation instructions to family and friends if they  begin showing symptoms. Exposed people also may be given vaccine or immune  globulin shots to prevent or minimize cases that do arise.  </P> <P> In some schools and day-care centers, children who are considered susceptible  to measles have been excluded from school for two weeks, at the health  department's request, when a measles case crops up in a classroom, Ross added.  </P> <P> Public health officials say they are painfully aware that these steps don't  address the real reasons for measles' spread -- unimmunized preschoolers and  older children whose first dose of measles vaccine did not work.  </P> <P> Ross noted that the Lopez boy who died was one of the children whose earlier  vaccine had failed.  </P> <P> The U.S. Public Health Service issued guidelines in December recommending a  second measles vaccine for children just before they enter school, for all  students entering college and for all medical personnel.  </P> <P> The recommendation was issued in hopes of preventing the 35% to 40% of measles  cases affecting persons older than 5 years in whom a first dose did not result  in immunity, the health service said.  </P> <P> However, there are no plans in San Diego County to inoculate all entering  kindergartners a second time against measles because there is no money to do  it, Ramras said. He said it would cost $700,000 for vaccine to do that  countywide.  </P> <P> Statewide, it would cost at least $5 million just for the vaccine to inoculate  kindergartners and college freshmen, Dunajski said.  </P> <P> Ramras concedes that it isn't much comfort turning the issue of whether to get  a second measles vaccination over to parents, since the inoculations are  expensive.  </P> <P> Just buying the vaccine itself to give shots to his three teen-age and young  adult children cost $75, Ramras said. At a private doctor's office, a shot  costs $30 to $40, and many insurance policies don't cover the cost.  </P> <P> If the usual annual cycle holds, the number of new measles cases will taper off  as the year progresses and then pick up again next winter.  </P> <P> In the meantime, because the most serious measles cases often occur in babies,  health officials are recommending that infants be immunized at 12 months, three  months earlier than usual. But early immunization increases the chance that the  child won't have permanent immunity, so a second shot between ages 4 and 6  would be necessary.  </P> <P> Because of the San Diego outbreak, parents might want to ask their doctors  about inoculating babies as young as 6 months, Ramras said. Such children would  need a second shot at 15 months and again at school age.  </P> <P> Older children who never received a second MMR (measles, mumps and rubella)  shot also should receive a second dose -- even if they are past their teen-age  years. Anyone born after 1957 is considered at risk, because of problems with  the early vaccine.  </P> <P> Measles begins with cold symptoms and progresses to a high fever and a severe  rash. Complications can include dehydration, pneumonia, ear infection and  encephalitis. Encephalitis can leave permanent brain damage.  </P> <P> The measles virus is spread through the air, even as long as an hour after the  infected person has left a room. It also can be spread before the infected  person is aware of having the disease. This makes it particularly important for  parents to leave uninfected children at home when going to doctors' offices or  an emergency room, health officials say.  </P> <P> Southern California has had a measles outbreak since 1987, but San Diego's did  not take hold until last year. Los Angeles officials had recorded 1,407 measles  cases and six deaths by the end of March.  </P> <P> On Friday, there were four children in Children's Hospital in San Diego because  of measles complications, including one infant who has been on life-support  equipment for nearly three months.  </P></p>

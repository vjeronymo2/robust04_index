			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Coda heads for market with Pounds 62m price tag Coda is coming to the main market through a placing at 235p a share, valuing the North Yorkshire-based computer software company at Pounds 61.7m. US investors are taking a strong interest in the company, which derived almost half of its Pounds 23.5m revenues last year from the North American market. SG Warburg Securities, which is handling the placing, said there would be 26.24m shares in issue following the placing - 8.2m were being placed on behalf of existing shareholders and 2.45m on behalf of Coda. Dealings are expected to start on February 9. General Atlantic Partners, a US private investment group which specialises in the computing services industry, is spending Pounds 6.16m to acquire 10 per cent of the shares. A further 250,000 shares have been reserved for placement with institutional investors in the US. The p/e is 24.5 at the placing price, with a gross dividend yield of 1.1 per cent. The net amount raised, after expenses, will be Pounds 5m which Coda intends to use to develop further its range of international accounting software and to expand geographically. Competitors include SAP, the fast-growing German company, which this week reported a 15 per cent surge in net profits for 1993, indic-ating a buoyant market for large scale accountancy software.</p>

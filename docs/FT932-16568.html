			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Deals signal lower lending margins in UK SIGNS that lending margins are falling again for UK companies that are regarded as strong credits were confirmed on Friday with the launch of a Pounds 125m syndicated loan for Northern Foods. The five-year loan, arranged by NM Rothschild and Midland Bank, will pay a margin of 37.5 basis points over Libor - comfortably below the level of around 45 basis points established by several deals for UK companies last year. The terms on the Northern Foods syndicated loan are identical to those on a recent five-year, Pounds 100m deal for Reuters, led by Warburg. Bankers said Northern Foods, though well regarded, was not thought as strong a credit as Reuters. However, Rothschild reported good initial interest from Northern Foods' relationship banks, at whom the loan is targeted. 'These two deals have established a new corporate benchmark in the UK corporate loan market, at least for good credits,' one banker said. The lower lending margins on the two deals were attributed to the shortage of high-quality corporate borrowers in the syndicated loans market.</p>

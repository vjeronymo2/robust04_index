			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEB. 15 LOCKOUT SET, BUT OWNERS HINT SOFTENING;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: TALKS RESUME MONDAY WITH POSSIBILITY THAT MANAGEMENT OFFER WOULD BE  MODIFIED TO REMOVE "PERFORMANCE" ASPECT OF PLAN FOR YOUNGER PLAYERS.  </P> <P> Baseball's owners reaffirmed Friday that a lockout of spring training camps  will begin Feb. 15, unless the Major League Players Assn. agrees to the concept  of revenue sharing.  </P> <P> However, in a news conference after the owners meeting, there seemed to be a  dedicated attempt to avoid using the word lockout, a softening of both position  and rhetoric, and the hint that key elements in the revenue-sharing proposal  will be withdrawn or changed when collective-bargaining negotiations resume  Monday in New York.  </P> <P> The owners' meeting had been portrayed by Charles O'Connor, general counsel of  the owners' Player Relations Committee, as a deadline for deciding if there was  enough time to open the camps by Feb. 15. But indicative of the conciliatory  tone Friday was optimism expressed by O'Connor and others that a settlement by  Monday or Tuesday would permit an opening as scheduled.  </P> <P> Bud Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers and chairman of the PRC, said in the  news conference that he felt clubs would be in position to open spring training  within four or five days of an agreement.  </P> <P> Barring major changes in the revenue-sharing proposal, a Monday or Tuesday  resolution seems doubtful. The union has said that the proposal is designed  strictly to lower salaries and eliminate the free-agent market.  </P> <P> Asked Friday if there will be changes in the proposal Monday, O'Connor said his  staff will talk over the weekend and try to take new ideas to the table. He  alluded to discussions in the owners' meeting and said:  </P> <P> "It's impossible to come to a meeting of this type and not have been educated.  You're bound to take some of that education back to the talks. Whether that's  reflected (in a change) on page one of the proposal or page two, I don't know.  </P> <P> "Monday, we'll discuss where we are. If the opportunity presents itself, there  could be a change in rhetoric, a change in discussion, a change in the  proposal. I don't know if it will happen Monday, but it will happen at some  point."  </P> <P> It was speculated Friday that the pay-for-performance aspect, criticized by  both owners and players, is almost certain to be withdrawn. That provision  calls for salaries of players with zero to six years of major league service to  be determined by a two-year statistical table that fails to account for  defense, character and intangible contributions. It would also eliminate  arbitration and both guaranteed and multiyear contracts for players in that  category.  </P> <P> The PRC has consistently said that pay for performance was only a suggested  means of allocation.  </P> <P> O'Connor reiterated Friday that the key component for the clubs is knowing how  much revenue to budget for salaries. Cost certainty, he calls it. The proposal  calls for 48% of the clubs' gate and national TV income to go toward salaries.  Even if that was raised to the 53% of total revenue that players in the NBA  receive, there is some question if the union will accept revenue sharing, with  its inherent restrictions on free agency and arbitration.  </P> <P> Don Fehr, the union's executive director, has cited current prosperity and said  the PRC has been unable or unwilling to demonstrate a current or future need  for revenue sharing.  </P> <P> "We've never premised this proposition on making every club profitable,"  O'Connor said Friday. "The industry is obviously healthy. Profitability is not  our goal, nor are we debating large and small markets.  </P> <P> "When you look at the history of the last 10 years, what we're trying to  resolve is the question of what percentage of revenues are the players entitled  to. We're not tied to any one part or detail of it, but we think that revenue  sharing is the best way to put stability in the relationship."  </P> <P> None of the spokesmen were willing to say how long the owners would pursue  revenue sharing if the union continued to resist. Asked about the scheduled  opening of the season on April 2, Commissioner Fay Vincent said a group of  general managers was studying the question of how much spring training would be  necessary to maintain that date.  </P> <P> "My own guess is roughly three weeks," Vincent said, meaning he could go to  mid-March before jeopardizing the start of the season.  </P> <P> Questioned about the public reaction to a spring lockout, Vincent said, "the  public is as eager to have baseball as we are and the players are. This will  not be something to celebrate. There are significant negative consequences. But  I also don't think the public cares about strategy. I think the public wants  baseball in accord with the baseball schedule."  </P> <P> It is believed, in that regard, that Vincent ultimately will order the camps  opened to preserve the start of the season. He reiterated, however, that he is  not inclined to issue such an order while the parties are still at the table.  </P> <P> "I'm trying to find ways to be relevant and helpful, but I believe in the  process," he said.  </P> <P> Vincent brought union and management representatives together three times last  week, and his behind-the-scenes involvement, sources said, contributed to the  conciliatory tone Friday.  </P> <P> Although there had been media speculation that several clubs oppose a lockout,  Selig insisted that Friday's meeting, which lasted only two hours, was  "non-confrontational in every sense."  </P> <P> Reading from a statement at the news conference, Selig said changes in strategy  and bargaining position were not requested or made during the meeting, and that  the ownership remained entirely supportive of the negotiating team.  </P> <P> Selig said there was no need for a vote since ownership had passed resolutions  in July and December in support of PRC strategy, including a lockout.  </P> <P> He said the Feb. 15 deadline put pressure on both sides, but "we're not in a  position yet where we have to sit and wonder how many days of spring training  are we going to have. The camps will not open on Feb. 15 if we don't have an  agreement, but there's time to reach that agreement. We're going back to the  table Monday and we'll be there every day."  </P> <P> Technically, players are not required to be in spring training until Feb. 28.  Players who report earlier do so on a voluntary basis. O'Connor said that given  the time structure, he was hesitant to call it a lockout until late March or a  date when the regular season was actually affected.  </P> <P> He said that major league managers and coaches would not be permitted to join  minor league workouts, but that injured players receiving treatment could  continue to receive it at their home or spring training stadium. He said no  decision had been reached as to the possibility of playing the exhibition  schedule with minor leaguers.  </P> <P> Most owners left for the airport while the news conference was in progress or  later refused comment, saying members of the PRC would talk for them.  </P> <P> Said Marge Schott, owner of the Cincinnati Reds:  </P> <P> "There's still time for the camps to open, but if there's no agreement, we'll  support the PRC. I'm sure they'll work out something that's best for baseball.  We all care what the fans think, myself in particular."  </P> <P> Fehr, meeting with players in Phoenix, said a Feb. 15 shutdown represented a  lockout no matter what O'Connor or anyone else called it, and he reiterated  that the absence of genuine bargaining by management is likely to result in a  legal action by the union.  </P> <P> Of the fans, he said, "I think it's going to be hard for an industry that just  signed a $1.5-billion television contract to generate any sympathy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> LOCKOUT ISSUES  </P> <P> WHAT OWNERS WANT  </P> <P> -Revenue sharing. Players would be guaranteed 48% of the money from ticket  sales and broadcast contracts.  </P> <P> -Pay-for-performance. Players with fewer than six years of major league service  would be paid on one-year, nonguaranteed contracts according to statistical  formulas. Each team would pay 1/26th of the total for these players.  </P> <P> -Participation level. Teams going above predetermined payroll levels could not  sign free agents from other clubs.  </P> <P> WHAT PLAYERS WANT  </P> <P> -Salary arbitration. Eligibility restored to players with between two and three  years of service.  </P> <P> -Rosters. Restored to 25 players.  </P> <P> -Minimum salary. A raise from $68,000 to between $100,000 and $125,000.  </P> <P> -Free agency. Players removed from 40-man roster and sent to minors on outright  assignments would become free agents. Draft pick compensation for free agents  would be eliminated.  </P> <P> -Collusion. Automatic penalties for collusion.  </P> <P> -Benefits. An increase tied to the new television contracts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHO BENEFITS FROM EXHIBITION GAMES?  </P> <P> A LOOK AT WHOSE INCOME IS IN JEOPARDY  </P> <P> THE CACTUS LEAGUE  </P> <P> ANGELS  </P> <P> FACILITY: Mesa, Gene Autry Park: Owned/operated City of Mesa.

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / International Company News: Sweden merges Gota and Nordbanken ahead of sale The Swedish government yesterday announced the merger of Nordbanken and Gota Bank, two of the country's five biggest banks. Between them, they have taken the lion's share of state aid which has been handed out since a loan-loss crisis last year crippled the banking sector. The new wholly state-owned bank will become the country's largest in terms of market share, ahead of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Swedbank and Svenska Handelsbanken, which all survived the crisis without falling under state control. The government said it intended to privatise the merged bank, but not until late 1994 at the earliest. Yesterday's announcement underlined the extent to which the government has been forced to use taxpayers' money to keep the banks afloat, although it said further commitments should not be necessary. The state is to put up SKr30.4bn (Dollars 3.66bn) in aid to stabilise Gota before it is taken over by Nordbanken. This will bring to SKr92.1bn the total amount of aid pledged to the banking sector since the crisis erupted in 1992. Gota is to receive a capital injection of SKr20bn and new equity worth SKr3.1bn. The state will also provide SKr7.3bn in equity and guarantees to Retriva, the so-called 'bad bank' which will lift SKr43bn in bad loans out of Gota. Retriva will stay in government hands. The state has already pumped SKr16.2bn into Nordbanken and SKr35bn into Securum, another 'bad bank' which took on Nordbanken sour loans totalling SKr67bn. Despite the scale of support for Nordbanken - which allowed it to bounce back into profits this year - and for Gota Bank, the government insisted their merger was not against the interests of competition in Swedish banking. Previously SE Banken, Handelsbanken and General Electric of the US - the only foreign suitor - dropped out of the bidding for Gota. They said the price was too high. 'The two banks are a compliment to each other, and it is the best alternative from a competitive standpoint,' said Mr Odd Engstrom, chairman of the Bank Support Authority. He said the two combined would give taxpayers a better return when privatised than if they had been sold off separately. He said the authority would seek to 'claw back' some of the capital it had injected into Nordbanken when setting a price for Gota. The authority has set a minimum price of SKr3.1bn, but clearly wants Nordbanken to pay much more. Mr Engstrom said independent studies had valued the synergy effects of the merger at between SKr1.5bn and SKr2.5bn. The banks will have combined assets approaching SKr400m, less than Swedbank and SE Banken. However, they will have a leading 24 per cent share of the country's total lending and deposit market, with 400 branches and 7,000 employees. Mr Per Lundberg, head of Gota since September 1992, said he would leave. Mr Hans Dalborg, chief executive of Nordbanken, said the main effect of the merger would be a rationalisation of head office functions.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   State support for Swedish banks??  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                            SKr(bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Swedbank                                       8.0 Nordbanken                                    16.2 Securum*                                      35.0 Foreningsbanken                                2.5 Gota Bank Capital                                       20.0 Equity                                         3.1 Equity for Retriva**                           3.8 Guarantee for Retriva**                                      3.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                                         92.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Min return from sale of Gota                   3.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Net total                                     89.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ??

Attending the tea party were provincial leaders, including  Gu  Jinchi, Xu Wencai, Yu Junbo, Xiao Zuofu, Sun Qi, Gao Jizhong,  Zhang Chenglun, and Ma Pinfang; as well as representative  personages from the non-public units throughout the province.  They happily got together to jointly view the Spring Festival.    Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee,  delivered a speech on behalf of the provincial party committee  and the provincial people's government, in which he extended  cordial regards and festive greetings to the participating  comrades. He said: By the end of 1993, the number of  individually run industrial and commercial enterprises and  privately owned ones throughout the province reached 753 and  involved 1.3 million persons. Both the number of enterprises  and number of people involved topped previous peaks.  Non-publicly-owned enterprises and units have become an  important force in the promotion of development in the  province's economy. The situation prevailing among these  enterprises or units is very gratifying.    In his speech, Gu Jinchi urged party committees and  governments at all levels to continuously give regular guidance  and support to the work of organizations under the provincial  federation of industry and commerce. He also urged the  organizations of industrial and commercial federations across  the province and the representative personages of non-public  units to further emancipate their minds; to seek truth from  facts; to unite as one; to work industriously; and to strive  together with the people throughout the province to realize the  second pioneering program, to restore the province's glorious  prestige, and to build socialism with Chinese characteristics.</p>

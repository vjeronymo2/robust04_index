			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 9 (YONHAP) -- Chinese Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi said Thursday his country  has decided to allow formal imports of Korean-made automobiles.    At a meeting with his South Korean counterpart Kim Chol-su,  Wu said, "We decided to formally import Korean-made automobiles  although we are in a difficult situation." China's trade  minister, meanwhile, asked the Korean side to cooperate in  importing Chinese products. Wu noted that it would be difficult  for China to import Korean-made vehicles on a cash basis,  hinting that Beijing wants to import the automobiles on a  counterpurchase basis.    During the meeting, the Korean side demanded that China  allow  in 5,000 Korean cars. The Chinese, however, failed to set a  specific target, according to a Ministry of Trade, Industry and  Energy official.    "We think the export contract will pave the way for formal  exports of Korean-made automobiles to China," the official said.  "Daewoo's export contract will not be just a one-time contract  and domestic manufacturers could export (their cars) to China  continually."    Daewoo Motor Co. has signed a contract with a Chinese firm  to  ship out 5,000 Lemans, Espero and Prince autos to China around  August or September, according to sources.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / By-election threat to NZ government: South Island voters could end National's majority Christchurch may be the largest city in New Zealand's South Island, but it is not usually the hub of the nation's political life. This week is different. For the past few days, top politicians such as Mr Bill Birch, the finance minister, Ms Helen Clark, the embattled leader of the opposition Labour party, and Mr Jim Anderton, who broke away from Labour to form a coalition of five left-leaning minority parties called the Alliance, have been rubbing shoulders there. Jim Bolger, the prime minister, arrived last night. The reason for this turnout is a by-election to be held on Saturday in the Selwyn constituency which threatens to end New Zealand's fragile political stability. According to the latest opinion polls, Mr Bolger's National party could lose the seat, and with it, the majority that has allowed National to govern for nine months. Mr Bolger, anxious to deter voters from risking this option, has said that it would be 'a disaster'. A general election would be one possible outcome, but by no means guaranteed. What is certain, he claims, is that financial markets would take fright, causing the New Zealand dollar to fall, inflationary pressures to mount, and interest rates to rise. By contrast, Mr Anderton - whose party looks most likely to snatch the seat from National - has talked soothingly of allowing the Bolger government to remain in office. The opposition parties would simply insist that it act in a consultative manner, passing only those measures on which consensus had been achieved. 'They could govern,' he says 'but they just couldn't do what they want.' Last month, when Ms Ruth Richardson, the former finance minister who held Selwyn for National at the November general election, announced that she was quitting politics, few observers thought matters would pan out this way. Selwyn is a curious constituency, encircling Christchurch in horseshoe fashion. Historically, the electorate has been dominated by Canterbury Plains farming communities, who tended to back National. But boundary changes before the general election last November added parts of Christchurch's urban hinterland, such as Belfast and Kaiapoi. These are blue-collar communities which traditionally vote Labour. About half the current Selwyn electorate receives some form of welfare payment, according to census data, and the threatened closure of local hospitals under the government's health service reforms has been a dominant issue in the by-election campaign. The boundary changes may partly explain why Ms Richardson saw her majority cut to just 888 votes last November from more than 5,400 in 1990. Nevertheless, when she stepped down last month, few commentators thought the Bolger government would be at risk. National, it was argued, would retain its 'bedrock' rural support. Non-National voters, angry at the government's squeeze on welfare payments and slow to feel the benefits of economic recovery, were expected to split their protest vote between Labour and the Alliance. An AGB-McNair opinion poll, based on a 400-voter sample and taken on Monday night, showed National set to win 30 per cent of the vote, the Alliance 27 and Labour 9. Immediately after Ms Richardson resigned, the figures were 33 per cent, 15 per cent, and 23 per cent respectively. Since then, the Trade Union Federation, the umbrella body for about a dozen unions, has thrown its weight behind the Alliance. This, the TUF stresses, is not a long-term defection from Labour, but the only way to stop National. The Labour-to-Alliance shift is not hard to understand. Mr Anderton promulgates old-style 'tax and spend' policies and has played his cards adroitly since the last election when his party won more than 18 per cent of the vote but only two of the 99 seats. Labour, by contrast, has big internal problems. Ms Clark ousted Mr Mike Moore as leader soon after the election defeat. But her personal popularity rating is much lower than her predecessor's, and Labour's financially-conservative but socially-liberal policies are tough to sell. Ms Clark calls Labour's approach 'responsible, but with a heart'. For many reform-weary New Zealanders who do not believe that National's quest for financial virtue is building a desirable society, this is fudge. If the Alliance wins the seat on Saturday, National would be reduced to 49 seats, while Labour would have 45, the Alliance three and NZ First two. Mr Peter Tapsell, the speaker, is drawn from Labour ranks, and has made clear that his primary responsibility would be to maintain the status quo. In the event of a confidence vote, for example, he would support a Bolger government. Mr Anderton has said the Alliance would do likewise. Whether this would still allow Mr Bolger to plead 'an inability to govern' and ask the governor-general to call a general election, is debatable. Asked yesterday about this, Mr Bolger said it was 'not currently in my thinking'. In any case, such a request might be rebuffed; the governor-general might very well ask Ms Clark, as leader of the biggest opposition party, to try to form a government. Further clouding matters is New Zealand's decision to move to a proportional representation system. Under this, half the MPs will represent specific constituencies and the remainder will be drawn from party lists. The move was supported by a majority of voters last November, but the administrative changes will not be completed until next year. An election under the new system would benefit minor parties such as the Alliance and, given the wafer-thin majorities at present, most pundits believe that the country would go the polls under the new system in 1995.</p>

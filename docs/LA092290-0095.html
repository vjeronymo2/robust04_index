			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS / BOND MEASURES;  </P> <P> VOTERS FACE FIVE TAX-RAISING PROPOSITIONS  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates came to the City  Council with what he considered urgent business: Thousands of 911 emergency  calls went unanswered each week, the chief said, and the only solution was to  purchase for $235 million a new state-of-the-art system.  </P> <P> Gates proposed taking the matter directly to voters with a bond measure.  </P> <P> "I'm hoping to get it on in November," he said, "before they realize what's  happening."  </P> <P> What's happening is that bond measures like the one Gates proposed are making a  comeback as a post-Proposition 13 approach to funding public improvements  without raising taxes.  </P> <P> Originally banned under the historic Jarvis-Gann tax initiative, California  voters reinstated general obligation bonds four years ago with passage of  Proposition 46. Since then, measures have begun to pop up on local ballots  throughout the state, and this November, Los Angeles voters will decide on no  less than five such measures -- two proposed by the city and three by the  county.  </P> <P> Los Angeles city and county officials, whose financial woes began with  Proposition 13 and have worsened with state and federal budget cuts, see bonds  as something of a godsend.  </P> <P> Since passage of Proposition 46, city voters have approved five bond measures  for a variety of projects that could add as much as $61.69 to the average tax  bill. The two measures on the city ballot in November could bring that total to  $96.84, but analysts say the real amount is unlikely to reach that figure.  </P> <P> Bonds make it possible to raise tax money beyond the 1% property tax limit set  by Proposition 13. Approval of two-thirds of the voters is required, and there  are strict limitations: bond money may be spent only on real property and  borrowing may not be done to meet operating expenses.  </P> <P> With general-obligation bonds, governments can borrow money at  lower-than-normal interest rates. Lenders are willing to accept lower interest  payments because there is very little risk in their investment. Each issue  finances a specific capital project and pay-back comes from a specific tax  tacked onto every property owner's bill.  </P> <P> In addition to the 911 measure, city voters on Nov. 6 will be asked to approve  $100 million worth of bonds to pay for the preservation of affordable housing  and homeless shelters.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County voters will be asked to raise their property taxes by  approving an $817 million bond measure -- the largest in the county's history  -- to pay for park improvements.  </P> <P> County voters have approved one such measure in recent years -- $96 million for  jail construction -- and officials are considering putting bond measures on the  1992 ballot to pay for replacing the aging hospital system and bring county  buildings up to earthquake safety standards.  </P> <P> Its fate may be linked to two other measures on the ballot that would generate  money for county coffers in something of the old-fashioned way: raising taxes.  Proposition A would provide money for jails, Proposition C would fund  transportation improvements. Each would boost the sales tax by a half-penny on  the dollar.  </P> <P> With all these competing bids to squeeze money from the populace, some  officials have begun wondering whether voters have reached the limit of their  generosity.  </P> <P> "Enough is enough," said City Councilman Nate Holden, who opposes one city bond  measure. "I think it's going to be very difficult for anything to pass this  time."  </P> <P> Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who as chairman of the Budget and Finance Committee  is a proponent of the bonds, said: "The people are willing to vote for bond  issues where they can see the connection between their tax bill and the benefit  it's going to create for them. But there's not a bottomless pit to these  things, and as the economy slows down the receptivity will wane."  </P> <P> Richard B. Dixon, the county's chief administrative officer, said he sees a  "limit to how much we can take to the electorate at any one time."  </P> <P> The county measures are opposed by Supervisor Pete Schabarum and the Howard  Jarvis Taxpayers Assn.  </P> <P> "I think the real test of where the tax revolt is will come with this  election," said Joel Fox, president of the association.  </P> <P> The organization has taken no position on the city measures because it has not  thoroughly reviewed them.  </P> <P> "There are literally hundreds of bond measures on the ballots and we can't be  everywhere and read all of them," said Kris Vosburgh, executive director of the  association. Vosburgh said nearly every every community in state has one or  more bond measures on the November ballot.  </P> <P>  Here are the bond and tax measures for the city and county of Los Angeles:  </P> <P> </P> <P> PROPOSITION A: COUNTY JAIL CONSTRUCTION  </P> <P> The measure would raise the sales tax by half a cent to seven cents on the  dollar to finance jail construction and operations and relieve overcrowding.  </P> <P> County bureaucrats also view the measure as a device to free funds for strapped  health and welfare programs.  </P> <P> The measure is the result of a successful lobbying effort in Sacramento by Los  Angeles County officials to obtain a new revenue source for escalating jail  costs. County officials won passage of legislation that allowed for a tax  increase for jails only by a simple majority. Usually, approval by two-thirds  of the voters is required for a tax increase.  </P> <P> The cost of housing prisoners has soared 458% from $76 million in 1980 to $348  million this year because of the dramatic increase in drug-related crime, said  Sheriff Sherman Block.  </P> <P> Block, who is pushing Proposition A, estimates that it will cost $1 billion a  year to operate the county jail system by 1995. The measure would raise $423  million a year and allow the county to move forward with an aggressive 20-year,  $3.5-billion plan to build 12 new jails for an estimated 42,230 inmates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PROPOSITION B: COUNTY PARKS  </P> <P> The largest bond measure in county history, it would boost property taxes to  pay for an $816-million array of recreational and cultural facilities.  </P> <P> The projects include restoring trout habitats, refurbishing the Hollywood Bowl,  building a mountain camp for troubled youths and upgrading beach and zoo  facilities. The measure also provides for use of unemployed youth in tree  planting and graffiti removal.  </P> <P> If approved, the owner of a home assessed at $250,000 would pay an additional  $19.85 the first year. The amount would increase to a high of $46.13 in the  fourth year before declining.  </P> <P> County parks director Rodney Cooper said the measure would ease the  department's budget woes by providing $200 million to refurbish deteriorating  county parks and recreational facilities.  </P> <P> However, county administrative officer Dixon contends that the measure places  an additional burden on the budget because it provides funds for park  acquisition without providing money for maintenance and operations of parks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PROPOSITION C: COUNTY TRANSIT PROJECTS  </P> <P> The measure would authorize a half-penny sales tax increase to fund transit  projects and county officials do not agree about it.  </P> <P> The tax, pushed by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, would raise $400 million  annually to build and operate rail systems, maintain bus service and make  street improvements. The half-cent sales tax increase would be in addition to  the $400 million in sales taxes already paid by county consumers under a  half-cent levy for transit approved in 1980.  </P> <P> County Supervisor Ed Edelman, chairman of the county Transportation Commission  and a usual Bradley ally, is taking no position of Proposition C because he  believes it is more important for Proposition A to pass. He fears that too many  tax measures on the ballot may lead to defeat of all.  </P> <P> The tax increase would make up for the cuts in federal transit funding that  have occurred over the last 10 years, said Neil Peterson, executive director of  the County Transportation Commission.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PROPOSITION J: 911 SYSTEM  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Police Department wants a new 911 and radio communication  system that would cost $235 million. So far this year, the department said,  more than 71,000 calls to 911 have gone unanswered and officials predict that  the number will be well over 100,000 for 1990.  </P> <P> The measure has the unanimous backing of the City Council and the endorsement  of Bradley. Little public opposition has emerged.  </P> <P> If approved, the measure will cost the owner of the average 1,500-square-foot  home $26.25 a year for the next 20 years, according to city figures.  </P> <P> For their money, taxpayers will get two new 911 centers to replace the one now  operating in a fourth-level sub-basement at City Hall East. Police officials  argue that two centers are necessary because an earthquake or other natural  disaster in a one-center system could knock out virtually all emergency  communication.  </P> <P> The new centers would cost $105 million, leaving $130 million to replace and  expand the police radio system.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PROPOSITION K: HOUSING PRESERVATION  </P> <P> Sponsored by City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, the measure would provide $85  million for low-interest secondary loans to nonprofit groups for buying and  rehabilitating "at-risk" housing. Another $15 million would be set aside to buy  and rehabilitate shelters for the homeless.  </P> <P> Housing units "at-risk" are structures that are either seismically unsafe or  categorized as "slums," according to a city report backing the measure. The  rehabilitation program could preserve 2,500 to 5,200 units or more.  </P> <P> But this method of financing housing has never been used in the city of Los  Angeles and questions remain about the legality of using general obligation  bonds for loans and grants to private developers, according to Keith Comrie,  the city administrative officer.  </P> <P> Questions also remain about the ability of nonprofit groups to use a large  infusion of money. The measure is backed by top state Democrats and  Republicans, anti-poverty advocates, real estate agents, Bradley and City  Council. Councilman Holden, the lone opponent, says taxpayers have become  "overly generous" in approving bond measures.  </P> <P> The cost to the average homeowner would be $7.75 a year for 20 years, according  to the city administrative office.  </P></p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Bonuses seen as route to end yearly pay rise Increasing use of bonus schemes is paving the way for an end to the annual pay rise, a report suggests today. The report by the Confederation of British Industry and Wyatt, the human resource and actuarial consultancy, says that employers are broadening their use of incentive and profit-related pay schemes. The adoption of such variable pay systems partly reflects a desire by employers to use them as a lever to break away from or reduce the annual rise in basic pay to which many remain committed. The growing popularity and sophistication of the schemes is arousing suspicion among some employees since they involve unconsolidated pay. For the same reason they are attractive to employers who want greater flexibility in their pay arrangements and want to reduce their pay bills if business deteriorates. Mr Oliver Overstall, Wyatt's UK director of compensation strategy, said: 'It is almost incredible that with record low inflation rates, many UK organisations still ratchet up their fixed pay costs by incremental additions to base pay.' The survey, which analysed 300 schemes in 100 companies, defines variable pay, widely adopted in the US, as the 'at risk' part of a wage packet, covering individual bonuses, team incentives, gain-sharing, share schemes, profit-sharing and spot awards - one-off payments for a job well done. The most generous types of variable pay, it says, are restricted share schemes and key-contributor schemes, usually confined to senior management. These can sometimes be worth up to 100 per cent of basic salary. The survey says that performance measures vary between different classes of staff. Profitability, revenue or income generation are most common among middle and senior management. Quality and speed are often used for clerical and supervisory staff. Production volume and quality measures tend to be adopted for manual workers. Companies are using different systems for different purposes, says the report, which says variable pay is not replacing performance-related pay but often complements it. Profit-related pay schemes approved by the Inland Revenue are gaining in popularity. Nearly one in 10 private-sector employees are covered by such schemes which give tax relief on an amount of pay linked to profit. One-sixth of those surveyed said they planned to introduce or extend a profit-sharing scheme in the next two years. Mr Overstall said: 'If UK employers want to maintain the competitive edge they have fought so painfully to achieve, it seems evident that they should, as quickly as possible, move the bulk of any pay increases into the truly variable element of their compensation framework.' This would give them a more flexible pay platform, he argued, and added: 'The demise of the universally held notion of the annual pay rise could then be on the cards in the UK.' Variable Pay Systems.

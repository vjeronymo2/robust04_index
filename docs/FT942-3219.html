			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (17): Battles loom in UK market - Competition will benefit the corporate sector The UK telecommunications market, already arguably the most open and competitive in the world, is about to become a veritable battleground. The main beneficiaries will be the corporate sector - particularly large telecoms users in the City of London. The qualification 'arguably' is needed because of the contrast with the United States, where competition is more striking. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest US long-distance carrier, has been forced by competition to relinquish more than 35 per cent of the long-distance market. In the UK, British Telecommunications still boasts a 90 per share of the total market for telecoms services, and according to most analysts' projections it will loosen its grip by only about three per cent a year. BT is not under the same pressure from 'equal access' regulation as AT&amp;T. The US carrier has to gain its custom through the explicit choice of customers in each case; by contrast, in the UK it is only the customers motivated to desert BT who have to act. Inertia means staying with the former monopoly supplier. The absence of 'equal access' in the UK undoubtedly gives BT an advantage over AT&amp;T, and is a prime source of contention between the operators in their claims about the 'equivalence' of their respective home markets. However, BT's 90 per cent market share is not a meaningful comparison with AT&amp;T's 65 per cent. BT's main competitor, Mercury Communications - 80 per cent owned by Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK's former imperial operator - started building its network only in 1984; outside the City of London, and in the residential market nationwide, it has only recently become a strong competitor to BT. Moreover, until a change in the regulatory regime in 1991, Mercury was BT's sole competitor, whereas AT&amp;T has had to fight head-on with MCI, Sprint and assorted re-sellers for more than a decade. The 1991 regulatory review gave as big a boost to UK competition as the initial privatisation of BT and licensing of Mercury in 1984. It abolished the BT/Mercury long-distance duopoly. And the government declared itself ready to licence almost any competent telecoms provider to offer services, on their own networks or across those of other operators, except for rival international infrastructure to that of BT and Mercury. Since 1991 more than 40 new operators have been licensed to provide UK telecoms services, both long-distance and local (the latter still largely a monopoly in the US). The effect has been to boost competition in all the main sectors. Taking them in turn, there have been three main consequences for the corporate sector: An intensification of long-distance competition. The National Grid, supported by the 12 privatised electricity companies in England and Wales, has established its own telecoms operator, 'Energis', which is erecting a third long-distance fibre-optic network across the National Grid's pylons. Energis claims that its overheads - in both senses of the term - are markedly lower than BT's and Mercury's, and it is about to start offering a commercial service. Energis is touting headline figures of around 15 per cent off existing long-distance tariffs, and has already won a 10-year contract with the BBC to operate a broadcast network for the distribution of the corporation's television and radio services in the UK. Several regional telecoms operators have also been licensed, mostly electricity companies working more or less in conjunction with Energis. The most ambitious is Torch Communications, a joint venture between Yorkshire Electricity and Kingston Communications (the long-time independent local operator covering the city of Hull), which is about to launch a service in Yorkshire geared particularly at the business market. The Leeds-Sheffield business axis has a high concentration of corporate custom, and Mercury's influence has been patchy in the region. Energis and the electricity companies are thus mobilising the country's pylons. The railways are being used for the same purpose by Mercury and British Rail Telecommunications - a free-standing subsidiary of the soon-to-be-privatised British Rail, which is also planning to enter the corporate market. It was perhaps inevitable that someone would soon exploit the canals too. However, the form of exploitation is novel: GPT, telecommunications equipment manufacturing joint venture between GEC and Siemens of Germany, has clubbed together with British Waterways to offer so-called 'dark fibre'  -a fibre-optic network without electronics for sale 'wholesale' to other operators or businesses wishing to use it to tailor their own networks. Fibreway, the new operator, is making only a modest investment at the outset, but its potential is considerable if long-distance telecoms becomes an essentially commodity business for large users and telecoms retailers. The start of local competition, particularly in the City of London operators. From an industry perspective the most far-reaching advance since the 1991 regulatory review has been the emergence of competition in the 'local loop', which appears to be overturning the conventional wisdom that competing local supply is uneconomic. The most visible local competition is coming from the operators, mostly US-owned, which are building combined cable television and telephone networks in urban areas. The cable companies believe the economies of scale available from dual provision have revolutionised the economics of local telecoms supply. Their commitment is far from half-hearted: about Pounds 6bn is being invested over the next five years, with most of urban and 'commuting' Britain set to be cabled. North American telecoms operators are to the fore, led by Nynex, US West, Southwestern Bell and Bell Canada. Telewest, a joint venture between US West and TCI, is in the process of a London flotation, expected to be the first of many. So far, the cable operators have concentrated on the residential sector, selling cable telephone on the back of television. About 40,000 business lines have been installed out of a total of about 400,000. But as the larger city networks - notably Nynex in Manchester - get under way, the attraction to the corporate sector will increase. For many large businesses, bigger gains likely to be had from the free-for-all occurring in the City of London, where no fewer than three new operators are currently building their own infrastructure. Colt and MFS, both financed by well-established US operators, are building fibre grids, inter-connecting with other long-distance operators, specifically for the corporate sector. Their emphasis is different - Colt is a dedicated local operator; MFS also intends to enter the long-distance re-sale market, and has ambitious plans to build similar grids in other UK cities, building on its US experience as a highly successful 'competitive access provider' ('Cap'), offering direct fibre links to the long-distance carriers for larger businesses in major cities. The development of a thriving re-sale market. The City of London has also spawned a growing array of re-sellers - operators leasing capacity from others and re-selling it at a discount to standard tariffs, in many cases providing their own switching facilities and direct links to customer premises. Worldcom, Sprint, ACC and Esprit, the first three US groups and the third a private UK-based operator with offices across Europe, are the companies most frequently encountered in the re-sale market. They focus on international traffic, but most also offer a re-sale service within the UK. Worldcom now has more than 200 customers and five switches of its own, and plans to offer an indirect access service later this year targetted at small and medium-sized businesses. BT and Mercury are both reacting vigorously to the new challenge. Both have long offered volume discounts. More than half of BT's business traffic now goes through one of five discount schemes, offering savings of 16 per cent off standard tariffs to the highest volume users. Mr Michael Hepher, BT's managing director, says that volume discounts are likely to become larger still - which will push Mercury to follow suit. BT has also established 'Win Back' teams, targetted at larger corporate clients. It claims the teams are already bearing fruit, with more than Pounds 200m of business won back from Mercury. Returners include Citybank, the Prudential, and National Power, BT claim. Since BT is not allowed to engage in preferential pricing, its 'win back' appeal is based on overall packages of services and customer support. Standing back from the battleground, is the competition delivering the corporate sector better services at cheaper prices? One is inevitably dealing in counterfactuals, but a recent study by Analysys, the Cambridge-based telecoms consultancy, gives some support to the idea that price competition is serving larger business well. The Analysys study* shows tariffs for UK businesses lower than those of France, Germany and Italy. On the other hand, they have been so since before the privatisation of BT and licensing of Mercury in the early 1980s. Only for larger businesses does the differential appear to have increased with any consistency. Since the large corporate sector has been the most intensely competitive over the past decade, two plausible arguments could be made. First, that competition brings down prices more rapidly. Second, that it distorts pricing, benefiting those sectors which are competitive at the expense of others. As competition spreads to all sectors over the next decade, the truth will be revealed. * Cutting the Cost, Analysys, 24 Castle Street, Cambridge; price Pounds 95.</p>

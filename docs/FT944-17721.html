			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses suffer again from domino effect The domino effect wreaked more havoc yesterday, as higher than expected US factory orders hit Treasuries, the Dow, European bond markets and equities, writes Our Markets Staff. Equity valuations were not sufficiently cheap in Europe to make up for lack of impetus from America, said Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. 'On the way up,' he said, 'interest rate-driven markets took prices to the point where we were looking at 1996 earnings at the end of 1993.' If bond yields rose further, he added, equities in Europe might have to become visibly undervalued to bring in the buyers. Mr Bell was not, however, looking for any repeat of October 1987. 'There is more risk of a 5 per cent crumble than a 30 per cent crash,' he maintained. FRANKFURT's Dax index fell 26.23 to a new 1994 closing low of 1,968.72 on the session. After an intraday low of 1,930.55, it lost 42.8 or 2.1 per cent to 1,946.49 in the post bourse. Turnover rose from DM6bn to DM7.5bn. Dealers reported domestic and US selling and Mr Glen Liddy at Kleinwort Benson said that stocks which had been favoured to a degree in recent weeks were punished yesterday. In chemicals, Bayer and Hoechst fell DM11 to DM331 and DM13.10 to DM309.50; in utilities, RWE by DM16.50 to DM425.50, and Veba by DM22.50 to DM487. Among second liners, Asko dropped a further DM45 to DM730 on the session following Tuesday's loss of DM85 on a DB Research downgrade. PARIS, too, established a new 1994 low as the CAC 40 index declined 42.40 or 2.3 per cent to 1,833.72 in turnover of FFr3.7bn. Financials were weak, with Credit Local down FFr17.30 at FFr377.50, and Suez by FFr10 at FFr240. Bouygues, the sole riser for much of the day, ended FFr9 higher at FFr587. One of the construction company's consortiums was awarded the potentially lucrative licence to run France's third mobile telephone system; and another got the contract for the St Denis stadium in north Paris which will be the main venue for the 1998 soccer World Cup. Bouygues beat groups led by Alcatel Alsthom, which fell another FFr19.40 to FFr461.60, and Lyonnaise des Eaux, which dropped FFr14 to FFr475; Lyonnaise, at least, had the consolation of forming part of the winning sports stadium consortium. AMSTERDAM fell 2.1 per cent and Elsevier came under pressure on ratings warnings after its takeover of Mead Data Central for Dollars 1.5bn. The AEX index dropped 8.36 to 390.13. Elsevier fell 60 cents to Fl 16.10 following its 10-for-one share split, after Standard &amp; Poor's placed Reed Elsevier ratings on CreditWatch negative and Moody's put its long-term debt ratings on review for a possible downgrade. A Fl 5.90 fall to Fl 178.60 in VNU was attributed to worries that its television affiliate RTL may lose star performers. Chemicals and internationals were under pressure, with Akzo Nobel down Fl 4.80 at Fl 197.30, DSM Fl 4.30 lower at Fl 139.60 and Royal Dutch Petroleum falling Fl 3.80 to Fl 185. MILAN saw one of its worst fears come true as the government unexpectly found itself pitched into renewed battle with the country's anti-corruption magistrates. The Comit index fell 16.04 or 2.4 per cent to 641.94, on a day which saw allegations that the prime minister could become involved in a formal graft investigation, the justice minister offer his resignation and a government spokesman call for a criminal suit against the country's chief prosecutor. Among the blue chip stocks, Fiat fell L126 or 1.9 per cent to L6,351 and Stet lost L214 or 4.5 per cent at L4,492. A further L1,037 or 5.1 per cent fall to L19,257 in Benetton was attributed to renewed rumours that the company might launch a capital increase. ZURICH's interest rate worries came to the fore and the SMI index dropped 41.1 or 1.7 per cent to 2,480.4. Attention continued to focus on UBS following last Friday's share restructuring announcement. The bearers fell another SFr10 to SFr1,181 and the registered shares were SFr2 lower at SFr285. The weaker dollar weighed on industrials, leaving Brown Boveri and Sulzer down SFr28 at SFr1,062 and SFr13 at SFr802 respectively. Profit-taking eroded some of Swiss Re's recent sharp gains on the sale of its direct investment activities, the shares falling SFr6 to SFr665. Drug stocks followed the lower trend, with Ciba declining SFr12 to SFr718 and Roche certificates giving up SFr105 to SFr5,620. MADRID ended off its worst, with the general index down 5.65 or 1.9 per cent at a new closing low of 290.07, after 286.97, in turnover of Pta35.8bn. Rough treatment was meted out to selected banks, utilities and construction stocks.

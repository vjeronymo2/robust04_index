			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S NOT DEAD YET;  </P> <P> YIDDISH IS THE COMMON LANGUAGE NOWHERE ON EARTH, BUT IT'S THE MOTHER TONGUE FOR  SOME JEWS SEEKING THEIR ROOTS  </P> <P> Yiddish has been dying a slow death for at least 50 years, but lovers of the  Jewish language of Eastern European villages and East Coast immigrant slums  still cling to the mame-loshn, their mother tongue, even in Southern  California.  </P> <P> They go to literary lectures, informal discussion groups, classes and  songfests. Orthodox Jews sometimes debate the Talmud in Yiddish. Old people on  bus benches in Jewish neighborhoods gossip in the language of their youth. And  a small but growing number of younger Jews who grew up speaking English are  turning to Yiddish studies.  </P> <P> This much activity might have surprised the pioneers of the Los Angeles Yiddish  Culture Club, who drew up a 50-year charter when they staged their first  evening of tea and cake in 1926. Even then, Yiddishists were worried that  America would prove rocky ground for their transplanted tongue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Number Unknown  </P> <P> Sixty-three years later, the club still stages a formal program every Saturday  night from October through June at the Institute of Jewish Education on 3rd  Street in the Fairfax District, but no one knows how long it will last.  </P> <P> In fact, no one really knows how many Yiddish speakers there are -- either in  Southern California, home to an estimated 700,000 Jews, or in the world at  large.  </P> <P> "While the use of the language as a primary vernacular has been declining,  interest in it, both sentimental and seriously intellectual, has been rising,"  says the Jewish Encyclopedia. "(T)he measurement of the present knowledge of  Yiddish . . . requires tools far subtler than those of ordinary censuses."  </P> <P> But there is no doubt that the number has been shrinking. Joshua Fishman, a  sociolinguist who teaches at Yeshiva and Stanford universities, said there may  be 3.5 million Yiddish speakers in the world today, including about 1.25  million in the United States, compared to an estimated 12 million worldwide and  just under 3 million in this country on the eve of World War II.  </P> <P> Yiddish (the name literally means Jewish) has its roots in the Dark Ages, when  Jews who lived in southern France and northern Italy migrated into what is now  Germany.  </P> <P> They spoke their own language, similar to the Romance languages of that day,  but exchanged it for a form of medieval German, adding words from Hebrew and  using the Hebrew alphabet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Distinct From Modern German  </P> <P> Modern Yiddish emerged as they gradually moved to Eastern Europe. It is  distinct from modern German, with words folded in from Hebrew and the Slavic  and Romance languages like so many raisins in a New Year's koylitsh (egg  bread).  </P> <P> From the early 1800s on, as more worldly Jews became a part of the cultures  around them, some looked down on Yiddish as a zhargon, the language of ignorant  village folk.  </P> <P> But that ignored a rich literary tradition that goes back at least as far as  1272, and a secular Yiddish literature that flowered from the middle of the  19th Century on. Novels, plays, poetry and newspapers appeared in the language,  along with prayer books and translations from the Bible.  </P> <P> In waves of emigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, about 7  million European Jews spread the language to the United States, Canada, South  America and what is now Israel.  </P> <P> But others stayed behind. Most of them were gassed or shot or died of cold and  hunger in concentration camps after Nazi forces conquered the Jewish centers of  Eastern Europe. Of the 6 million Jews put to death during World War II, about 5  million were Yiddish speakers, Fishman said.  </P> <P> By then, Hebrew had become the language of the Jewish settlers in Palestine. In  Stalin's Soviet Union, Yiddish and all other aspects of Jewish culture were  stifled. And in the United States, Yiddish was often discarded as worn-out  baggage from the old country.  </P> <P> "The emphasis was Americanization," recalled Irving Teitelbaum, 67, a building  contractor who arrived in Chicago from Poland 50 years ago. "One week after I  came to this country my brother schlepped me to night classes and said, 'Learn  English.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Dead Yet  </P> <P> Now, except for some ultra-religious enclaves in Israel and the East Coast, and  a small circle of secularists in New York whose Yiddish-language nursery school  is so popular that it has a waiting list, there is nowhere left where Yiddish  is the common language.  </P> <P> Which is not to say that Yiddish is quite dead yet.  </P> <P> The kultur klub (pronounced "cool-toor kloob") has extended its stay  indefinitely at the Institute of Jewish Education, and classes at the Workmen's  Circle, Santa Monica College and the West Valley Jewish Community Center had  147 students at last count.  </P> <P> "We lose people every year, simply because of the fact that people are dying,"  said Moshe Cohen, 78, president of the Los Angeles Yiddish Culture Club. "But  somehow we find people who've exchanged playing cards on Saturday evenings for  something more creative. We have a half-dozen young people too."  </P> <P> About 100 senior citizens gather there once a week for lectures, musical  programs, tea, cake and a chat.  </P> <P> Other groups of first- and second-generation Americans meet as far afield as  Anaheim, Arcadia, Long Beach and Laguna Niguel for informal evenings of Yiddish  literature and conversation.  </P> <P> Labor Zionists, Socialists and disillusioned Communists speak the language at  political meetings. Shoppers and shopkeepers use it in the bakeries and butcher  shops of the old Jewish neighborhoods of Fairfax and Pico-Robertson.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Services Generally in Hebrew  </P> <P> Orthodox Jews often speak Yiddish in their synagogues, although services are  generally conducted in Hebrew, the ancient language of the Bible and the prayer  book.  </P> <P> Yiddish speakers can also use the language as far away as Moscow and Buenos  Aires.  </P> <P> "I used to fly to a lot of places around the world, and I found that a lot of  people speak Yiddish," said Sy Cohen, 70, of Los Angeles, a retired pilot for  the Flying Tiger line. "Somehow you'd look somebody in the face and something  would make you both say, 'Vos makht a yid (How's it going)?' "  </P> <P> A World War II veteran of the Air Transport Command, Cohen said Yiddish came in  handy when he volunteered to fly supply missions during Israel's War of  Independence.  </P> <P> "There were two pilots who escaped from Russia and we put them in the cockpit  as co-pilots," he said. Since no one spoke Hebrew, the Americans and the  Russians communicated in Yiddish.  </P> <P> "We would say aruf mitn (up with the) gear, arop mitn (down with the) gear,"  Cohen recalled.  </P> <P> Marion Herbst, a Los Angeles artist and folk singer, fell in love with the  language when a friend played a record of folk songs for her, but she said it  can be useful too.  </P> <P> "There are still more speakers of Yiddish than there are of Esperanto, if  you're looking for a practical reason for speaking Yiddish," she said.  </P> <P> But Herbst, 57, goes beyond practicality in explaining its appeal. "It's my  language," she said. "Some people are obsessed by French and French culture.  Me, I'm obsessed with Yiddish, with Yiddish culture. It's a mystical thing."  </P> <P> The pungent sounds of Yiddish have also begun to tantalize people who did not  drink them in with their mothers' milk.  </P> <P> More than 200 students are learning their alef-beyz (alphabet) and other basics  at UCLA and at Jewish institutions such as the University of Judaism and the  Workmen's Circle, a fraternal organization on Robertson Boulevard.  </P> <P> "I always wanted to learn Yiddish. It was always the language of secrets in my  home," said Susan Page, 40, of Garden Grove, who studied Yiddish at a Jewish  Community Center in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Starting with the alphabet, she progressed until she could write a letter in  Yiddish to her aunt.  </P> <P> "I love it," she said. "I feel a real good connection with Jewish people in the  world."  </P> <P> Seventy-five to 100 people, many of them in the 40-to-50 age group, are  expected to take classes in Yiddish at the University of Judaism this fall, and  an additional 200 may attend lectures on Yiddish literature, Yiddish theater  and the history of Yiddish folk songs.  </P> <P> "These are people who are in search of their roots . . . not people who know  the language, but people who have the feel of it or the smell of it," said  Rabbi Jack Shechter, director of extension courses at the campus in the Santa  Monica Mountains above Sepulveda Pass. "It's a way . . . to deal with the  Jewish side of them."  </P> <P> Even in the most strictly observant neighborhoods of Jewish Los Angeles, where  women in long dresses and men in long beards throng the sidewalks on their way  to shul (synagogue) on Saturday mornings, many parents speak with their  children in English. Others make a point of using Yiddish, said Rabbi Chaim  Schnur, 39, director of Agudath Israel, an agency that lobbies for Orthodox  causes.  </P> <P> "Yiddish is still perceived by many as having an intrinsic value, as being the  language of the Jew, and it shouldn't be forgotten. It should be preserved,"  Schnur said. "Some of the older boys in yeshiva (high school) study in Yiddish,  because that's a form of discussion that goes back" to the 18th Century.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Yiddishists send money to YIVO, a research institute in New York,  and help gather books for the National Yiddish Book Center, in Amherst, Mass.,  which has saved about 900,000 old Yiddish books and sent out tens of thousands  to individuals and libraries around the world.  </P> <P> About 100,000 of those volumes came from Southern California, said Nanci Glick,  associate director of the center, whose founder, an energetic 34-year-old  former graduate student named Aaron Lansky, was just awarded a $250,000  MacArthur Foundation grant. He expects to use it to send Yiddish books to the  Soviet Union, Glick said.  </P> <P> These groups may well be the saving of Yiddish in America. By the year 2010,  Fishman predicts, the number of speakers will stabilize at just under 1  million.  </P> <P> "By that time its speakers, as distinguished from its admirers and those who  have love affairs with it from afar, will probably be ultra-Orthodox," he said.  </P> <P> In recent years Yiddish students at universities have amused themselves by  inventing words: shneykishele (marshmallow -- literally, "little snow pillow"),  kurtskes (short pants -- a diminutive and plural form of kurts, which means  short).  </P> <P> The standard text, "College Yiddish," has gone through 17 printings since it  was first published in 1949, and a simpler primer, "Learning Yiddish in Early  Stages," was reprinted in 1987.  </P> <P> But Janet Hadda, 43, an associate professor of Yiddish at UCLA, said the  success of college programs -- there are about 60 in the United States -- does  not mean that the language is thriving.  </P> <P> Her classes in Yiddish as a language attract no more than a handful of  students, while a poetry class taught in English last spring drew 35, she said.  </P> <P> "When I teach conversations to my students in elementary Yiddish, they and I  know I'm not training them to spend their junior year abroad in Yiddishland,"  she said. "Although I do hear reports of former students using their Yiddish in  diverse situations, they are unlikely to go out into the world, find a mate who  speaks Yiddish and conduct a courtship in that language."  </P> <P> Still, some have found that Yiddish can be fun -- and a way to meet people.  </P> <P> A Berkeley resident, for example, recently advertised in the National Yiddish  Book Center's monthly publication "to find and have a correspondence, in the  warmth of Yiddish, with another gay Yiddishist."  </P> <P> Others make friends in class.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Feeling of Completeness  </P> <P> "This gives me a feeling of emotional completeness and accomplishment -- and  besides, everybody is so nice," said Sharon Baumgold, 36, an attorney who went  by her Yiddish name, Shayndl, when she attended classes at the Workmen's  Circle.  </P> <P> "You'd expect Yiddish to be a moribund language and only older people to speak  it, but that's obviously not true. It can't be dying if we speak it," she said.  </P> <P> The class, made up of 10 women and one man, had gone beyond the alef-beyz to  study the future tense and plural pronouns, but Abe Friedman, who taught the  classes last year, said most of his students are not interested in grammatical  niceties.  </P> <P> "When we get into the dative, accusative and genitive cases, I lose half my  class. People run away," he said. "I taught it the first year and I haven't  taught it since."  </P> <P> The curriculum includes songs and folklore, including jokes about the "wise"  men of Chelm, who thought the sea is salty because of all the herring that swim  around in it.  </P> <P> "This is a great link between the past and us," said Adinah Lindner, a social  worker at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Lindner said she uses Yiddish sometimes  with some of her older immigrant clients.  </P> <P> "We don't want to let Yiddish go," she said. "If we don't make an effort to  study it, to continue speaking it, there won't be Yiddish in the next  generation, and after all the centuries . . . it would be pretty sad."  </P> <P> </P> <P> One-Liners From Singer  </P> <P> One of the best-known Yiddish writers, Isaac Bashevis Singer, had a series of  one-liners when asked about the fate of Yiddish, a question that Yiddishists  have been wrestling with for decades.  </P> <P> Jewish people suffer from many diseases, but amnesia is not one of them, he  would say.  </P> <P> Or, the Yiddish language is sick, but among Jews, the distance between being  sick and dying is a long way.  </P> <P> Or, why write in Yiddish? I write about ghosts. What could be more appropriate  than a dying language?  </P> <P> Or, we believe the dead will arise. The first thing they'll ask is, is there  anything new to read in Yiddish? So I write in Yiddish.  </P> <P> His quips were quoted by Marvin Zuckerman, 57, an English professor at Valley  College who taught Yiddish there for several years before it was dropped for  budgetary reasons. Yiddish will be restored to the curriculum next spring,  Zuckerman said, but he is not optimistic about the future of the language.  </P> <P> "Lomir zich nit narn (let's not fool ourselves)," Zuckerman said. "Does it  exist in your children's mouths? If not, forget it."  </P> <P> Zuckerman, whose parents sent him to a secular Yiddish school in New York, said  his own children do not speak the language, but their house is full of Yiddish  books and newspapers.  </P> <P> He said parents who let children know that Yiddish was once the language of  their people may be surprised by their eventual interest: "You never know what  will happen."  </P> <P> Edith Post, 61, a Los Angeles high school teacher, was inspired in the opposite  way. Intrigued by a chance encounter with her daughter's college Yiddish  textbook, she plans to take early retirement and move to New York to complete a  doctorate in Yiddish studies.  </P> <P> "The language sounds good in my mouth and in my head and the literature stands  on its own feet," she said.  </P> <P> "People are saying it's going down, but it's not," she said. "There's a  renaissance of Yiddish studies. And people say, 'OK, it's just going to be  elitist.' I don't know that. . . . Who would have believed Hebrew would become  a living language?"  </P> <P> A YIDDISH SAMPLER  </P> <P> Yiddish-speaking immigrants have added a unique spice to the English language.  Here is a sampling of words, often used as slang, that have come into American  usage through Yiddish, according to Webster's New World Dictionary.  </P> <P> blintz -- From Russian blinyets, diminutive of blin, pancake; a thin pancake  rolled with a filling of cottage cheese or fruit.  </P> <P> ganef -- From Hebrew ganav; a thief.  </P> <P> gefilte fish -- From German gefullter fisch; chopped fish, usually a mixture,  as of whitefish, pike and carp, mixed with onion, egg, seasoning, and boiled,  originally in a casing of the fish skin; usually served cold.  </P> <P> gevalt -- From g'vald, force, violence; a cry of alarm, help!.  </P> <P> kibitzer -- From German kiebitzen, to look on (at cards); meddlesome onlooker,  especially one who volunteers advice; a giver of unwanted advice, a meddler.  </P> <P> maven -- From Hebrew mevin; an expert or connoisseur, often a self-proclaimed  one.  </P> <P> mazel tov -- From Hebrew; good luck, an expression of congratulation.  </P> <P> mazuma -- From Hebrew mezumanim; cash.  </P> <P> megillah -- Hebrew for scroll; a long or involved explanation, a complicated  matter.  </P> <P> schlemiel -- From Hebrew, proper name Shelumiel  </P> <P> (literally, my peace is God); current meaning probably popularized after Peter  Schlemihl, title character of a novel by Adelbert von Chamisso (1781-1838),  German writer; an ineffectual, bungling person who habitually fails or is  easily victimized.  </P> <P> schlep -- From German schleppen, to drag; to carry, take, haul; to go or move  with effort; an ineffectual person.  </P> <P> schlock -- From German schlacke, dregs; anything cheap or inferior; trash.  </P> <P> schmaltz -- From German schmalz, literally, rendered fat, akin to schmelzen, to  melt; highly sentimental and banal music or literature.  </P> <P> schmo -- A foolish or stupid person, dolt.  </P> <P> schmooze -- From Hebrew shemuoth, items reported, gossip; an idle chat.  </P> <P> schnook -- A person easily imposed upon or cheated, a pitifully meek person.  </P> <P> schnorrer -- From German schnurren, to whip, purr: from the sound made by  musical instruments carried by beggars; a person who lives by begging or  sponging on others.  </P> <P> zaftig -- Juicy, succulent, from medieval German; having a full, shapely  figure.  </P></p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: ConAgra chief to head RJR Nabisco RJR NABISCO, the US food and tobacco group, in a surprise move last night named Mr Charles Harper as chairman and chief executive. Mr Harper, who is currently chairman of ConAgra and has been credited with turning that company from a commodities business into a successful packaged food products group, will take up his new post on Monday. Only two months ago, RJR Nabisco acted speedily to fill the chairman's post when Mr Lou Gerstner left to run IBM. RJR set up a 'co-chairman' structure, splitting the job between Mr Lawrence Ricciardi, formerly its general counsel, and Mr Karl von der Heyden, finance director. In March, RJR gave no hint that it would be looking for a new, sole chairman. Indeed, Mr Ricciardi stressed the arrangement was not an 'interim step'. Last night, the company said that at that stage, 'frankly there were no plans to change the structure'. However, it also denied there had been any disagreements between the co-chairmen. It said Mr Harper's appointment would help the company 'aggressively pursue its growth agenda under Mike Harper's leadership as a highly experienced chief executive with a strong background in consumer products'. Under the new arrangement, Mr Ricciardi will become president and Mr von der Heyden will retire. Mr Harper, 64, retired as chief executive of ConAgra last year, although he stayed on as chairman, guiding group strategy. He has worked for ConAgra since 1974. The appointment of a well-respected executive with long experience of the food industry comes at a sensitive time for RJR. Its shares have languished, creating unhappiness among some investors and problems for Kolhbery, Kravis Roberts, the company's largest shareholder.</p>

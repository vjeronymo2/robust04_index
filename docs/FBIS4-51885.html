			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- Kumsong tideland  reclamation, one more creation of eternal value, has been  successfully completed in Korea by People's Army [KPA] soldiers  mobilized in peaceful construction and builders.    A great nature-remaking project for damming up a wide sea  extending scores of ri along the West Coast from Kwangnyang Bay  to Kumsong-ri in Onchon County, South Pyongan Province, has been  completed to obtain 3,300 hectares of arable land.    Hundreds of hectares of paddy fields have already been  adjusted as a standardized field like a checker board,  irrigation and drainage waterways to prevent damages from  drought, flood and brine forever and roads extending tens of  kilometres have been built.    Paddy fields have been divided into fields of 25 hectares  each. This year will witness the first farming in these fields.    A ceremony for the completion of the Kumsong tideland  reclamation took place on the spot on April 27.    Vice Marshal Choe Kwang, Politburo member of the Central  Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and chief of the  General Staff of the Korean People's Army, conveyed a message  of thanks of the C.C. [Central Committee], the WPK at the  ceremony.    The message highly estimated the KPA soldiers and builders  for their indomitable spirit and shining feats performed in the  large- scale nature-remaking project with the unshakable faith  that they have nothing impossible under the wise leadership of  the party.</p>

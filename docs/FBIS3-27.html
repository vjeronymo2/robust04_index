			<p>nationalists  in July 1991 to promote creation of an independent  Ukrainian Armed Forces, initially achieved substantial influence  within the nascent Ukrainian defense establishment, particularly  in personnel and related matters.  Since mid-1992, however, the  UOU has increasingly come into conflict with the military  establishment and has lost much of its influence inside the  Defense Ministry, a trend that has greatly accelerated since  Vitaliy Radetskyy replaced Konstyantyn Morozov as defense  minister.  The union has reacted belligerently to the loss of its  insider status, returning to its roots as a military-oriented  ally of the moderately nationalist Ukrainian People's Movement  (Rukh) and seeking to influence the military from the outside  through the political process. It is running candidates for  parliament and is likely to remain a significant political force  if it and its nationalist allies do well in the 27 March 1994  parliamentary election.                                       END SUMMARY     The Union of Officers of Ukraine:  From Establishment Insiders to  Nationalist Opposition     The UOU'S Foundation by Ukrainian Nationalists     Rukh was evidently the moving force in the UOU's creation.  At  least since the fall of 1990, Rukh's leaders had been calling for  the creation of a separate Ukrainian army, saying this was an  essential element in the drive for Ukrainian independence from  the Soviet Union (Kultura i Zhyttya, 28 October 1990; Kiev radio,  19, 22 February 1991).  When the First UOU Congress met in July  1991, press reports said that Rukh had organized it specifically  to pursue this goal (TASS, 29 July 1991; Kiev radio, 27 July  1991; Krasnaya Zvezda, 5 November 1991).  Several Rukh leaders  played key roles at the congress.  Rukh Deputy Chairman Volodymyr  Mulyava chaired the congress's organizing committee; Rukh  Military Collegium Chairman Lt. Col. Vitaliy Chechylo was a  deputy chairman of the organizing committee; and the congress  elected Rukh Political Council member Col. Vilen Martirosyan as  the UOU's first chairman (TASS, 29 July 1991; Komsomolskaya  Pravda, 18 September 1991; Narodnaya Armiya, 29 June 1992).     With a large majority of its members ethnic Ukrainians and  retired or reserve rather than active-duty officers, the UOU has  always been more a Ukrainian nationalist organization than a  military one.  Eighty-five percent of its members are ethnic  Ukrainians, a proportion far higher than that in the armed forces  overall (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994). (See Note 1)  Only  half of the delegates to the First UOU Congress were on active  duty (Interfax, 29 July 1991).  At its most recent congress it  was reported that twice as many members were retired as were on  active duty, and that many UOU officers, including oblast  organization chairmen, are either in the reserves or retired from  the service (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994).  Many of the  union's organizers were not military men.  For instance, Mulyava  and Oleksandr Yemets (See Note 2) were civilians.  Other key  leaders, such as former UOU chairmen Hryhoriy Omelchenko and  Oleksandr Skypalskyy, were career police officers (See Appendix  C:  Biographical Information).     (Note 1) In 1992, according to then-military personnel chief  Oleksandr Ihnatenko, eighty-five percent of servicemen in Ukraine  were ethnic Russians (Narodnaya Armiya, 5 May 1992).     (Note 2) Yemets, leader of the Party of Democratic Revival of  Ukraine, was a deputy chairman of the First UOU Congress  organizing committee (Kiev radio, 27 July 1991).     The rapid disintegration of the USSR led the UOU to shift its  attention from its original goal of creating a Ukrainian national  army to influencing the nascent army's development.  As the  Soviet state rapidly withered awaY in the wake of the August 1991  coup attempt, Ukraine enacted a package of laws in October 1991  to create its own armed forces by placing Soviet forces stationed  in Ukraine under Ukrainian government control.  Ukraine also  appointed its own defense minister, Konstyantyn Morozov.  The UOU  then set itself the task of shaping the armed forces--especially  the officer corps--in what it considered a patriotic mold.  In  practice, this meant striving to influence decisions on  appointments, promotions, and dismissals, as well as seeking a  leading role in military indoctrination activities.  In November  1991, the Second UOU Congress demanded that all appointments,  "from battalion commander on up," be "coordinated with" the UOU  (Krasnaya Zvezda, 5 November 1991). (See Note 3)  The congress  also passed several resolutions calling for an acceleration of  the creation of a Ukrainian army and for measures to assure that  the army be manned by soldiers whose first loyalty was to  Ukraine.  In March 1992, then-First Deputy Chairman Vitaliy  Chechylo said that the UOU should "take a most active part" in  military personnel matters (Narodnaya Armiya, 28 March 1992).     (Note 3) The Soviet Defense Ministry was not reported to respond  directly to these demands, but a few days after the congress  Defense Minister Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov decried "centrifugal  tendencies" in military affairs (Krasnaya Zvezda, 7 November  1991).  The nascent Ukrainian Defense Ministry was also  apparently silent; the newly-appointed minister, Morozov,  addressed the congress but was not reported to discuss a role for  the UOU in military personnel matters (Moscow Russian TV, 2  November 1991).  Subsequently, however, Morozov strongly backed  UOU aspirations in this area (See below, page   ).     From the beginning, many officers stationed in Ukraine-  -particularly among the ethnic Russian majority of the officer  corps--were hostile to the UOU, evidently fearing that its  influence in personnel decisions boded ill for them personally.  As early as the end of 1991, an assembly of air defense officers  accused the union of seeking to arrogate to itself the powers of  newly minted commissars" and to revive "democratic centralism"  (Narodnaya Armiya, 14 December 1991).  Rival servicemen's groups  sprang up, often with the apparent purpose of opposing the UOU.  According to reports in the Moscow press, groups such as the  Independent Officers Association (based in Vinnytsya,  headquarters of the predominantly Russian 43rd Missile Army) and  the Kiev Constructive Union sought to protect their members and  the armed forces overall from what they charged were UOU "witch  hunts" for supporters of the 1991 coup attempt.  The UOU  actively, but unsuccessfully, opposed these groups' creation  (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 2 November 1991; Krasnaya Zvezda, 26  November 1991).     Defense Minister Morozov Encourages the UOU     Despite the hostility of many officers, the UOU at first  flourished, helped by the friendly attitude of nationalist-minded  Defense Minister Morozov.  Morozov signalled early on that his  thinking on military matters paralleled that of Rukh and the UOU.  He told a Moscow News interviewer that Ukraine needed its own  armed forces as soon as possible to guarantee its independence,  echoing earlier statements by Rukh leaders (See above, page  ).  In the same interview, he said that he shared the concerns  expressed at the Second UOU Congress over the loyalties of the  officers then stationed on Ukrainian territory (3-10 November  1991).  A UOU Executive Committee session was held on Ukrainian  Defense Ministry premises in January 1992, the members  congratulating themselves on their new-found establishment  insider status (Narodnaya Armiya, 1 February 1992).  Several UOU  leaders were appointed to important Defense Ministry and Security  Service posts where they were well-placed to pursue the UOU's  agenda in personnel and related matters.  In December 1991, UOU  Chairman Martirosyan was appointed chairman of the government's  new Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen (CSPS), with  First Deputy Chairman Chechylo as one of his top aides (Narodnaya  Armiya, 29 January, 11 March 1992).  A UOU Executive Committee  member, Oleksandr Skypalskyy, headed the Security Service's  Military Counterintelligence Directorate (Molod Ukrayiny, 17  October 1991).  UOU Deputy Chairman Hryhoriy Omelchenko was  especially well placed to weed out supposedly undesirable  officers, heading the organized crime unit in Skypalskyy's  directorate as well as sitting on the Defense Ministry Higher  Certification Committee, which vets senior appointments  (Narodnaya Armiya, 30 January 1993; Nezavisimost, 9 April 1993).     "Ukrainianizing" the Armed Forces     The UOU scored one of its greatest successes with the appointment  of Volodymyr Mulyava, deputy chairman of both the UOU and Rukh,  as chief of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's new Socio-  Psychological Service.  This service was organized on the basis  of ideas developed by Mulyava in his capacity as a Rukh deputy  chairman to inculcate Ukrainian patriotism and national identity  among the troops (See Appendix C: Biographical Information).  To  this end, Mulyava launched a highly controversial program  requiring servicemen to learn the Ukrainian language, history,  and traditions (Syn Otechestva No. 7, February 1992; Narodna  Armiya, 29 July 1992).  President Leonid Kravchuk endorsed the  program--at least in principle--at a Ukrainian Security Council  meeting in late 1992 (Narodna Armiya, 9 December 1992).  However,  Mulyava's critics--both in Ukraine and in Russia--charged that he  actually sought to purge ethnic Russians from the officer corps  (Narodnaya Armiya, 1 April 1992; Narodna Armiya, 3 December 1992;  Interfax, 6 January 1993; Pravda, 13 May 1993), a claim which he  and other UOU and Defense Ministry officials heatedly and  repeatedly denied (Kiev radio, 6 February 1992; Narodna Armiya, 5  May 1992, 3 December 1992, 17 April 1993; Vechirniy Kyyiv, 22  November 1992).     The UOU's influence in the Ukrainian government and armed forces  reached a peak in the spring and summer of 1992.  Senior military  and political figures addressed its Third Congress, which met in  April 1992 and attracted 918 delegates, the largest number ever  (Ukrinform, 6 April 1992).  Congress speakers congratulated the  union on the large role it was now playing in military affairs  (Golos Ukrainy, 7 April 1993;  Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992).  UOU leaders had expansive ideas about the organization's present  and future role in military affairs.  For instance, a "Draft UOU  Program," signed by several top union leaders and published in  the Defense Ministry newspaper Narodnaya Armiya on 4 June 1992,  mapped out ambitious goals for direct UOU involvement in drafting  military legislation, personnel decisions, training,  indoctrination, and social welfare of servicemen.  On 24 June  1992, Morozov ordered that the UOU should be involved in  identifying and removing corrupt officers (Molod Ukrayiny, 23  July 1992).     The UOU Under Attack, Fights Back     Even as its influence peaked in the middle of 1992, the UOU was  apparently encountering growing resistance from the defense  establishment--despite Morozov's friendly attitude--as well as  from politicians outside the military.  The critics said that its  influence within the military establishment was excessive and  decried the ends for which that influence was being used.  For  instance, in an interview published on the eve of the Third UOU  Congress, Yevhen Hryniv, a moderate Rukh member of parliament,  complained that the UOU had fixated on the "nationality question"  and said its decisions should be taken by the armed forces only  as recommendations (Narodnaya Armiya, 1 April 1992).  Several  months later, a favorable article on Mulyava's activities claimed  that the Defense Ministry newspaper Narodna Armiya was developing  a  disloyal attitude" toward him (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 22 November  1992).  At the end of 1992, 155 members of parliament called for  Morozov's dismissal, on the grounds that he had supposedly  allowed the UOU--in particular Mulyava--to "control" military  personnel policy and to impose its "nationalist ideology" on the  troops (Interfax, 6 January 1993). (See Note 4)     (Note 4) Press reports have not been observed to describe the  political leanings of the 155 deputies, although Morozov's  supporters consistently described them as communists.  Among the  organizers of the call for Morozov's dismissal were Col. Valeriy  Izmalkov, a deputy from Zaporizhzhya in the mainly Russian  eastern Ukraine and an inveterate foe of the UOU; Oleksiy  Prychkin, also from Zaporizhzhya and a former high communist  party official; Maj. Gen. F. Kiparis; MVD Lt. Gen. O. Badurka;  and Viktor Slyusarenko (Holos Ukrayiny, 6 January 1993;  Nezavisimost, 13 October 1993).     Belligerent Response to Criticism     In response, UOU leaders rose to Morozov's defense, while they  accused their critics in the military  and parliament of being  corrupt, unpatriotic, and pro-communist.  Hryhoriy Omelchenko,  elected UOU chairman at its Third Congress, repeatedly complained  that a "nomenklatura mafia" in the government, parliament, and  armed forces was blocking his efforts to prosecute officers whom  he accused of corruption, communist sympathies and subservience  to Russia.  Omelchenko also claimed that criticism of Morozov was  motivated precisely by Morozov's support for the UOU's anti-  corruption efforts (Nezavisimost, 18 July 1992; Molod Ukrayiny,  23 July 1992; Kiev TV, 13 January 1993; Uryadovyy Kuryer, 3O  January 1993; Nezavisimost, 9 April 1993; Molod Ukrayiny, 15 July  1993; Khreshchatyk, 8 October 1993).  Mulyava dismissed the  accusations in parliament against himself and Morozov as  comical," describing Morozov's critics as "conservative  generals" and "pro-imperialist and pro-communist forces" seeking  to protect "corruption and abuses in the armed forces" (Kiev  radio, 6 February 1993).  Morozov in turn defended Mulyava  against charges of discrimination against ethnic Russians  (Narodna Armiya, 17 April 1993).  The UOU issued a combative  statement, published in Narodna Armiya on 4 February 1993,  decrying "political provocations by pro-communist, chauvinist  [pro-Russian] forces," which it said could lead to civil war and  the loss of Ukrainian independence.     Furthermore, after the Third UOU Congress in April 1992, pressure  from opponents began to unravel the web of personal links that  the UOU had so successfully created between itself and the  defense establishment, a process abetted by the endemic factional  and personal rivalries within the UOU itself.  Martirosyan and  Chechylo, the UOU's two most prominent figures in the area of  servicemen's social welfare, broke with the union after the Third  Congress (Narodna Armiya, 13 May 1993).  In March 1993, Morozov  dismissed Deputy Minister for Personnel Oleksandr Ihnatenko, a  key UOU ally, for allegedly tolerating corruption (Narodna  Armiya, 26 March, 17 April 1993).     Meanwhile, there was infighting within the leadership of the UOU.  Martirosyan was forced out from the UOU chairmanship at the Third  Congress under heavy pressure (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992)  and after his deputy, Chechylo, had publicly criticized him for  being reluctant to step down (Narodnaya Armiya, 28 March 1992).  Volodymyr Pylypchuk, a UOU deputy chairman as well as deputy  chief of the Defense Ministry Military Education Directorate,  attacked the UOU leadership--at that point chaired by Omelchenko-  -for "authoritarian methods," incompetence and poor organization  (Narodnaya Armiya, 19 June 1992).  In December 1992, Chechylo, at  that point no longer a UOU official but still identifying himself  as a UOU member, accused Omelchenko of tolerating and even  encouraging corruption within the UOU leadership (Pravda Ukrainy,  21 December 1992).  The following year, Oleksandr Skypalskyy, who  had just been elected UOU chairman at the Fourth Congress in  April 1993, told an interviewer that Omelchenko, his predecessor  as chairman and his subordinate in the Security Service, had used  his UOU position to advance his own career (Narodna Armiya, 13  May 1993).     The Fourth UOU Congress     Despite clear signs that its opponents' attacks were taking a  toll on the union, the UOU made it clear at its Fourth Congress  in April 1993 that it was not backing down on its ambitions to  play a leading role in military policy.  Attendance, as compared  with the Third Congress a year earlier, was down sharply, from  918 delegates to about 6OO.  Outgoing Chairman Omelchenko said  Ukraine was facing "difficult times" in the economy, which he  blamed on the "nomenklatura" parliament.  Other speakers  criticized parliament for failing either to enact a military  doctrine or to cut back the size of the armed forces, accusing it  of protecting servicemen whom the UOU thought should be dismissed  for corruption or disloyalty.  The congress also expressed  considerable dissatisfaction" with the activities of the  government's Committee for the Social Protection of Servicemen  (CSPS) and called--unsuccessfully--for the dismissal of CSPS  Chairman Martirosyan, a former UOU chairman who was by that point  estranged from the union (Ukrinform, 6 April 1992; Narodna  Armiya, 13 April 1993).  Addressing the congress, Morozov praised  the UOU's activities and said that it "should not be a bystander"  in personnel and indoctrination matters (Narodna Armiya, 13 April  1993; Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 27 April 1993), advice the UOU seemed  inclined to take to heart.  Its new chairman, Oleksandr  Skypalskyy, asserted shortly afterwards that the Fourth Congress  had been held "exclusively to affirm the readiness and aspiration  of the UOU to take an active part in the building of the  Ukrainian army" (Narodna Armiya, 13 May 1993).     New Defense Minister Cracks Down on the UOU     The UOU's position within the military establishment suffered an  especially serious decline after Vitaliy Radetskyy's appointment  in October 1993 as defense minister, replacing Morozov.  Radetskyy brought with him a reputation as a foe of the UOU  (Narodna Armiya, 17 September 1992), a reputation he did nothing  to dispel.  Asked in parliament about his attitude toward the  UOU, he was implicitly hostile, saying that the question of  dissolving the union needed to be "studied attentively."  He was  noncommittal when asked his evaluation of Socio-Psychological  Service Chief Volodymyr Mulyava's activities, though he did tell  an interviewer later that he would slow down--but not eliminate-  -Mulyava's controversial program to promote use of the Ukrainian  language in the armed forces (Kiev radio, 8 October 1993; Moloda  Halychyna, 14 October 1993).  Meanwhile, the parliament sought to  curtail the UOU's role, enacting a new Military Doctrine which  banned political activity by servicemen (Golos Ukrainy, 29  October 1993).  Omelchenko--clearly seeing the ban as a serious  threat--called it a "gross violation of human rights" (UNIAN, 3  November 1993). (See Note 5)     (Note 5) Ironically, only four months earlier, the Fourth UOU  Congress had criticized the parliament's delay in enacting a  military doctrine (Narodna Armiya, 13 April 1993).     Once in office, Radetskyy took several steps to curtail the UOU's  influence.  He shifted Mulyava to a new position as deputy  defense minister for ties with the public, parties, and  movements, a shift seen as a blow to Mulyava and the UOU, since  it removed him from involvement in personnel-related matters.  Radetskyy also removed Mulyava from the Higher Certification  Commission, along with two UOU allies, former Defense Ministry  personnel chief Oleksandr Ihnatenko and Yuriy Prokofyev, chief of  the Defense Ministry Military Education Directorate (UNIAN, 2  December 1993).  These actions led commentators to claim that the  ministry was conducting a "purge" of UOU activists (Narodna  Hazeta No. 44, November 1993; Valentyn Labunskyy in Holos  Ukrayiny, 12, 17 November 1993).  One commentary in a nationalist  Lviv newspaper even claimed that Radetskyy was serving Russia's  interests by making these changes (Andriy Starostin in Post-  Postup, 2 December 1993).  Radetskyy reportedly forbade officers  to write for publication--supposedly in response to a critical  article by Air Force Major General Oleksandr Rol, (See Note 6) a  UOU member who was subsequently elected the union's chairman  (UNIAN, 3 November 1993).  Radetskyy also revoked Morozov's 1992  order giving the UOU a role in personnel matters (Kievskiye  Vedomosti, 27 November 1993).     (Note 6) Rol's article, published only a few days after  Radetskyy's appointment, excoriated the Defense Ministry  leadership for incompetence and corruption and asserted that the  military was incapable of reforming itself without the  involvement of outsiders (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 13 October 1993).     Radetskyy's apparent hostility toward the UOU communicated itself  down the chain of command.  Some unit commanders reportedly tried  to suppress UOU activities (Samostiyna Ukrayina, 22 November  1993).  In December, the UOU's Kiev organization appealed to  Radetskyy to put a stop to what it called "arbitrariness" and  "pressure" against UOU activists by commanders (Molod Ukrayiny,  17 December 1993).  UOU officials also claimed that the Defense  Ministry had attempted to prevent officers on active duty from  attending the UOU's Fifth Congress, granting permission only at  the last moment (Halychyna, 4 January 1994).  At the congress,  two delegates claimed that the military command was trying to  "ban" UOU representatives from certification commissions at all  levels, which vet appointments (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994).     UOU Remains Defiant, Steps Up Political Activity     The Fifth UOU Congress     When the Fifth UOU Congress met in December 1993, the  organization's estrangement from the defense establishment was  near-total.  Attendance was down again, to a mere 225 delegates,  less than a quarter of the attendance at the Third Congress a  year and a half earlier.  Outgoing Chairman Oleksandr Skypalskyy  and other participants attributed the decline to "persecution" of  UOU members by commanders (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 December 1993;  Halychyna, 4 January 1994).  No top Defense Ministry officials  attended (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994); by contrast, Morozov  and other senior figures had addressed the Second, Third and  Fourth Congresses (Moscow Russian TV, 2 November 1991; Narodnaya  Armiya, 8 April 1992; Narodna Armiya, 13 April 1993).  In  contrast to its extensive favorable coverage of earlier UOU  congresses, the Defense Ministry newspaper Narodna Armiya  published only a short Ukrinform report on the Fifth Congress (22  December 1993).     The congress's mood was defiant.  It elected a new chairman, Rol,  who was already in disfavor with the Defense Ministry and who was  rumored to be on the verge of dismissal from the armed forces in  retaliation for the critical article he had published in October  (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 December 1993, 6 January 1994).  Speakers  attacked the government for not spending enough on defense and  failing to promote arms exports (Kiev TV, 18 December 1993;  Halychyna, 4 January 1994).  Delegates gave a standing ovation to  a fiery speech threatening to revive the 1940's anti-Soviet  Ukrainian Insurrection Army if "anybody" prevented the UOU from  playing what it considered its proper role (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21  December 1993).  Mulyava called on the UOU, despite the "new  conditions," to expand its influence "in all spheres of army  life" (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994).  Another UOU official,  Bohdan Vivchar, assailed the UOU's parliamentary critics as  "national chauvinist [pro-Russian] forces" who sought to "prevent  the consolidation of an independent Ukrainian state through the  building of strong armed forces" (Halychyna, 4 January 1994).  Delegates also pointed to recent opinion polls showing high  popular support for the officer corps, evidently seeing this as  proof that the UOU was in a stronger political position than its  critics (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 December 1993, 6 January 1994).     Parliamentary Election Campaign Activity     Faced with official hostility and with its influence within the  establishment on the decline, the UOU is re-emphasizing its long-  standing links with Rukh and other nationalist groups in  preparation for the March 1994 parliamentary election.  In  December 1993, UOU Deputy Chairman Omelchenko appealed for all  "democratic" groups to unite during the election campaign and to  run a single "democratic" candidate in each parliamentary  district (Interfax, 17 December 1993).  Addressing the Fifth UOU  Congress, Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil likewise appealed for  unity of all "democratic and patriotic forces" in the election  campaign and urged the union to "engage in political activity  more daringly" (Molod Ukrayiny, 24 December 1993).  While the UOU  is clearly taking an active role in the campaign, these appeals  for unity are meeting with mixed success.  The Fifth Congress  decided to run UOU candidates in all regions of the country  (Halychyna, 4 January 1994)--a goal the union is unlikely to  achieve--while at the same time UOU is participating in the All-  Ukrainian Electoral Committee of the Democratic Bloc with Rukh  and several other nationalist groups to try to unite behind  common candidates (Interfax, 17 December 1993; UNIAR, 4 January  1994).     At least six UOU leaders are candidates for parliament:  Rol;  Omelchenko; Skypalskyy; Mulyava; Guards Lieutenant Colonel  Oleksandr Lobashchuk, a member of the UOU's Executive Committee  and deputy chairman of its Lviv Oblast organization; and Vasyl  Krychun, a local government official and deputy chairman of the  Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast UOU organization.  All but Krychun are  apparently defying the Military Doctrine ban on political  activity, since they remain on active duty.  Five of the six are  running in nationalist western Ukraine, the UOU's main power  base.  Rol is running in Lviv Oblast on the ticket of the  Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, Lobashchuk also in Lviv  Oblast as an independent supported by the UOU, Skypalskyy in  Volyn Oblast, and Mulyava and Krychun in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast  (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 4, 14 January, 24 February 1994; Vechirniy  Kyyiv, 21 December 1993; Holos Ukrayiny, 12 January 1994;  Halychyna, 27 January, 12 February 1994).  Omelchenko is running  in Kiev as a candidate of the Party for Democratic Revival of  Ukraine (UNIAR, 29 December 1993; Vechirniy Kyyiv, 4 January  1994).     Prospects     Despite the reverses it has suffered since mid-1992, the UOU is  clearly determined to remain a force in Ukrainian military  policy.  Recent statements by the UOU's leaders show that it has  not abandoned its central ambition of playing a leading role in  shaping the armed forces and acting as the guardian of their  loyalty and honesty.  Its vigorous activity in the parliamentary  election campaign shows its determination to seek alternate means  to exert influence on the military even in the face of the  Defense Ministry's hostility.  Its strong and long-standing links  with Rukh and other important political groups will probably be  helpful to it in this endeavor.     Appendix A:  The UOU'S Agenda     UOU spokesmen have said that the union's goal is to ensure that  all members of Ukraine's officer corps will be honest, competent,  and loyal to Ukraine (See for example the UOU Draft Program in  Narodnaya Armiya, 4 June 1992; as well as interviews by then-UOU  First Deputy Chairman Vitaliy Chechylo in Narodnaya Armiya, 28  March 1992; then-UOU Chairman Oleksandr Skypalskyy and Kiev local  organization Chairman Volodymyr Saladyak in Narodna Armiya, 13  May 1993; and current UOU Chairman Oleksandr Rol in Samostiyna  Ukrayina, 5 February 1994).  Stated in such general terms, these  goals are hardly controversial and in fact have been endorsed  even by the UOU's opponents, including Radetskyy (see his  articles in Armiya Ukrayiny, 26 January 1994, and in Ukrayinska  Hazeta, 2 February 1994).  Controversy has centered instead on  the UOU's aspiration to play a direct and leading role in  personnel decisions, down to the level of influencing individual  appointments and dismissals, as well as on its criteria-  -particularly ethnicity--for ensuring loyalty to Ukraine.     Beyond its primary interest in influencing personnel and  indoctrination, the UOU has also pledged to work for better  living conditions for servicemen and to prevent the  misappropriation of military property, either by corrupt  individuals or by Russia.  Its focus on Ukrainian nationalism is  displayed in its strenuous opposition to Crimean separatism.  It  has also lobbied against ceding control of the former Soviet  Black Sea Fleet to Russia and against the presence of any foreign  troops in Ukraine (Khreshchatyk, 3 March 1994).     Military Personnel, Indoctrination and Loyalty Issues     The UOU's attempts to shape Ukraine's officer corps has been its  main raison d'etre almost from the beginning.  Two key UOU  leaders, Hryhoriy Omelchenko and Volodymyr Mulyava (See Appendix  C: Biographical Information) have played the most prominent roles  in this area.  Omelchenko has sought to use his positions in the  Security Service and on the Defense Ministry Higher Certification  Commission to weed out unsuitable officers--though he claims to  have been thwarted in these efforts by entrenched conservatives  in government (See above, page  ).  Mulyava, meanwhile, took the  lead in attempting to mold servicemen into what he and the UOU  considered Ukrainian patriots.  It remains unclear to what extent  this meant--as critics charged--favoring ethnic Ukrainians over  ethnic Russians (See above, page   ).  However, UOU leaders  frequently warned union audiences against the danger of ethnic  discrimination, suggesting that at least some UOU supporters,  despite denials, may have in fact pursued discrimination against  Russians.  For instance, UOU Deputy Chairman Andriy Haysynskyy  told an interviewer in 1991 that "in my opinion" ethnicity should  have no significance, implying that others did not share that  view (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 2O September 1991).  At the Third UOU  Congress, Deputy Chairman V. Lazorkin said the union should  "help" military personnel authorities "make correct appointments  to key posts," which should be filled only by "true patriots."  While Lazorkin's statement was not unambiguously a call for  ethnic discrimination, it may have been understood as such.  Omelchenko, who was elected UOU chairman the next day, responded  to Lazorkin by warning against seeking "enemies" on the basis of  their ethnicity (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992).  The concern  with ethnicity seems to be lingering, however, even among the  UOU's friends; an interviewer for the nationalist newspaper Za  Vilnu Ukrayinu praised newly-elected UOU Chairman Oleksandr Rol's  "good idiomatic Ukrainian" as evidence of his "healthy family  roots" (14 January 1994).     Whatever its views on ethnicity, the UOU clearly will not  willingly give up its claim to a role in shaping Ukraine's  officer corps.  In a recent interview, newly-elected Chairman  Oleksandr Rol, while making conciliatory statements about the new  Defense Ministry leadership, asserted that "We [the UOU] consider  it our duty to indoctrinate army personnel in the spirit of  Ukrainian patriotism and glorious traditions of the Ukrainian  Army" (Samostiyna Ukrayina, 5 February 1994).     The UOU has also pushed insistently to require all officers to  swear allegiance to the Ukrainian state.  Characteristically, the  union presented itself as the guarantor that this goal would be  achieved.  It early on created a data bank to identify officers  who had or had not taken the oath (Moscow Ostankino TV, 29  January 1992).  Then-UOU Chairman Vilen Martirosyan said he would  use this data to lobby for the dismissal of all commanders who  refused the oath (Moscow radio, 18 March 1992).     The Defense Ministry has endorsed this goal, but not a UOU role  in enforcing it.  In mid-1992, then-military personnel chief  Oleksandr Ihnatenko, a UOU ally, said that all officers who  refused the oath would be transferred to service in Russia or  other former Soviet republics (Krasnaya Zvezda, 9 June 1992).  One officer, Major Grigoriy Nesmyanovich, claimed that this in  practice meant denying salaries and other benefits to officers  who refused the oath as a way of pressuring them to leave Ukraine  voluntarily (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 15 July 1992).  Defense Minister  Vitaliy Radetskyy, a UOU opponent, recently ordered that any  remaining officers who had not taken the oath be removed from  active service (UNIAN, 1 February 1994).     Yet another aspect of UOU involvement in military personnel  matters has been its campaign to bring Ukrainian servicemen,  stationed in other parts of the former Soviet Union or in Eastern  Europe, "home" to Ukraine.  Shortly after the dissolution of the  Soviet Union, the UOU Executive Committee called for an  interstate agreement to send all former Soviet servicemen to  their "native" republics (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 January 1992).  Then-Defense Minister Konstyantyn Morozov told the Third UOU  Congress that the "return" of these servicemen would help to  "Ukrainianize" the army (Golos Ukrainy, 7 April 1992).     Protection of Military Property     The UOU has cast itself as the protector of military property  from both theft and attempts by Russian authorities to  appropriate equipment claimed by Ukraine.  The subject was raised  at the Second UOU Congress (Literaturna Ukrayina, 7 November  1991) and at a January 1992 UOU Executive Committee session  (Narodnaya Armiya, 1 February 1992).  At its Third Congress, the  UOU took credit for protecting military property against  misappropriation (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992).  The Third  Congress highlighted its concern with the corruption issue by  electing Security Service Col. Hryhoriy Omelchenko as UOU  chairman.  Although Omelchenko has complained that he has been  prevented by conservative politicians from carrying out this  mandate (See above, page    ), the UOU nonetheless remains  determined to attempt to police the military.  The head of the  UOU Lviv Oblast organization, Mykola Vasylkevych, recently  asserted that "the UOU will take a most active part" in  inventorying and protecting military property, "from ships under  construction to the last cartridge" (Shlyakh Peremohy, 15 January  1994).     "Social Protection" of Servicemen     The problem of the shortage of housing and other amenities for  military officers evidently presented a dilemma for the UOU.  While any organization aspiring to influence among servicemen in  the former Soviet Union must address this issue, Ukraine's near-  catastrophic economic situation makes it difficult for any group  to deliver on its promises.  Although the union  characteristically at first presented itself as the guarantor  that living standards would improve, it eventually backed off its  earlier aspirations and promises.  It may be a testament to the  intractability of the problem that the UOU officials most  identified with the social welfare issue, founding Chairman Vilen  Martirosyan and former First Deputy Chairman Vitaliy Chechylo,  have both fallen out with the organization (See Appendix C:  Biographical Information).     The UOU urged, and took credit for, the creation in late 1991 of  a Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen (CSPS) attached  to the Ukrainian Council of Ministers (Narodnaya Armiya, 29  January 1992).  Martirosyan was appointed chairman of the new  committee (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 January 1992), and Chechylo chief  of its General Department (Narodnaya Armiya, 11 March 1992).  Martirosyan told the UOU Executive Committee in January 1992 that  military housing and other "social protection" issues were a  "main task" and "top priority" for the UOU and that his dual role  created "new opportunities" to solve the problem (Narodnaya  Armiya, 1 February 1992).  The "social protection" issue was a  major topic of discussion at the Third UOU Congress, and  Martirosyan told the congress that the union was establishing a  fund to finance housing construction (Moscow radio, 4 April 1992;  Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992).  In June, the UOU Draft Program  repeated that promise (Narodnaya Armiya, 4 June 1992).  However,  the Third Congress reportedly believed that Martirosyan could not  adequately lead both the UOU and the CSPS.  Both he and Chechylo  stepped down from their UOU posts, Martirosyan reportedly under  heavy pressure (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992).     By 1993, the UOU was backing off from its earlier plans to play  an active role in providing for servicemen's welfare.  In April,  the Fourth Congress assailed Martirosyan's stewardship of the  CSPS, calling for his dismissal but rejecting a call for the  abolition of the CSPS (Interfax, 12 April 1993; Narodna Armiya,  13 April 1993).  In May, then-UOU Chairman Skypalskyy said that,  earlier promises notwithstanding, the union could not help  finance housing construction, and would merely offer "moral  support" to officers in need of housing (Narodna Armiya, 13 May  1993).  In contrast to the Third and Fourth Congresses, the Fifth  UOU Congress in December 1993 was not reported to have discussed  "social protection" at all.     Crimea     In keeping with its Ukrainian nationalist roots, the UOU opposes  any change in Crimea's status (Narodnaya Armiya, 9 June 1992).  The union and its Crimea regional organization assailed the  Russian parliament's July 1993 resolution claiming Crimea as  Russian territory (ITAR-TASS, 1O July 1993; Holos Ukrayiny, 28  July 1993).  In September, the union declared that no bilateral  issues could be solved until Russia "surrendered its territorial  claims" (Kiev radio, 2 September 1993).  In December, a Crimean  Ukrainian Civil Congress was created, headed by Lieutenant  Colonel Serhiy Lytvyn, chairman of the UOU Crimea regional  organization, to lobby for "preserving Ukraine's territorial  integrity."  The congress opposed the very holding of a Crimean  presidential election (Kiev radio, 2 December 1993; Moscow Radio,  4 December 1993; Holos Ukrayiny, 7 December 1993).     Box     Allegations of UOU Links to Radical Nationalist Groups     Although there have been claims that the UOU is linked to, and is  even giving active support to, underground armed nationalist  organizations such as Ukrainian Self-Defense (UNSO) (Moscow News,  14-21 June 1992; Pravda, 13 May 1993; Valeriy Izmalkov in  Kievskiye Vedomosti, 27 November 1993), Ukrainian news media have  not been observed to report hard evidence of such ties.  It  should also be noted that these allegations emanate mostly from  Russian sources or from Ukrainian critics of the UOU.  Former UOU  Chairman Oleksandr Skypalskyy has denied these claims; although  he said that the members of UNSO and similar groups were  "patriots," he also said "I do not share their methods"  (Literaturna Ukrayina, 23 September 1993).  UNSO leader Dmitriy  Korchinskiy recently told a Moscow News interviewer that UNSO has  the support of "officers' circles," but he did not mention the  UOU or any other organization by name (18-24 February 1994).     End Box     Appendix B:  Evolution of UOU Policy on Nuclear Weapons     The UOU has moved gradually from a position of supporting the  country's denuclearization to one of seeking to retain a  strategic nuclear arsenal for some time to come.  The First UOU  Congress called for a nuclear-free Ukraine (TASS, 29 July 1991).  The UOU's first chairman, Vilen Martirosyan, subsequently said  that plans for separate Ukrainian armed forces did not include  any ''strategic'' component, which he said should remain under  central" control (Kuranty, 29 August 1991).  The Second UOU  Congress in November 1991 supported this position (Literaturna  Ukrayina, 7 November 1991).  However, the Third UOU Congress  hailed a statement by Vasyl Durdynets, deputy chairman of the  Ukrainian parliament, that any "strategic" forces on Ukrainian  soil should be subordinated to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry  (Moscow Radio, 4 April 1992).  The Fourth UOU Congress called for  keeping nuclear weapons in Ukraine (Interfax, 12 April 1992).  At  the Fifth UOU Congress, outgoing Chairman Oleksandr Skypalskyy  spoke in support of the Ukrainian parliament's heavily-  conditioned ratification in November 1993 of the START I Treaty  and the Lisbon Protocol (Kiev TV, 18 December 1993).  His  successor, Oleksandr Rol, recently told an interviewer that he  believed that Ukraine would need a nuclear deterrent for as long  as Russia possesses nuclear weapons--a position which he has made  part of his parliamentary election campaign platform.  Rol also  said that, in his capacity as UOU chairman, he would  "investigate" the fact that the officers of the Vinnytsya-based  43d Missile Army had not sworn allegiance to Ukraine (Za Vilnu  Ukrayinu, 14 January 1994; Shlyakh Peremohy, 29 January 1994).  The UOU has issued a statement opposing Ukraine's "unilateral  nuclear disarmament" (Khreshchatyk, 3 March 1994), and the  union's local organization in Kiev has called for a nationwide  referendum on the subject (Khreshchatyk, 5 March 1994).     Appendix C:  Biographical Information     The following biographical entries are intended to illustrate the  UOU's connections with Rukh and other nationalist organizations,  as well as with the Defense Ministry and other government  institutions.  Russian spellings, where they differ from  Ukrainian, are given in parentheses.     Chechylo (Chechilo), Vitaliy, Lt. Col.  He was chairman of Rukh's  Military Collegium; he then served as deputy chairman of the  organizing committee for the First UOU Congress, where he was  elected UOU first deputy chairman (Komsomolskaya Pravda, 18  September 1991).  He is chief of the General Department of the  Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen attached to the  Ukrainian Council of Ministers (Narodnaya Armiya, 11 March 1992).  He stepped down from his UOU post at the Third Congress  (Narodnaya Armiya, 28 March 1992).  He has since been feuding  with the union's leadership, accusing it of corruption (Pravda,  Ukrayiny, 21 December 1992).  Former UOU Chairman Oleksandr  Skypalskyy called his criticisms "ignoble and ungentlemanly,"  claiming that he had not been expelled only because the union had  no expulsion procedure (Narodna Armiya, 13 May 1993).     Haysynskyy (Gaysinskiy), Andriy, Lt.  A UOU deputy chairman (Za  Vilnu Ukrayinu, 2O September 1991), he served on the commission  to organize the Defense Ministry Socio-Psychological Service  (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 July 1992).     Kostyuk, Roman, Col., reserves.  He was chairman of the UOU Kiev  organization in 1992 (Narodnaya Armiya, 1 February 1992) and then  UOU first deputy chairman (Narodna Hazeta No. 44, November 1993).  He helped draft the 1991 legislation setting up the Ukrainian  Armed Forces (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992).  He was one of the  signers, along with Rukh's Vyacheslav Chornovil, of a  Proclamation of the Standing Council of Democratic Parties and  Movements of Ukraine, calling for unity in the March 1994  parliamentary election campaign (Khreshchatyk, 11 December 1993).     Krychun, Vasyl.  A former member of the Soviet Air Defense  Forces, he is now a member of both the oblast and city soviets,  as well as head of the city communal property fund, in Ivano-  Frankivsk.  A member of Rukh since 1989, he is also deputy  chairman of the UOU Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast organization and a  candidate in the March 1994 election for parliament (Halychyna,  12 February 1994).     Kubakh, M.F., Lt. Col., reserves.  A deputy UOU chairman for  economic affairs and a member of the Kharkiv Oblast Soviet  military commission, he was one of the authors of the UOU Draft  Program (Narodnaya Armiya, 4 June 1992).     Lazorkin, V, Col., member of the Lviv Oblast Soviet (Narodnaya  Armiya, 22 January 1992). He served as UOU deputy chairman  (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992) and chairman of the UOU  Coordinating Council (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 July 1992).  He helped  draft the 1991 legislation setting up Ukrainian Armed Forces  (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992) and was one of the authors of  the UOU Draft Program (Narodnaya Armiya, 4 June 1992).     Lytvyn (Litvin), Serhiy, Lt. Col., retired.  Chairman of the UOU  Crimean regional organization and chairman of the Ukrainian  Studies Department at the Symferopil Higher Building School, he  was elected chairman of the new Crimean Ukrainian Civil Congress  in December 1993, at which time he retired from active military  duty (Holos Ukrayiny, 7 December 1993).     Martirosyan, Vilen, Maj. Gen.  A member of Rukh's Political  Council, he was elected the UOU's first chairman at its First  Congress in July 1991 (TASS, 29 July 1991).  He served as  chairman until the Third Congress in April 1992, when he stepped  down under pressure (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992), and  subsequently left the UOU altogether (Narodna Armiya, 13 May  1993).  He recently authored a scathing attack on the UOU,  claiming that under Volodymyr Mulyava's leadership it had  instigated an "open purge" of the officer corps in favor of then-  Defense Minister Konstyantyn Morozov's supporters, which  according to Martirosyan has resulted in a wholesale exodus of  highly skilled servicemen, both officers and enlisted men  (Kievskiye Vedomosti, 5 February 1994).  He has been chairman of  the Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen, attached to  the Ukrainian Council of Ministers, since its creation in  December 1991 (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 January 1992; Kievskiye  Vedomosti, 5 February 1994).  He is an ethnic Armenian (Narodnaya  Armiya, 4 April 1992).     Mulyava, Volodymyr.  Mulyava's only military rank prior to  January 1992 was sergeant in the reserves (Moskovskiye Novosti,  10 November 1992).  He developed his ideas for a military Socio-  Psychological Service to inculcate Ukrainian patriotism among  servicemen as early as 1986, and was active in Rukh's 1990 and  1991 preparations to organize the UOU (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 July  1992).  A deputy chairman of Rukh's governing board, he chaired  the organizing committee for the First UOU Congress and was  elected UOU deputy chairman (Kiev radio, 27 July 1991; Rabochaya  Tribuna, 2 August 1991).  In September 1991, he submitted a  report on behalf of Rukh to Ukraine's new defense minister,  Konstyantyn Morozov, proposing to create a Socio-Psychological  Service.  Morozov gave Mulyava the rank of colonel and appointed  him to head a commission to organize the new service (Narodnaya  Armiya, 29 July 1992).  In February 1992, Mulyava was appointed  head of the service (Syn Otechestva No. 7, February 1992).  He  also sat on the Defense Ministry Higher Certification Commission.  At the end of 1992, he was promoted to major general (Narodnaya  Armiya, 3 December 1992).  In late 1993, Mulyava was removed from  the Socio-Psychological Service and appointed deputy minister for  ties with the public, parties, and movements, a shift which was  seen as weakening his and the UOU's influence since his new  position gave him no role in personnel or indoctrination (Holos  Ukrayiny, 12, 17 November 1993).  He was also removed from the  Higher Certification Commission (UNIAR, 2 December 1993).  Mulyava has served as Rukh spokesman on economic policy (Narodna  Hazeta, No. 1, January 1992) and on Ukrainian Orthodox Church  affairs (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 4 June 1992) and is the hetman of  the Ukrainian Cossacks (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 4 March 1993; Kiev  radio, 18 August 1993).  He is a candidate in the March 1994  election for parliament (Halychyna, 27 January 1994).     Omelchenko, Hryhoriy.  Formerly a career MVD officer (Narodna  Armiya, 13 May 1993), Omelchenko is now a colonel in the  Ukrainian Security Service, where he heads the organized crime  unit of the Military Counterintelligence Directorate  (Nezavisimost, 9 April 1993).  He is also a member of the Defense  Ministry Higher Certification Commission (Narodnaya Armiya, 30  January 1993).  Omelchenko was a deputy chairman of the UOU until  its Third Congress in April 1992, when he was elected chairman  (Narodna Armiya, 8 April 1992).  He served as chairman until the  Fourth Congress a year later, when he was again elected deputy  chairman (Kiev radio, 15 September 1993); he was re-elected to  that post at the Fifth Congress (Molod Ukrayiny, 24 December  1993).  He is a candidate for parliament on the ticket of the  Democratic Revival of Ukraine Party (UNIAR, 29 December 1993).     Pylypchuk (Pilipchuk), Volodymyr, Colonel.  He helped draft 1991  legislation setting up Ukrainian Armed Forces (Narodnaya Armiya,  8 April 1992).

He was removed from the Defense Ministry  Higher Certification Commission by Defense Minister Vitaliy  Radetskyy (UNIAN, 2 December 1993).     Rol (Ryl), Oleksandr, Maj. Gen.  Once a senior Soviet Air Force  officer, Rol is now chief of the Operational Administration Staff  of the Ukrainian Air Force (Samostiyna Ukrayina, 5 February  1994).  He has persistently criticized the leadership of the  Ukrainian Defense Ministry for inefficiency and corruption and  has called for a robust Ukrainian military, including offensive  as well as defensive capabilities (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 17 March  1992; Ukrinform, 3 March 1993; Vechirniy Kyyiv, 13 October 1993;  Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 8 February 1994).  He recently endorsed  Ukrainian retention of nuclear weapons (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 14  January 1994).  Rol was elected UOU chairman at the Fifth  Congress (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 December 1993) and is a candidate  in the March 1994 election for parliament (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 14  January 1994).     Skypalskyy (Skipalskiy), Oleksandr, Maj. Gen.

A  member of the UOU Executive Committee until April 1993, he was  elected UOU chairman at the Fourth Congress (Narodna Armiya, 13  April 1993).  He stepped down at the Fifth Congress in December  1993 to run for parliament (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 December 1993).  With Oleksandr Yemets, leader of the Party of Democratic Revival  of Ukraine, he was one of the founders of the Democratic Center  electoral bloc for the March 1994 election (Kievskiye Vedomosti,  12 January 1994).     Saladyak (Solodyak), Volodymyr, Col., retired.  A deputy UOU  chairman and head of the UOU Kiev city organization, he was one  of the authors of the UOU Draft Program (Narodnaya Armiya, 4 June  1992, 13 May 1993).

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi </F> Kumagai by political commentator Soichiro Tahara, Kyoto  University Professor Masaaki Kosaka, and political commentator  Yoichi Masuzoe in Tokyo; from the "Sunday Project" program; date  not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Tahara] Let me congratulate you first. Now I  want to ask you whether it is true that you did not want to take  the post of chief cabinet secretary?    [Kumagai] It is true.    [Tahara] So, you took the post reluctantly.    [Kumagai] I did not want to assume this important post at a  time when the nation is in difficult times. I experienced  neurasthenia for the first time.    [Tahara] To tell you the truth, we also think that you are  fit to be the international trade and industry minister.  Because Finance Minister Fujii has been retained in the same  post, we also thought you would be retained as the international  trade and industry minister. How come you have been appointed  as chief cabinet secretary?    [Kumagai] Well, this would not have happened if the Social  Democratic Party of Japan had remained in the coalition. With  the reduced number of members, the ruling coalition has to deal  not only with party affairs but also cabinet tasks. So, it was  inevitable for me to accept the post.    [Tahara] Some reporters told me that Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa has sent you to the  cabinet as his other self. Is this true?    [Kumagai] I am often called an aide to Mr. Ozawa. I was  when I and Mr. Ozawa were in the same faction. But now I argue  with him and sometimes oppose what he says. Subjectively  speaking, I am not his aide. But because I have worked with  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata for a long time, I can say I serve  as a bridge between Ozawa and Hata.    [Tahara] Mr. Ozawa is often criticized as being dictatorial  and for his arbitrary decision-making together with [Komeito  Secretary General] Yuichi Ichikawa. Is what has been said about  him true?    [Kumagai] I think there are some points in his political  style that he should reflect on. But what has been said about  him is untrue. He is a poor talker and not a careful tactician.  He usually makes a frontal attack. He does not conduct  behind-the-scenes negotiations, even when we expect him to do so.    [Tahara] Some say he is slovenly.    [Kumagai] Rather than calling him slovenly, I would say he  can do no more than making a frontal attack.    [Tahara] So he is like a baseball pitcher who can throw only  a fast ball?    [Kumagai] Yes, he is just like a pitcher who can throw only  a fast ball at the speed of 170 km three times and does nothing  else the rest of the game.    [Tahara] I would like to ask about the uproar caused by the  formation of the parliamentary group "Kaishin." When the SDPJ  secretary general appeared on this program recently, I asked him  whether Ozawa and Komeito's Ichikawa really make decisions  arbitrarily in the coalition. Kubo's answer was no. So I  thought Kubo was on good terms with Ozawa. Do you not think the  uproar would not have occurred if Ozawa had made just one call  to Kubo?    [Kumagai] I do not know. We had only a vague idea that a  new parliamentary group might be gradually formed toward the end  of the current Diet session. We thought if the formation of a  new group was planned that day, only small parties would come  together and announce the formation of Kaishin. But things  progressed before we knew what was happening.    [Tahara] I also thought only the Democratic Socialist Party  and the Japan New Party would participate in the group.    [Kumagai] In his political concept, Mr. Ozawa has the desire  to form two major political forces and then establish a  two-party system. Because an unexpected person moved to form  the group, I think Mr. Ozawa lost control of himself and took  the opportunity.    [Tahara] So he is careless. (laughing)    [Kumagai] Yes, I think he is.    [Tahara] That is one thing I wanted to ask you today.  In connection with our earlier discussion, the fact is the  ruling parties hold only one-third of the lower house seats and  only one-fourth of the upper house seats. The cabinet is very  much a minority administration. Some term this a caretaker  government for the next election, or for the passage of the  budget. How do you intend to carry on?    [Kumagai] This is not what we originally planned. If we had  enough time, we would have engaged in more patient persuasion of  the SDPJ and Sakigake to remain in the coalition. It is a  shame, because we had agreed on Hata as prime minister, although  there was a procedural fault; we also reached a basic agreement  on policy. It would have been merely a question of how to start  with a clean slate to make up for the procedural mistake, and it  would have been necessary to work by all means to persuade them  to return to the coalition. However, the Diet session had been  suspended due to various issues. Then the air crash occurred in  Nagoya, the budget remained untouched, and nothing was being  done about the economy which was starting to show initial signs  of recovery. Many things were left undone. This affected the  people's livelihood. Thus, in a sense we had to take off  because of the time limit.    I personally believe that although the SDPJ is saying it is  impossible for them to return to the coalition since agreements  have been reached on basic policies, based on this policy accord  and on the consensus that Hata is the right man we need to keep  our door open and work to tenaciously persuade them to return to  the coalition.    There is also deliberation on the budget. We need to  continue to discuss tax reform. It is important to close the  gap in our discussion process.    [Tahara] If you intend to bring Sakigake [Harbinger] and the  SDPJ back into the coalition, would it not have been better to  give them ministerial posts?    [Kumagai] Oh, no. If we do that....    [Tahara, interrupting] For instance, Komeito and Shinseito  hold many cabinet posts. Are some of them not just temporary  occupants [kuseki join] of these positions who will make way for  returning SDPJ and Sakigake cabinet members?    [Kumagai] No, that is not the case.    [Tahara] A number of them do not seem to be competent.    [Kumagai] In the event they come back, we will have to  reshuffle the cabinet.    [Tahara] A reshuffle?    [Kumagai] I am not talking about any particular person.  With regard to the budget, the SDPJ and Sakigake say they will  cooperate because they took part in formulating it. They say  they will cooperate in passing budget-related bills. Once the  budget is passed, we will have to engage in preparatory  discussions and lay the groundwork for asking them back.    [Tahara] I think they will cooperate. They will probably  cooperate in passing the draft budget because the SDPJ also took  part in formulating it.    It is said the Diet will be dissolved after approving the  budget. As a matter of fact, a survey conducted by Voice Inc.  [name as heard] shows many people want the Diet to be dissolved.  Of course, if the Diet is dissolved, an election will be held  under the new election system. Do you agree?    [Kumagai] Of course. All preparations have been made.  Members of the deliberation panel [the electoral redistricting  panel on new constituency boundaries for the House of  Representatives] were selected in April. As far as the system  is concerned, we are supposed to start Diet deliberations on the  redistricting bills within six months of the members being  selected. However, the agreement among the ruling parties,  including the SDPJ, says they will try to enact the  redistricting bills during the current Diet session. It is said  that procedures to enact the bills take time. However, we are  having endless discussions compared to the discussions the LDP  had during the Kaifu administration. We are preparing ourselves  to listen to the opinions of local cities. The next step is to  map out fundamental ideas needed to enact the bills. Once we  have this yardstick, then the remaining problems will be  technical matters. All we have to do is to actually rezone the  precincts according to the plan. It is not a dream at all to  start Diet deliberations during the current Diet session if the  members of the working group work energetically.    [Tahara] Suppose an election is held under the new  system. When do you think is the earliest it will be held?    [Kumagai] We can hold it around July.    [Tahara] What? Masuzoe, would you listen to this for a  moment? Do you think an election can be held in July?    [Masuzoe] It can be done if we want.    [Kumagai] It is not something we can force.    [Tahara] I mean, if it is possible.    [Kumagai] Our fundamental understanding is that the current  Diet session will end on 29 July. The coalition and the SDPJ  have had discussions and have agreed to complete its  deliberations during the current Diet session.    [Tahara] Does it mean the current Diet session may be  extended? Will it be extended in order to rezone the precincts?    [Kumagai] It will cause problems if a government official  says such things. What I mean to say is that it is possible if  we can reach an agreement.    [Tahara] Is it possible to extend the Diet session?    [Kumagai] Yes.    [Tahara] Would you like to pass redistricting bills even if  you have to extend the term of the current Diet session?    [Kumagai] As you know, Tsutomu Hata became chairman of the  Election System Research Council when the Kaifu administration  was inaugurated following the Recruit scandal. In other words,  he was the first LDP member who stood up for the reform.    [Tahara] You mean election system reform?    [Kumagai] Yes. That was his starting point. To Tsutomu  Hata, adoption of redistricting bills will put an end to his  quest.    [Tahara] It has to end.    [Kumagai] He has to complete what he started to talk about  in front of the people, otherwise he cannot rest.    [Tahara] Let me go back to what we were discussing earlier.  Do you think July is too early, even if relevant bills are  approved by extending the term of the current Diet session?  Masuzoe said earlier the election would be held in September.    [Masuzoe] An election has to be held within six months.  Initially, three months was required for public notification.  Six months plus three months is nine months. However, nobody  needs a three-month notification because people watch TV. They  will know it right away. Also, there are 300 seats in total.  There will be no change in the total number of seats; only  minor changes are needed. If you make a change in one district,  then you have to make a change in other districts. The council  can inform us about new constituency boundaries tomorrow if we  ask them to.    [Tahara] This means that an election, no matter how soon it  may be held, can be held under the new election system.    [Masuzone] There will be no problem at all from a legal  point of view.    [Kumagai] Masuzone is quite right. However, it is necessary  for the panel members to come up with a yardstick, or to listen  to the opinions of local autonomies once again. They need to  fulfill the minimum requirements. Therefore, it is impossible  for them to submit the bills in May. They need to work hard for  a certain period of time. Moreover, politicians' opinions  should be reflected in the bills, otherwise the bill will never  be approved.    [Tahara] I have a feeling half of the politicians do not  want political reform.    [Kumagai] It is more than half.    [Tahara] More than half of the politicians?    [Kumagai] Including myself.    [Tahara] Are you saying you are included in the half of the  politicians who do not want political reform?    [Kumagai] No, I am not. I mean to say that I benefited  from the election system for medium precincts. This is an  imaginary destruction. In other words, we grudgingly agreed and  pledged to the people that we would make changes by destroying  the election system for medium precincts. We should be ashamed  if we break that promise.    [Masuzoe] Is it possible to pass redistricting bills before  approving the budget?    [Kumagai] Theoretically, it is possible.    [Masuzoe] That means you can insist on saying you cannot  pass the budget unless redistricting bills are approved.    [Kumagai] Well, I cannot say that. The Diet, which will  begin on Monday, will be turned upside down if I said that.  [laughing] I have to remain cool as much as possible.    [Tahara] The Hata administration is determined to approve  the budget and redistricting bills during the current Diet  session even at the risk of extending the Diet session.    [Kumagai] The Hata cabinet has to enact by all means the  1994 budget bill and the bills on new constituency boundaries  during the current Diet session.    [Tahara] Do we still have enough time? We do? There is  another thing I would like to talk about. It's about the Korean  peninsula issue. I hope a war will not break out on the Korean  peninsula. However, how is Japan going to deal with an  emergency situation? The Japanese people think about this  issue. UN Forces or the U.S. military will be dispatched if war  breaks out. Well, the foreign minister said today on another TV  program that we need to change various things in order to deal  with such an emergency. Do you think we need to make legal  preparations? What do you think?    [Kumagai] Well, the foreign minister....    [Tahara, interrupting] He was referring to the Self-Defense  Force Law. He was talking about the possibility of revising the  law.    [Kumagai] Well, regarding the Self-Defense Law, a bill was  already submitted to the Diet. We went through a bitter  experience.    [Tahara] Some are asking what Japan can do. Some say we  should introduce a law only for a limited period of time. As a  matter of fact, Komeito's Secretary General Yuuichi Ichikawa  said during this program last week that we should take  legislative actions. What do you think, Kumagai?    [Kumagai] The Hosokawa administration said Japan will act  within the scope of the Constitution. The administration did  not say within the scope of laws because....    [Tahara, interrupting] This means new laws can be  introduced.    [Kumagai] That is correct. We have to do that as a matter  of course. However, negotiations on the North Korean issue are  coming to the final stage. The UN is trying to settle the issue  peacefully on the basis of the UNSC statement. Negotiations  with the DPRK are entering their final stage. Judging from the  tacit rules of the International Atomic Energy Agency, it is not  a good idea at this stage to threaten the DPRK by hinting at the  possibility of taking military action. I think we should  prudently deal with the issue. However, we have to prepare  ourselves for various cases, and this is another story. It is  true that the government has studied necessary measures.    [Tahara] Masuzoe, what do you think about this issue?  Do you have any opinions?    [Masuzoe] For example, in case we need to rescue Japanese  citizens living abroad, the issue of revising the Self-Defense  Forces [SDF] Law will naturally arise.    [Kumagai] A related bill has been submitted to the Diet, but  it has not been easy to enact.    [Masuzoe] There is also the question of how to deal with  "nyukan ho" [the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition  Act] in case refugees come to Japan. Moreover, when the United  Nations adopts a resolution calling for sanctions against North  Korea, and the sanctions include a ban on remittances to North  Korea by "Chosen Soren" [General Association of Korean  Residents], will Japan fully implement them? I do not think  "gaitame ho" [the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control  Law] is sufficient to that end. If the critical scenario for  this situation becomes reality in a month, Japan will not have  enough time to deal with these issues. Do you think these  issues will cause the cabinet to collapse?    [Kosaka] I think it is necessary to form a large coalition  government. The current cabinet has the capability of dealing  with these issues, or the people would not have empowered the  cabinet to do so. This is because the cabinet is a minority  administration. I am talking about a possible scenario.  Although I do not want to say this, the government should have  started making preparations for North Korea's nuclear issue two  years ago. Since there is confusion in the administration, it  has no choice but to apologize to the public.    [Kumagai] Most people, including the Hata cabinet, know what  we should do if events occur. They know this well. I am not  saying we are studying necessary measures. However, if we spell  out our policy during peace time when nothing is happening, this  will create much confusion due to the current political  situation. However, we understand North Korea is serious and  the situation is fast developing into a reality. It is true we  are now studying what we should do. Once a consensus is  reached, it will be possible for us to establish a crisis  control system in a heartbeat.    [Tahara] Do you mean that although the government should not  talk about such things while nothing is happening, it can  properly deal with the situation when something happens? Do you  think the government needs to take legislative measures?    [Kumagai] To that end, a political procedure is necessary.  As you said, since we are minority ruling parties we cannot do  everything in haste. After all, the establishment of a  political foundation or mainstream thinking will naturally be a  precondition for adopting political procedures.    [Masuzoe] My opinion runs counter to yours. Because the  government has not studied the necessary measures in a  cool-headed manner during peace time, including adopting  legislation in case of an emergency, there is a possibility that  if Japan decides to revise the SDF Law for the purpose of  rescuing overseas Japanese, this will worsen relations with  South Korea. It is rather dangerous for the government to enact  emergency defense legislation when it is terribly upset by a  serious situation. If you enact legislation, do you intend to  do so without going through the legal formalities?    [Kumagai] No, it is impossible for us to violate the law.  This issue....[pauses] However, we do not think the situation  will suddenly develop into a military collision. What measures  the United Nations will take in the future depends on the next  moves by North Korea. In dealing with the Gulf war, the United  Nations spent almost half a year accumulating its resolutions in  a persistent manner, and it gradually reached its final decision  while observing Iraqi reaction. While watching developments at  the United Nations, we need to appeal to the public regarding  necessary measures; the government may need to change its policy  depending on these developments. We have created conditions to  that end.    [Kosaka] It is good to prepare for various scenarios. We  should do so during peace time. Therefor we must make  preparations now--for example, a measure to rescue Japanese  living abroad. But if we cannot do that, we need to accept the  situation. Because we have not made preparations so far, it  would be better not to enact an emergency legislation. In that  case, the government needs to apologize to the United States and  the international community for not participating in their  actions, and must apologize to those citizens living abroad for  being unable to rescue them. If the administration is not  supported by the entire nation after making such an apology, it  cannot deal with the situation. But I do not think such a  scenario will occur. If my expectations are wrong, I will  apologize. [laughter]    [Tahara] Mr. Kumagai, the issue of the tax system must be  considered in addition to the electoral system and budget issues.    [Kumagai] This is a major issue.    [Tahara] Do you intend to solve the tax issue during the  current Diet session?    [Kumagai] No, we hope to enact relevant bills by the end of  this year. To that end, we need to reach an accord among the  ruling parties, including the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ], which used to be a ruling party.    [Tahara] Do you hope to do so by around the end of June?    [Kumagai] The current Diet session will end on 29 June. So  I mean during the current Diet session.    [Tahara] Do you hope to have a general plan for tax reform  during the current Diet session?    [Kumagai] Yes.    [Tahara] Now that the SDPJ has become an opposition party,  do you think the SDPJ intends to reach an accord with the  coalition?    [Kumagai] Like the issue of North Korea, this issue is a  major topic of the nine-point policy agreement, which was  reached among the ruling parties, including the SDPJ. The SDPJ  made bold to make concessions on this issue. There will be  various arguments on the details of the agreement. I think we  need to solemnly continue our efforts. As such, it is not  appropriate for us to promote work by ourselves without  consulting with the SDPJ. We need to continue to keep our door  open to the SDPJ and to seek its views. While communicating  with the SDPJ through such measures, we would like the party to  return to its past stance in line with the coalition.    [Tahara] Do you need to urge the Liberal Democratic Party  [LDP] to help as well?    [Kumagai] This is a matter of course. An additional clause  of the previous bill on special tax reductions stipulated  partial reform of the tax system. In a sense, this was the  LDP's proposal. For this reason, we need to urge the LDP to  cooperate in dealing with this issue.    [Tahara] Mr. Kosaka, do you have anything else you want to  ask of the new administration? You may make one more request.    [Kosaka] Well, no matter what, the administration should not  be too hasty. There is an old saying about waiting until the  time is ripe, but everyone, including Mr. Ozawa and Mr. Kumagai,  seems to have forgotten this. You should think about this.  Three months have already passed since February, but in this  period there has been commotion over a national welfare tax or a  reshuffling of the cabinet. Who would want to [words  indistinct] at such a busy time? If they had passed the budget  bill and worked out the new electorate divisions during that  time, they would be happy right now. The last three months have  shown how bad things can turn out to be when you rush things.    [Kumagai] Well, they certainly say "walk but do not run."    [Tahara] Well, maybe that has something to do with your  earlier remarks about Mr. Ozawa's character -- that he is a  hasty person... short-tempered.    [Kumagai] Well, he is always very direct.    [Tahara] You mean throwing fast, straight balls only?    [Kumagai] Yes, like he does not like to beat around the  bushes.    [Tahara] I think you could tell Mr. Ozawa to stop doing  this.    [Kumagai] Yes, that is right. Not only by myself, but  together with Prime Minister Hata. I think this is a question  of style.    [Tahara] Do you think Prime Minister Hata can do this?    [Kumagai] Well, Prime Minister Hata is quite stubborn. As  prime minister, he would be the only person who could stand up  to Mr. Ozawa's fast balls. When he is really determined -- I am  talking about Prime Minister Hata -- then you had better watch  out.</p>

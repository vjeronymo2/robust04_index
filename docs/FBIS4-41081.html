Control posts are being  built on both banks of the river, after which the work to  restore the Inguri bridge will begin.    Deputy Commander of the Russian troops in the Transcaucasus  Major-General Vassiliy Belchenko told Interfax that two  battalions were ready to take part in the peacekeeping mission  in Abkhazia.

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> If you're having a problem with a major appliance, you may be tempted to throw  it out and buy a new one.  </P> <P> Don't be hasty, advises the Major Appliance Consumer Action Panel.  </P> <P> If you contact an authorized service agency or the customer relations office of  the manufacturer, you may save money and hassle, and in some cases even have  the appliance replaced.  </P> <P> The panel suggests that you first reread the use and care booklet and check the  appliance's plug, fuses, pilots and controls. You may discover the problem  yourself.  </P> <P> Once you're sure the problem is with the appliance, contact an authorized  service agency for a written diagnosis of the problem, a list of parts required  for repair, and an estimate of costs for both parts and labor.  </P> <P> Then write to the manufacturer's customer relations office, usually listed in  the use and care booklet which comes with the appliance.  </P> <P> Describe the complaint clearly and include copies of the service agency's  diagnosis, along with proof of purchase, and model and serial numbers.  </P> <P> Tell the manufacturer what you think is a reasonable solution. Be sure to  include your address and a daytime telephone number, along with copies of  service receipts and correspondence relating to the repair.  </P> <P> If you're still not satisfied, contact MACAP, a volunteer mediation group made  up of industry professionals. It is sponsored by the Assn. of Home Appliance  Manufacturers.  </P> <P> The panel will review your complaint, contact the manufacturer again and  recommend a nonbinding solution, when appropriate. The panel is at 20 N. Wacker  Drive, Chicago, Ill. 60606.  </P></p>

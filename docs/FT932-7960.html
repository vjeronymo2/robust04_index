			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Russia sets tough debt terms RUSSIA is demanding repayment on harsh terms of the trillions of roubles it is owed by the other former Soviet republics. Members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, they are ostensibly committed to establishing a closer economic union. In talks with the states, Russia has demanded: that repayment must start from 1994; that the interest rate on the debt must be paid at 2 per cent above the prevailing interbank rate; that the repayments be denominated in dollars at a rate pegged to that prevailing in the middle of last year, when the rouble was much stronger against the dollar. Western advisers following these negotiations say the terms are exceptionally tough - especially as Russia has benefited from a five-year postponement on payment of interest and capital on its Dollars 80bn-plus debt with the London and Paris clubs. However, they are also seen as an opening gambit, albeit one showing Russia is no longer willing or able to deal with its neighbours on any other than commercial terms. Most of the debt is in the form of technical credits advanced over recent years which have allowed the republics to keep on buying Russian energy and manufactured goods. Russia's dominance as an energy producer has meant it is the creditor country in nearly all bilateral relationships with other CIS members. However, the debtor countries are in most cases even more impoverished than Russia, with much less possibility than Russia of earning hard currency through energy or other sales. Their continuing need for Russian credits is illustrated by the intention of the Ukrainian government to seek a further Rbs1,000bn credit line with which to pay for Russian oil and gas this year. Russia's potential to earn hard currency this year and next has been further damaged by the continuing fall in oil output.</p>

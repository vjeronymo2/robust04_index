Liu Fangren said: Party committees and governments at all  levels must uphold the basic line of "one center, two basic  points," seek truth from facts, seize opportunities, and quicken  the pace of development. They should adopt the idea of moving  ahead as fast as possible, forging ahead bravely, and being  courageous enough to do pioneering work. In the course of  deepening reform, they should help advance the overall process,  strive to make breakthroughs at key points, integrate theory  with practice, apply various economic policies properly and  flexibly, make substantial efforts to seize opportunities and  strive to gain the initiative, and seek development while  overcoming difficulties.    Liu Fangren said: Today, the gap between eastern and western  regions is widening. A poor region like Guizhou Province should  have a sense of urgency. We must adopt and firmly establish in  our mind the idea of macroagriculture and develop the rural  economy in an all-round way. While not relaxing grain  production, we should vigorously develop diversified economic  operations, township and town enterprises, animal husbandry, and  courtyard economy. We must actively use the noncultivated land  resources to optimum results, conduct farming properly, and try  to reclaim more farmland from mountains. In organizing the  implementation of reform measures, we must subject local to  overall and immediate to long-term interests, handle well the  relationship among reform, development, and stability, and  create a fine environment for economic development. We must make  a good job of the grass-roots organization building in rural  areas, focusing on the building of party branches, so that for  each village, a good party branch secretary is selected, a good  leadership group set up, and a road to prosperity found. It is  necessary to establish a scientific management system and do a  good job in the [words indistinct] activity, so that this  activity can be brought to a new height.    Liu Fangren also emphasized that in the future, when  assessing the performance of leading cadres of the autonomous  prefecture and counties, we should, first, look at the growth  rate of revenue in the specific locality; second, find out how  much peasant per-capita net income has grown; and third, find  out how well party and spiritual civilization building have been  conducted.</p>

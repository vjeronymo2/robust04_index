			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Shrinking budgets but defence stays at the core THE WAY British Aerospace talks about its military business it would be easy to forget that defence budgets are shrinking throughout the industrialised world and that the UK Ministry of Defence is in the throes of fresh cost-cutting. 'The defence company is still at the core,' said Mr John Cahill, the chairman who arrived at BAe last year as a newcomer to the arms business. Mr Dick Evans, chief executive, echoed the optimistic tone about BAe's aircraft-to-ammunition defence division, which accounts for 40 per cent of group sales: 'Overall performance remains strong, with excellent prospects for the future.' Last year's defence profits of Pounds 352m before interest and tax counterbalanced the Pounds 337m lost in commercial aircraft. However, the result was lower than the restated profit figure of Pounds 371m for the previous year. Military sales also fell to just over Pounds 4bn, compared with Pounds 4.27bn in 1991 and a peak of Pounds 4.64bn in 1990. In spite of the recent decline, BAe claims to have outperformed the rest of the defence market since 1988 with an increase of about 10 per cent against an overall market decline of some 12 per cent. The results of cost-cutting, including the closure of facilities in the missile, military aircraft and Royal Ordnance subsidiaries, were beginning to bear fruit, Mr Evans said. Labour costs had been reduced by 40 per cent since 1988. As a proportion of sales, labour and overheads had dropped from 45 per cent to 30 per cent. Mr John Weston, chairman of BAe Defence, said all parts of the division were profitable. Additional cutbacks were likely but there were no further substantial closures in view. Exports made up 74 per cent of BAe's military turnover last year, compared with a level in the mid-1980s of just over 40 per cent. Prospects have been boosted in the last 12 months by three crucial breakthroughs: a Pounds 570m MoD contract to go ahead with the Asraam air-to-air missile, agreement on a revised programme for the four-nation Eurofighter and the recent Saudi order for 48 more Tornado bombers. Mr Evans disclosed that payment for the Tornados, part of a package worth between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 5bn, would be separate from the current arrangements for the Al-Yamamah arms supply pact, to which Saudi Arabia dedicates 500,000 barrels of oil per day. Final payment details were still under negotiation, he said.</p>

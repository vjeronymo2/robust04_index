[passage omitted]    We have learned that Aleksandr Yakovlev, head of the Federal  Television and Radio Broadcasting Service, has called a meeting  of representatives on all sides to look for a solution following  the ultimatum from communications workers. The meeting adopted  a letter to the prime minister, stressing that allocation of  money to clear the debts to the communications workers is a  political more than an economic necessity. People should have  access to news regardless, and the government should fulfill its  obligations to the Communications Ministry and to state  television and radio companies.</p>

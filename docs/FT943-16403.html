			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Views sought on rolling settlement Pro-Share, the London Stock Exchange-backed group which promotes wider share ownership, has launched a survey to assess the requirements of small shareholders under a 'rolling settlement' share purchase system. In particular, Pro-Share wants to find out how much direct contact shareholders want to have with the companies they invest in if they are forced into the use of so-called nominee companies. Starting on July 18, the traditional two- to three-week settlement period will end and shares will have to be paid for or delivered within 10 business days of the bargain being struck. The move to rolling settlement is expected to increase the use of nominee companies which will hold customers' shares in the nominee's name, although beneficially for the client. That means all communication the company formerly had directly with the shareholder will be held instead with the nominee company. Pro-Share has helped to devise a proposed code of conduct for nominees which would require that 'non-asset related' materials from the company is sent to actual shareholders. These are materials such as annual reports which do not suggest actions on 'matters affecting the value of the company'. But on matters such as takeover bids, the code will not require nominees to ascertain the preferences of actual owners before voting on their behalf.</p>

On the agenda are the withdrawal of the Russian troops from  Estonia, the social protection of Russian military pensioners  living in Estonia, and other questions of bilateral relations.    Vasily Svirin, Russia's top negotiator, said earlier Russia  will now present the detailed timetable for the troop withdrawal  from January through August.    Svirin said the timetable contains the dates for the pullout  of all units as well as the number of men serving in them.

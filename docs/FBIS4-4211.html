			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President  Rong Yiren met with Jean Matteoli, chairman of the Economic and  Social Council of France, and his party here this morning.    Rong welcomed Matteoli to China on behalf of the Chinese  Government.    Being here for the first time, Matteoli said that through  the  current visit, he hoped he could establish connections with the  Chinese leaders so as to serve the development of the friendly  relations between France and China.    Matteoli said that developing such relations was in the  interests of the two countries.    Rong said that generally, Sino-French cooperation and  exchanges in politics, economy, culture, science and technology  have made progress since the two set up diplomatic ties 30 years  ago, though there were twists and turns during the period.    The recent visit to China by Prime Minister Balladur had  contributed a lot to the promotion of bilateral relations, Rong  said.    China and France suffered tremendous losses in World War Two  and therefore both cherish and work for world peace.    The present world is not so peaceful, said Rong, and the  situation requires different nations, on the basis of the five  principles of peaceful coexistence, to enhance exchanges and  deepen understandings, so as to make joint efforts to safeguard  peace in the world.    The Chinese vice-president stressed that as China and France  are both permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, their  friendly cooperative relations have significant meanings for  international peace.    Matteoli agreed with Rong's views.    The Economic and Social Council is a legislation  consultation  institution in France. Matteoli and his party are here on a  friendly visit as guests of the National Committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.</p>

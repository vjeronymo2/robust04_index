			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters suggested that, in addition to cross-referring to &sect;488.234 of the proposed rule (redesignated as &sect;488.452, ``State and Federal disagreements involving findings not in agreement in situations where there is no immediate and serious threat''), we should refer the reader to proposed &sect;488.212(a) (``Action when there is no immediate and serious threat''), and to &sect;488.232 of the proposed rule (redesignated as &sect;488.450, ``Continuation of payments to a facility with deficiencies''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We believe this to be unnecessary. We try, to the greatest extent possible, to avoid redundancy in regulations. When trying to determine what to do when there is State and Federal disagreement, it is most likely that the reader will consult &sect;488.452. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another commenter suggested that the text of our proposed &sect;488.202(e) be revised to state, ``If the State and HCFA disagree on the decision to impose remedies when HCFA has performed a validation survey, the disagreement is resolved in accordance with [proposed] &sect;488.234.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Not allowing HCFA to impose remedies unless and until it has performed its own validation survey would, in most cases, significantly lengthen the amount of time between the facility's being cited for a deficiency and the time when a remedy would be imposed. This would not fulfill the intent of the Act, which states that criteria as to when and how each of the remedies is to be applied ``shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the remedies *&blank;*&blank;*'' (sections 1819(h)(2)(B) and 1919(h)(2)(B) of the Act). In any event, the Act does not limit the Secretary's ability to make findings exclusively through the use of validation surveys. The Act says only that the Secretary may impose sanctions if he or she ``finds'' noncompliance. There may be occasions, for example, when the Secretary may choose to impose sanctions based on a State agency survey. We have therefore concluded that the Act did not intend that the Secretary exercise his or her oversight authority only through Federal onsite validation surveys. Nonetheless, in some cases it will only be possible to draw conclusions about facility compliance through onsite surveys. Moreover, sections 1819(g)(3)(B) and 1919(g)(3)(B) of the Act require the Secretary to conduct validation surveys for at least 5 percent of the State survey agency's standard surveys, as long as the 5 percent equals at least 5 facilities. Therefore, many times the Secretary's enforcement decisions will arise as a result of Federal validation surveys. However, this will not always be the case. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons listed immediately above, we are making no revisions to proposed &sect;488.202(e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some members of the health care community said that the proposed 2&hyph;4 and 15-day periods are inadequate to allow facilities a fair opportunity for correcting deficiencies. In addition, commenters suggested that HCFA_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Specify whether the days are calendar days or business days; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Specify that the time frames for correction will not begin until the facility receives the notice, rather than when notice is sent; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Specify that the notice must be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested or by personal delivery, and that the State must give the facility notice in the same manner; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Provide an expedited hearing process to safeguard the facility's ability to continue its business and protect its residents from wrongful government action. This measure must be taken, the commenter said, due to the short notice we proposed to give in the case of immediate and serious threat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters said that the time frames we proposed are too long. One of these commenters expressed serious concern, noting that the Act clearly requires that immediate action be taken to remove the jeopardy in immediate and serious threat situations. This commenter urged that no notice be given before the imposition of a sanction in these cases, and suggested that, in nonimmediate and serious threat situations, 5 days notice should be given. Another said that, in many cases, it is obvious that the remedy should be imposed immediately. This consumer organization asked why a State survey agency should ever have to delay initiating monitoring visits to a facility or why a facility with widespread quality of care problems should be allowed to admit new residents for 15 days after such problems are discovered. Other commenters cited the possible continuance of ``roller coaster compliance'' unless we shorten the time frames. ``Roller coaster compliance'' refers to the facility practice of coming into compliance only long enough to stave off an impending remedy, then reverting to noncompliant activities or practices until the next time the deficiencies are cited, when the cycle begins all over again. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters said that our proposed time frames do not adequately protect residents, referring to monitors as an example. One said that in a case of jeopardy, the State might feel it necessary to have a monitor in the facility as the survey team is leaving. Waiting two days without outside scrutiny may be too long under some circumstances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

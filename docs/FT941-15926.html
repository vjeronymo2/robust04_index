			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris finishes off best but still at record Some of the continent's bourses searched for incentives yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS went ever higher, although the CAC-40 index finished off the day's best level of 2,349.20, adding 14.08 to a record 2,331.33. Turnover was FFr8.8bn. The pricing of Eurotunnel's fare structure had little effect on the share price by the close, ending just 25 centimes up at FFr55.00, although they had earlier fallen back to FFr52.25 as some investors took the view that the fare range was higher than anticipated. In contrast Michelin gathered FFr10.90 to FFr240.00 following its announcement after the close of trading on Monday that it was launching a FFr3.5bn convertible bond issue. James Capel came out strongly following the news, removing the company from its sell list and upgrading it to hold, adding that there was scope 'for sentiment to improve as automotive shares move back into favour'. In contrast to Monday's firm upward run, trading in FRANKFURT was unimpressive and the DAX index moved throughtout the session in a narrow 11 point range. The DAX index closed down 5.04 at 2,228.75. Turnover was DM10bn. There was little immediate reaction among investors to west German GDP data for 1993, which showed the worst performance for nearly 50 years, as the figures had been widely expected. Metallgesellschaft recouped most of Monday's losses, closing up DM16 at DM236, while Schering added DM40 to DM1,170 on news that it was to increase production of one of its products in the US. Chemical stocks were generally unmoved by a positive wage deal in the west German sector: Basf put on DM3.60 to DM304.50. MILAN built on early gains to end four sessions of losses as positions were covered ahead of the end of the monthly account on Friday. The Comit index added 13.28 to 602.13, although the mood remained fragile ahead of today's parliamentary vote of confidence. Montedison added L23.90 to L928.70 in huge volume of 51.2m shares - three times the trade of any other share - amid technical covering after the end of its rights issue. Ferruzzi put on L111 or 7.4 per cent in volume of 5.4m shares. Bargain hunting after recent losses lifted industrials. Fiat added L144 to L4,297 and Pirelli put on L51 to L2,053. Olivetti rose L87 to L2,053 on renewed hopes that it will win Italy's second cellular telephone license. ZURICH pulled higher after a weak opening, in further reaction to Monday's correction, and the SMI index added 10.7 to 3,026.6. Foreign selling left SMH SFr37 lower at SFr949 while SBC put on SFr18 to SFr513 as it caught up with recent rises elsewhere in the sector. Zurich Insurance shed SFr14 to SFr1,558 and Winterthur was SFr11 higher at SFr859 after one Zurich bank recommended that Winterthur had more potential for a short term advance than did Zurich. AMSTERDAM drifted aimlessly although there was a good performance out of DSM which has been lagging behind other stocks recently. The chemical groups stock added Fl 2.90 to Fl 110.50, while Akzo improved just 30 cents to Fl 207.90 on news of the European Commissions approval of its merger with Nobel. The AOE index dipped just 0.41 to 424.01. MADRID surged 1.6 per cent higher to a record close after a brisk day's trading. The general index rose 5.36 to 3333.39. The climb was attributed to high liquidity and the calming effect of comments by Banesto's former chairman, Mr Mario Conde, which gave most benefit to banking issues. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya added Pta80 to Pta3,095 and Banco Central Hispano put on Pta85 to Pta3,245. WARSAW overcame Monday's hesitant mood and the WIG index pushed 1.9 per cent ahead to a record high as selling slowed down ahead of year-end earnings reports. The index rose 272 to 13,558 in turnover of 1,500bn zloties. ISTANBUL finished at a record high for the fourth straight day in spite of heavy mid-session profit-taking after an early rally. The composite index ended 209.43 at a provisional 25,656.6 after a day's high of 26,788.83.

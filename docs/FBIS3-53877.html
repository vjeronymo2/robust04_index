			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Paris] Radio Monte Carlo has reported that Ahmad  Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC], has accused  the U.S. Administration of deception, disinformation, and  hypocrisy in its attempts to cause dissension among the allies  opposing the Palestinian limited self-rule agreement. Jibril,  who was speaking to AFP, continued: The objective that  Washington sought to achieve through the Geneva summit was to  neutralize the Syrian position so it could impose the  Gaza-Jericho First agreement. However, the strength and  firmness of the President al-Asad's position has foiled this  objective. President al-Asad stood in defense of the Arab  nation's causes and refuted all allegations. In Geneva,  President al-Asad was as we have always known him -- an Arab  knight faithful to the Arab nation's rights.</p>

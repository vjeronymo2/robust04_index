			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BUSFIELD BEARDS BEARD FOR ROLE  </P> <P> Timothy Busfield plays a naval officer in the Broadway play "A Few Good Men,"  which means he had to shave the red beard he wears on "thirtysomething."  </P> <P> Busfield told the New York Daily News that the beard was merely a gimmick to  help him get the Elliot role on "thirtysomething." "I know I look young and,  when I auditioned for the part four years ago, I wasn't even thirty-something,"  he said. "I was 29. But I wanted the part, so I figured one way of making  myself look older was growing a beard. I kept putting off an audition until I  thought it was full enough. Now I guess I'll have to start growing it again."  </P></p>

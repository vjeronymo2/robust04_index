			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 8 Mar (TANJUG) -- Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic has received Charles Redman, U.S. President  Clinton's special envoy, who arrived in Belgrade today. They  exchanged views on the current phase of the peace process in  Bosnia, particularly in light of the Washington agreement on  creating a Muslim-Croat federation.    After an hour and a half of talks with Milosevic, Redman  said: "We have reached a very important phase in the process,  which should result in a comprehensive solution to the Bosnian  conflict, something that will contribute to the stability of the  entire region."    Recalling U.S. involvement in the peace process in Bosnia  and  the agreement on a Muslim-Croat federation, Redman said things  on the ground were progressing successfully, adding in support  of this claim that the disengagement of Muslim and Croat forces  had already begun in central Bosnia.    "Today's talks with President Milosevic were the first  exchange of views," Redman said, and added: "My intention was to  be sure that President Slobodan Milosevic fully acknowledged and  understood what we are doing in the Muslim-Croat agreement."    According to the special envoy of the U.S. President, it is  time to work quickly to find a comprehensive solution to the  Bosnian conflict: "We believe that all regional elements can  play an important role in seeking a comprehensive solution. We  believe that President Milosevic, as well as other regional  leaders, will be actively involved in the second phase of the  peace process." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (14): The wise go well prepared - Practical issues for investors CHINA can be a daunting place for people who know little about the country but feel that they must not miss out on the business phenomenon of the 1990s. Businessmen and consultants familiar with the country say that it is essential to take a long-term strategic view when establishing a presence in China. Success requires patience, perseverance and flexibility. Here we provide some advice on how to set about it. PREPARATION Define your company's goals. A vague idea that China is a big market in which you should be present is far from enough. Objectives need to be established at the highest level and pursued with commitment - this is how Chinese enterprises work and your negotiators will not be on firm ground unless you do the same. This means defining the desired product of a venture, the targetted market, setting management responsibility at a high level and establishing where the project fits in to your corporate strategy. This will help to determine what structure would be the most desirable: a wholly-owned Chinese enterprise, an equity joint venture, a co-operative agreement or assembly contract. Research should be done on government policies in your areas of business, since a venture will have a far greater chance of receiving strong backing if it is in line with official priorities. APPROACHING THE CHINESE Expect years to pass between your first contacts and the eventual start of operations. Chinese business and government work on an informal system of personal relationships, called guanxi. This does not imply corruption - it is simply the way that things get done. Relationships need to be built over time, through repeated visits and often by arranging visits for Chinese officials and executives to your headquarters. Do not reveal your full aims, ideas or requests for specific information until you have established these links. Remember that the people you meet are themselves constantly seeking to build guanxi. Over time you want yours to be as good as theirs, and this will help your negotiating position. China's reform and expansion does not mean that there has been a radical change in practice within the bureaucracy with which you have to deal. Nothing can be taken for granted. At the same time, companies should be wary of wide public mood swings about China and keep their focus on conditions in their areas of business. CHOICE OF PARTNER AND NEGOTIATION Choosing your partner is the most important decision. If your first contact is with a ministry, do not be too easily directed towards the first potential partner suggested. Work out who has relationships of patronage with whom. Western companies are likely to choose state-owned enterprises as their partners because they have strong links with supervisory bodies, need injections of capital and technology, and are likely to be permanent fixtures. Beware of a state-owned enterprise which is seeking to diversify out of out-dated products into areas it knows little about. However, you may judge an apparently unlikely partner to be the right one: for example, Baskin-Robbins of the UK Allied-Lyons group is opening ice cream stores in partnership with the China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control agency. The most important criterion in choosing a partner is establishment of a correspondence of respective goals. The goals of each partner do not have to be the same, but they must not conflict and they must require mutual co-operation. This cannot be discussed too much. You need to be satisfied that success of the venture is as important to your partner as it is to you and that you agree on the means to achieve it. Part of the consideration of the right partner will be its location: infrastructure and costs must be assessed. Tax and other incentives offered to foreign investors are far more uniform across China than previously. Understand on which documents the Chinese side places weight. A joint feasibility study conducted with official participation is more important than the earlier letter of intent. It is vital to ascertain who has the final say. CONTRACTUAL AND LEGAL ISSUES Views differ on the need for detail in a contract. Negotiations are the vehicle for nailing down detailed agreements on all aspects of a venture's business - such as shareholding structure, product, technology transfer, local content, whether products are to be exported, marketing, finance, tax, access to foreign currency, management, recruitment, training. However, the resulting contract does not have the weight that it would have in the west because China lacks the necessary body of law as well as an adequate judicial system. Virtually anything is negotiable. Topics which had been closed can be re-opened. There would however be seeking of redress for breaches of contract through the courts. It is likely that the use of arbitrators will grow. MANAGEMENT Many foreign companies will insist that they appoint the general manager of a joint venture. Even if they do, it is important to keep cementing the friendship with the Chinese partner so that problems can be dealt with in a co-operative fashion as they inevitably arise. After start-up, management is the key issue. Foreign companies will generally place an expatriate manager on site whose principal role will be helping to improve management practices. Chinese staff may have a high level of technical expertise but are unfamiliar with the concept of management responsibility and often view it as being risky to take the initiative and cut across bureaucratic practices. This does not mean that foreign managers must simply attempt to impose western practices. They have to be patient and adaptable in attempting to deal with Chinese problems in a Chinese way, while increasing levels of efficiency and responsibility. One foreign manager says: 'If you've just got solutions, you're doomed to failure. You have to see what the problems are, and then try to solve them.' CONTACTS A growing number of foreign consultants, law and accountancy firms have established offices in China and can provide considerable expertise as well as access to Chinese contacts. Commercial sections of embassies in Beijing are good sources of information. In Britain, the China-Britain Trade Group (071 630 5780) is a useful place to start. INTERPRETERS Good interpreters are essential and hard to find. Poor translation means poor communication. This will lead to verbal and cultural misunderstandings which could haunt a venture in future years, as well as failure to build the necessary understanding, friendship and trust. Translators may weaken your points to avoid giving offence, which can both help and hinder negotiations. Good, sensitive translators are likely to take on a wider role as advisers on the attitudes of the people with whom they are negotiating, as well as a general source of information. Companies increasingly need to have executives who are fluent in Chinese. USEFUL READING For serious economic information, the World Bank has a number of important publications and the IMF recently published Occasional Paper No 107, China at the Threshold of a Market Economy. Powerful, readable books include Jung Chang's Wild Swans, Nien Cheng's Life and Death in Shanghai and Amy Tan's The Kitchen God's Wife. Also interesting is Colin Thubron's Behind the Wall. Historical overview is provided by Jonathan Spence, The Search for Modern China, and John King Fairbank, The Great Chinese Revolution 1800-1980. A useful tale for investors is Jim Mann's Beijing Jeep. Chinese Profiles by Zhang Xinxin and Sang Ye is oral history. Geremie Barme and Linda Jaivin's New Ghosts, Old Dreams is a collection of modern writings. Fang Lizhi's Bringing Down the Great Wall; Writings on Science, Culture and Democracy in China gives a sense of the Chinese mind.</p>

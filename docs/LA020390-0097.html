			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER THE WALL: AN EAST GERMAN IN LONG BEACH'S 'COPPELIA';  </P> <P> DANCE: DAVID WILCOX DEDICATES TODAY'S PREMIERE TO THE GERMAN PEOPLE AND BRINGS  IN BALLET MASTER THOMAS VOLLMER AS DR. COPPELIUS.  </P> <P> Caught up in the euphoria of East Berlin's liberation, Long Beach Ballet  director David Wilcox barely knew what to do first.  </P> <P> For starters, he dedicated his production of "Coppelia," which has its premiere  this afternoon, to the German people.  </P> <P> Then came a wave of nostalgia. He remembered walking across Checkpoint Charlie  several times -- as a dancer with the (West) Berlin Ballet -- to see the  Komische Oper Ballet.  </P> <P> "It was absolutely wonderful," he recalls, "and the memory set something off in  me, a desire to reach out to these artists . . . about to enjoy freedom at  last."  </P> <P> So on Jan. 11, in a moment of unbridled optimism, he picked up the phone and --  after much difficulty -- finally reached Tom Schilling, the company's director:  </P> <P> " 'Nothing could make me happier,' I told Schilling, 'than having one of your  dancers come here to perform Dr. Coppelius. What better way to celebrate?' And  he seemed just as eager as I to accomplish the goal."  </P> <P> So begins a tale of two cities and Thomas Vollmer, among the first dancers from  Germany's newly open sector to travel the free circuit for a guest engagement  since the Wall's crumbling.  </P> <P> Director Schilling told director Wilcox that he had, in Vollmer, the perfect  candidate: someone who could dance a romantic role like Romeo as well as the  caractere part that needed to be filled in Long Beach.  </P> <P> But in all the excitement, Wilcox was not told until the end of the  conversation that the agreed-upon guest artist held the title of Tanzmeister,  or ballet master, or that he had won the Bronze Medal at Moscow's 1983  International Ballet Competition, marking him as a supreme technician.  </P> <P> Considering that the Long Beach Ballet had first sought Dudley Moore to  impersonate the crotchety old Coppelius and then Stanley Holden, who  specializes in such comic characterizations, Vollmer, a virtuoso in his prime,  seemed miscast.  </P> <P> "Thomas doesn't know the traditional 'Coppelia' at all," says Wilcox. "But  he'll learn it in time. What really bothers me is using him for a role that  ignores his technique. So I've devised a little something at the conclusion to  show off the real talent."  </P> <P> Getting Vollmer a work visa, it turned out, required extensive documentation --  including reviews and references proving that he was, indeed, an exceptional  dancer. But fax operations between East Berlin and Long Beach left something to  be desired. So when the crucial packet finally arrived -- just last week --  Wilcox was nearly frantic.  </P> <P> "I went to the airport to collect it," Wilcox says, "and then directly to  Chatsworth, where an official could translate the articles, every word, into  English. Meanwhile Vollmer's ticket was waiting at the airline counter in  Berlin.  </P> <P> "Finally we got the OK and a day and a half later, on Jan. 26, Thomas arrived  here."  </P> <P> Since then, the 33-year-old native of Leipzig has been "just flabbergasted,"  says Wilcox, who speaks German fluently and translates for his guest.  </P> <P> They stopped on the way back from LAX at a large food market, and Vollmer found  the spectacle "scary," feeling like Coppelius in Wonderland as he beheld bin  after bin filled with fresh, crisp vegetables.  </P> <P> "And fruit," Vollmer says in amazement. "During the winter it's non-existent at  home. People stand in long lines only to find empty shelves."  </P> <P> Driving down the San Gabriel River Freeway, they saw a half-mile long stretch  of car dealerships.  </P> <P> No such instant wheels where Vollmer comes from: "We must be on a waiting list  15 years to buy a car."  </P> <P> Inside the Long Beach Ballet studio he also confronts a whole new situation.  His single experience with Dr. Coppelius involved a revisionist one -- with the  old toy maker being in love with Swanilda and then fashioning a doll that  looked like the heroine.  </P> <P> However, the dancer from East Berlin is not so overloaded with new information  that he fails to see the big picture of his expanding world.  </P> <P> "I come from a country," says Vollmer, "where people live poorly, you can't  imagine how poorly. But artists are special, they're given every advantage --  while, here, amid incredible wealth, there is no money for the arts.  </P> <P> "After a long, exhausting rehearsal I asked to take a shower, but David waved  his hand around the meager studio and told me none exists on the premises. What  a contrast between our countries. How different the mentality."  </P></p>

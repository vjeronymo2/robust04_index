			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Republikaner Chairman Franz Schoenhuber: </F> "Germany -- Where Are You Going? 1994 -- Year of Decision"]    [Text] "Our economic-technological system, applied by a  centralizing bureaucracy craving to rule, is eating itself up as  Saturn ate his children; we are overpopulated, have  overfabricated and overproduced, are overfed, and have  dehumanized our public servants with letters and ink, dispirited  the administration, and dissolved everything into a dead  mechanism!"    Karl Reichsfreiherr vom und zum Stein, written in the first  third of the last century.    This dead mechanism is more "alive" today than ever. The  established political class has moved too far away from  humanness, adopted dictatorial practices, and only knows one  objective: survival at any price, even at the price of the  decline of its own people: apres nous le deluge [after us the  deluge]!    Have we learned something from the historical catastrophe  that was the result of a Nazi regime gone hubristic? Maybe that  we walk upright?    I have experienced the Third Reich fully aware of what it  was, so I allow myself to compare it with other systems, and I  claim that the people who lived at that time had a higher degree  of personal courage than the present generation. Moreover, one  must take into account that resistance in those unfortunate 12  years not only meant restrictions or even the loss of one's  civil existence, but that quite frequently it even lead to  death. We Republikaners are filled with great pride that a man  such as resistance fighter Hans Hirzel, member of the "White  Rose," has found his political home in our party.    What legitimizes those who were born later to condemn those  who were maneuvered into a bitter time by fate? The regime was  criminal, but the people who lived under it were not. They were  victims of a megalomania that covered up its real intentions  very well at the beginning. However, they were also victims of  the failure of the parties in the Weimar Republic.    Those who, today, want to spare the FRG the fate of Weimar,  and who want to save our people from another moral and cultural  decline, have to go to the roots and not just treat the  symptoms. The renewal and consolidation of democracy must be  everyone's cause and not be left only to those who call  themselves representatives of the people, and who frequently  only represent interests of their own or of certain groupings.  Petitions for referenda and referenda must be rated more highly.    The watering down of traditional links and values must end,  liberalism must not be confounded with libertinism. The harmful  influence of the American way of life, which is characterized by  success-based thinking at any price, must be forced back. These  influences are particularly strong in the sphere of movies,  radio, and television. The struggle for audience rating  eliminates the last ethical and moral scruples. Women are made  the object of lusty craving, degraded into merchandise and cheap  labeled articles. The sexual act is exhibited on the screen,  just like that between apes in a zoo, in all its varieties and  deviations. While Africa is putting on clothes and listening to  Mozart, we are taking off clothes and discovering the particular  artistic value of the bush drum.    Even children are harnessed to the cart of the advertising  industry and confronted day after day with the representation of  violence of the worst kind. Such representations seduce people  into imitating them, and we citizens even promote these  activities by paying excessively high fees. One has to think  intensively about abolishing these fees.    The churches bear a great part of the blame for the moral  decline. They subject themselves almost unconditionally to the  zeitgeist to deviate attention from their failure in the Third  Reich. Here it is also true that churchmen showed more backbone  in the Nazi state than their successors do now. I would like to  mention Cardinal von Galen or Pastor Niemoeller in this  connection.    I am of the opinion that the spying activities of Manfred  Stolpe, the current minister president of Brandenburg and  Evangelical churchman, must be regarded as worse than the  divisive and ingratiating attitude of the then "Reichbishop"  Mueller in the Third Reich. Mueller acted openly, while Stolpe  was spying behind people's backs.    We Republikaners are in favor of the separation of Church  and  State. What Frederick the Great said is valid for us, namely  that each may be saved after his own fashion. Where is the  Christian way of doing things of political pastors from Hintze  to Thierse? As we can see, even for somebody like Mr. Hintze a  lie is a "bourgeois prejudice" -- just as it was for Lenin.    The church tax has favored this moral degeneration. Church  servants have become church earners. Moral regeneration of the  churches will only be possible when they go back to the status  of the early Christians, when they renew themselves in the  catacombs, so to speak.    Even many years before Bluem, who ultimately caved in  anyway,  we requested that the church tax not be levied by means of the  state. Besides, we regard it as legitimate to hold a referendum  on whether the church tax makes sense or does not.    What must also be exposed is the hypocrisy, particularly in  the case of "Christian" politicians, who are least qualified to  moralize. In my former capacity as a journalist I repeatedly  had the experience that the first thing leading Christian Social  Union officials did once they arrived at their destination on an  official visit was to ask for the address of a brothel, and then  they exchanged their "experiences" with a twinkle in their eyes.  They are the same politicians who appeared with their entire  families at Catholic Church or Evangelical Academy receptions,  effectively displaying their deep piety in public. If we  Republikaners were to strike back with the same instruments the  established parties and their foundations are using against us,  I would guarantee the moral "decapitation" of quite a few  Christian politicians and even Catholic dignitaries, who  clandestinely live in pseudomarital conditions, while calling  from their pulpits for compliance with the Church's commandments.    We are all human beings. And who will throw the first stone?  We will not! We will not even throw back the stones that bear  a signature and are aimed at us. We want an open exchange but  will not hit below the belt. We have political opponents but  not enemies. If a politician like Mr. Stoiber says the "enemy  stands at the right," then this proves, first, that he does not  know the first thing about the rules of the game of democracy  and, second, that in order to stay in power he is capable of  doing anything. After all, as everybody knows, he is determined  to conduct the election campaign with ideas right of center.    Let us not deceive ourselves. Even our party is not yet  everywhere in the best possible shape necessary to credibly  represent our causes. Self-criticism must not become a foreign  word for us. Our program is good. We must manage to bring our  program and members to one level everywhere.    The year 1994 is the year of decision -- not only for our  party, but also for our people. The zeitgeist is abdicating; it  has no more money. That gives us a chance! Let us do  everything we can to make sure people cannot say at the end of  the year: tried and found wanting! I believe in our success!</p>

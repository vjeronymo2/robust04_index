			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / World Trade News: South Korean investors switching to S E Asia SOUTH-EAST Asia displaced North America last year as the prime area for South Korean direct investment abroad, as trade patterns changed, John Burton writes from Seoul. Korean investment in South-East Asia grew 29 per cent to Dollars 555.7m (Pounds 368m), which accounted for 44 per cent of Dollars 1.26bn that Korean companies invested overseas last year, the finance ministry said. Investors were attracted by the area's expanding markets and its production costs, which are lower than in Korea. Meanwhile, Korean investment in North America, its biggest export market, fell 16 per cent to Dollars 391.6m as its share of Korea's trade shrank slightly. The biggest jump in investment was in China, Vietnam and former communist countries, with which Korea has established diplomatic relations in recent years.</p>

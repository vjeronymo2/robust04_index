			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Schneider bid for Square D examined by Canada THE Canadian government's Bureau of Competition Policy has begun a formal inquiry into the proposed acquisition of Square D of the US by France's Groupe Schneider. Both companies, which produce electrical equipment, have significant competing businesses in Canada. Under Canadian law, an inquiry begins only if there are reasonable grounds to believe an acquisition could substantially prevent or lessen competition in Canada. Square D has been fighting off Schneider efforts to take it over since February, when Schneider made an unsolicited offer of USDollars 78 per share, or Dollars 1.9bn, for the company. Square D wants to remain independent and is looking for third parties with which to make alliances. Mr Jerre Stead, chairman of Square D, said Schneider's takeover effort 'raises substantial questions under the Canadian competition laws as well as under the US anti-trust laws and competition laws of several European countries'. A US District Court is scheduled to consider Square D's allegations that the Schneider acquisition would violate US anti-trust laws on May 13. Square D is also urging the US Federal Reserve to review the Schneider takeover bid on the grounds that it would violate US banking laws. American bank holding companies are prohibited from owning more than 5 per cent of a non-banking company. At issue, according to Square D, is the control of Schneider by Paribas and Societe Generale, the big French retail bank, which hold 9.7 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, of the shares of SPEP, which in turn holds a majority interest in Schneider.</p>

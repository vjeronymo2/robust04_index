			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / The Clinton Economic Plan: Officials feel load off their shoulders - US Treasury buoyed THE Clinton economic package would enable the US to hold its head up high in international negotiations and promote its agenda of global growth more effectively, a Treasury official claimed with evident satisfaction. He said the package, which included a planned halving of the budget deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product over the next four years, was a 'real response' to calls for tough US fiscal action from trading partners. It would set the tone for better international economic relations. Foreign governments should note that the Clinton strategy was 'consciously internationalist'. The goal was to improve US economic performance not by erecting protective walls to foreign products or capital, but by domestic reforms that raised US productivity. The plan offered a real hope of lower long-term US bond yields and faster growth of output. In recent years, US economic diplomacy has been hampered by its failure to take the tough budgetary medicine advocated by its trading partners and by international bodies such as the OECD and the IMF. Since being nominated as Treasury secretary, Mr Lloyd Bentsen has repeatedly said he would try to revitalise economic co-operation between the Group of Seven industrial countries. He is attending a G7 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in London on February 27. He seems likely to press European governments to lower interest rates towards the low levels prevailing in the US and Japan as part of a co-ordinated strategy to promote global growth.</p>

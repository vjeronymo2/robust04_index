			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As shown in Table II&hyph;9, benzidine is present in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastestream at concentrations that pose a substantial risk to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human health and the environment ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , equal to or greater than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1E&hyph;5 for carcinogens) for the municipal landfill management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario. Benzidine was found to be present in several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastestreams from the manufacture of triarylmethane pigments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using aniline as a feedstock, including wastewaters from both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities that manufacture these pigments. The Agency believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that benzidine is either a raw material contaminant or a reaction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by-product from the process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Large quantities of aniline, typically in excess, are used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a raw material to this process. As a result, this wastestream  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was found to contain over three percent aniline. The calculated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high-end individual cancer-risk level for aniline is 8E&hyph;5 for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> landfill scenario.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to benzidine and aniline, the waste was found to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain two other hazardous constituents that are believed to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by-products of the reaction and pose a significant risk at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations detected for the municipal landfill management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario. Two additional compounds presented in Table II&hyph;9, 1,2-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diphenylhydrazine and azobenzene, coelute on the mass spectrum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (see Section II.D, Description of Health and Risk Assessments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a discussion on the Agency's approach to risk assessment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coeluting compounds). Both compounds are likely oxidation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products of aniline, and may be present in the waste as reaction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by-products. In addition to the uncertainty in establishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations for each of the two compounds, the chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathway from aniline to these oxidation products suggests that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either contaminant may be present at all or part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration detected. The Agency conducted the risk assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using the health-based levels for 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> azobenzene, independently. For disposal in a municipal landfill,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coeluting compounds, based on the toxicity of 1,2-diphenylhydrazine, is 2E&hyph;5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to assessing the risks associated with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual constituents found in the waste, the Agency considers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the combined risk of constituents that co-exist in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastestream. In the case of this wastewater treatment sludge,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all of the constituents discussed above ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , aniline,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benzidine, and 1,2-diphenylhydrazine/azobenzene) are believed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> co-exist in the wastestream. The processes that produce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operated continuously all year. As a result, the constituents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detected in the wastestream are likely to be present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simultaneously in the waste. Therefore, the combined calculated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk of these individual constituents, for the municipal landfill  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario would be 2E&hyph;4 at the high end.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the risks associated with the current and plausible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management practice for this wastestream (blending with non-hazardous fuel for combustion) are insignificant. As discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Section II.D, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency believes that the fuel blending will continue. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively high organic content of the waste gives the material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value as a fuel ingredient and, therefore, generators of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste have an economic incentive to continue fuel blending.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Agency is proposing not to list the wastestream as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous. If the NPDES program requirements were to change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , become more stringent) then those triarylmethane pigment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producers that currently do not generate a sludge could be forced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to generate a sludge due to their efforts to meet new NPDES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. In that case, the plausible management scenario  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would change, and other practices, such as landfilling, would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> become possible. The Agency may reopen this listing decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should this occur, and will use the risk levels associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this management scenario to make a revised listing determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency is proposing not to list as hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane pigments using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aniline as a feedstock. As shown in Table II&hyph;10, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewaters contain an average aniline concentration of 200 ppm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the wastewaters contain the same hazardous by-products found in the wastewater treatment sludge. Although this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastestream, if managed in surface impoundments, would meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria set out in 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a waste as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous and would be capable of posing a substantial present or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential risk to human health or the environment if released  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into the environment, the Agency has determined that management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in surface impoundments is not plausible for this wastestream.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes this because 100% of this wastestream is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> managed in exempt tanks. The Agency has no reason to believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this management practice will change. Risk associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment in tanks is insignificant and, thus, the Agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing not to list this waste as hazardous. However, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparison purposes, the Agency has calculated the risks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with disposal of this wastestream in a surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impoundment. If, based on comments, the Agency determines that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is not reasonable to assume that management in tanks is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correct plausible management scenario, the Agency probably would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine that management in a surface impoundment is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate plausible management scenario.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These wastewaters are generated from filtrations of process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediates and products, flushing operations, equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> washdowns, floor washings, and process operations. Based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response data from the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total of 757,080 metric tons, or 0.4 million gallons per day, of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater from the production of triarylmethane (TAM) pigments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is generated. Information on generation relevant to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion is not included at the present time due to business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidentiality concerns. All of the wastewaters generated from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TAM pigment production (using aniline as a feedstock) are treated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in tanks prior to discharge to a POTW. The data presented in Table II&hyph;10 represent three samples collected from two TAM pigment-manufacturing facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Election day in spitting distance - Ballot Box Spitting Image, the political satire programme, is to return to the television screen on April 8 - the eve of the general election. 'So far nobody has even raised a question about it,' says a spokesman for Central TV, the company that puts it out. At the last general election in 1987, a special Spitting Image programme appeared at 10pm, just after the polls closed and before the coverage of the results by ITN. It was quite savage. Will the April 8 show be equally sharp? The answer is that it is impossible to tell in advance. The political puppets will appear in front of a live audience as a sort of Question Time and the answers will be ad-libbed. A regular Spitting Image series resumes on April 12.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Workers' rights The complex wrangle around the European Commission's final revision of the Acquired Rights Directive has become a test for Europe's legislative procedures - and for the Commission's commitment to a new balance between social protection and job creation. The directive, which protects the rights of workers when organisations change ownership, became a political issue when it started to interfere with the UK government's programme for contracting-out public services. In its attempts to narrow the scope of the directive to exclude the contracting out of activities like cleaning and catering, the UK initially stood alone. But as public sector reforms spread across Europe, the UK government has acquired allies. The result is a rather obscure paragraph in the revised directive which says that only whole economic entities are subject to the directive, as opposed to more narrow activities. However, lawyers are quick to point out that in the famous Schmidt case, involving a German bank, the European Court of Justice ruled that one woman cleaner represented an economic entity. So there may be less room for manoeuvre than is implied by the revision. Part of the problem is the immense complexity involved in drafting legislation for countries with 12 different approaches to the transfer of ownership. Just as awkward is the unpredictability of the European Court itself, which is not bound by precedent and which has recently been handing down judgments which have outraged several conservative governments. Underneath all this is an even more important issue for Europe's labour markets. The original directive was based on the laudable premise that long-term relationships should be encouraged between employers and employees, and that a change of ownership should not introduce instability into those relationships. That principle cannot, however, be applied to the short-term contracts which are typical for services contracted out from the public sector. So any revision of the directive which excludes low-skilled services is likely to reinforce the trend towards a dual labour market, of well-protected insiders and less secure outsiders. That in turn would create a problem for Europe's social dimension. Beginning with last year's Delors white paper, a welcome new balance has been struck between social protection and job creation, which points towards relaxation of the acquired rights directive if it threatens to prevent the creation of more low-paid, service sector jobs. But the same white paper stressed that the burden of deregulation should not fall on the weakest sector of the labour market, as would follow from a simple loosening of the directive. The uncomfortable logic for Europe's social thinkers may be, therefore, that the directive should be scrapped altogether.</p>

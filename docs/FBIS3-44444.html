			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Weiling: "Fueling Growth With Nuke </F> Power"]    [Text] China is speeding nuclear power plant construction  to fuel its dynamic economic growth.    By the year 2000, the country's nuclear power plants will  have a capacity of 6 million kilowatts while new plants with  another 6 million kilowatts in capacity will be under  construction, You Deliang, a spokesman of the China National  Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) said yesterday.    China's first nuclear power station, at Qinshan in Zhejiang  Province, is now safely and efficiently operating, You added.    And, by the end of this year, experts predict it will have  generated 1.73 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity since it  was linked to the national grid in December 1991.    Work on Qinshan's second phase, two generators with a  capacity of 600,000 kilowatts each, has also begun.    Meanwhile, Generator No 1 at the Daya Bay Nuclear Power  Station is expected to go into commercial operation soon, while  Generator No 2 will go into commercial operation before next  June.    Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station, near Shenzhen in Guangdong  is  the country's first joint-venture nuclear power plant.    Its two generators are designed to generate 10 to 12.6  billion kilowatthours of electricity a year, he said.    The power will be sold to Guangdong Province and Hong Kong  to  support their economic development.    CNNC President Jiang Xinxiong said the establishment of the  two power stations was a milestone for China's nuclear power  industry.    The Chinese began late in this field and must strive to make  advances to fuel the country's economic growth, he said.    China's booming economy has also provided a huge market for  nuclear energy, Jiang said.    Provinces, especially in Southeast China's coastal areas,  consider nuclear power an important means to meet their  increasing energy demands.    Jiang said the corporation had also made big strides in  developing nuclear fuel.    A production line, introduced from France to produce pressed  [as published] water reactor (PWR) nuclear fuel has been built  and is due to go into production next year.    Jiang said CNNC's industrial output in 1993 rose 37.7  percent  compared to last year. In addition, CNNC is trying to grab a  share of the international market by exporting its nuclear power  generators.    Pakistan is negotiating with China to import a second  300,000- kilowatt generator now that the first one is being  built.</p>

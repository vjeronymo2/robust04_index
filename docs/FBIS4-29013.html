			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu said Wednesday that moves are afoot at the U.N.  Security Council to complete a draft resolution on North Korea  this week for adoption in two to three weeks' time.    Han made the remark at a meeting of lawmakers and local  chapter heads from the ruling Democratic Liberal Party held at  the Lawmakers Hall of the National Assembly.    The foreign minister's remarks are understood to signify  that  Pyongyang's withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] would cause the U.N. resolution to be advanced by  one week from the original schedule.    With regard to China's position on sanctions against  Pyongyang, Han said, "Intensive diplomatic efforts to win the  constructive cooperation of China are underway. China is well  aware that North Korea is accountable for the current critical  situation of its nuclear row.    "Pyongyang's quitting the IAEA will not affect the status of  the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). Therefore, as long  as North Korea does not quit the NPT, the nuclear safeguards  accord and inspection obligations with the IAEA remain  effective," he emphasized.</p>

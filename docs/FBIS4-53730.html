			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 20 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's trade  imbalance continued in April, recording a monthly deficit of 379  million U.S. dollars on a customs clearance basis, the Ministry  of Trade, Industry and Energy announced Friday.    The ministry said in a report that the nation's exports in  April totaled 7,692 million U.S. dollars, a 14-percent increase  over the same period last year, while imports reached 8,071  million dollars, up 17.8 percent compared with April 1993. The  deficit represents an increase of 277 million dollars over the  same month of 1993.    Accordingly, trade in the first four months ran a deficit of  3,010 million U.S. dollars on a customs clearance basis with  27,597 million dollars in exports and 30,606 million dollars in  imports. The trade deficit during the first four months is 1,122  million dollars higher than in 1993.    April's sharp increase in imports resulted from growing  demand for imports amid business recovery and from more raw  materials being shipped in. In particular, imports of crude oil  and oil-related products, which had witnessed declining demand,  are on the rise while such capital goods as machinery, chemicals  and textiles are showing an increase of around 20 percent.    Meanwhile, exports showed a sound recovery with a  double-digit increase in products from the heavy-chemical and  primary industries together with an 8.7-percent rise in  light-industry goods.    The strong Japanese yen prompted Korea's export to increase  in electronics and electrical goods (21.2 percent) and chemical  products and precision machines (12 to 13 percent).    Korean exports to developing countries surged 17 percent  compared with 11.2 percent to advanced countries. In contrast,  exports to China decreased 2.3 percent due to a decline in  Chinese demand for Korean automobiles.</p>

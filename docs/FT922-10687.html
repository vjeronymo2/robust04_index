			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Sri Lanka violence leaves 105 dead THE TAMIL Tiger separatist group in Sri Lanka has killed more than 55 Moslem and Sinhalese in a pre-dawn attack on an agricultural settlement in the country's eastern province which it claims as part of its traditional homeland. In retaliation, armed Moslems have killed 50 Tamils in a nearby vilage. The Moslems speak Tamil but support the majority Sinhalese. The Tigers accuse the Sinhalese-dominated government of trying to convert the demographic character of the province through irrigation projects which provide water for new settlements. Sinhalese and Moslem families are given land while Tamils are not, the Tigers claim. Tamil assaults have targeted isolated Sinhalese and Moslem settler farms. Police said the Tigers used knives and axes in the latest attack. A non-governmental commission in Nepal will investigate a series of police shootings that left at least eight people dead in Kathmandu recently, Agencies add. Official reports say eight people died in the April 6 shootings, while an unofficial count put the death toll at 17. Witnesses say police opened fire after violence broke out during a one-day strike. Burma's army fired mortar barrages at Karen guerrilla bases on the Thai frontier on Tuesday after Rangoon announced it was suspending its offensive, a Karen spokesman said yesterday. The Karens have fought for several decades for greater autonomy from central government. The Burmese military junta meanwhile released 11 more political prisoners yesterday, bringing the total of detainees freed to 38 since General Than Shwe became prime minister last week, state radio said.</p>

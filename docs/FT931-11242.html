			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Trencor gains W&amp;A for R350m TRENCOR, the Cape-based transport and trading company, is to gain control of W&amp;A, a diversified South African consumer and industrial group, through a capital injection of R350m (Dollars 113.6m). The deal brings together two of South Africa's largest companies not controlled by the country's big mining houses or financial institutions. The two groups yesterday announced that companies in the W&amp;A group  - comprising FS group, FSI corporation, Waicor and W&amp;A  - would launch rights offers to raise at least R500m. Trencor would invest R350m by underwriting the offers and taking up rights. Trencor and a management consortium led by its controlling shareholder, Mr Jeff Liebesman, will exercise joint control of W&amp;A at board and executive levels and will appoint an executive chairman. Trencor, a very low profile company, has produced good results over a number of years, while W&amp;A has struggled to shake off problems of excessive levels of debt. Trencor, with a market capitalisation of about R2.7bn, is one of the most highly-rated stocks on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange with a price/earnings ratio of 21. W&amp;A, with a market capitalisation of about R210m and a p/e ratio of 3.3, has long had a poor rating. Mr Liebesman said yesterday that the proceeds of the rights issue would be used to redeem debt and would reduce significantly the group's gearing. The compatibility of the two groups' interests would create promising business opportunities, particularly in export-related and international fields. Mr Liebesman said the disposal of non-core assets would continue.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Redundancy spectre stalks branches - The Battle for Midland MICHAEL thought he had a job for life until he heard the news. A counter clerk at a London branch of Midland, he said: 'It's shattering news. We have always sacrificed salaries for security and perks like low mortgages. If I lose my job I will lose my house.

This year the bank made a profit and we were all optimistic and looking forward to a decent pay settlement. Now suddenly the black clouds of uncertainty are back again.' Jenny, a cashier in Bath, said: 'I have not been able to concentrate all day. I don't suppose there is anything we can do to stop it. Everyone who wanted to take early retirement or redundancy has done so. Anyone still here really wants to be.'</p>

These  photodetectors are suitable for operation in a structure of  three-dimensional integrated microcircuits with optical  linkages. Of the familiar types of GaAs photodetectors, the  metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors are the most  attractive from the point of view of being able to obtain  ultimately high speed and sensitivity, and because of their  technological compatibility with the fundamental element of GaAs  integrated circuits - the field effect transistor. The structure  of the examined MSM-photodetector is described and its spectral  characteristic is shown in a graph. As shown in the curves, the  maximum spectral sensitivity is located at the absorption edge  of the gallium arsenide (_l_[.sup]1[/]=0.87, where a sharp  peak is observed. The second maximum appears at  _l_[.sup]2[/]=1.2-1.3 m. Presence of two spectral  photo-sensitivity regions with different characteristic times,  offers an additional capacity for controlling the information  flow using two wave-lengths. Results of studying the indium  phosphide photodiodes are discussed and graphs showing their  cross section and topology, as well as their volt-ampere  characteristic are provided. The spectral characteristic of an  InP photodiode is also shown in a graph. Figures 7, references  9: 4 Russian, 5 Western</p>

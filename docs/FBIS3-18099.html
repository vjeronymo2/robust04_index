			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by </F> Norbert Mayer; place and date not given: "Germany Urges Quick  Conclusion"]    [Text] [Mayer] Mr. Kinkel, it will become clear during  the weekend whether the countries willing to join the European  Union will be able to conclude negotiations according to  schedule. Will you support Austria's concerns?    [Kinkel] The German Government strongly supports the desire  of Austria and the other states of the European Free Trade  Association to join the European Union. The German delegation  was advised to examine Austria's concerns with the necessary  flexibility and understanding.    [Mayer] Which of the three problems -- transit, agriculture,  acquisition of land -- do you consider the most sensitive issue?    [Kinkel] All the spheres you mentioned are difficult but not  insoluble. It is important to find solutions that are  acceptable to all sides and that are within the framework of  what has been achieved in the European Union so far. On the  secondary homes issue that you mentioned, only a solution that  grants the same rights to citizens from Munich or Vienna is  acceptable to us -- to use a graphic example.    [Mayer] If talks are not concluded by the beginning of March  1994, membership will be postponed. Germany will hold the  chairmanship of the European Union for six months as of 1 July.  Are quick negotiations after this date conceivable? What will  Bonn's contribution to successful negotiations be?    [Kinkel] The German government will emphatically support a  successful conclusion of the negotiations according to schedule  on 1 March 1994. I will do everything possible to ensure that.  I hope that accession talks will no longer be on the agenda  during the German presidency in the second half of 1994. At  that time the ratification process should be well under way in  the member states and in the countries that want to join the  European Union. Otherwise membership cannot take effect on 1  January 1995.    [Mayer] To what extent do the candidates influence the  topical problems of the European Union?    [Kinkel] The applicants will be important and welcome  members of the European Union. All four states have long  democratic traditions and highly-developed national economies.  These states naturally have similar problems to the other  members of the European Union. However, they have realized that  there are no panaceas and no special cures. I see no  insuperable difficulties in the institutional sphere if the new  members demonstrate the political will to support the  Community's policy and observe the rules stipulated in the  agreements. During the accession talks, we agreed to adapt the  institutions to a larger number of members. At the government  conference scheduled for 1996 we will have to take stock and  examine proposals for changes on this basis.</p>

			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLANNED FARM SUBSIDY CUTS DECRIED;  </P> <P> AGRICULTURE: THE GRAIN BELT WOULD TAKE THE BIGGEST HIT. BUT CALIFORNIA WON'T  ESCAPE THE TRIMS SOUGHT BY U.S. BUDGET NEGOTIATORS.  </P> <P> American farmers face $13 billion in budget cuts to federal agriculture  programs, cuts that many farm groups argued Monday could unfairly burden wheat  and grain growers nationwide and mete out the harshest punishment to the  Midwestern Grain Belt.  </P> <P> "Certainly the states where grain and cotton are major commodities will be  hit," said Robert A. Denman, spokesman for the National Farmers Union. "The  biggest hit will come out of the wheat producers in the Plains States. Their  production costs are higher and their options are fewer."  </P> <P> California farmers have traditionally fared best at budget-cutting time because  the state grows an estimated 250 different crops on a commercial scale and  hence its farm economy does not rely heavily on federal subsidies. But even  California won't escape the cuts proposed by budget negotiators on Sunday.  </P> <P> "It's popular to say that California farmers aren't impacted by the federal  farm programs because we have a diverse agriculture here," said George Tibbits,  director of national affairs for the California Farm Bureau Federation. "I  always end up refuting that. The farm programs do have a significant impact on  farmers in California."  </P> <P> Congressional and Administration budget negotiators have not pinpointed the  agricultural programs that will be cut; the only strict orders were that $13  billion be trimmed over five years and that $1.3 billion worth of cuts must  come out of fiscal 1991 subsidies.  </P> <P> But the Office of Management and Budget has made what one House Agriculture  Committee source on Monday called "suggestions" for Congress to follow as it  figures out where the $13 billion will come from.  </P> <P> One OMB suggestion was that "target prices" -- the price for which crops should  ideally sell -- be cut by 2% a year. The target price generally is higher than  the market price for which a crop actually sells. Since the government pays the  difference to farmers in the form of subsidies, lower target prices mean lower  government outlays.  </P> <P> OMB also suggested cutting "base acreage" -- the number of planted acres  covered by government subsidies -- by 3% per year. The OMB figures that this  two-part plan could save $500 million in 1991 and $12.4 billion over the life  of the five-year budget plan.  </P> <P> States such as Kansas, whose farmers grow mostly wheat and are heavily enrolled  in government subsidy programs, would be hardest hit. With $6.6 billion in farm  revenue in 1988, the last year for which such statistics are available, Kansas  was the No. 5 farm state in the nation. But a whopping $848 million -- or 13%  of its revenue -- came from federal farm subsidies, making it No. 6 in the  country in handouts.  </P> <P> California, by contrast, is the nation's No. 1 farm state, with $16.6 billion  in farm receipts in 1988, but it drops all the way to No. 15 when federal  subsidies are counted. Only about 2% -- or $335 million -- of California's farm  income came from federal programs, said Frank Limacher, an economist with the  state Department of Food and Agriculture.  </P> <P> Still, California is the No. 2 cotton state behind Texas, and an estimated 6%  of the state's irrigated agricultural land is planted in wheat. Both cotton and  wheat are federally subsidized, and growers here will feel the pain of budget  cuts.  </P> <P> "We think the deficit is being cut on the back of wheat, cotton, feed grain and  rice programs, and the other elements of the farm program are really not taking  that much of a hit," said Daniel M. Weldon, executive vice president of the  California Assn. of Wheat Growers.  </P> <P> In addition to what he termed the "unfair" distribution of the cuts, Weldon is  concerned about the timing of the budget discussions and the uncertainty that  timing causes.  </P> <P> "Planting of wheat starts in late October and goes through through November,"  Weldon said. "Right now, farmers really don't know what the farm program is.  Farmers are making plans with bankers, getting loans arranged, making  projections about what they want to plant.  </P> <P>  "The banker looks at farm-program income," he said. "As that is reduced, it's  going to put lending to farmers in greater jeopardy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> REVENUES VS. SUBSIDIES  </P> <P> Although California is the nation's No. 1 state in farm revenues, it gets a  disproportionally small amount of federal farm subsidy payments because of its  diverse crop production. The following figures are from crop year 1988, the  most recent year for which statistics were available.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.22IN:2.00IN:2.22IN:2.11IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Revenues  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Revenues  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Subsidies  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Subsidies  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> State  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> ranking  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (billions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> ranking  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (billions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> California  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> No. 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $16.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> No. 15  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $0.335  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Texas  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> No. 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> No. 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.15  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Iowa  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> No. 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> No. 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.665  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nebraska  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> No. 4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> No. 4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.091  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Kansas  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> No. 5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> No. 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.848  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Illinois  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> No. 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> No. 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.374  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Minnesota  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> No. 7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> No. 5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.036  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: California Department of Food and Agriculture  </P></p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / The Property Market: The reluctant landlord - Hanson's acquisitions in the 1980s have helped it build one of the UK's biggest property banks With some Pounds 4bn of assets, Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, is Britain's second biggest property company, according to a survey last year by DTZ Debenham Thorpe. But it is a reluctant corporate landowner. 'We never went out and bought a property company. We have acquired property by default,' says Mr Malcolm Ablett, managing director of Hanson Properties. Apart from a brief flirtation last summer with the notion of buying Canary Wharf, the troubled Olympia and York development in London, Hanson has rarely set out to add to its property portfolio in the UK or the US, where it also has substantial assets. Instead, it has built up its property assets through an aggressive policy of acquisitions of non-property companies. These began in 1983 with the purchase of London Brick, which owned large clay and gravel reserves and agricultural estates of some 100,000 acres in south-east England. In the same year, Hanson bought UDS, a retail group with a portfolio of 2,000 stores. These included Whiteleys department store in west London, which at the time was trading at a loss. Hanson closed Whiteleys, won planning permission for a redevelopment and sold the site to Arlington for Pounds 18m. In 1985, Hanson took over the Imperial Group, which brought with it, among other things, the Courage brewing estate. The estate included the site of Shakespeare's Globe theatre in Southwark, along with a adjacent terrace of listed Georgian houses. The future of this historically important site has provoked intense controversy (even though the most controversial proposal of all - a plan by American tycoon Donald Trump to build an 80-storey office tower on the site - was never pursued). The development of the Globe site has been stymied by a debate among conservationists over whether to destroy the Georgian houses so as to excavate the remains of the Globe. At present, the anti-excavation camp, is winning the argument; Hanson may find new uses for the Georgian houses, either as flats or a hotel. Meanwhile the back of the site is due to be turned into a car park. In 1989 Hanson bought Consolidated Gold Fields, which through its subsidiary ARC, an aggregates company, owned a property development arm and gravel pits. The most recent addition to Hanson's holdings came with the 1991 acquisition of Beazer, the building products group. The Beazer purchase brought with it a large estate management business and investment portfolio. Hanson is not sentimental about its large property bank. 'Our sole objective is to turn assets into cash,' says Mr Ablett. Some portfolios have been sold in their entirety; the UDS stores were sold long ago; as was the village of Stewartby near Bedford, which was built by London Brick. Others are proving more difficult to sell. As a result of the Beazer and ARC takeovers, for instance, Hanson inherited three empty office blocks in Bracknell, one of the most over-developed towns in the south-east. Before its takeover by Hanson, ARC had also undertaken a lot of business park development, which came to fruition just when recession took hold in 1989. 'The timing was terrible,' says Mr Ablett. Hanson has also held onto most of the investment portfolio, including shopping centres, it inherited from ARC and Beazer. Hanson is likely to start selling its shopping centres following the recent pick-up in interest in this sector of the market. Hanson owns shopping centres in Bath, Stroud and Newcastle and has stakes in centres in Middlesborough, Leeds and Hull. The most significant of Hanson's remaining assets is its land bank: 100,000 acres of land in the south-east, which belonged to ARC and London Brick. Selling the land will take a long time. First, Hanson does not want to flood the market. Second, it wants to add value to its land bank by winning planning permission before putting it on the market. The case for addressing planning questions has become more urgent as a result of recent changes to the planning regime, which lay down the framework for planning decisions for the next 10 years. 'We do not want to miss the boat,' says Mr Ablett. The most recent planning exercise undertaken by Hanson was a nine-month review of ARC's land holdings. Each parcel of land had to be examined and reviewed for its development potential. 'We recovered the cost of the review in its eighth or ninth week,' says Mr Ablett. But Hanson's most elaborate exercise in adding value to its land is at Peterborough, where it owns a large area of land left derelict following the extraction of brick clay. After eight years of preparatory work, it has won planning permission for the Pounds 500m Peterborough Southern Township - the largest private-sector new town since the first stages of Welwyn Garden City. On the 2,000-acre site, Hanson has planning consent for 3m square feet of commercial and industrial space, a retail park, two supermarkets and housing for 13,000 people. Hanson says it has already had some interest from developers, mostly for warehouses. None the less, it expects the development of the township to take more than a decade. 'We have to be realistic,' says Mr Ablett. 'We realise this is a longer term project. It won't produce vast sums in the short term.' Although Hanson Properties usually shuns development, it does not rule out joint venture developments. 'It may be that to kick-start the project, we have to be flexible. We are prepared to talk to anyone.' If and when a partner is selected for the Peterborough venture, it is unlikely to be the Beazer housebuilding arm. The Hanson divisions are kept at arms' length; no division is asked to subsidise another. 'We don't believe in robbing Peter to pay Paul,' says Mr Ablett. Hanson Properties is also heavily involved in trying to extract value from the land used within its businesses. The efficient management of property is central to the philosophy of a company which prides itself on gaining maximum value from its assets. Reviews of operational assets are made at a local level, although there are instances where Hanson Properties would become involved 'to help their management thinking'. That said, Mr Ablett is anxious to dispel any notion that the property arm is a significant overhead for Hanson. The property management is contracted out to agents, while the head office employs just 30 property staff, including accountants and secretaries. The overriding impression given by Hanson is that property is as much a painful necessity as a potential source of value. 'We are not long-term holders of property,' says Mr Ablett. 'Our role is to convert what we have into cash, not to add to it.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Changes in property values (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Retail                Office                   Year to    Mnth of    Year to    Mnth of                    Mar 93     Mar 93     Mar 93     Mar 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rental growth        -3.6       -0.3      -16.8       -1.2 Capital growth       -3.4       -0.1      -13.1       -0.4 Total return          4.3        0.5       -4.4        0.5 Current yields        9.0                  10.4  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Industrial                 All                   Year to    Mnth of    Year to    Mnth of                    Mar 93     Mar 93     Mar 93     Mar 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rental growth       -10.0       -0.7       -9.8       -0.7 Capital growth       -8.7       -0.4       -8.0       -0.3 Total return          0.8        0.5        0.5        0.5 Current yields       11.5                  10.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IPD Monthly Index, Investment Property Databank  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

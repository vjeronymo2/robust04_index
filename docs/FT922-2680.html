			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Intercare makes Pounds 1.4m halfway Trebled first-half profits were achieved by Intercare Group, which operates in the optical, dental and medical fields. Positive contributions came from four acquisitions. In the six months ended April 30 1992 turnover expanded from Pounds 5.8m to Pounds 10.8m, and pre-tax profit surged from Pounds 452,000 to Pounds 1.4m. Earnings per share were 4.2p (3p) and the interim dividend is stepped up to 0.6p (0.5p). The results included SAFA for one month, Birmingham Optical for two weeks, and Booster Electric Vehicles and Montis for the whole period. In addition, the group achieved organic growth. Mr Peter Cowan, chairman, said the optical side had an excellent six months, highlighted by organic growth at Pennine and the two acquisitions. Turnover at Pennine rose by more than 50 per cent. The acquisition of Birmingham took the division into higher value products. In difficult market condition A-Z Dental performed in line with expectations and continued to trade profitably, while developing the increasing private sector with new services and products.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chris Yeung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] China's main united front body has amended its  constitution to play down class struggle among Chinese or  between China and "hostile foreign forces" stating it is no  longer the country's "major contradiction." The proposed  amendment, the first since 1982, has been tabled at the opening  of the second plenum of the Eighth Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held at the Great Hall of the  People yesterday.    The amendment says the struggle between Chinese and "hostile  forces in and out of the country" will be a long-term task.  "Class struggle within a certain area will exist over a long  period of time. But [it is] no longer the major contradiction  of the society," it says.    The CPPCC constitution will state clearly the primary task  of  the country is modernization in accordance with the theory of  Chinesestyle socialism and the "preliminary stage of socialism."  Elaborations will also be made on the system of "political  consultation" and "democratic supervision" over the party and  Government.    The system forms a major component of the Chinese-style  democratic political structure under Communist Party leadership.  For instance, it spells out that the major function of the CPPCC  is to organize political consultation and democratic supervision  and the political participation of other sectors.    Ruling out the possibility of a multi-party system, the  Communist Party has offered the CPPCC as well as the National  People's Congress, nominally the highest power organ in China,  greater say in national affairs. Delivering a work report of  the CPPCC Standing Committee yesterday, Vice-Chairman Ye  Xuanping reminded the 2,000- odd deputies of their vital role in  the "historic period of vigorous development."    He asked members, however, not to "go beyond their terms of  reference" when monitoring the government. Mr Ye maintained  that the united front organ dubbed by cynics a "political vase"  had made new progress in the first year of the current five-year  session. He said the CPPCC's Standing Committee had taken part  in the making of public policies on major issues facing the  country such as corruption and inflation.    Warning that the enforcement of successive reform measures  this year would inevitably lead to fresh social disputes, Mr Ye  said in the report deputies should strive to help maintain  political stability and unity. "[You should] mobilize all  positive factors and transform negative factors into positive  ones, so that the government can successfully implement its  reform packages. "All CPPCC affiliates sub-committees and  general membership should excel themselves in preserving the  overall interest and in maintaining stability without doing  anything prejudicial to unity and stability."    Mr Ye urged deputies actively to listen to and pass on the  grievances of the populace and suggest effective solutions.  "When a problem is not amenable to a quick solution, we should  assist the government to plead for understanding by the public  so as to defuse a crisis," he said.</p>

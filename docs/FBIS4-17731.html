			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Lyudmila </F> Glazovskaya and Mikhail Kalmykov]    [Excerpt] Ashgabat, 28 Apr -- Talks between French  President Francois Mitterrand, who is in Ashgabat on a state  visit, and Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov centered around  the situation in Central Asia and the difficult situation in  Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The first round of talks took place  late on Wednesday [27 April] evening.    Conducting a policy of positive neutrality and open doors,  Turkmenistan is seriously concerned by the security problems  close to its borders. As the Turkmen leader noted during the  talks, the country's decision to adhere to the Partnership for  Peace Program will enable it to pursue more actively ideas of  broad international cooperation in its foreign policy. He  pointed out that the program could become a real means of  guaranteeing not only the security of the peoples of Europe, but  of the regions that it borders.    The Turkmen side took pleasure in noting that by displaying  its practical aspiration toward organizing a dialogue between  East and West, France had of late been paying more attention to  the Central Asian region -- an explosive region of the world.  In the opinion of Turkmen diplomacy, the conflicts in  Tajikistan and Afghanistan pose a serious threat to  international security.    In turn, Francois Mitterrand welcomed the role being played  by independent Turkmenistan in helping to resolve conflicts and  overcome crises in the region peacefully. "We wish for a return  to civil peace in Afghanistan and want that country to find  internal accord once again. The United Nations must be brought  more actively into this process to relieve the suffering of a  people that has come into collision with the misfortune of war,"  the French president said. Recalling the proloned conflict in  Afghanistan, he voiced his hope that Ashgabat would continue in  the search for a peaceful settlement in that country. [passage  omitted]</p>

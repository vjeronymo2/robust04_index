			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "`Big Fish' and the Drug Trade"] </F>   [Text] The director general of the Narcotics Control Board  said in a speech that all efforts to control the drug trade in  Pakistan have been unsuccessful because some elected officials,  high-level government administrators, members of assemblies,  industrialists, and even some members of the Narcotics Control  Board itself are involved in this trade. He named one assembly  member, who was sentenced in London, but is still a member of  the assembly. He also mentioned apprehending drugs valued at 20  million rupees belonging to a very important person in Karachi.    If the Narcotics Board first removes its own corrupt  employees, it could be successful in its mission of catching the  `big fish' with government cooperation. What is necessary is  forming a solid plan and then asking for cooperation from all  those countries that have made remarkable progress in  controlling this evil.</p>

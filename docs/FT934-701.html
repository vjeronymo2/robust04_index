			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Harnessing pester power - Diane Summers considers the tactics of the toy advertisers Pester power', as those in the business of marketing to children so appropriately call it, has just about done its job for another year. This week parents all over the world will be wrapping Barbies, Lego and video games, as well as all the other fads, fashions and enduring favourites that make up the global toy and games market, worth more than Dollars 55bn (Pounds 36.90bn) last year. The most indulgent, according to market analysts Euromonitor, are the Germans. In 1992 their children each had Dollars 429-worth of toys and games lavished on them, while Swedish children got Dollars 400, Americans Dollars 384, and British Dollars 294. More than half of the Dollars 55bn total is spent around Christmas. With advertising budgets to match, toy and games manufacturers are constantly searching for the most effective ways of harnessing pester power and making their products the ones that parents will scour the shops for in the run-up to Christmas. The youth market is the trickiest and most competitive of the children's markets, as is apparent from the video games wars being fought between giants Sega and Nintendo. While some of Sega's more aggressive advertising might make parents flinch, it appears to be getting through to its intended target of teenage boys. Mark Earls, planning director of advertising agency Still Price Lintas, who has studied marketing to youth, observes: 'Sega has got the personality at the moment. The personality of the brand is excitement and being a bit anarchic, a bit dangerous.' Advertisers often wrongly assume that young people now are very much like their own younger selves, says Earls. Salvador Dali pinpointed the problem, says Earls, when he observed that 'the trouble with the youth of today is that we are no longer part of it'. Middle-aged advertising folk 'trying to be hip and cool and groovy just doesn't work', according to Earls. The result can too often be adverts that have the same effect 'as the vicar doing the twist at the youth club party'. Nor, in his view, is the structured advertisement with an obvious 'moral' ending effective with a generation exposed to a wide range of media images and with a sophisticated understanding of how advertising works. The approach now needs to be looser. 'All youth culture now is about play. You throw something into their world and hope they're going to play with it,' he says. At the other end of the children's age range, life appears to be simpler. Peter Waterman, vice-president of corporate affairs at Hasbro, the toy company with the second largest global market share after Nintendo, has no time for the wilder schemes of advertising's 'creatives'. He has a clear recipe for success when it comes to advertising to, for instance, five- to nine-year-olds. 'You do what you would do if you were an adult with the toy in your hand. You show the toy to the child and then show the child how the toy works. The toy itself and its operation is always the hero of the action.' Waterman, who used to work for Procter &amp; Gamble, says the selling of detergents and toys should be based on similar principles. 'You demonstrate the product in action. Every half-second you use dressing that up in some disguise is time wasted when you could be telling the consumer about the product you want them to use,' he says. And the half-seconds around Christmas come very expensive. The most effective medium for toy and games advertising is television and all the main manufacturers will be clamouring for airtime during children's peak viewing. In the UK, for example, media buyers Zenith report that one 30-second slot on GMTV, the breakfast channel, would cost Pounds 15,000 just before Christmas, compared with about Pounds 9,000 at other times of the year. Provisional bookings have to be made a year in advance, with firm commitments from advertisers by Easter. Television itself, with its tight regulation of what is allowed by the broadcasting authorities, also acts to make toy advertising relatively simple, says Waterman. In the UK, the Independent Television Commission has a formidable set of rules advertisers must abide by. For example, direct exhortations to practise pester power are outlawed - the slogan 'Don't forget the Fruit Gums, mum' might well fail to get past regulators these days. Anything that might make a child feel inferior or 'liable to be held in contempt or ridicule' if it does not buy a particular product is also banned. Furthermore, the price must be shown if the toy costs more than Pounds 20. One rule that many parents may wish to quote in the aftermath of Christmas is: 'Where advertisements show results from a drawing, construction, craft or modelling toy or kit, the results shown must be reasonably attainable by the average child and ease of assembly must not be exaggerated.' Some countries have gone further: in Flanders, the 'five-minute rule' means there can be no advertisements during children's programmes, or for five minutes before or after them on terrestrial television channels. In Greece, a complete ban was lifted but its reimposition is being discussed following a change in government. In effect, Sweden and Norway ban all advertising to children on terrestrial television channels. Waterman, who is also an official of the Toy Manufacturers of Europe, a lobbying group, says the ban is a barrier to trade which distorts the market. He hopes it can be challenged in the new year when the European Economic Area treaty comes into effect. The treaty will extend European Union single market and competition rules to those countries, including Sweden and Norway, which are signatories. Waterman is indignant about restrictions which he considers do more to protect trade than children. 'Advertising to children is an entirely harmless activity. Steps to stop children seeing advertising at all are completely unnecessary and, in fact, are undesirable. They prevent children from learning important social and economic lessons,' he says. Lessons which include, presumably, early training in how to spot who holds the purse-strings and how to lobby effectively for your favourite projects.  --------------------------------------------            Top 10 toys in the UK  -------------------------------------------- 1.

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Rhine damps hopes of the Bonn lobby They call it the Big Hole in Bonn: the huge building site on the banks of the Rhine where a whole new complex of parliamentary offices is being built, in spite of the German government's plans to move lock, stock and barrel to Berlin by the turn of the century. Now it seems to be not just a big hole, but more of a bottomless pit. The entire foundations of the DM800m (Pounds 312m) complex have been devastated by the floods which swept the banks of the Rhine over Christmas. According to reports confirmed by the construction ministry, the flood waters actually raised the floor of the building by 70 centimetres, and caused ominous cracks to appear in much of the concrete piling. The Bundestag's budget committee yesterday called a halt to the building programme, and questioned why it was allowed to go ahead at all. Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer, the luckless construction minister responsible for the move to Berlin, has sacked her chief building inspector for failing to keep her informed, but now faces calls for her resignation. All this has come on the eve of vital negotiations between Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the leaders of all the main political parties, and the mayors of Bonn and Berlin, to decide precisely when and how the great move should take place. At their summit meeting tomorrow they also have to settle the most important question of all: how much the move will cost. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, who is desperate to contain a swelling budget deficit, told a party meeting on Tuesday that the costs of moving must be kept to DM20bn - compared with earlier unofficial estimates of up to DM30bn. His critics think him hopelessly optimistic. Ms Ingrid Matthaus-Maier, deputy leader of the Social Democrats in the Bundestag and a fierce opponent of Berlin, called for a 10-year delay in the move, saying the figures had been 'massaged'. Yet any lingering hopes entertained by the vociferous Bonn lobby to delay the switch of capital have been sorely undermined by the force of the flood waters on the Rhine. A spanking new office complex, with a swimming pool, sports hall, and an underground garage for 1,200 cars, would have been a great temptation for the members of the Bundestag to stay put beside the Rhine. If the project has to be abandoned, they may be all too happy to move to the Spree as soon as possible.</p>

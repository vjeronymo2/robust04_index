			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Bosnian factions end talks International mediators yesterday ended two days of talks with Bosnia's warring factions with no apparent agreement on the future division of the former Yugoslav republic. However, sources close to the talks in France said leaders of a new Moslem-Croatian federation and rebel Bosnian Serbs had agreed to meet again with a 'contact group' from the US Russia and the European Union in a week to 10 days' time. They said the talks, at which the factions did not meet face-to-face, focused on the carve-up of territory between the federation and the heavily-armed Serbs, who currently control 70 per cent. Earlier the Croatian news agency reported that the Croats and Moslems had 'partly accepted' a mediators' proposal giving them 51 per cent.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Arts: Jommelli's 'Dido' - Lugo Lugo is a flourishing market town in the fertile, misty plain between Bologna and Ravenna. Until recently, its chief visitors were livestock traders; but then, enterprising local authorities, with considerable financial effort and with impeccable taste, restored the 400-seat Teatro Rossini, which dates from the mid-18th century and boasts an interior by the great Antonio Galli Bibiena. Since the restoration was completed, five years ago, the Rossini has annually produced one or two operas, chosen intelligently with the theatrical space in mind and generally avoiding the standard repertory. This year's programme comprised a single, but important and fascinating work, Niccol Jommelli's setting of Metastasio's magnificent drama Didone Abbandonata. I should be more precise and say one of Jommelli's settings, for he used the text three times; and Lugo - advised by the scholar Giovanni Carli Ballola, who prepared the performing version - staged the third and last Didone, given in Stuttgart in 1763, when Jommelli was court composer to the Duke of Wuerttemberg. There, he had a good orchestra at his command, the court choreographer was Noverre, and the Duke Karl was generously eager to engage the best singers and designers. The Teatro Rossini, especially in these lean times of Italian recession, has to think in less sumptuous terms. Nevertheless, it was able to give the audience a good idea of what the opera is like and what it must have meant to a cultivated audience of two centuries or more ago. To begin with, Lugo engaged the Bolognese architect Pier Luigi Cervellati to design the set, inspired by Bibiena: an elegant grey-beige arrangement of columns and arches with what looked like a drypoint vision of a towered and cupola-ed Carthage in the distance. Elements were moveable, including a ghostly white ship which appeared as needed. Cervellati, with Antonio Taglioni, was also the sensible producer. Mariangela Capuano created handsome baroque costumes; Mauro Mazzali made an impressive statue of Neptune. Even with some minor cuts, this Didone made a long evening; and it must be said that the young singers, brave as they were, could not always fulfil the demands of the score. Fortunately, the all-important role of Enea was in the hands of an ardent, assured mezzosoprano, Adriana Cicogna. As in most of Metastasio's dramas, the conflict is more intellectual than physical. In Didone there is some fighting, but indecision is the real enemy. Cicogna made the hero's dilemmas real and cogent. Understanding the text, a work of noble, seductive beauty, is of supreme importance. Before and after Jommelli it was set by about 60 composers, from Sarro, in 1724, to Saverio Mercadante 99 years later. Jommelli must have loved the words, because, while he produced stirring or affecting arias, his recitatives are supreme as he subtly underlines the speeches with nuanced orchestra, strange textures, wisps of melody or simply what might be called a vague sonorous ambiance. At times the listener thinks of Monteverdi, but then there is a stunningly modern effect. With unclear words, the audience could still appreciate the superb deployment of the instruments (a sudden trumpet-soprano duet in the last act was hair-raising), but the listeners could not enjoy the full excitement. This was particularly regrettable in Dido's final monologue. Maria Angeles Peters has a voice of some sweetness and agility, but not of great power, and by the end of the opera, though she produced the sounds acceptably, she was evidently tired and she failed to move. As her sister Selene, the soprano Alessandra Rossi looked suitably unhappy (Selene is secretly in love with Enea), too, but the voice was often expressionless. The sole male in the cast, the tenor Ezio Di Cesare (Iarba, the African king, Dido's enemy and suitor) sang forcefully; experts might have said this was not proper baroque style, but it was convinced singing, and it was appreciated. With the exception of the Dido, all the interpreters seemed to gain assurance as the opera progressed. Except for an occasional, perhaps inevitable indulgence granted some sluggish singers, the conductor Amedeo Monetti persuasively drew lively or sensitively-coloured played from the reduced Orchestra Sinfonica dell'Emilia Romagna. Many Italian towns the size of Lugo have charming opera houses. Of these, the luckiest survive as cinemas, while others have been turned into supermarkets, garages or ruins. Lugo has achieved then a double distinction: it has saved a beautiful theatre and it has filled it with great music (and capacity audiences).</p>

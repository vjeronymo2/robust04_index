			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Regarding ways to tackle the  security situation in the country, Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi  said that the government was committed to adopt a firm method,  as the head of state, Liamine Zeroual, recently declared in this  respect. He added that an absolute priority had been given to  the improvement of the security situation and the protection of  people and property. The prime minister further said that the  relentless efforts of the security forces, the improvement of  living conditions for the citizens, the fight against  unemployment, the protection of the workers' purchasing power,  and the strengthening of the local authorities together  constitute activities aimed at guaranteeing a better security  situation.    On ways to bring the security situation under control, the  prime minister believes that for the Algerians who are concerned  about the country's future, who respect the constitution and the  laws of the Republic, and who work for the nation's highest  interest, dialogue seems natural and necessary, and allowing the  expression of various viewpoints is a democratic act and is  evidence of civilization, as the prime minister put it.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 19 Apr (TANJUG) -- The cabinet of Nikola  Koljevic, vice president of the republic of Sprska, today  informed the aid organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)  that the republic of Srpska authorities have authorized this  organization, too, to carry on with its humanitarian convoy  operations. It was announced yesterday that, under an agreement  between the Serbian authorities and Yasushi Akashi, the UN  secretary general's special envoy, the UNHCR, the International  Committee of the Red Cross, and Handicap International can  resume their humanitarian convoy operations. In the TANJUG  report, Medecin Sans Frontieres was left out by mistake.</p>

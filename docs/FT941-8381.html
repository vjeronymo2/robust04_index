			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Fashion: Spotlight on paper lanterns - Alice Rawsthorn on the revival of a fashion with its roots in Japan One of the least likely beneficiaries of the design world's obsession with the early 1970s is the paper lantern, the mainstay of so many student bedsits, which is now back in fashion with a bang. The soft glow and hand-made air that made the paper lantern seem so out of place in the stark interiors of the 1980s make it perfect for the artisan look of the 1990s. It may be infused with the hippy ethos of the early 1970s, but it traces its roots to the post-war US design scene and to Isamu Noguchi, the Japanese-American sculptor and furniture designer who devised the first modern paper light at his Long Island studio in the early 1950s. Noguchi was born in Los Angeles in 1904, the son of a Japanese poet who had emigrated to the United States, and a Californian woman who answered his advertisement for a translator. Noguchi spent his childhood in Japan and his teens in the US. He studied sculpture under Constantin Brancusi in Paris before settling in New York where he designed furniture for Herman Miller and sets for the Martha Graham dance company. In the early 1950s Noguchi was asked by the Japanese town of Gifu to help revive its industrial base. Gifu had historically been a centre for the manufacture of candle-lit paper lanterns. Noguchi developed a modern version of these traditional Mandarin lamps for use as electric lights. He designed dozens of different lanterns for Gifu in the 1950s and 1960s. Some are simple adaptations of the Mandarin originals. Others are more idiosyncratic abstract shapes like his own sculpture. They are still made by hand in Gifu today using mino-gami paper which comes from the bark of the mulberry tree. Noguchi lanterns are exquisite objects. He designed the frames and shades so cleverly that they fold away into perfectly flat parcels. The mino-gami paper is so fine that there is a very special, soft quality to the light itself. The Conran Shop, which has a limited range of Noguchi lights, sells a small beehive lamp for Pounds 89 and a larger beehive floor lamp for Pounds 257. The full selection is available by mail order from the Isamu Noguchi Foundation at his old studio on Long Island and ranges from Dollars 62 for a simple paper pendant to Dollars 636 for an elaborate floor lamp. The Conran Shop also has a less expensive range of rectangular paper pendant lights from Pounds 9.50 to Pounds 14.50. An excellent selection of Noguchi-inspired lanterns has been produced by Habitat. Its designs are not as meticulously finished as the originals, nor is the quality of the light so fine, but they are much cheaper. Habitat sells small beehives for Pounds 15, a larger version for Pounds 20 and classic coolie pendants for Pounds 6.50. A number of contemporary designers have brought out new versions of the Noguchi lanterns. Matthias Dietz, a German design historian and curator, has commissioned a collection of paper lights from 30 Japanese architects and designers including Toyo Ito and Shigero Uchida. 'There's been so much interest in Noguchi recently that I thought it would be interesting to see how modern Japanese designers interpreted his ideas,' he says. Tom Dixon, one of the most enterprising young London furniture designers and another Noguchi buff, has also brought out a range of hand-made paper lights. 'I was getting tired of working on heavy furniture pieces and wanted to try something lighter,' he says. 'I've always loved Noguchi's work and decided to see what I could come up with by making a model aircraft structure.' He began by making star-shaped lights and moved on to geometric columns. The small stars start at Pounds 100. The columns cost around Pounds 450 depending on how much work is involved. Dixon is now working on a series of intricate paper lights to sell in the shop he plans to open this spring in London's Notting Hill. He also makes one-off paper lights to order. Rei Kawakubo, the Japanese fashion designer, ordered a set in black for the Comme des Garcons shop in New York. 'I didn't think they would work,' says Dixon. 'The black made them look more like sculpture than lights. But they did give off a strange eerie glow.'

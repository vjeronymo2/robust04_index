			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Bhutto leads parliament boycott Pakistan's former prime minister Benazir Bhutto led an opposition boycott of the parliament's lower house yesterday after clashing with the government over an alleged attempt to kill her last month, Reuter reports from Islamabad. Ms Bhutto and other deputies of her People's Democratic Alliance (PDA) marched out of the house after Gohar Ayub Khan, the National Assembly speaker, gave short shrift to their accusations. On Saturday, a court acquitted Ms Bhutto's husband Asif Ali Zardari of masterminding the murder of 29 people. Prison officials said Mr Zardari, arrested in October 1990, was still being held to face other charges, although this acquittal was his fifth so far.</p>

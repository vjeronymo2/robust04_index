			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Two views of Russia-Tatarstan treaty: "Moscow-Kazan: The </F> Peoples Are Moving, Moving Ahead"]    [Text]  <H6>  Vyacheslav Nikonov, Russian Federation State Duma Deputy </H6>   Inasmuch as Tatarstan had in recent years fallen  increasingly  far out of the legal space of Russia, the fact that a formula  has been found with the aid of which it has essentially returned  to this fold can only be welcomed. This was possible largely  thanks to the new Russian Constitution, which, unfortunately,  does not create a full-fledged federation but affords an  opportunity for more flexible relations between the center and  the components of the Russian Federation.    To what extent such a form as a treaty is at all acceptable  in a normal federation is another matter. It is hard to imagine  a treaty between, say, the U.S. Government and the state of  Massachusetts. But we are in transition as yet from a unitary  state to a federative state, from the old concept of  national-state arrangement to the idea of a symmetrical  federation. And from this viewpoint the conclusion of the treaty  is an entirely permissible act.    The treaty does not, in my view, alter the status of the  Republic of Tatarstan and does not add sovereignty to it, it  contains altogether no mention of sovereignty, although it says  that Tatarstan is entitled to pursue international relations  independently. This may be interpreted both as the fact that it  is a subject of international law and as the fact that it is not  such. The treaty has not, in principle, cleared up this problem  but, once again, if we take some other federations--the United  States again--we see that in each state there is a state  secretary, essentially a minister of foreign affairs, and that  the state pursues an original foreign policy, which is confined,  it is true, to a very narrow range of issues. That is, there is  nothing so terrible in this either.    The treaty draws quite strict terms of reference between  Tatarstan and the Federation and determines quite a wide range  of joint powers. The list of issues that remain within the  jurisdiction of the Russian Federation is quite voluminous, and  Tatarstan, naturally, has an interest in these matters being  decided at Federation level. Consequently, it now has a direct  interest in participating in the work of the federal authorities.    The treaty delicately and competently skirts the problem of  contradictions between the constitutions of the Russian  Federation and Tatarstan. In my view, the best way of  delineating authority between the center and the components is  when the prerogatives of the center are simply determined, and  everything else remains "local." It is good, therefore, that the  parties to the treaty did not become obsessed with whose  constitution--that of Russia or Tatarstan--is "higher" but  established that there is a sphere of activity within the  competence of the federal government, there is a sphere of joint  competence, and so forth.    We do not currently have equality of the components of the  Federation. And there is, of course, a certain danger that the  treaty with Tatarstan will serve as an incentive to a further  "parade of treaties" for the center and the republics. It may be  anticipated that at some stage the krays and oblasts also will  want to formalize treaty relations with the central power. But I  would not be inclined to dramatize the situation. The fears in  connection with the collapse of Russia are altogether  exaggerated, and a gravitation toward reintegration has  manifestly been revealed today. It seems to me, for example,  that Tatarstan displayed in the conclusion of the treaty greater  flexibility than the central power. It dropped certain of its  demands in the sphere of political sovereignization and division  of the economic space, Kazan has agreed to pay taxes to the  federal treasury, the creation of joint regional development  funds is contemplated, and so forth.  <H6>  Nikolay Sorokin, ITAR-TASS correspondent for OBSHCHAYA GAZETA </H6>   The news of the signing of the treaty with Russia has been  greeted in restrained fashion in Tatarstan. To rejoice or wait  and see? I have been calling acquaintances and asking them to  comment on a document, the like of which Tatarstan has never  signed throughout its history. But all have been politely  refusing, referring to the fact that they are not familiar with  the text as yet.    The treaty was born in difficult labor and in argument and  doubt. Progress toward it was made perseveringly, step by step,  at the price of mutual compromise over a period of almost three  years. There were in Tatarstan not only supporters but also  opponents of a normalization of relations with Moscow, about  which President Mintimer Shaymiyev said heatedly on the eve of  the signing of the treaty: "There are politicians, who are  guided by the principle: 'the worse, the better', who are  opposed to all negotiations with Russia, which they call a  neighboring state." At one demonstration, incidentally, the  crowd sentenced Shaymiyev for participation in the negotiations  to... death, notifying him of this by telegram.    Defeating the Kazan "ultras" by argument is impossible, but  their "trump" arguments are not now seen as being that  substantial. The treaty affords Tatarstan complete freedom in  foreign economic relations. Without waiting for the signing of  this document, incidentally, the republic had already formed a  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and a Department for  Foreign Affairs. Business contacts have been established with  companies, banks, and cultural and social organizations of the  United States, Turkey, Hungary, and South Korea, and treaties  have been concluded with almost all "natives" of the former  Union. Thus cellular communications, which will enable Tatarstan  in three years to move in terms of level of individual telephone  subscribers from 66th place in Russia into the top 10, are being  introduced in the republic in conjunction with the American  Hughes Network Systems.    The particular value of the treaty between Russia and  Tatarstan is that an instrument of its  realization--intergovernmental agreements--is proposed  simultaneously. Eleven such agreements have been adopted thus  far--on the budget, property, customs, the environment, the  defense sectors, transport, communications, and others. The  Tatar National Bank, for example, although remaining a  structural subdivision of the Central Bank of Russia, has  acquired great operating scope: It may now, at its own  discretion, restructure the network of its branches and allocate  credit independently, without Central Bank involvement, for  priority programs for the republic.    The treaty that has been adopted is, in Mintimer Shaymiyev's  opinion, only the first step. Having declared in the Kremlin:  "We shall not stop here," he made his Moscow colleagues quite  wary, but hereupon reassured them: Tatarstan, having initiated  the treaty relationship, will shortly propose the next  program--for decentralization of the Russian economy.    And the people of Tatarstan will make their evaluation of  the  treaty at the repeat Federal Assembly elections, which are  scheduled for 13 March. The candidates for deputy, among whom is  President Mintimer Shaymiyev, were registered on 16 February,  incidentally.</p>

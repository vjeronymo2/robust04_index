			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MONTGOMERY ISN'T CELEBRATING DAVIS' CONTRACT  </P> <P> Most members of the Kansas City Royals said they were pleased with the team's  signing of reliever Mark Davis, but the Royals' reliever who will lose his  closer's role says he is upset and shocked.  </P> <P> "I think what it does is put me on the best pitching staff in baseball and  wanting to leave it," said Jeff Montgomery, who had 18 saves and a 1.37 ERA  last season.  </P> <P> Montgomery, who replaced Steve Farr as the closer when Farr developed knee  problems at mid-season, said that he would not demand to be traded but that  having his job taken away has left him "totally unhappy."  </P> <P> "I'd like to have the opportunity to pick up where I left off last season and  see what I could do over the course of a year," Montgomery said in a telephone  interview from Cincinnati. "I'm extremely shocked that this would happen to me  after what I did last year."  </P> <P> Farr, who also finished with 18 saves, said he was impressed with the signing  of Davis. "I know we're going to be competitive for sure," he said, adding that  he sees a personal downside to the acquisition.  </P> <P> "Every time they go get another reliever, it doesn't make my job any more  secure," said Farr, adding that his knee is strong after surgery.  </P> <P> Montgomery and Farr were projected as set-up men for Davis, although pitching  Coach Frank Funk said Montgomery might also be used as a closer in certain  situations and could even be used as a starter.  </P></p>

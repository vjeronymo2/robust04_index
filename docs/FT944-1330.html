			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / OECD forecasts brighter times: Paris body voices optimism but issues warning on need for structural reforms The economic outlook for the industrialised world looks brighter now than at any point in recent years, with strong growth and low inflation expected over the next two years, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development declared yesterday. However, this recovery could soon sour if governments do not seize the chance to address longer-term structural problems by introducing some politically sensitive reforms, warned the Paris-based think-tank. In an unusually strong appeal, Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, chief OECD economist, called on governments to introduce more labour market reform, control their social security budgets and not to succumb to the temptation of tax cuts. 'This (economic growth) is a golden opportunity to address longer-term problems,' Mr Shigehara said. He pointed out that the industrialised countries had largely squandered the opportunities for reform that had emerged in the last economic upturn in the 1980s. The appeal came as the OECD, which is funded by 25 industrialised nations to promote economic co-operation, unveiled its latest half-yearly outlook on the world economy. In a very upbeat report, the OECD revised its forecasts upwards for economic growth and predicted that the industrialised world would see growth of 2.8 per cent this year and around 3 per cent in the following two years. Interest rates would need to rise in most countries in the industrialised world over the next few years, as economic growth spread across the region, the OECD said. However, rates are unlikely to rise as high as they have in previous economic upturns, and inflation across most of the OECD area is likely to remain subdued. In spite of the recent rise in US interest rates, it remained unclear whether this monetary tightening would be sufficient to prevent inflationary pressures from souring the recovery there, the OECD said. The US remains at the forefront of the surge in growth, though expansion should slow sharply in the next two years. Canada and the UK are forecast to see the second highest rate of growth of the seven largest OECD countries next year, with GDP expected to expand by 4.2 and 3.4 per cent respectively. Continental Europe is also expected to see accelerating rates of growth next year, although the growth rate in Germany is not expected to rise above 3 per cent until 1996. Meanwhile, Ireland is expected to see the fastest growth of any OECD country, with 5 per cent growth forecast this year and next. Inflation is expected to remain well below the growth rate in most regions. Excluding Turkey, which has an unusually high inflation rate, average annual inflation in the OECD countries is expected to be only 2.3 per cent next year. But in spite of this optimistic outlook, the OECD warns that accelerating growth means that governments must soon raise interest rates in most countries. The most challenging situation currently exists in the US, where strong growth over the last four years is estimated to have eroded all the spare capacity. Although the US government has already raised interest rates, the report notes that it 'remains unclear' whether this has been sufficient to prevent the economy from overheating in the coming years and sliding back into recession. The OECD forecasts that short-term interest rates in the US will rise to 6.7 per cent by the start of 1996, and 6.9 per cent in 1996. Although this implies that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy quite rapidly next year, Mr Shigehara yesterday pointed out that this rise was still likely to leave rates well below their peaks in previous upturns. In the UK, Australia and New Zealand, the OECD argues that steady recent growth has created a 'case for continuing with gradual monetary tightening'. In continental Europe, German interest rates are expected to remain unchanged in the near future, although the OECD forecasts that short-term interest rates will rise to 5.6 per cent in 1996. In Ireland, the Nordic countries and some other European countries interest rates may also need to be raised soon if conditions deteriorate, the report says. The only exception to this upward trend in interest rates is Japan. Although the OECD predicts that domestic demand will grow faster in Japan than most other regions in the next year, the 'appropriate time for moving rates to an upward path appears to be some way off', it says.

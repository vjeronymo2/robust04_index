			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / International Company News: GM rental sale breathes life into buy-out business - The background to Vestar's takeover of the US car hire group worth an estimated Dollars 1bn The sale of General Motors' National Car Rental subsidiary to Vestar Equity Partners, announced on Thursday, shows that the US buy-out movement is not dead after all. The deal is rumoured to be worth about Dollars 1bn including debt - a figure described by an adviser yesterday as not far off. If so, it is only the third US billion-dollar buy-out of the 1990s (the others were the Payless retail chain and the insurance company American Re). This is a far cry from the glory days of the 1980s. It is also a long step for Vestar, a buy-out firm founded in 1988 by Mr Daniel O'Connell, former co-head of management buy-outs at First Boston. To date, Vestar has done 13 deals with a total purchase price of Dollars 1.6bn. The National Car Rental deal takes it into rather a different league. However, Vestar has a useful asset in the form of Mr John Howard, its joint chief executive. Until he joined the firm in 1990, Mr Howard was with Wesray, another buy-out firm founded by Mr William Simon, ex-treasury secretary. One of Wesray's more spectacular coups, in which Mr Howard was closely involved, was the 1986 buy-out of Avis, National Car Rental's larger rival. The sums involved in the Avis deal are worth recalling. Wesray bought Avis in July 1986 for Dollars 265m plus Dollars 1.34bn of assumed debt. It then raised Dollars 570m through disposals. In September 1987, it sold Avis to its employees for Dollars 1.75bn. In just over a year, Wesray had more than tripled its money. Whether the same can be done with National Car Rental is another matter. Its recent history is decidedly chequered. General Motors first took a stake in 1988. In 1992, it took control, and in the same year took a Dollars 744m charge against profits for losses and restructuring at its new subsidiary. For a while, GM thought seriously about winding the business up. However, at the start of 1993, it brought in Jay Alix, a firm of specialist consultants, to sort it out. A year later GM announced that the business had been profitable at the operating level through 1993, and that it was thinking of selling it. At about the same time, Ford was moving to take 100 per cent ownership of its own car rental business, Hertz. The difference in strategy between close rivals is striking. Ford points out that besides providing a large sales outlet for its cars, the rental business allows it to evaluate their performance. 'We've been pretty happy with Hertz,' Ford commented yesterday. 'After all, it is the car business.' The GM line is somewhat different. Rental, it says, is just not profitable enough. It can involve selling cars on unattractive terms, and often means taking them back second hand. 'In the last couple of years,' GM said yesterday, 'we've been pulling back the number of cars we've sold to rental agencies. We're trying to redirect into selling direct to customers, which is better for GM than the subsidised market of rental fleets.' Meanwhile, GM will maintain its existing supply agreement with National Car Rental. Thereafter it is up to Mr Howard to find value where GM failed. In the chiller climate of the 1990s, perhaps Vestar is taking a risk after all.</p>

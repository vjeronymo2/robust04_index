			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Back to basics on the factory floor - Richard Gourlay examines the Japanese concept of continuous improvement and finds that dramatic change can be achieved with employee co-operation It takes a brave man to allow consultants to tear up his factory and re-arrange it overnight. It takes employees who are even more understanding to accept such changes. At the Paddy Hopkirk car accessory factory in Bedfordshire just before Christmas, consultants inspired by the Japanese concept of continuous improvement - or Kaizen - did just that. One morning the factory was an untidy sprawl of production lines surrounded by piles of crates holding semi-finished components. Two days later, when the 180-strong workforce came to work, the machines had been brought together in tightly grouped 'cells'. The piles of components had disappeared, and the newly-cleared floor space was neatly marked with colour-coded lines mapping out the flow of materials. Overnight, there were dramatic differences. In the first full day, productivity on some lines increased by up to 30 per cent, the space needed for some processes had been halved, and work in progress had been cut considerably. The improved lay-out had allowed some jobs to be combined, freeing up operators for deployment elsewhere in the factory. 'I was expecting a change but nothing as dramatic as this,' says Hopkirk, who is chairman. 'It is fantastic.' A natural marketing man, Hopkirk has successfully established the company on the back of the name he made for himself 30 years ago when he won the Monte Carlo rally in a Mini Cooper. Sales of his bicycle racks for cars are growing and making good margins; even the axle stands are holding their own against fierce Chinese competition. But Hopkirk had long known his production processes left a lot to be desired. 'We were a marketing company that went into manufacturing and could never get it right,' he says. Hopkirk discovered the Kaizen approach after an introduction from a US customer. He invited representatives from the Kaizen Institute, a European consultancy, and executives from other Kaizen clients to try implementing improvements in his factory over a five-day period. In essence Kaizen is the antithesis of the old adage: 'If it ain't bust, don't fix it'. The theory is that managers lead a relentless drive to improve the production process, but can only succeed if they win the co-operation of the company's real 'value-adders' - the shop floor workforce. One of many Japanese management practices which have been adopted in the west, Kaizen is most frequently applied in larger companies. But it is equally valid in smaller factories. Paddy Hopkirk has sales of Pounds 6m a year, but with the help of continuous improvement thinks this can reach Pounds 9m. Nor does its most simple application appear to require the services of expensive consultants. Before joining the Kaizen Institute, production engineer Ross Banarjee doubled production of fire extinguishers in six years for Thorn Fire Protection with a workforce of about 200 after implementing what he had studied in books. Another convert is Brian Francis, managing director of Albion Press Metals in the West Midlands, who introduced Kaizen practices with the help of Nissan UK when he had 280 employees. Each year he was having to deliver productivity improvements because his customers would not agree any pricing increases. Like many other suppliers to the motor industry who are in the same position, Albion has had to find the productivity increases by continually improving its manufacturing processes. A central tenet of Kaizen is the elimination of waste. It not only exists in obvious piles of excess inventory. It is also wasteful when an operator makes more movements than is necessary to complete a task because his or her machine is badly positioned. To reduce one of the biggest sources of waste, Kaizen favours one-piece production, involving as many processes as possible being carried out on a single part consecutively rather than one process being done in a big batch. Parts are only delivered to the next stage of the production or assembly process when they are needed. This so-called Kamban inventory delivery system ensures semi-finished goods do not pile up at each stage, tying up cash in work-in-progress. 'Over-production belongs where it was over-produced,' says Peter Willats who founded the Kaizen Institute of Europe with Masaaki Imai, author of a book that popularised the approach.* Another central theme is the drive to reduce the time wasted in processes that do not add value, like carrying parts or moving from one machine to another. Willats says that in an average factory only one second is spent adding value - like drilling holes, assembling or packing - for every 1,000 seconds spent not adding value. He says he has never seen a factory cut this ratio to less than 1:200 but that managers and workers should continuously seek ways to reduce time-wasting effort. One way of eliminating unnecessary walking is to set up production lines in a horseshoe shape rather than a straight line; in this way an operator doing a number of tasks will end up at the starting point for the next cycle. This can also lead to surprising savings in space, which in Paddy Hopkirk's case is timely indeed. Hopkirk was wondering how to accommodate the extra workforce needed to handle this month's seasonal increase in demand on its cycle rack line. Space savings made during the workshop may solve the problem. To a production engineer, much of what Kaizen advocates might seem like common sense. Much of it is. 'The problem is that in the last 25 years we have lost the rigour to maintain those basics,' says Pierre Lecocq, vice-president in charge of radiator manufacture at Valeo, the decentralised French car components group which has adopted the Kaizen approach. 'It is not revolutionary in the sense that the tools we are implementing are very creative, it is just that the Kaizen system forces you to be thorough in maintaining the rigour,' he says. Like many good management ideas, Kaizen has spawned its lexicon of aphorisms. 'Seek to create the obvious factory' is one. A storage shelf, for example, should be clearly labelled showing what tool should be there, where it is if it isn't, whether it is ready for use and when it was last overhauled. Willats says this procedure can cut set-up times on machines that produce large batches of parts: the machine has shorter runs without being uneconomic, reducing work in progress and increasing the factory's flexibility. Another article of faith - observed in Japan if not always elsewhere - is that 'no one will improve themselves out of a job'. This sums up a truth that companies will only get the full co-operation of workers if the improvements they suggest do not end in management laying them off. 'Creativity of the workforce does not come naturally even in Japan,' says Lecocq. 'There is a whole management system there to put pressure on operators to participate. A shop floor manager is directly judged by the number of suggestions his people are coming forward with.' Too often, though, suggestion box schemes fail because the ideas are not evaluated quickly enough. It also takes time to change shop floor perceptions. A job takes on a new dimension with Kaizen - continuous questioning of procedures rather than slavish adherence to them. But acceptance can be remarkably quick. Andy Hand, a production welder at Paddy Hopkirk, said of the overnight changes in his working environment; 'It looks like the bosses had a brain transplant. A weight has been lifted off our shoulders.' Hopkirk wishes he had discovered Kaizen 25 years ago. But a better test of whether his factory has been transformed can only be seen over time. The Financial Times plans to return to the factory in the summer to see how continuous any improvement has been. * Kaizen - The Key to Japan's Competitive Success, Masaaki Imai, McGraw Hill.</p>

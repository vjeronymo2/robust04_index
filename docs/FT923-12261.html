			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / BA cabin crew back one-day strikes BRITISH Airways cabin crew on European short-haul routes have voted for a series of one-day strikes in a dispute over pay and conditions. The decision was taken at a meeting of 300 members of the TGWU general union. The meeting followed a ballot for strike action, which was carried by a majority of 53 per cent. The union said the dispute was over BA's decision to move crews to a subsidiary company with inferior salaries and conditions. Crews affected are based in Birmingham, Manchester and Scotland. BA said it did not expect services to be disrupted if cabin crews did take action. The airline added: 'We have not forced anybody into anything - we have union agreement to the establishment of British Airways Regional, which is necessary to cut costs and secure the long-term future of services out of these regional points.'</p>

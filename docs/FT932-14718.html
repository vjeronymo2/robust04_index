			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Yeltsin comes under attack on two fronts PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia sustained attacks on two fronts yesterday, as his vice president accused the president's closest associates of corruption and Russian industrialists laughed at his claim that the worst was over in the economy andinflation was going. The ferocious attack from General Alexander Rutskoi, in his capacity as inter-departmental fighter against corruption to the Russian Supreme Soviet, accused Mr Mikhail Poltaranin, head of the federal information service, and Mr Gennady Burbulis, former first deputy prime minister and until recently the closest of Mr Yeltsin's advisers, of being involved in crime rings. Mr Burbulis, he alleged, was implicated in the 'Red Mercury' scandal, in which a company in Ekaterinburg (the former base, as Sverdlovsk, of Mr Yeltsin) called Promecologia had received monopoly export rights for mercury. Mr Poltaranin was implicated in the theft of money for the sale of former Red Army property in Berlin, and in the diversion of German aid to the Russian military to build houses, he said. Making explicit the link between criminal circles and radical reform, Gen Rutskoi told parliament that officials most involved in corruption 'are very interested that the present course of reform be maintained, since it's filling their pockets'. Striking the populist note which could make him a formidable electoral opponent for Mr Yeltsin, Gen Rutskoi said: 'The people of Russia were robbed twice last year: once because of shock therapy and the liberalisation of prices, and once because of those sums of money and resources which, without any control, were sent abroad.' Mr Yeltsin hinted this week that he would ask Gen Rutskoi to resign. Mr Yeltsin's humbling before a 4,000-strong gathering of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs in a hall within the Kremlin came when he claimed inflation had dropped from nearly 30 per cent in January to 17 per cent in March. The last figure was drowned in a chorus of jeers and catcalls. 'I don't understand. . . ', said the president, turning to Mr Arkady Volsky, the union's president, for assistance. Inflation, according to figures compiled by the state statistical service Goskomstat, has come down in the first quarter, though its estimate is 21 per cent for March. The underlying rate of credit expansion, the root cause of inflation, has itself come down sharply, to as little as 10 per cent in February from highs last year of over 30 per cent a month. As Mr Yeltsin came under fire in Moscow, leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States yesterday produced an orchestrated chorus of support for the Russian president. The meeting in the Belarussian capital of Minsk, called by Mr Yeltsin to decide the future of the CIS, became a campaign rally for the president a little more than a week before his crucial constitutional referendum on April 25. Even President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, a bitter critic of Russian policy, was induced to endorse Mr Yeltsin as the best Russian president Ukraine was likely to get. He said the referendum would determine whether the Commonwealth would continue to exist and added that 'there are forces in Russia which want a return of the Soviet Union, but that way lies bloodshed'. Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov said: 'We fully support the Russian president even if we do not support every action of his government.' There was no overt disagreement but it is doubtful that this unity will survive a more detailed examination of Mr Yeltsin's proposals in a month. Mr Yeltsin could gain the support of 60 per cent of voters in the referendum on April 25, according to polling by the Gallup organisation.</p>

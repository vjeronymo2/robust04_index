			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIETS SUSPEND SENDING RESERVES TO QUELL UNREST  </P> <P> Facing mounting public opposition, Soviet authorities today suspended their  emergency call-up of reserve troops to stem the warfare in Azerbaijan and  Armenia, while President Mikhail S. Gorbachev blamed extremists opposed to his  reforms for the ethnic conflict.  </P> <P> The Soviet leader said some Azerbaijanis were calling for a separate Islamic  state.  </P> <P> His comments came amid reports Azerbaijanis brought arms into the country over  the border they have forced open with Iran.  </P> <P> Many of the 29,000 troops sent to the southern republics have been unable to  reach their destinations because hundreds of Azerbaijanis have blocked airports  and roads with trucks and buses, opposing what they view as Kremlin  interference.  </P></p>

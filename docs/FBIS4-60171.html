			<p>BFN     [Text] Jordan today reiterated its support for Yemeni  legitimacy and the unity of the Yemeni people, refusing, at the  same time, to clearly condemn Aden's decision yesterday to  establish an independent state in the south.    Government-run Jordanian radio and television have been  reporting, without comment, the views of northerners and  southerners. However, official Jordanian media have recently  referred to the southerners as the separatist forces, the  description used by the northerners, who are referred to as the  government forces.</p>

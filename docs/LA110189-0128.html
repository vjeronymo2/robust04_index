			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS  </P> <P> Varco International Inc.: The Orange-based oil-drilling equipment company  recorded net income of $408,000 for the third quarter, a 5% decline from the  $430,000 posted for the 1988 third quarter. Revenue rose 42%, to $21.8 million  from $15.3 million. For the first nine months of 1989, net income declined 36%,  to $1.3 million from $2 million for the comparable 1988 period. Revenue  increased 34%, to $65.3 million from $48.8 million. The company said the  revenue increase was attributable primarily to the acquisition of Baker Hughes  Inc.'s BJ Machinery division at the end of September, 1988. "Our financial  results reflect a continuing weakness in the level of drilling activity," said  W.B. Reinhold, chairman of Varco.  </P></p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (13): Royal Jelly looked tempting but the cautious investor said no - EIS at 375p and Allied Colloids at 215p are the latest additions, as total return reaches 67 per cent IN THE Review in January last year, I mentioned that I had considered the portfolio taking a risky, quick in-and-out gamble on shares in Regina, the Royal Jelly firm. It looks as if the company had made a turn-around in its trading and financial position, yet at that time Regina shares were only 1.75p. The portfolio had sufficient cash to buy 500,000 Regina shares. If it had done so, it could, theoretically, have turned that Pounds 8,750 investment into Pounds 45,000 by selling the shares earlier this year, when Regina reached a high of 9p. In reality, due to wide dealing spreads, the purchase price per share for such a large number of shares might have been around 2.5p, instead of 1.75p; and the price per share gained from selling them might only have been 8p. Even so, a large profit would have been made in a relatively short time. However, the portfolio, as mentioned in January 1992, cannot be too speculative, and so did not buy any Regina shares. In April this year, Regina reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 143,000 for the six months to February 28, compared with a loss of Pounds 457,000 for that period last year. Although Regina shares are now around 5.5p, I still feel they are not for the cautious. In the Review in April, I included William Ransom in the portfolio at 52p. But on the Friday of publication they jumped 8p to 60p. As a matter of record, my personal pension scheme first bought shares in that company in March 1991, paying 40p per share. My pension scheme did not sell a single Ransom share, even when the price rose to 67p, nor when the shares fell back again. Indeed, the scheme still retains its Ransom shares, as I believe the company has good prospects with its pharmaceutical and plant extract activities. I believe in moral responsibility. I mentioned in my quarterly article that the scheme held Ransom shares, and I will always reveal in my articles any position I may hold in any shares mentioned. For example, my pension scheme currently includes holdings in Burlington, Norcros and Pentland. My dealings in such shares are restricted to such times as it can be seen that any profits made have not been purely as a result of mentioning the shares in an article. I could, of course, have decided not to include in the portfolio any shares in companies in which I have an interest - but that so severely limits my choice that the quarterly portfolio's performance would suffer. I am also aware of the view that, if I find some interesting share situations, it seems rather selfish not to mention some of them in my articles. But be warned: I do not promise profits. No one is infallible. Any of the shares mentioned in my articles could fall. Indeed, just look what happened to Norcros. In the Review in April, the portfolio 'bought' 3,000 Norcros shares for 158p each. The company's share price rose, partly as the date of its announcement of full year figures drew nearer. But when the figures were announced on June 3, it was accompanied by details of a proposed 2-for-7 rights issue at 132p per share. The share price of Norcros then started to decline. Unfortunately, the portfolio has insufficient cash to take up its rights entitlement, so the nil paid were sold at 17.5p, although I still feel that Norcros has takeover potential. One of its subsidiaries, Norprint International, is one of Europe's most successful suppliers of labelling systems. Important customers for its magnetic tickets include British Rail, British Airways and the Milan Metro. This division ought to have considerable growth potential. Norcros has a whole host of other activities - from ceramic tiles to Crittall windows and Triton showers. The portfolio will set a stop-loss limit of around 135-138p, although anyone following this portfolio could consider an even more cautious stop-loss level of around 142p. Last time, I said the portfolio would buy 750 shares in the engineering company EIS Group, if they fell back to 400p. However, by the time the article was published, the shares had already fallen to 375p, and so it was at this price that the portfolio acquired the shares. One of the reasons for the fall in the price of EIS was its announcement, on April 20, of a 1-for-5 rights issue at 340p. For the full year to December 31, 1992, EIS's results were encouraging, especially in these difficult times for engineering companies: pre-tax profits were up from Pounds 14.2m to Pounds 15.1m. The company has a wide spread of engineering interests around the world  - from power transmission couplings and fluid seals to process equipment and aircraft and precision engineering. Exports and overseas activities account for well over half the company's turnover. EIS has increased its pre-tax profits, dividends per share and shareholders' funds every successive year for 22 years. I hope this track record will continue. But, bearing in mind the portfolio's cautious stance, I will set a stop-loss limit of 335-340p. Also in the last Review, when shares in Allied Colloids were 226p, I said the portfolio would buy 1,000 of them if they fell to around 215p. The shares reached that level on May 28, and so the portfolio made its 'purchase'. The company produces speciality chemicals, and more than 80 per cent of its sales are to overseas customers. So, hopefully, its prospects are better than those of companies dependent on one territory or market. The portfolio will set a stop-loss level of 200-205p. The portfolio retains its interests in Burlington and Pentland. If Burlington shares fall back to around the 20p level, then the portfolio would contemplate selling the shares - especially if it looked as if they could fall further. So far this year they have traded in the 15p-27.5p range. If the shares fell below 16p, then the portfolio would consider buying up to 15,000 of them, assuming the reason for their fall was not due to really bad news but was as a result of a general market downturn or just lack of interest in the company. I am still hoping that Burlington will receive a takeover approach. Even at 25.5p the company's market capitalisation is only Pounds 3.77m. Pentland is regarded as a long-term hold for the portfolio. Its 22.6 per cent holding in Authentic Fitness Corporation is now worth considerably more than the company's original Dollars 10m investment in 1990, as AFC was floated on the New York stock exchange in July last year. This appears to have been overlooked by the market and I feel that Pentland is currently underrated and, despite intense competition in the sports footwear industry, still has considerable potential with all its varied interests. Another company with which I remain impressed is Meggitt. But the shares have still not fallen to the portfolio's target purchase price of 75-80p and, as very little cash is now available (unless one of its investments falls to its stop loss level), much as I would like to acquire Meggitt shares, the portfolio is unable to do so. Meanwhile, it is important to note, that if it looked as if there would be a sudden, sharp, downturn in the market, the portfolio might 'dash for cash' and sell everything, even if it had not reached the stop-loss limits. The author of this feature, which first appeared in the autumn 1991 issue of the Review, is familiar to many readers as the writer of the Diary of a Private Investor column in the Weekend FT. The Review invited him to suggest a Pounds 10,000 portfolio for capital growth, without being too speculative. The opinions expressed are his own.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------        HOW THE POUNDS 10,000 PORTFOLIO STANDS AFTER 21 MONTHS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Purchase/                        July 2                    Number       sale       Cost     July 2      Value Company          of shares    price (p)  (Pounds)  price (p)  (Pounds)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Pentland           3,500         99       3,465       107        3,745 Burlington Group   4,000       11.5         460      25.5        1,020 Norcros            3,000        158       4,740       149        4,470 William Ransom     3,000         52       1,560        63        1,890  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SHARES BOUGHT  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- EIS                  750        375       2,813       395        2,963 Allied Colloids    1,000        215       2,150     235.5        2,355 Cash*                279 Total                                                           16,486  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Cash figure allows for interest in the Lazard Cash Fund and dividends  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes: No allowance made for dealing costs.

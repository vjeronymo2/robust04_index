			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Attraction of jobs for life should be examined Sir, Peter Robinson, of the London School of Economics' Centre for Economic Performance, welcomes (Letters, December 13) the 'nailing of the myth' that jobs for life have become a thing of the past, as outlined by Simon Burgess and Hedley Rees ('Jobs for life still available to many' December 9). Would that it were as simple as that. Figures from the Labour Force Survey in December's Employment Gazette paint a more complex picture. Comparisons between 1984 and 1994 show that while the number of permanent jobs (employees) has grown by 2 per cent, the number of temporary posts has grown by 27 per cent. For men there has been a reduction of 6 per cent in the number of permanent posts, and an increase of 38 per cent in the number of temporary jobs. One only has to look at a sector such as further and higher education to see the impact of these changes. Not just yearly contracts, but term ones are becoming the norm in some institutions. This does of course raise the question of how many renewals of a temporary contract it takes for a temporary job to become a permanent one? During this period there has also been, as is well-known, a big rise in the numbers of self-employed (23 per cent) and in part-time working (24 per cent), particularly for men (69 per cent). Perhaps more profitable than a debate about whether there are still 'jobs for life' to be found (implying that that is intrinsically desirable) would be to look at the massive growth in jobs which are part-time, temporary, home-based or flexible in some way, and their potential for good or ill. Some three-fifths of new jobs are believed to fall into the 'flexible' category. Often, such forms of employment offer advantages which compensate for the attendant lack of job security. But what policy-makers, employers and providers of financial services need to examine are the reasons why 'jobs for life' are attractive to people, namely as the underpinning for housing, retirement, insurance and so on, and develop a framework whereby people in more flexible forms of employment can enjoy similar levels of security. Addressing these concerns offers a more realistic approach to trends in the jobs market than holding out false hopes that there will continue to be an adequate supply of full-time, permanent posts to meet demand.

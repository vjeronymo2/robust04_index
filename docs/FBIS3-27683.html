			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, February 26 (XINHUA) -- Relations between  the United States and Russia are facing a severe test over the  scandal of two Russian spies which was revealed last week.    On February 22, the U.S. Government instituted judicial  proceedings against Aldrich Hazen Ames, the former chief of the  CIA's Soviet counter-intelligence branch, and his wife Maria,  charging them with spying for the former Soviet Union and Russia.    Three days later, the U.S. Government expelled a Russian  diplomat from the Russian Embassy in Washington.    It's widely believed that the incident will have a major  impact on Russian-U.S. relations.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher personally handed  an statement of protest to the Russian Embassy in Washington,  declaring that the U.S. could not tolerate Russia installing  spies in its country and describing the incident as a very  serious matter.    Commenting on the case, U.S. President Bill Clinton  suggested  that as a result the U.S. will completely re-evaluate its  foreign policy toward Russia. Many senators in the U.S.  Congress insisted that amendments should be attached to policies  on aid to Russia.    In the last two years, the United States and Russia have  been  seeking a strategic partnership in their relations. In January  their presidents met in Moscow and signed a declaration  announcing that the two countries had entered a stage of  "strategic partnership".    However, there are still contradictions and differences  between the two countries on matters of vital interests.    Russia has always claimed that it has "special interests and  responsibilities" in the new republics which have emerged in the  territories of the former Soviet Union. Russia has taken it for  granted that it has the right to send its peace keeping troops  into these republics and has taken economic measures to  safeguard its interests in them.    Meanwhile, the United States has been using the carrot of  economic aid to various republics and countries in the area as a  means of containing Russia's influence.    The United States, for example, has supported the three  Baltic republics in their request for the withdrawal of Russian  troops and has offered more economic aid for the Ukraine. It  also signed an accord of "democratic partnership" with  Kazakhstan.    Observers here consider that the proposed U.S. plan for  expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),  which it has described as a "partnership for peace", poses a  threat to Russian interests in East European countries where it  previously had traditional influence.    So far, the Russian Government has kept a tight rein on its  response to the U.S. spy allegations. The Russian intelligence  agency has also kept silent, despite Russia's known displeasure  about the U.S. decision to publicly announce the allegations and  the charges without consulting it in advance.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in a statement  last Thursday [24 February] that the Ames issue should not be  placed at the top of the Russian-U.S. relations agenda.    Kozyrev said he believed that the issue won't set back the  hopes for a partnership for peace between Russia and the United  States. The Foreign Ministry also expressed its hope that the  issue could be settled before the political and diplomatic  interests of both countries were put in jeopardy.    Sources from Russian intelligence agencies here said they  were bewildered by the dramatizing of the spy issue on the part  of their American colleagues and the U.S. Government.    An official with the Russian intelligence agency said in an  informal talk that spies from the U.S. are also active on  Russian territory and hence the Ames issue should be tackled  within a framework drawn up between the intelligence agencies of  the two countries.    However, press commentators in Moscow are convinced that the  uproar in the U.S. about the issue will have an adverse effect  on the future development of the relations between the two  countries. They believe that the approach now used by the two  sides to calm down the row will, to some degree, dictate where  their bilateral relations will head for.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] South Korea will set up a consulate general in the  Chinese port city of Qingdao by the end of September this year  at the latest, a Foreign Ministry official said yesterday. He  said two officials at the ministry will be sent to Qingdao in  mid-May for preparatory works, which will take three of four  months.    In addition to dealing with usual consular affairs, the new  consulate general will support Korean companies engaged in  business in Shandong Province surrounding Qingdao, said the  official. He added more Korean firms have advanced into  Shandong than any other Chinese province.    Seoul, which formalized diplomatic ties with Beijing in  August 1991, now has one consulate general in Shanghai. The  official said the government will push to set up several more  consulates general in other key cities in China.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Fitness plan for body and soul: Michael Prowse considers the options facing the Clinton administration as it wrestles with reform of US healthcare When President Bill Clinton sends healthcare reform plans to Congress next month, he will be proposing social and economic change of a scale and complexity seen only twice before in US history - during Lyndon Johnson's 'Great Society' of the 1960s and Franklin Roosevelt's 'New Deal' of the 1930s. Healthcare accounts for about one seventh of US gross domestic product, making it the nation's largest business and a sector that, economically, is more significant than all US export industries combined. Its political clout is more than commensurate with its economic muscle: when Mr Clinton's task force held a public hearing in Washington last week, representatives of 160 special interest groups - from the American Medical Association to the National Farmers Union - turned up to give evidence. Needless to say, they opposed many of the changes the White House is expected to propose, and could not agree on the principles that should guide reform. Mr Clinton's fundamental goals are easily understood and hard to quarrel with. He wants to bring the US into line with other industrial countries by: Giving all citizens a legally enforceable right to a standard package of health benefits. At present some 35m people (15 per cent of the population) have no insurance cover, and 100,000 people a month are estimated to be losing coverage as a result of corporate cuts, unemployment or sickness - which makes them 'bad risks'. Reducing the uncontrolled escalation of healthcare costs through a reform of the healthcare industry involving 'managed competition' between providers of healthcare and the imposition of 'global budgets' or ceilings on total spending. In the past three decades healthcare spending has grown twice as fast as the rest of the economy. Achieving these goals, however, raises a seemingly endless series of complex questions that are likely to be resolved only after protracted debate in Congress and intense lobbying by interest groups. The first thorny question is what to include in the basic package of guaranteed benefits. Oregon state has generated enormous controversy by openly drawing up a set of healthcare priorities for its public programme and declining to fund treatments that are either unlikely to succeed or too expensive or both. The standard benefits package would have to include most doctors' services and routine hospital acute care. But what about organ transplants and experimental drugs for treating cancer? What about the cost of prescription drugs, which are not covered by Medicare, the federal scheme for the elderly? What about abortion, which Congress has never previously agreed to finance with taxpayer dollars? What about mental health care and long-term nursing home care, which are heavily restricted even in generous private insurance schemes, yet which Mr Clinton has indicated he wants to make more available? If many of these items were included, the expenditure on healthcare could balloon: the federal government, at a minimum, would have to upgrade the benefits provided for the elderly under Medicare, at a cost of perhaps Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.6bn) a year. A further unresolved question is who should decide what benefits to include in the standard package and when it should be improved to reflect technological change. The task force is considering setting up a National Health Board, loosely modelled on the Federal Reserve Board. Yet in a nation unaccustomed to any form of deliberate restraint in healthcare, such decisions would be far more contentious than those on interest rates. Ultimately Congress and the White House would have to decide. But deciding what everybody has a right to is only the first tricky issue. Mr Clinton then has to ensure that everybody is covered and find an acceptable means of controlling costs in the longer term. He also has to decide how much freedom to give individual states, whose existing healthcare systems vary tremendously, partly as a result of differences in wealth and population density. The fundamental framework for reform envisaged by the task force is an uneasy amalgamation of ideas put forward by analysts with very different philosophical beliefs about the role of government. Mr Clinton is impressed by aspects of the 'managed competition' schemes that Mr Alain Enthoven, a business professor at Stanford University, has been refining for years with the help of a group of experts who meet regularly at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. But he wants to supplement them with budget controls long favoured by left-wing Democrats. (In the late 1980s, Mr Enthoven influenced healthcare reform in Britain by advocating an 'internal market' - a form of managed competition - within the UK National Health Service.) Like most analysts, Mr Enthoven concedes that unsupervised competition in US healthcare has led to runaway cost inflation and worrying gaps in insurance coverage, especially in the small business sector. The central innovation of managed competition is to require individuals and small companies to purchase care collectively through intermediaries or sponsors that would negotiate terms with competing health plans offered by networks of insurers, hospitals and doctors in the private sector. The sponsors, now generally known as a 'health insurance purchasing co-operatives' (HIPCs, pronounced 'hippicks') would act as conduits for large pools of citizens and thus have the market clout to force doctors and hospitals to provide high-quality care at lower prices, for example by replacing traditional fee-for-service medicine with more economical alternatives, such as the pre-paid plans offered by Health Maintenance Organisations. They would also regulate local health markets, ensuring that all certified health plans offered at least the minimum guaranteed package of benefits on the same terms to all applicants, regardless of age, sex or health status. In most variants of managed competition, the current practice of unrestricted tax relief for corporate health schemes would be ended; tax deductibility would be limited to the cost of the cheapest plan in any area offering the standard benefits package. The theory is that the combination of competition and fiscal incentives would control health costs without the need for bureaucratic controls on the private sector. Managed competition has never been tested. But there are some indications that shifting more people into HMOs and other forms of managed care would reduce costs. Mr James Robinson of the University of California at Berkely recently analysed health plans used by Bank of America employees in California. In 1989 the average expenditure per employee enrolled in an HMO was Dollars 1,853; average spending on employees who opted for traditional fee-for-service medicine was Dollars 2,968. Only about 10 per cent of this cost difference reflected the fact that enrollees in the HMO tended to be healthier than those who opted for an unrestricted choice of physicians and hospitals. The problem with many managed competition schemes is that employers and individuals are not obliged to purchase insurance, although subsidies might be provided for small companies, low income workers and the unemployed. Universal health cover is thus not guaranteed. And since premiums are freely negotiated between the HIPCs and networks of providers, there is no certainty that costs would be controlled. Mr Clinton is thus expected to supplement managed competition in two ways, both foreshadowed in the innovative healthcare reform plan proposed last year by Mr John Garamendi, the insurance commissioner for California. The Clinton plan is expected to: Achieve universal access by requiring all employers to insure workers, but ease the burden by subsidising the cost of premiums for employees of small companies (80 per cent of the currently uninsured population are members of families whose heads are employed). Task force working papers suggest the share of costs employers would have to meet might range from 50 per cent for the smallest companies to 80 per cent for the largest. Making employees responsible for the remainder would encourage people to choose the cheapest plan certified by the local HIPC as providing the federally approved standard package of benefits. The administration may phase out the Medicaid programme that currently provides insurance for about half of people living below the official poverty line. Public subsidies for the unemployed and poor might instead be paid directly to local HIPCs which would enroll them in the cheapest health plan offering the standard benefits package. Care of the poor and middle income groups would thus be integrated. Control costs by imposing some form of a 'global budget' on the healthcare sector. Mr Paul Starr, a health analyst at Princeton University and senior adviser to the Clinton team, has proposed what he calls 'benchmark budgeting'. In effect the federal government would stipulate a maximum allowable rate of increase in the premium charged for the standard benefits package. In addition, a more flexible target would be set for discretionary spending by individuals and companies who wanted to purchase more generous health plans. The cap and target, argues Mr Starr, could be set by the president and Congress on advice from his economic advisers and the National Health Board. The advantage of a cap on premium growth is that it avoids the bureaucracy of direct controls on the price and volume of medical services (an option which many prominent Democrats including Mr Mario Cuomo, governor of New York state, are still urging). At the same time, however, the networks of competing doctors and hospitals would find themselves subject to an overall spending limit. Like the medical profession in all other developed countries, they would have to ration the supply of expensive new forms of treatment, but the trade-offs would be determined locally rather than in Washington. The Clinton plan is theoretically attractive. But turning abstract ideas into practical proposals will be an immense task. Perhaps the biggest challenge lies in creating new institutions. How quickly, for example, could a national network of HIPCs be established? And what exactly would be the status and powers of these bodies? Should they be public corporations or non-profit private sector bodies subject to political oversight? Then there is knotty issue of paying for the reforms. Bringing healthcare coverage to the uninsured, providing subsidies for small business and improving the package of benefits offered could cost an extra Dollars 90bn a year (1.5 per cent of national output), perhaps more. The reforms will only gradually reduce the rate of growth of spending. Mr Clinton is expected to raise 'sin' taxes on tobacco, alcohol and guns but this would cover only a portion of the required revenue. He may also propose new taxes on hospitals and doctors. The big question, however, is whether he has the courage sharply to restrict the tax-deductibility of employer-paid healthcare, a middle-class perk which costs the Treasury about Dollars 90bn a year. Tough restrictions would increase the relative attractions of economical health plans, such as HMOs, which are disliked by many Americans because they impose restrictions on choice of physicians. The transition to a new system also threatens severely to disrupt one of the few sectors that has steadily created jobs in recent years. Mr Uwe Reinhardt, a health care analyst at Princeton University, reckons that managed competition could throw many specialists out of work (on average HMOs require only 125 physicians per 100,000 enrollees, less than half the number in traditional fee for service medicine.) The restructuring is also likely to provoke a wave of mergers and job cuts in the health insurance industry, sparking comparisons with the 'downsizing of defence'. Healthcare reform makes Mr Clinton's budget-cutting economic plan look like a gentle warm-up exercise. It will affect the future of every family and business in the nation. Yet in spite of the formidable problems, there is a good chance that Mr Clinton will succeed. The contradictions and inefficiencies of the present system are widely regarded as intolerable: a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed that three quarters of voters believe a 'complete overhaul' of the system is needed. Mr Clinton has the intellect and communication skills to convince the nation that change is now less threatening than the status quo.</p>

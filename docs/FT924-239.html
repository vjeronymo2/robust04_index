			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Letter to Calcutta: No rest from her mission of mercy While Christians around the world have been celebrating Christmas, their most revered co-religionist quietly carried on with her work. 'I spend Christmas as I spend every day - with the poor,' says Mother Teresa of Calcutta. 'We share with them whatever food we have.' At the age of 82, she takes no rest. While age and illness have forced her to slow down, she does not allow herself any time off. Mother Teresa does not carry her burden lightly. Even conversation can be a distraction from the enormity of her mission, since she is utterly convinced that she must dedicate every moment to God. She says: 'Everything I do is for Christ.' This fierce determination lives inside the frailest of bodies. At times, she seems as weak as some of the destitute sick that she tends. She has difficulty walking and can scarcely kneel to pray. Only her hands are strong  -she takes visitors by both hands, gripping them in a combination of greeting and blessing. Mother Teresa lives in the house in Calcutta from which she directs her work for the poor through the Missionaries of Charity, the order of nuns she founded in 1950. The building stands on a busy road, exposed to the dirt and the diesel fumes which permeate the city. It is well-maintained but simple: there is no glass in the windows, no air-conditioning and only one fan. Mother Teresa inhabits a small room next to the chapel. The veneration with which she is treated is palpable: her patients stare in silent adoration; the nuns speak in her presence in hushed voices; a well-dressed Indian woman, who has come to give thanks for a favour, drops to Mother Teresa's feet and kisses her ankles. She says: 'When you touch her, you can feel the power coming from her.' Mother Teresa's answers to questions are brief. How does she manage to keep going? 'I pray. With prayer you can do anything.' She adds with the faintest trace of pride that the Missionaries of Charity now have houses in 105 countries, including homes for the poor, for the sick, for orphans and for Aids victims. She visited Britain this year to open a house for the homeless in Birmingham. I ask her why such places were necessary in rich countries. She says that riches are unevenly divided. 'It's because some people are rich, others are poor.' And what could we do to put that right? 'Share,' she answers. 'Share until it hurts.' The west is too materialistic, she says. Westerners lack the capacity to share because they are too attached to their possessions. 'You must become more spiritual. You must have time to pray.' With those words she grips my hands once more. The meeting is over. 'Mother is tired,' says one of the nuns. 'If you want to know more about her work, why don't you go and see it for yourself.' Early the next morning, I go to Kalighat, a particularly poor district of Calcutta. The grand old Victorian buildings hide in the shadows, like dowagers trying to conceal the effects of age. The roads are littered with potholes and rubbish. The rickshaw men are already at work, pulling loads of vegetables to the city's markets. People throng the streets - washing, talking and eating breakfast. Kalighat is dominated by a temple to Kali, the Hindu patroness of Calcutta and the goddess of destruction. Next door, somewhat incongruously, stands Mother Teresa's home for the dying. Inside, the sick lie on rows of low beds, while their nurses - nuns and young volunteers from western countries  -quietly prepare food, doling out portions into aluminium plates. Above their heads on a blackboard hangs a silent summary of the previous day's work: 'Males 47; females 46; admissions nil; discharges four; deaths nil.' I ask a nun from southern India why she came to work in Calcutta. 'For God. And for Mother Teresa,' she says. The same dedication is apparent at Shishu Bhavan, Mother Teresa's Calcutta orphanage. Nuns and volunteers look after about 300 children, most of whom have been abandoned in the city's teeming slums. Virtually all are found adoptive parents. 'Today, people are willing to take even the difficult ones, even the handicapped,' says a nun over the noise of 10 small children eating breakfast together. Outside, the orphanage runs a soup kitchen on a grand scale - some 600 local poor are fed at the gates every morning under the careful eye of a large cook who watches to make sure that no one steals an extra meal. Among the volunteers in the orphanage is a woman from Cardiff who says she waited 12 years for her own children to grow up before coming to work for a month in Calcutta. 'I love it here. But it's easy for me. I can go and have a drink in the hotel when it gets too much. And I'm going home in time for Christmas. It's the nuns I admire, they never leave. Nor Mother Teresa.' In the evening, I return to Mother Teresa's house, where her nuns and some of the volunteers gather for prayers. The chapel looks out on to the street and on to the noisy rush-hour traffic. Mother Teresa crouches on the stone floor near the back, apparently too frail to kneel properly. She stares at the ground and it seems her strength might fail her at any moment. Yet, her strong hands are clenched together, as if trying to grapple with some unseen force. Even in her prayers, Mother Teresa does not seek rest.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Son Song-chin] </F>   [Text] Following the sever of diplomatic relations  between our country and Taiwan 17 months ago, Lin Tsun-hsien,  representative of the Taiwan Mission in the ROK, arrived here on  a Delta Airlines flight at 4:10 PM on 20 January.    In the news conference held at the airport, Representative  Lin said: "I will do my best to restore mutual trust as soon as  possible and to establish new relations based on the principle  of equality and reciprocity."    Government officials, including Chong Yong-cho, a  consultation officer in charge of Asian affairs at the Foreign  Ministry, received the representative at the airport. Some 100  resident-Chinese also warmly welcomed the representative and his  wife by presenting garlands of flowers.    The representative said: "Although the two countries severed  ties a year ago, I think it will not be long before the  bilateral relations of frienship are restored since the two  countries have maintained close cordial relations in culture and  trade for a long time. I think, first of all, it is urgent to  restore mutual understanding and trust." He then added: "It  took longer than expected for me to arrive in the ROK because I  had to pass on the ambassadorial duties of my former post. As  soon as the construction of a new office at Kwanghwamun building  is completed, the mission will be inaugurated and begin  operations."    In connection with restoring relations in areas of economy  and aviation, he said: "I believe that the bilateral relations  in aviation, economy, and trade will soon be restored if the two  countries and peoples are prepared to do so."    Representative Lin, saying that most Taiwanese people  welcome  the opening of the Taiwanese mission in the ROK, disclosed that  he has met with Han Chol-chu, representative in the ROK mission  in Taiwan, and that they had agreed to work closely with one  another.    The major tasks of the mission will be protecting the rights  of Chinese residents in the ROK and assisting Taiwanese students  studying in the ROK, he said.    Following the break in diplomatic relations on August 24,  1992, the ROK and Taiwanese Governments have since signed an  agreement to establish relations in July last year and the ROK  Mission in Taiwan began operations as soon as 25 November of  last year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Knyazkov under "Military-Political Review" </F> rubric: "The Last of the 90,000.... Heavy Burden Falls to Lot  of Russian Servicemen Still in Estonia"]    [Text] In 1990 there were 90,000 Soviet Army servicemen on  Estonian territory. Now all that is left of the once mighty  military grouping which Russia has taken under its jurisdiction  is something in the order of 2,500 men and, as the Estonian  press notes ironically, nowadays there is one Russian officer  for every three soldiers. Surely not a single army in the world  has such a ratio. Nonetheless the Russian military units, which  are concentrated in only a few garrisons, are still being  clamorously called "occupying" units, and Estonia regards their  presence as a direct threat to the country's sovereignty.  Special concern is apparently being caused by the two nuclear  reactors at the naval base in Paldiski and the 144th Motorized  Rifle Division, which has weapons and armored personnel carriers  as well as around 30 tanks. In the republic capital itself an  ammunition dump which originally contained 7,000 items in  storage is under the constant attention of the Estonian  military. True, now there are considerably fewer of them, since  ammunition is being continuously taken off to Russia.    The Baltic Fleet has already withdrawn its ships, but  something like around 12 half-sunken old "tubs" have been left  at piers in Tallinn and Paldiski.    Citing these figures to Moscow journalists, the Estonian  military observed that, besides the "purely military aspect,"  they are concerned by the fact that the Russian garrisons pose a  danger "as a hotbed of crime and of weapons and metal  smuggling." Something similar has already been voiced in a RIA  report cited by Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar, so when given  the opportunity to talk to the Estonian premier personally in  Tallin, I asked him to clarify the facts cited.    "The Estonian police did indeed recently arrest a group of  Russian servicemen trading in weapons and metals," Laar replied.  "Incidentally, the Russian Prosecutor's Office is also working  on these cases. But we are especially concerned by the trade in  radioactive metals. According to our information the Baltic  Fleet recently sold and exported from Estonia several ships  containing a considerable dose of radioactive contamination."    I think the thesis regarding the "criminalization" of the  remnants of Russian troops in Estonia is no accident, especially  as certain incidents "have occurred." But by the way, it is  relevant to recall that our servicemen are permitted to sell  some metals and surplus property locally. All the funds earned,  Colonel General Leonid Mayorov, commander of the Northwestern  Group of Forces, stressed in a conversation with me, are going  on the construction of housing for military pensioners in  Russia. But in my view the issue here is that, by raising a  delicate subject, officials in Tallinn are thereby trying to  exert pressure on Moscow and to mold public opinion in a certain  way. The aim is well known -- to get Russia to withdraw its  troops before 31 August 1994. But the point is that, following  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to Tallinn, when  the signing of the appropriate troop withdrawal treaty started  to look more certain, Estonia itself has been holding up the  troop withdrawal willy-nilly.    "The Russian side is making active preparations for the  transportation of nuclear reactors, fuel, and radioactive waste  from Paldiski," Anatoliy Chizhikov, military attache at the  Russian Embassy in Estonia, related. "Containers are being  delivered and the necessary equipment and specialists are  arriving: Unique work lies ahead! But instead of helping us in  this the Estonian side is delaying the matter in every way  possible."    It turned out that originally in order for the specialists  to enter Estonia promptly they needed merely to put in a claim  at the Estonian Foreign Ministry, which would the be transmitted  to the border.... But visas were soon introduced, but for some  time the Estonian border services did not even "know about it."    "Estonia is trying to hasten the Baltic Fleet's final  departure," Vice Admiral Anatoliy Gavrilov, commander of the  Tallin Naval Base, said. "We reached agreement with a Norwegian  firm to help us raise four cutters that sank in Paldiski and it  would acquire them as scrap. Three cutters were raised, but  then Estonian representatives intervened. They protested the  deal and, as a result, we had to...scuttle the cutters that had  already been raised."    Vice Adm. Gavrilov categorically denied the Estonian side's  suggestions that the Baltic Fleet is selling "contaminated"  ships. According to him, before any trade deals go ahead the  ships are "cleaned" of radioactive waste, if there is any. This  process is strictly monitored.    It seems as though problems will even arise at the final  stage of the troop withdrawal. Anatoliy Ivanov,  minister-counselor at the Russian Embassy in Tallin, explained  that we will have to hand over our military camps and their  property under formal instruments [akty], and there is no doubt  that the meticulous Estonians will count every last item. What,  for instance, was the commander of a military unit near Tallin  meant to do? In April the "Kaitseliit" (armed militiamen),  which are structurally part of the republic's Defense Ministry,  removed three 24-meter masts from the antenna field under the  threat of force. And, despite a protest from the embassy, no  apology was forthcoming and the antennas have not been returned.    Our military have long since disappeared from the streets of  Estonian cities -- officers and NCO's switched to civilian dress  a few years ago so as "not to traumatize" the local population  too much. But within the garrison of the 144th Division, based  on the outskirts of Tallin, everything is like a "normal"  military unit -- uniforms and meticulous garrison duty at  checkpoints, in the staff, and in the military subunits.    "Although there has been no political solution to the troop  withdrawal, we are preparing to redeploy," the chief of staff,  Guards Colonel Yevgeniy Lazebin, noted. "People's morale is  good. An operational group is at work at the new site. The  question of rented accommodations for officers' families is  being resolved, and South Korea's Samsung has promised to build  us residential quarters by August of next year. The first five  blocks will be built by the end of the year."    But not everything has been so smooth -- combat subunits are  having to be temporarily billeted in the field. In the absence  of any accommodations in Russia, officers' families have been  forced to send their personal effects and furniture to their  relatives' apartments.    "And, incidentally, 30 percent of families have nowhere at  all to put their things," Guards Lieutenant Colonel Gennadiy  Kaverda, the division's psychologist, explained. "This means  that some things will have to be sold off, and there is no need  to mention how hard officers' families are taking it."    In conclusion, I would like to say the following. For a long  time Russian troops were an important factor in the difficult  dialogue between Estonia and Russia. Relying on this, Russia  tried to solve the problems of social protection for military  pensioners and the civil rights of the Russian-speaking  population in Estonia. This tactic did not meet with any  particular success. The negotiating process is deadlocked....  Meanwhile, the troops have been leaving for Russia and are  being cut back locally. Some people in Estonia have gotten the  idea that it is possible not only to insist on an immediate  Russian troop withdrawal, but also, if necessary, on "making  Russian servicemen withdraw by force." That was the sense of  statements made by General Aleksandr Einseln, commander of the  Estonian Defense Forces. Fortunately, sober-minded trends have  prevailed at top political level in Estonia of late. The  fruitful meetings in Tallin between the Estonian leadership and  Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his  deputy Vitaliy Churkin inspire hope that the disputes between  the two countries -- disputes at the focus of which Russian  servicemen have found themselves -- will be resolved in a  civilized fashion.</p>

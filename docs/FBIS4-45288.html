			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 31 May (EFE) -- Oswaldo Sandoval, president of  the Foreign Relations Committee of the Peruvian Congress, said  today that the U.S. decision to withdraw its airplanes and  radars supporting drug enforcement in Peru favors drug  trafficking.    Sandoval said that the U.S. decision "is incoherent, and  lacks logic, as everyone recognizes that drug enforcement is the  responsibility of producers as well as consumers."    Sandoval said that without U.S. logistical support in Peru  "the mafias could transport the drugs without fear of being  intercepted by the Peruvian Air Force, which joined the drug  enforcement effort with recognized success in 1992."    Arnaldo Velarde, Peruvian delegate before the Inter-American  Committee for the Control of Drugs and Drug Abuse (CICAD), said  that the interruption of the U.S. aid was decided "unilaterally,  and without consultation."    Velarde also confirmed that Washington has suspended the  flights of its AWAC and Orion airplanes, and has ordered the  withdrawal of the radar operating in Yurimaguas that is used to  control flights at the Peruvian and Colombian border.    Velarde said: "This will greatly hurt drug enforcement,  because the Peruvian Air Force lacks the necessary means to  detect the airplanes flying on the Colombian border, 99 percent  of which are used to carry cocaine."    The suspension of the aid was recommended by the State  Department with the argument that shooting down civilian  airplanes suspected of carrying drugs "is a violation of  international law."    The flights of the AWAC and Orion airplanes, which are  equipped with high technology radars, allowed the Peruvian Air  Force to detect and intercept the drug trafficking airplanes,  which in some cases, when they refused to obey the orders to  land, were shot down.    Velarde said that Peru will continue the drug enforcement  effort "with its own means," but he indicated that the detection  of airplanes carrying drugs "will be slower, difficult, and  expensive" without the U.S. aid.</p>

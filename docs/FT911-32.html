			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Business spread behind Power Corp's advance POWER Corporation, the Dublin-based property development company, has announced pre-tax profits for 1990 up from IPounds 10.26m to IPounds 15.59m, or Pounds 14m sterling. Turnover increased 13.5 per cent to IPounds 35.12m. After tax of IPounds 3.38m (IPounds 2.31m) earnings per share came out at 10.54p, compared with 8.65p. Mr Robin Power, chairman, said that the company had performed exceptionally well given the difficult market conditions. 'We are the only property company quoted on the UK market to have achieved results in line with forecasts of 14 months ago. This is due to the spread of business between Ireland, the UK and the US.' The company said the value of its property portfolio at the end of 1990 stood at IPounds 352m, up from IPounds 33m when the company came to the market at the end of 1987. An independent valuation resulted in net assets per share of 198p at the year end, compared with 207p. Power has been involved with Brent Walker, the troubled leisure conglomerate, in the Trocadero site in central London and in the Blackpool Tower shopping centre. Mr Power said that the deal with Brent Walker, involving the swapping of Brent's 50 per cent stakes in the two developments and Power's 50 per cent stake in the Island site adjacent to the Trocadero, was still subject to some consents. 'We had expected things to be finalised two weeks ago but there have been some hold ups.' He added that the company intended to retain only 50 per cent of the Trocadero. When the development was completed and an attractive price could be obtained the 50 per cent from Brent would be disposed of.</p>

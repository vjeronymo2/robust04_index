In the opinion of the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, "the president's  speech signifies, to some extent, a new stage in the development  of intra- state relations: the Russian parliament received for  the first time a presidential message called upon to give  guidelines in political, economic and social construction for  1994".    "Legislators," the TRUD newspaper notes, "were waiting for  the president's response to a decision taken by the lower house  to pardon members of the state emergency committee (eds: they  attempted an abortive coup in august 1991) as well as people  involved in riots on May 1, 1993 and ringleaders of the coup in  September-October 1993.    "But Yeltsin refrained from a direct appraisal. However, his  speech contained the following idea: you can display mercy only  if it does not contradict rules of law and morality."    "After reading the presidential message," the PRAVDA  newspaper writes, "one is apt to ask the following question: is  the country really changing the political, social and economic  course in the interests of the majority of Russians or has Boris  Yeltsin launched an election campaign for a new term of the  presidency with his speech?"    The message, the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper notes, "had  to  contain specific strategic plans of the president. However, the  tradition of former reports on guidelines" which general  secretaries of the former Communist Party of the Soviet Union  liked to deliver, remained.    "Mr. Yeltsin limited himself to the enumeration of existing  problems and general phrases on what direction should be taken  to resolve them."    The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper examines reasons for the  arrest of CIA agent Aldrich Hazen Ames and his wife Maria del  Rosario by FBI officers, to which American television was  invited.    "Russia acted more confidently in the international arena in  the recent past," the newspaper stresses. "Our diplomatic  success in Bosnia and Herzegovina evidently exhausted the U.S.  Administration's patience: Americans were snubbed there.    "Therefore, Ames's scandal broke out exactly at this time.  It is precisely at this time that Washington wants to stop  Moscow and to remind it who is master in the world.    "In good old times when a Western power fell into fits of  hysteria about Soviet spies, Moscow replied with the principle  of 'tit for tat': arrest for arrest, expulsion for expulsion.    "Even Mikhail Gorbachev acted the same way at the beginning  of his rule. Later, political will weakened. Then, the Soviet  Union collapsed. If Russia wants to display firmness, spies can  be found in Moscow too."    TRUD runs its own material on the state's delays with  payment  of wages. The newspaper notes that "the Russian Statistics  Committee reported: wage arrears more than doubled in january,  totalling a sky-high sum of 1,681.3 billion roubles. Over 30,000  enterprises in industry and agriculture did not pay wages and  salaries to their employees."    The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper forecasts the dollar's  exchange rate to the rouble in 1994. The newspaper believes that  the dollar's rate will reach 2,650-3,190 roubles by the end of  the year.    The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper prints a sensation that a  Russian scholar designed an instrument for liaison with...  Ghosts. "It would seem that talk about miracles is out of  question in our era of pragmatism and scientific discoveries.       "But actualities of life beat our imagination. In any case,  Gennadiy Markov of Novosibirsk invented an instrument for  liaison with a supreme outer space intellect and carriers of its  information -- ghosts."    St. Petersburg mayor Anatoliy Sobchak sent a proposal to  Finnish Housing Minister Pirjo Rusanen: To complete the  establishment of a joint stock society in the shortest possible  time in order to implement a joint housing project in St.  Petersburg -- "Northern Valley-Pargolovo".    The project is worth 15 billion Finnish marks and will be  financed with credits from international banks and personal  savings of future condominium owners, reports the VECHERNYY  PETERBURG newspaper.</p>

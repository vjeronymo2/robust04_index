			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT, WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> STATUS OF SEAU, BERNSTINE UNCERTAIN  </P> <P> Linebacker Junior Seau, who suffered a pulled groin Thursday in practice,  wasn't sure Friday whether he would be ready for Sunday's game at Kansas City.  </P> <P> Seau practiced in a limited capacity Friday and said the injury hadn't improved  since Thursday.  </P> <P> What are his chances?  </P> <P> "I'm not going to say anything about Sunday," he said. "All I know is that we  play the Chiefs."  </P> <P> Tight end Rod Bernstine might not play on Sunday, either. Bernstine is still  recovering from a hamstring injury he sustained last week.  </P> <P> "Just jogging doesn't bother me," he said, "but bursting and stuff like that  does."  </P> <P> Coach Dan Henning said he would decide Sunday morning whether to activate Seau  and Bernstine.  </P> <P> Nose tackle Joe Phillips, recovering from an assault Sept. 26 that required him  to have surgery to repair his eye orbit, is back into a workout routine.  </P> <P> He was at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium Friday lifting weights. He is 24 pounds  lighter than he was before the beating and says his bench-press capability is  down from 550 pounds to 450 pounds.  </P> <P> Running back Darrin Nelson used to do a lot less standing around than he does  now. He is the fourth running back of four. In nine games, he has carried twice  for nine yards and caught two passes for 19.  </P> <P> Last year in 10 games with the Chargers, Nelson caught 31 passes for 328 yards  and rushed 36 times for 197 yards.  </P> <P> Nelson isn't fazed by the situation. This is his 10th season in the NFL, and he  is aware that the end of his football career is approaching.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't say I'm bored," Nelson said. "It gets a little frustrating. But  Marion (Butts) is doing a good job, and Ronnie (Harmon) is going to be here a  lot longer than I am. He might as well get the experience." DON PATTERSON  </P></p>

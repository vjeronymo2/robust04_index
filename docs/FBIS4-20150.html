			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andre Dumoulin, research assistant at the </F> European Institute for Research and Data on Peace and Security  (GRIP) in Brussels: "A Profound Review of the French  Prestrategic Concept"]    [Text] If the debate about the method of using the  technical nuclear weapons in the possession of NATO has never  really ceased, the French prestrategic component, of which the  Pluton, and then the Hades, missiles were the symbols and the  stakes at risk, have never been excluded from it. From foreign  sources, the perception of the nonstrategic component of the  French nuclear force has periodically been put forth as a  justification for the refusal to participate, with full  confidence, in the building of a secure Europe with Paris as the  motivating force and guarantor of stability, based on its  minimal strategic deterrent capacity.    From the historical point of view, and apart from the  transition from the concept of a warning shot as a test to that  of a final warning that must have its own military efficiency,  the prestrategic doctrine has undergone many fluctuations.    However, certain French politicians and experts, including  Jacques Chirac and Francois Heisbourg, have finally advanced the  idea of carrying out the final warning on the very territory of  the aggressor. While this proposed method has the advantage of  avoiding collateral damage to close allies and of being entirely  attributable (the opponent's radar would determine precisely who  was responsible for the ground-to-ground shot), confusion could  develop about the distinction between a warning shot and a  strategic shot, with consequences one can readily imagine.  Paradoxically, this desire to make the final warning dependent  on a strike of strategic range had the effect of stripping the  principle of tactical nuclear warning of its legitimacy.    If the Hades can no longer be the potential basis for the  building of a secure Europe, and if French doctrinal specificity  in the prestrategic realm has never resolved the basic  contradiction between the political message of the atom and  nuclear support of tactical maneuvers, France today must  approach the doctrine of the prestrategic warning strike in a  different way.    Nuclear weapons today are undergoing a veritable conceptual  and doctrinal revolution that is being given further impetus by  the reduction in military budgets. This change is operating in  two main directions.    First of all, we are seeing a rebirth of the strategic  level.  In other words, a considerable number of so-called tactical  conventional weapons will in the end be used within a strategic  framework, while in the nuclear sector, their counterparts with  a limited range of action in the nuclear sector will have to be  enhanced to give them greater range, or they will vanish from  the military landscape.    The second trend is toward conventional weapons and  polyvalence in the weapons systems previously assigned an  exclusively nuclear capacity. Based on the lessons of the Gulf  war, the numerous stages of infrastrategic nuclear deterrence  might be replaced by conventional deterrence through the use of  strategies based on strikes from a distance, preventive strikes,  and classic long-distance strategic strikes.    Tactical nuclear weapons are being replaced by  high-precision  classic weapons with very powerful explosive charges--MLRS  [multiple rocket launchers], FAE [fuel air explosive] bombs,  bombs with a zone-saturation effect, and conventional cruise  missiles. These replacements are capable of achieving the same  results in the field, while they also eliminate the problem of  certain undesirable effects, both immediate and deferred, such  as unacceptable collateral damage, residual radioactivity, and  political and philosophical criticisms.    With the effort to ensure greater polyvalence for its  prestrategic aerial vectors, France should be able to approach  the problem of the warning strike today with greater  flexibility. The emergence of a multipolar world makes an update  the "three-circle" strategy and a review of the doctrine and the  needs related to the prestrategic strike necessary. The goal is  indeed a transition from such a specifically East-West warning  to an "all-points" strategy. This requirement for flexible use  is only met by the cruise missile.    Where the strategic nuclear weapon would continue to serve  as  life insurance for the vital interests of France, the  conventional weapons for retaliation, which are less powerful  but more accurate, would have the task of conveying warning  messages on more tolerable, but equally effective, levels.    At the intermediary level, a high-altitude warning strike in  the form of EMP [electromagnetic pulse] charges would provide  earlier protection of the vital interests of France, making  clear the possibility, as an entirely last resort, of strategic  nuclear intervention in the event that this deterrent measure  failed.    There is nothing to prevent the establishment of a new  French  prestrategic concept based on conventional weapons. At a time  when nuclear weapons cannot cover all of the risks with which  France might be faced, and when its vital interests at the heart  of the nation are less and less threatened, in the military  sense, it becomes desirable to organize the conventional  resources and to extend their use to strategic missions.    In addition, conventional warning weapons are better suited  to a sharp, precise, and very meaningful blow delivered within a  context that is no longer exclusively East-West, but  multidirectional, with strategic and political-military goals  that have high priority but are less and less vital, in that  they do not in any way involve a threat to the national survival  of continental France.    The use of conventional weapons for a prestrategic strike  would also have the advantage of simultaneously preventing the  disproportionate use of weapons, by limiting the process to the  reasonable conventional level, as well as facilitating speedier  coercive and classic warning strikes without the danger of  escalation to extreme measures. It will from now on be a matter  of a conventional deterrent that is credible because it is  practical, as distinguished from nuclear deterrence based on the  nonuse of the weapon.    At a time when the new British defense white paper,  "Defending Our Future," which came out last July, has raised  further questions raised about the nuclear air-to-ground missile  that was to replace the WE-177 gravity bombs, and which was to  be the possible focus of cooperation with France or the United  States, it is probable that Paris cannot avoid a redefinition of  prestrategic nuclear missions.    With the probable disappearance of chemical weapons toward  the year 2000, the elimination of a large part of the  American-Russian nuclear theater and tactical weapons, as well  as the reductions in the strategic realm resulting from the  START [Spacecraft Technology and Advanced Reentry Tests]  treaties, the remaining nuclear potential will increasingly be  considered in terms of the logic of nonwar, within a context of  "existential deterrence," thus being reduced to a subsidiary and  residual role. Following this new definition, the  high-technology conventional weapons will be able to acquire a  deterrent capacity that, unlike that of nuclear weapons, can be  more easily adapted to conflict situations of low or moderate  intensity.    Today, clarification and the placing of nuclear instruments  and pertinent doctrine in proper perspective are needed. In  France, the drafting of the white paper and the military  planning law expected this coming spring should favor this new  strategic approach, setting aside certain contingencies and  taboos.</p>

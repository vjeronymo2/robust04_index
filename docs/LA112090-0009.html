			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTON SUCCEEDS ENGER AS PIERCE HEAD FOOTBALL COACH  </P> <P> Bill Norton, an assistant football coach at Pierce College for the past two  seasons, has been hired to replace Head Coach Bob Enger, who announced his  resignation Friday.  </P> <P> Norton, 43, was introduced as the new Brahma coach at a press conference at  Pierce on Monday, three days after Pierce's final game of the season.  </P> <P> "When I came here two years ago, my goal was to become the head football coach  at Pierce College," Norton said. "So I'm excited. I think this program is  headed in the right direction. . . . I think Pierce is a potential gold mine."  </P> <P> Pierce had a 9-21 record under Enger, 55, who took over in 1988 after the  school had not fielded a team in the previous two seasons due to budgetary  cuts.  </P> <P> Norton was an assistant at Glendale College in 1987 and 1988 before coming to  Pierce. He was head coach at Palmdale High from 1984-86 and at Bishop  Montgomery High from 1977-83.  </P> <P> Bishop Montgomery advanced to the Northwestern Conference championship in 1983,  losing to Canyon, 40-24.  </P> <P> Pierce has posted 4-6 records in the past two seasons after finishing 1-9 in  1988.  </P> <P> "We didn't improve in the win-loss column this season," Norton said. "But we  were a much better team. We played several teams much closer this year than we  did last year."  </P> <P> Bakersfield, the No. 1-ranked team in J. C. Grid-Wire national poll, came from  behind to defeat the Brahmas, 38-35, in a Western State Conference finale  Friday, when Renegade kicker Jon Baker hit a 47-yard field goal with one second  left.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEST EUROPEANS BALK AT QUICK AID FOR SOVIETS  </P> <P> Western European leaders Tuesday signaled support for Mikhail S. Gorbachev's  efforts to rescue his ailing Soviet economy but fended off a Franco-German push  for an immediate $15-billion aid package.  </P> <P> The leaders of the 12-nation trading bloc ended a two-day summit by asking  aides to consult with the Kremlin about urgent proposals for immediate loans  and longer term assistance.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Charles Haughey, the host of the meeting, said the leaders are  aware of concerns about the Soviet president's chances of success in advancing  his economic reform program.  </P> <P> The troublesome question also will be at the top of the agenda of next month's  economic summit of the seven leading industrialized nations in Houston.  </P> <P> In their final statement, the leaders praised reform efforts in South Africa  but made no move to ease the economic sanctions imposed against the white-led  government in 1986.  </P> <P> Britain's Margaret Thatcher, who has pushed for a lifting of prohibitions,  hailed their statement urging an end to violence in South Africa. She said it  was directed at black leader Nelson Mandela's African National Congress and its  support for an armed struggle, which "ought to be abandoned."  </P> <P> In taking a cautious approach on the Soviet Union, the officials, led by  Thatcher, rejected an appeal by France and West Germany for immediate aid.  </P> <P> "I favor support for economic reform, but there has to be reform to be  supported," Thatcher said.  </P> <P> Spain's prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, said, "It wouldn't be responsible for  the community to fix a budget (aid package) without knowing the needs."  </P> <P> Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, who made a strong pitch for immediate  Soviet aid, said he is satisfied with the summit, however. He said aid for  Moscow is a "long-term investment from which we all can benefit."  </P> <P> West German banks have already agreed to grant loans totaling $3.1 billion to  the Soviets.  </P> <P> In exchange for the help, Kohl has said he will urge the Kremlin "to adopt a  constructive approach" toward membership of a united Germany in the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization.  </P></p>

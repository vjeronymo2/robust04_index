			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Cuckney appeals for funds to aid Maxwell pensioners SIR JOHN CUCKNEY, the senior City figure given the job of rebuilding the pension funds looted by the late Robert Maxwell, said yesterday he had still only received one donation of Pounds 120,000 and appealed to City institutions to make contributions. He hinted that a new campaign to raise funds for the Maxwell pensioners' trust fund would be launched within the next few days, using advertisements and letters to solicit contributions. In an interview at the unit's office in St James's Square in London, Sir John, the retiring chairman of 3i, the venture capital group, said the trust would require 'tens of millions of pounds' to make good 'a remarkable bit of pillaging'. He stressed that donations would not imply any culpability or liability, and would be motivated by a desire to 'help restore and consolidate the good name of the pensions industry and the financial services area'. 'In the end, the most interesting thing will be seeing those companies which choose not to contribute,' he said. Sir John's unit has a provisional budget for the first year of Pounds 1m, representing the Department of Social Security's entire contingency fund, and is staffed by 20 DSS civil servants, headed by a Department of the Environment under-secretary. He fended off criticism that the unit was duplicating existing efforts and was a 'whitewash'. Sir John said the trust had already been approached by a number of individuals and 'financial institutions totally unconnected with the Maxwell affair' willing to make donations. He would not be drawn on the amounts involved or when the money would be received. The trust - set up on June 7 by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, as part of the Maxwell pensions unit - has a single donation from the National Association of Pension Funds. Sir John's comments came as the cross-party social security committee is due to renew inquiries into the Maxwell affair with an urgent meeting with the liquidators and administrators of the pension funds. A meeting last night of the cross-party group of MPs campaigning for the Maxwell pensioners agreed to ask the committee to look at the costs of tracing the missing funds after MPs expressed concern about the scale of the fees. The group also agreed to seek early meetings with Sir John and with Mr George Staple, the director of the Serious Fraud Office. Sir John said that most of the money received by the trust would be given to the Maxwell pension fund trustees. But he said there could also be 'individual ex-gratia payments to pensioners outside the schemes who are not the responsibility of any trustees'. Sir John said he expected the unit to be operating for at least the next 18 months. He said the trust would have an important role in acting as a focal point for information, and in co-ordinating the work of accountants and other advisers in an effort to reduce the level of fees charged. He added that he had been approached by a number of people and professional firms asking for support or offering suggestions and initiatives, although he would not give further details. One of the greatest challenges, he said, would be to try to co-ordinate the large number of legal actions being taken in an effort to recover assets. He confirmed that he was also 'working on' the issue of gathering more financial information from countries with secretive banking laws. However, he said that he had seen 'no evidence of government maladministration'. The Maxwell fund trustees met for the first time last week and are likely to sign a completed trust deed in the next few days. Maxwell court order, Page 10</p>

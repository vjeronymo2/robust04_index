			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (9): Faster fax transmission helps cut the telephone bill - A few seconds makes all the difference One might wonder why it matters if a fax machine transmits a page of text in two seconds instead of 11. After all, the seven seconds makes little difference to most people. But fax machine vendors believe that speed is important, even if most of their customers do not realise it. Super-fast fax machines, transmitting a page of A4 in just that amount of time are expected next year from manufacturers such as NEC. With prices predicted to be about Pounds 3,000, they will be competitive against today's heavy-duty, top-of-the range machines. The real benefit lies in the potential for savings on telecommunications costs. The two-second transmission time means that three to five pages can be transmitted in the same time as one today. Most installed fax machines transmit at 9.6 kilobits per second, averaging 9-11 seconds per page. The fastest machines transmit at 14.4 kilobits per second, which average six seconds per page. Businesses which regularly use fax for long documents such as contracts, will notice a large reduction in the overall transmission times. If they are paying high international call charges, that reduction should translate into a lower telephone bill. The new machines will conform to the Group 3 technical standard for fax  - the most common type of fax machine used by businesses today. They will operate over ISDN lines at 64 kilobits per second. Similar transmission times are already possible on digital fax machines  - available from manufacturers such as Canon and Ricoh. Digital fax, also known as Group 4 fax, has been available for several years. But it has not proved popular, with less than 1,000 sales a year throughout Europe, according to figures from the industry consultancy BIS Strategic Decisions. The reason is not that users doubt the benefit of the higher speed. It has more to do with technical standards. Group 4 is incompatible with the analogue Group 3 faxes. This means that it can only transmit to another Group 4 machine. Usually, Group 4 machines are sold in pairs, for a specific purpose. For example, a law firm with offices in the US and UK. Ricoh's Chris Wills says the cost can be justified by comparing the cost of a 1.5-second transmission time with the Group 3 average of 11-15 seconds at international call rates. 'You can work out a payback in months rather than years,' Mr Wills explains. But BIS consultant Bruce Clements, believes the super-fast Group 3 machines will be a better option than Group 4 because they can talk to any Group 3 fax - they adjust the transmission speed where there is a slower fax at the other end. He points out that 1.9m fax machines were sold in western Europe in 1993. 'It is a question of the installed base. The whole point of fax is that you can talk to someone else,' said Mr Clements. But speed is not the only area of change for fax technology. Next year's fax machines will look different, and in many cases will do much more than faxing. Ricoh's IFS 66, which is now under development, will incorporate PC-fax and electronic mail facilities. It will also function as a printer and a document scanner. The new 'intelligent fax' will allow people to receive faxed information, add to it and then send it on to someone else as electronic mail. It will also hold individual phone books for people, which will be able to store regular fax destinations. Programming numbers into the machine will be made easier using the new touch screen controls - a graphic user interface with computer-style screen icons. To send to regular destinations, people will access their phone book, highlight the number and send. The product derives from a development led by software company Microsoft. Called Microsoft At Work, it aims to produce a common means for connecting disparate pieces of office equipment, including printers, scanners and copiers as well as fax machines. Today, all products are proprietary and linking them together is difficult. Other fax manufacturers working with Microsoft include NEC, Canon, and Oki. The At Work interface will mean that fax machines can be attached to local area networks, and use them to control incoming and outgoing communications. It should also be possible to use fax machines as linking equipment between two different local area networks such as Banyan Vines and Novell Netware. At Work products will become an alternative to the PC-fax and Lan-fax packages currently available, such as Delrina Winfax and Gamma Fax. Some industry observers question the need for At Work when these other products already exist. But At Work proponents claim that many businesses are familiar with fax, but have difficulty understanding computer communications. Providing them with a means of linking the fax machine to a computer network, is a more acceptable solution, they say. Paul Gibson, sales director at Oki Systems said 'techno-fear' stops many businesses from buying PC-fax products. The At Work products provide 'the best of both worlds. And you don't need to know how it works', he said. Oki has a forerunner product to the At Work concept, which integrates fax with a printing and copying functions under the control of a PC, for just below Pounds 3,000. Ricoh's Chris Jobling points out that the At Work concept more closely integrates the computer system with the fax, than the traditional PC-fax products. The At Work concept incorporates the stand-alone fax, with the PC-fax, the Email, the printer and the scanner, he says. To get the same functionality without it, would mean exiting one application and going into another. The operation would not be as smooth. NEC's forthcoming Nefax-MFD, also based on the At Work interface, will enable the fax machine to be used as an optical filing system, by attaching an optical disk drive. It will also have extra security via an electronic signature. The signature effectively seals a document so that it cannot be tampered with. It can also be used to generate an audit trail, showing where the fax had been and who had looked at it. The At Work project is also expected to design a standard screen interface for faxes and other equipment. Screen-based fax controls should mean that the machines are easier to use than today's unfriendly machines which provide no guidance. However, industry observers warn that At Work concept has yet to be proven. 'Just because you develop something, doesn't mean that it will be taken up,' said Lester Davis, of the British Facimile Industry Consultative Committee. There is further concern that the development is being led by a single software vendor. The fax industry traditionally has developed technical standards by consultation, and by mutual agreement on a common approach.</p>

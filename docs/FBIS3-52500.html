Answering questions by newsmen about the fighting in  Afghanistan, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said latest reports  say that the fighting is continuing between the forces of  General Rashid Dostam and those of Mr. Ahmad Shah Mas'ud. Asked  to comment on the reports that Pakistan has closed borders to  stop the supply of food and fuel, the spokesman said Pakistan  has reviewed the situation in the light of the fighting. He  said Pakistan does not want to help any party or a new flow of  refugees from across the border. He, however, said there is no  question of sealing the border, which is so long and difficult.</p>

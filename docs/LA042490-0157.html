			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY IS AWASH IN EMERGENCIES;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT: A SERIES OF CRISES HAS HAD OFFICIALS DECLARING STATES OF EMERGENCY  ONE RIGHT ON TOP OF ANOTHER. THREE WERE SIMULTANEOUSLY IN EFFECT LAST WEEK.  </P> <P> If it sometimes seems that Orange County is bouncing from one emergency to the  next, that's because it's true -- at least on paper.  </P> <P> The past six months have featured an unusual string of emergency declarations  by the county government, culminating in a brief moment last week when the  county had three such declarations in place at the same time. Even among  longtime county leaders, it was an occasion for pause.  </P> <P> "These things sure are coming fast," said Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who has  spent 16 years on the board and could not recall a previous time when the  county had three officially declared emergencies overlapping. "I don't think  there's much we can do about it. I mean, we can't stop emergencies from  happening," he said.  </P> <P> The recent flurry started last fall when the Mediterranean fruit fly came to  the county. Once the bug showed up in county fruit, the Board of Supervisors  quickly approved a state of emergency to protect the county against lawsuits  that might result from the aerial spraying of malathion.  </P> <P> Then, with that infestation still in full swing, an oil tanker ran over its own  anchor and leaked 394,000 gallons of Alaskan crude oil on the Orange County  shore.  </P> <P> And just as the oil spill emergency waned last week, a persistent measles  epidemic pushed health experts to take action. County Health Officer L. Rex  Ehling declared the emergency on the morning of April 16, about 24 hours before  supervisors voted to end the oil spill emergency.  </P> <P> "I've been with the county for about seven years, and I don't recall anything  like it," said Marilee Miller, senior emergency management coordinator for the  county. "It's pretty unusual, that's for sure."  </P> <P> Why the county finds itself in the midst of so many emergencies is a matter of  some disagreement, though all parties agree that the biggest reason is simply a  run of bad luck. In addition to the emergencies themselves, however, the  process for formally declaring them has become more widely used in recent  years, making them a more common occurrence than in the past.  </P> <P> "People are becoming more aware of what the emergency declaration provides,"  said Christine Boyd, manager of the county's Emergency Management Division.  "When you get people who are more aware of the process, you get more people  making use of it."  </P> <P> A litigation-prone public also makes county officials more wary about doing  anything that might increase the county's legal liability, Riley added, so the  thought of refusing a request for an emergency declaration rarely crosses the  supervisors' minds.  </P> <P> The formal emergency declaration provides several things to governments that  turn to it. First, as Riley noted, it limits liability for actions taken in  combatting an emergency: In the case of the Medfly, for instance, the county's  declaration makes it less likely to be sued successfully by residents  complaining of the effects of malathion, which is toxic to some animals but  which state experts say is safe to humans.  </P> <P> Second, the declaration marks the first step toward letting residents and  others get access to state and federal money available for combatting certain  problems. Without the measles emergency declaration, the county could not apply  for a state grant to fight the epidemic; if the supervisors vote today to  reaffirm the health officer's declaration, as they are expected to, the health  office plans to apply for $304,424 in aid.  </P> <P> Finally, a declaration gives the county extraordinary powers that it would not  be able to command under ordinary circumstances. During the oil spill, for  instance, declaring a state of emergency let county officials close otherwise  public beaches.  </P> <P> "They can do anything from imposing martial law to confiscating property,"  Miller said. "The whole gamut of activities that you need to deal with an  emergency becomes possible when you issue the declaration."  </P> <P> So far, Orange County has always stopped well short of imposing martial law,  and, for the most part, its states of emergency have been relatively  short-lived. Most last no more than a few weeks or months, and they have to be  reaffirmed every two weeks by the board, a cumbersome political process that  supervisors sometimes resent but are obliged to go through under state law.  </P> <P> The reaffirmations have become politically painful on the Medfly issue in  particular because supervisors dislike having to continually cast votes on  malathion, a decidedly controversial topic.  </P> <P> Supervisors, bureaucrats and residents agree, however, that the most annoying  thing about the emergencies is that you never know where or when the next one's  going to hit.  </P> <P> "It may seem like a lot right now, but there can always be more," said Al  Villere, senior planner with the Los Angeles branch of the state Office of  Emergency Services. "After all, all it takes is an earthquake, and they'd be  looking at four emergencies instead of three."  </P></p>

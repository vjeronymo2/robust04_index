			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Senior officials have hinted that containing  inflation to 10 percent this year will be almost impossible. In  a report to the National People's Congress (NPC) the State  Planning Commission said it anticipated an "extremely arduous"  battle against inflation.    The commission said prices had stayed high since the start  of  this year after a rebound of inflation in November and December.  Steadily increasing grain price rises were pushing inflation,  the commission said. The commission said Beijing also recently  drew from the grain reserve to provide relief to some disaster  and poverty-stricken regions. "Although grain prices have  receded from high levels it will be extremely difficult to keep  it to a lower level," the commission said. "It is anticipated  that grain prices across the country will stay at the present  high level or above." Prices of vegetables, meat, consumer  products such as shoes, home appliances and publications as well  as raw materials for agriculture including fertilisers had  continued to rise.    Looking ahead, it said high overall demand would continue to  put great pressure on prices. Excessive growth in fixed-assets  investment and money supply last year would continue to make an  impact. The commission predicted that the growth in consumption  would outstrip last year's increase. And last year's  deregulation of price controls over many basic goods would begin  to influence production costs. Moreover, the State Planning  Commission warned that there was no room for optimism for the  so-called "vegetable basket" project aimed at ensuring adequate  supply of non-staple food this year. Much farming land had been  taken over by urban development. "It will take time for the  various measures to boost the supply of grain, cotton, edible  oil and other non-staple food products. The supply of some  agricultural products will remain strained."    Outlining the anti-inflation measures this year, the  commission said the State Council would control the introduction  of price reforms. Price readjustments to help solve the  problem of unreasonably low prices for grain, cotton and  petroleum would remain the centre-piece of this year's reform  programme. The State Council would strictly supervise reform at  all levels to ensure increases imposed were not excessive. And  the commission said regional authorities should introduce the  reforms gradually and should fully consider how much the public  could bear and whether the reform would undermine stability.    "The prices of daily necessities should not be arbitrarily  raised," the commission said. "(Local Governments) can provide  some price subsidies whenever necessary." Local Government  should not lower the amount of money allocated to subsidising  price of goods, it said. [sentence as published]</p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Beijing hardens HK stance Hopes of even a partial settlement to Anglo-Chinese differences about Hong Kong's political development diminished at the weekend when Beijing hardened its position in the 16th round of bilateral talks, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong. It is understood that during the two days of negotiations in Beijing Chinese officials backed off from an offer to settle the so-called non-controversial aspects of Governor Chris Patten's plans for Hong Kong's democratic development. The two sides resolved, however, to hold a 17th round of talks in the Chinese capital, starting on Friday, on arrangements for the colony's 1994 and 1995 elections. This could be the last round if the UK stands by Mr Patten's legislative timetable calling for the introduction of his bill on December 8. The Foreign Office official leading the British team said another round of talks was consistent 'with our hope of a faster rhythm of discussions from now'.</p>

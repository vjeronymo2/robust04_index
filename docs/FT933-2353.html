			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Arts: A dramatic souffle - Alastair Macaulay is captivated by Tom Stoppard's 'Travesties' UPROARIOUS, virtuoso, heartless, Tom Stoppard's Travesties returns to the Royal Shakespeare Company only nine months before its 20th birthday. Brilliantly it combines its contrasting ingredients: it is a pyrotechnic absurdist souffle about an overlap of art, aesthetics, and politics; it is a bitter little joke about the derangements of memory; and it is a postmodern mix of song-and-dance, history, dialectic, farce, time-travelling, striptease, and Oscar Wilde pastiche. Following it closely, one clings on giddily, recklessly, helplessly. But this is delight at the expense of sympathy. Stand back, and it becomes easy to resent the play's darling cleverness. Travesties, you may recall, covers that time in 1916/17 when Lenin (at the point of departing for the Finland Station), Tristan Tzara (at the moment of proclaiming Dadaism), and James Joyce (in the thick of writing Ulysses) all lived in Zurich. The play sees them through the eyes of Henry Carr, a British consular official who was preoccupied by playing (for Joyce) Algernon in The Importance of Being Earnest. Carr was a callow young dandy then, but is old and doddery now. He is the play's protagonist; and it covers his hopeless efforts, then and now, to cope with these three historical figures. The intricacy of Stoppard's invention is astonishing. Likewise his irrepressible comic flair. There are new touches in Act Two, where Lenin (Carr's Lenin), in full rhetorical flood, now proclaims 'To lose one revolution looks like a misfortune; to lose two looks like carelessness', and Old Carr comments 'There was nothing wrong with Lenin except his politics.' The classic jokes - ''tween the before-the-war-to-end-all-wars years, and the-between-the-wars years', 'When I was at school . . . if you had a chit from Matron you were let off to spend the afternoon messing about in the Art Room. Labour or Art. And you've got a chit for life?' - remain. The sublime centrepiece of this new/old Travesties is Antony Sher as Carr. Though his is a virtuoso role - now old, now young; a self-preening dandy lost in the shoelaces of genius; a self-aggrandising dotard dazed in the pursuit of lost time - the impression Sher himself leaves is of transparency. He dissolves himself into the part. He places Carr high in the satirical gallery of silly Englishness. His very vowel sounds recall the most inspired flights of Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan, Beyond the Fringe, and subsequent Alan Bennett roles. His Algernon would honour the most perfect Importance cast. And the way he contrasts the thoughtless energy of youth with the muddled reflectiveness of age is the only poignant thing about the play. Adrian Noble's staging makes the play as lucid as can be. By means of amplification, musical accompaniment, and dance, it stylishly points out all the more deranged flights of Carr's reimaginings. David Westhead's natty Tristan Tzara is a match for Sher; Amanda Harris and Rebecca Saire are consummately polished as Cecily and Gwendolen; Geoffrey Freshwater and Darlene Johnson give excellently sober accounts of Lenin and Nadya. The tense Lloyd Hutchinson, however, lacks authority as James Joyce. The play requires two sets, the library and Carr's room: which Richard Hudson has designed in ideal contrast - the library a crazily vermilion corridor, the room a wide, pale, Dadist arc. I do not adore the cuckoo-clock that tells us and Carr when his mind is wandering; but, like everything else, its timing is perfect. In fact, Noble has the play running like a clock, oiled to perfection. Travesties reminds me of the German girl working in Foyles's English Literature department. A customer asked, 'Do you know where I can find Oscar Wilde?' The girl replied 'I think he's gone for his lunchbreak.' Does it matter that the play is heartless to the point of being pointless? It coruscates, exhilarates - and then, with the curtain calls, evaporates. In repertory at the Barbican</p>

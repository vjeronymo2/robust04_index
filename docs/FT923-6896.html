			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Amnesty criticises US over Haitian refugees AMNESTY International yesterday accused the US of flouting international law by its policy of sending home Haitian refugees without attempting to identify those at risk from human rights violations, writes Stephen Fidler, Latin America Editor. It said it was deeply disturbed by the policy, now being challenged before the US Supreme Court. 'International standards insist that no one at risk of human rights violations should be returned without a full examination of their case.' The US administration maintains that those fleeing Haiti are leaving for economic, rather than political, reasons and so are not entitled to asylum. The human rights organisation disputes this, saying tens of thousands of Haitians have been forced into hiding by military repression. It said other countries, such as France and Switzerland, had made it difficult for Haitians to request asylum. Amnesty added that, since an army coup last September, Haitians had been suffering repression reminiscent of the Duvalier dictatorships. It had received hundreds of reports of torture, including claims of detainees being beaten to death.</p>

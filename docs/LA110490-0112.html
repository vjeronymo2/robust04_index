			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> SEVERAL MEASURES WILL SHAPE COUNTY BUDGET FATE  </P> <P> Consider the best scenario: If voters are generous on Tuesday, the financially  strapped Los Angeles County budget could be awash in more than $1 billion in  new funds provided by a variety of propositions.  </P> <P> Mental health clinics threatened with closure could remain open. Jails would be  built and expanded. The county's ailing trauma care system would be shored up.  </P> <P> Now, consider the worst: Unless voters approve certain key tax increases and  bonds, the Board of Supervisors will be faced with cutting $57 million from  health and mental health programs -- only one week after the election.  </P> <P> Ten of the proposed bond measures and tax increases on the ballot, if approved,  would provide Los Angeles County with money enough to avert closing the clinics  and upgrade beaches, parks and cultural facilities, among other things, said  County Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon.  </P> <P> The failure of just three measures in particular would contribute to the county  budget's downward spiral and make tougher Dixon's job of running a huge  bureaucracy beset with growing demands and shrinking resources, he said.  </P> <P> Most critical are two measures: State Proposition 134, the so-called  "nickel-a-drink" tax, and Proposition A, a county-sponsored half-cent increase  in the local sales tax, Dixon said. They would provide the county with a  continuing source of money.  </P> <P> Not everyone in county government agrees that more money is needed. Addressing  his colleagues' assertions that the county's budget must grow, board Chairman  Pete Schabarum said, "Baloney."  </P> <P> "This board would be better served in reassessing our priorities rather than  seeking more revenues," Schabarum said, pointing out that the county's $10.3  billion budget is bigger than the budget of 42 states.  </P> <P> Months ago, the supervisors voted to continue funding for county health and  mental health programs even though Gov. George Deukmejian, facing a state  budget crisis, last summer slashed state funding for those programs. The  supervisors decided to postpone cuts until after the election in the hope that  voters would approve the alcohol-tax increase, which would provide Los Angeles  County with $180 million a year.  </P> <P> Under alcohol industry-supported Proposition 126, the county is projected to  receive $34 million a year. But Joel Bellman, a spokesman for Supervisor Ed  Edelman, said that Proposition 126 provides for the state to distribute the  money.  </P> <P> "If Proposition 126 passes, there is no guarantee that Los Angeles County will  get one penny," he said.  </P> <P> If Proposition 134 is rejected, the county will be forced to cut $40 million in  mental health programs, resulting in the closure of most of the 19 county-run  mental health clinics and forcing 22,000 of the 52,000 mostly low-income  patients who now receive mental health treatment to go without care, said  county mental health director Roberto Quiroz.  </P> <P> In neither alcohol tax measure is approved, the county will also cut $17  million in health services over and above the $7 million in reductions  implemented in September, officials said. If Proposition 126 passes, the county  could receive enough money to avert health cuts but not the mental health cuts.  </P> <P> The supervisors could cut funding in other areas. But they have been loathe to  allocate scarce resources to bail out programs such as mental health, which the  state requires but does not fully fund.  </P> <P> If approved, Proposition 134 would provide enough money to avert most of the  mental health cuts, plus help the county's trauma care network, increase  alcohol and drug education and treatment programs, expand the sheriff's  anti-drug programs in the schools and fund sobriety check points, said Dixon.  </P> <P> Opponents of Proposition 134 say it would lock into the state budget higher  levels of spending than the increases it would raise, perhaps leading to other  tax increases.  </P> <P> Dixon said the county's Proposition A is critical to prevent county-run jails  from draining funds from other programs. It would raise the sales tax half a  cent to generate $423 million a year for construction and operation of county  jails and juvenile detention facilities.  </P> <P> Jail costs, Dixon said, have soared from $76 million in 1980 to $348 million  this year.  </P> <P> Other measures that would add to the county budget, as well as give cities  money, include:  </P> <P> * Proposition B, the largest bond measure in county history. It would boost  property taxes by $817 million to pay for an array of recreational and cultural  projects. The county would receive $336 million, and the remainder would go to  cities and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy.  </P> <P> * Proposition C is a proposed half-cent increase in the local sales tax to fund  transit projects. It would raise $400 million annually, of which the  supervisors would receive about $10 million to improve bus service and  dial-a-ride service for the elderly and the handicapped. The bulk of the money  would be distributed by the county Transportation Commission.  </P> <P> * Proposition 129, sponsored by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, would allocate  $1.2 billion in state funds over an eight-year period for drug enforcement and  treatment. It also would authorize $740 million in bonds for building jails.  The Los Angeles County sheriff would receive $36 million a year, which could be  used to increase sheriff's patrols, according to a spokesman for the campaign.  The county also would receive $24 million a year for drug education and  treatment.  </P> <P> Dixon has opposed this measure, saying it would require "diversion of existing  state funds from other programs with unknown impact."  </P> <P> * Proposition 133, sponsored by Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, is a proposed  statewide half-cent sales tax increase to fund a four-year, $7.5-billion plan  to put more police on the streets, expand drug education in the schools and  provide treatment for drug users. If approved, the measure would provide the  Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department with $53 million a year. The county  also would receive $9.6 million a year for more prosecutors, $9.6 million a  year for more judges, $38.4 million a year for alcohol- and drug-abuse programs  and $31 million for jails.  </P> <P> * Proposition 147 is a $225-million state bond that would finance construction  of county jails and juvenile detention facilities. No specific amount is  earmarked for Los Angeles County, but Dixon projected that the county would  receive up to $80 million.  </P> <P> * Proposition 149 is a state park bond. Los Angeles County would receive $10  million.  </P> <P> * Proposition 150 is a state bond for courthouse construction. Los Angeles  County expects to receive $60 million to $80 million.  </P> <P> Even if all the spending measures pass, that still will not solve all of the  county's problems, Dixon said.  </P> <P> "Without the infusion of new money, we're going to see a continued  deterioration of our infrastructure and our services," Dixon said. "With it,  you'll see us hold our own, and maybe improve a little."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Captain 1st Class Olle Jonsson by Valeriy </F> Gromak; place and date not given: "High-Ranking Member of the  Swedish Military Considers that It Is Essential for Russia To  Have a Military Base in Kaliningrad Oblast"]    [Text] Captain 1st Class Olle Jonsson was appointed flag  captain of the Swedish Navy two weeks ago. He is 54 years old  and has spent 34 years in the Navy. He has served in various  posts on all types of ship apart from submarines. His last post  was head of a training center in Karlskrona.    Olle Jonsson gave an interview to our correspondent.    [Gromak] Mr. Jonsson, we are living at a time when new  relationships are being established between states. This leaves  its mark on the reform of the armed forces, including the navy.  Changes are likewise taking place in the Russian Navy. In  particular the fleet forces are being significantly reduced  today. I am interested in whether the Swedish Navy will suffer  cuts?    [Jonsson] The arms reduction process has also affected the  Swedish Navy with all its force. We have already been forced to  cut a proportion of officers this year. A series of small naval  warships which, given their length of service, could go on  serving for another 10 years, is being withdrawn from the combat  strength. Minelayers are also being withdrawn from the combat  strength due to the expense of servicing them.    [Gromak] What prospects do you see for further cooperation  between Russian and Swedish seamen?    [Jonsson] It is a very good thing that Russian and Swedish  ships are taking part in joint exercises for the second year  running. This allows us to get to know each other better. For  example, Russian military medics came on board and visited our  ship Goteborg when we put in together to the port of Kiel. They  discussed the generally understood topics of providing emergency  medical treatment at sea and of dealing with an emergency.    [Gromak] The Baltic Fleet is on the whole based in  Kaliningrad Oblast. During a recent visit to Kaliningrad,  Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas stated that the  large concentration of troops in the area seems to be an  anomaly. I am interested in hearing the opinion of a member of  the Swedish military on this matter.    [Jonsson] First, I have not heard about this statement by  the prime minister [as published]. Second, I will express my  personal opinion. I consider that it is essential for Russia to  have a military base in Kaliningrad Oblast, especially now that  you have to all intents and purposes left all your bases on the  Baltic Sea....</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The trilateral statement by the Ukrainian, U.S.,  and Russian presidents, adopted in Moscow, is Ukrainian  diplomacy's great achievement. This was announced at a briefing  at the Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Ministry on 18 January. Tamara  Kucherenko reports the details:    [Kucherenko] [passage omitted] So what does the trilateral  statement provide for? This is how Oleksandr Chalyy, head of  the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's agreements and law directorate,  replied to a question from journalists:    [Begin Chalyy recording] This document outlined and took up  political obligations in respect of (?the course) of  disarmament: Ukraine will only disarm when the last missile on  its territory is gone. Legally I cannot see how this process  can even begin in purely technical and formal terms on the  grounds of this statement alone.    The obligations in the statement are very general. If we  look at the package of documents relating to START, however, the  obligations there are very specific. In other words, you and we  all have to understand that if START I is not ratified, the  actual implementation of the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine  within the framework of some general obligations and of this  statement alone is impossible.    That is to say, the statement -- as I understood the  president's statement -- means that the issue of START and the  Lisbon protocol must by all means be conclusively settled at the  Supreme Council. Without this, the implementation of this  statement is impossible even from the standpoint that it is in  need of financing. And who keeps a hold on the budget of  Ukraine? It is the parliament that adopts the budget.    So this is a document on implementing the [Ukrainian Supreme  Council START I ratification] resolution, and I believe that  without the parliament assessing the relationship between the  resolution and the statement, we will not be able to ratify  START I. There is the desire of the executive power, which has  taken certain steps and is proposing today to (?view this in the  long term). But do these steps correspond with the general  reservations in the resolution? Perhaps the parliament will now  retract some reservations contained in this resolution. But  this is the parliament's right. [end recording]    [Kucherenko] Another question raised by journalists at the  briefing was that of compensation for the nuclear warheads  removed from Ukraine. Specifically, is the payment of $175  million not too little? Oleksandr Chalyy says:    [Begin Chalyy recording] The United States will work  together  with Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus to increase this  aid specifically allocated to nuclear disarmament. So one  should not understand 170 [as heard] as the final figure.  Moreover, I believe it can by no means be final. No, it is  not. This is how we understand it.

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Party upheaval led to 'responsible' approach WHAT is the intellectual pedigree for Mr John Smith's alternative budget? The shadow chancellor's modestly redistributive aspirations and his acceptance of fiscal fine-tuning would no doubt have been familiar to an earlier generation of Labour politicians. So, too, would the discipline of a semi-fixed exchange rate. But the 'responsible' approach to public spending is unquestionably something new. It would simply not have occurred to many Labour politicians in the 1970s that an election might be winnable on the basis of financing increased spending out of higher taxation, while maintaining a similar public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) to the one promised by the Tories. How did this upheaval in Labour economic thinking come about? The watershed almost certainly came with the cabinet debate over the terms of Britain's letter of intent to the International Monetary Fund in 1976. The terms of the debate were set, first, by the then prime minister, James Callaghan, in a speech to the Labour party conference, which was partly drafted by his son-in-law Peter Jay. Against the background of a spiralling PSBR, plummeting sterling, high unemployment and inflation that had hit 27 per cent at its peak, Callaghan declared: 'We used to think that you could spend your way out of a recession. . . .I tell you in all candour that that option no longer exists, and that in so far as it ever did exist, it only worked. . . .by injecting a bigger dose of inflation into the economy, followed by a higher level of unemployment. . . .That is the history of the last twenty years.' Callaghan's speech appeared to herald the end of the Keynesian orthodoxy. But orthodoxy was not to go without a fight. And it was the late Anthony Crosland, the great architect of the revisionist Labour dream of a social market economy, who emerged as the most articulate opponent of the 'deflationist' tendency. He told Callaghan that it was all a banker's ramp. The economy, he claimed, was in better shape than the Treasury was prepared to admit. As irony would have it, Crosland was more right about the the economy than the Treasury knew. Cash limits were making bigger inroads into the PSBR than officials recognised and the balance of payments deficit substantially reflected investment in North Sea oil fields that had yet to produce revenue. But as the former Trade Secretary Edmund Dell observes, in his memoir of the 1974-76 period, that was not the perception in the markets; and it was inconceivable that any version of Crosland's strategy would have won international support. It took some time for the free spending habit to extinguish itself. Indeed, the implausibility of Labour's spending plans was a contributory factor in its departure from office in 1979. Nor did Labour ever adopt the domestic version of monetarism that came and went under the Tories in the first half of the 1980s. But by the late 1980s, after a decade of Thatcherism, the boundaries of the economic debate had undeniably changed. And so had the people with most influence on Labour party policy. The star of the Oxbridge intellectuals who dominated in the 1960s and 1970s has waned. Meantime the Scottish ascendancy, represented by John Smith, Gordon Brown and Robin Cook, exerts a more powerful influence. If Tony Crosland were around today he might well have worried about the narrow ground over which John Smith is seeking to differentiate his party against the Tories. The case for and against devaluation in present circumstances might have been more noisily fought. But that does not mean that a fight will not come in the end under a Labour government or Labour-led coalition. The new responsibility means that Labour's more enticing promises have been made dependent on economic growth. Yet last week's cheerful growth forecasts from the Treasury have met with widespread scepticism. The worry today is about a 1930s-style debt deflation, in which adherence to the ERM prevents sufficiently large interest rate cuts to limit the damage. How will the Labour faithful respond if the promised expenditure seems to be endlessly deferred? How long before they recall that it was a Labour chancellor, Philip Snowden, who gave financial rectitude a bad name in the Slump?</p>

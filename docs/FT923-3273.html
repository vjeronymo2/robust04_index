			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Drink: A wee, fruity dram - The delights of the Jura distillery BREAKFAST at the Jura hotel is nothing special but I enjoyed the tea, which tasted of peat. While I ate, my mind turned to the nearby whiskies of Islay, in the Inner Hebrides. Often, these are characterised by their peaty flavour. Many assume - quite wrongly as it turns out - that the taste must be caused by the same water that was having so much effect on my tea. A pungent, peaty malt is something whisky drinkers love or loathe, and it is associated traditionally with Islay, Jura's neighbouring island across the sound to the south. Oddly enough, however, when you call for a dram at the hotel bar, or saunter across the narrow road which separates the hotel from the Invergordon distillery and sit down for a drink with Willie Tait, the manager, you discover that the Jura malt has no noticeable peaty taste. Peat flavour comes from the smoke drying of the malt. You have to want the whisky to taste of peat and Tait and Trevor Cowan, Invergordon's chief blender, are adamant they do not. Inside the largely modern distillery, Tait will point out his tall, copper stills. These, he tells you, are there to give elegance to the whisky. A squat, dumpy still would give more flavour, perhaps, but it might end up by making the whisky coarse. Opinions vary considerably on why the flavours of whiskies differ so greatly when the techniques and materials used to make them are so often the same. Many distillers will point to the stills as the origin of style; all of them stress the water, too. It is the presence of trace elements in the mountain streams which imparts the character to so many different malts. Something also must come from the sea. The Jura distillery is on the strand in Craighouse, the island's answer to a metropolis. Whisky loses about 2 per cent of its volume in cask each year. The air that replaces the liquid is impregnated with sea smells. There are even traces of iodine in the spring water which runs down into Craighouse from up near the Paps of Jura. But Jura is a well-mannered malt. The basic 10-year-old in its double bass-shaped bottle has just a touch of iodine overlaying its fruity, nutty character. A real treat is the 26-year-old, which is released under the Stillman's Dram label. Only 1,800 bottles were made of this delicate, almost floral whisky with a slight whiff of crystallised fruit on the nose. It is one over which you can pore for hours, exploring its varied nuances. Moreover, all the flavour is derived from the whisky: very little sherry wood is used here. Across the Jura sound, Bruichladdich also is part of the Invergordon group. From an architectural view, it is rather more exciting than Jura; its whitewashed distillery buildings are substantially as they were built in 1881. Another surprise is to find many of the old machines still in use. The malt continues to be ground in what looks like the original grist mill, while the distillery floors are supported by cast iron Doric columns and the wort is made in a mash tun dated 1881. Out in the courtyard, there are warehouses with earth floors. Their absorbency is meant to make a considerable difference to the ageing of the spirit. Bruichladdich is run by Ian Allen, a quiet man in comparison with the waspish Tait. As his distillery is situated on Islay, you might be excused for thinking it is part of the Laphroaig or Lagavulin school which have between 40-45 parts per million of peat. But you would be wrong: Invergordon maintains the same peating policy at Bruichladdich as it does at Jura: two parts per million. Proof of this came with the wonderful 21-year-old Bruichladdich, one of the fruitiest whiskies I have tasted. It is a flavour which deserves to be known better, being in stark contrast to the wilder character of the more widely-distributed Islay malts. Many would find the Bruichladdich style far more their cup of tea.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (f)(3)(xv) of the final rule requires that each machine operated near yarding systems (high lead and skyline) shall be equipped with sheds or roofs of sufficient strength to provide protection from breaking lines. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. There were no comments opposing this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Overhead Guards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At paragraph (f)(4) of the final rule, OSHA is specifying that each forklift truck used in logging operations be equipped with an overhead guard. The overhead guard must meet the requirements of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) B56.6&hyph;1987 (with addenda), ``Safety Standard for Rough Terrain Forklift Trucks.'' This incorporation by reference of ASME B56.6&hyph;1987, has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. The final rule has been revised to reflect this approval and provides the requisite information regarding access to the text of ASME B56.6&hyph;1987.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule, OSHA had included forklift trucks in the provisions requiring installation of ROPS and FOPS. However, commenters informed OSHA that the manufacture of forklift trucks used in rough terrain conditions such as the logging industry are covered by the ASME standard (Ex. 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;47, Tr. W1 224), and that forklift trucks are manufactured with overhead protection, rather than ROPS and FOPS (Ex. 5&hyph;47).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes that this overhead protection requirement is necessary and will adequately protect logging forklift operators from falling objects. Since the mast assembly of the forklift truck prevents it from rolling onto its top, ROPS protection is not necessary. When accidents do occur, forklift trucks are more likely to tip over on their sides. OSHA believes that, in the event of a tipover, the seat belt requirement contained in this standard will prevent operators from being pinned or crushed by the truck or overhead guard by safely restraining them within the cab.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In paragraph (f)(4) OSHA has not included a provision excepting fork lift trucks placed into service before the final rule from being equipped with overhead guards. The manufacturing requirements for rough terrain forklift trucks have been in place since 1978. Since the useful life of these machines is approximately 10 years, OSHA is confident that almost all forklift trucks currently used in the logging industry do contain overhead guards meeting the ASME standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Machine Access  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (f)(5) of the final rule specifies various requirements regarding machine access. Paragraph (f)(5)(i) of the final rule requires that machine access be provided for each machine when the operator or another employee must climb onto the machine to enter the cab or an operating element to perform maintenance. This provision also requires that the machine access system meet the requirement of the SAE J185 June 1988, standard on ``Recommended Practice for Access systems for Off-Road Machines.'' This incorporation by reference of SAE J185, June 1988, has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. The final rule has been revised to reflect this approval and provides the requisite information regarding access to the text of SAE J185, June 1988.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained machine access provisions. The proposed rule specified that steps, ladders, handhold, catwalks, or railings installed after the effective date of this standard comply with the SAE J185, June 1981, or be in accordance with a design by a professional engineer which offers equivalent employee protection. There were no comments opposing the proposed provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes this provision is necessary to prevent logging injuries due to slips and falls. The WIR survey indicated that these types of injuries accounted for almost one-fourth of all logging injuries reported, and that 28 percent of all injuries resulting from falls involved machines and vehicles (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA believes that compliance with the SAE standard, in conjunction with work practices and training, will prevent these types of accidents. OSHA notes that in the final rule, the reference to the SAE standard has been updated from the 1981 to the 1988 edition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

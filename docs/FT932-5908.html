			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Letter: Restoration of Lloyd's good name Sir, Lloyd's meeting at the Albert Hall on May 25 merely confirmed that they have a wonderfully simple method for survival: Fail to regulate the market so that, to date, 90 per cent of recent horrendous losses fall (via the LMX spiral etc) on only 30 per cent of Names. Make long overdue reforms so the lucky 70 per cent, and any corporate capital enticed in, can make profits of up to 25 per cent or more in future. Abandon the 30 per cent of innocent Names, who had trusted Lloyd's, to their fate, with only very modest offers of compensation. There is, however, a very simple solution to this gross inequity - do what any other organisation would do and, via bonds, borrow against future profits. The Business Plan has, however, turned this available option down, in spite of the benefits which would accrue: abandonment of litigation, retention of many Names and, most important of all, restoration of Lloyd's good name. Those who wish to profit from the future should not do so on the bodies of the terminally wounded. J Hamilton Stutt, Bergen, 12 Bingham Avenue, Poole, Dorset BH14 8NE</p>

			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> NEW SLAYING STIRS BOSTON FLAP  </P> <P> Mayor Raymond Flynn and the media questioned each other about why the fatal  stabbing of a white college student in a black neighborhood on Martin Luther  King Jr.'s birthday took until today to make front-page headlines.  </P> <P> Full accounts of the slaying were not published in Boston newspapers until this  morning because police -- already under fire for their handling of the racially  charged Carol Stuart murder investigation -- did not provide any details about  the victim's identity until early Tuesday.  </P> <P> Northeastern University sophomore Mark Belmore, 19, was returning from his  girlfriend's dormitory around 12:25 a.m. Monday when he was attacked and  stabbed 22 times barely a block from the campus, which borders the racially  tense Roxbury neighborhood. Investigators were searching for four black  teen-agers who witnesses said fled the scene.  </P></p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Sport: A 90-minute act of penitence - Soccer LAST week I did penance. I refereed a football match. It was cold and windy and it rained hard. I was sworn at and my decisions were disputed, often with good reason. Still, it could have been worse. It did not hail and no-one hit me. After the game most of the players came up and thanked me. There is no contradiction in this. They moaned at me non-stop for 90 minutes but they knew that without me the game could have been much worse (and, under the rules of the Southern Olympian League, it would not have counted.) That is why I refereed. Next time my team plays at home I shall be playing, one of my team-mates will referee and I will moan at him when opposing forwards beat our offside trap. The most depressing aspect of the refereeing was not the abuse, it was the inescapable reminder of my own fallibility and powerlessness. I started well enough. I blew my whistle hard and waved my arms emphatically for every decision. I was a man who had done this before, at least five times. I was in control and could afford to let the game flow. (Although, the SOL Minor division E is not known for dirty play). When things go well, says David Ellery, a top international referee, 'you are like a conductor of an orchestra just making things flow.' That was me. The Leonard Bernstein of Clitterhouse playing fields. But discordant notes began to creep in. I was 40 yards away, my lenses smeared with rain - refs can't win, either it's 'get glasses' or 'you blind four-eyed git' - when one team stopped obviously thinking the ball was out. The other team carried on. By the time I noticed, it was too late. Suddenly, the throw-in I missed had turned into a long ball upfield had turned into a cross into the penalty area had turned into a goal and oh-dear-me I'm pointing at the centre spot, filled with doubt and guilt. Worse, is the abuse of trust by the players. There are always some who try to undermine the referee's fragile self-confidence; claiming every throw-in, arguing with every free kick. I am here for their benefit trying to stay unnoticed while they play football. Suddenly they want to fight instead. Our creative midfield player is taking the law into his own feet and kicking and shoving his robust opposite number. It is difficult not to feel betrayed. In some respects I have it easy. Our solitary fan offers me his advice: 'Send him off.' At least I am not the object of relentless scrutiny from television cameras, synchronised abuse from 30,000 fans and sly comments at post-match press conferences by managers. Nick Hornby, author of Fever Pitch, a book about life as an Arsenal fan, includes among his conditions for a great game: 'Outrageously bad refereeing decisions: I prefer Arsenal to be the victim . . .Indignation is a crucial ingredient of the perfect footballing experience; I cannot therefore agree with match commentators who argue that the referee has had a good game if he isn't noticed. I prefer to notice them and howl at them and feel cheated by them.' Ellery says: 'The crowd doesn't bother me. It is easy to block out 40,000 people, by the time you hear their reaction you've given a decision.' But he accepts that the linesman, trapped on the touchline close to the crowd, takes more abuse, especially from determined hecklers, the strange cases who pepper every soccer crowd and use the match as 90 minutes of psychotherapy. At Arsenal two years ago, when Liverpool were the visitors, the opening kick-off was lofted down the wing. Two players collided and the ball bounced off the field. The linesman indicated a Liverpool throw. The match was five seconds old, the ball had been touched thrice and a smartly-dressed middle-aged man behind me was on his feet and bellowing. 'You got that (swear word) wrong you (swear word swear word) linesman. You'll feel a right (swear word) when you see that on the (swear word) video.' He sustained this rage without a break until half time, when I moved seats. At Luton last season, I watched a game against Everton, listening to a man in a suit berating officials. One stretch of dull play was interrupted by a throw to Luton, his team. This did not deter him. 'Linesman]' he shrieked. 'You're holding the flag in the wrong hand.' 'They pay their money,' says Ellery. 'If they want to spend Pounds 9 to scream at me that's fine.' But what about the players? If my division E amateurs give me such a hard time what about professionals whose livings depend on the result? 'Some games are continuous battles between players and yourself,' says Ellery. With players 'complaining about decisions. Plus there is the increasing over-reaction to foul tackles, the diving and the conning.' Even top referees are amateurs - although even at SOL level it is considered good manners for the home team to give them Pounds 20 or so in expenses. This gives professional footballers and managers another stick to beat them with. 'Bringing in professional referees would be one of the best things to happen in football,' said Joe Kinnear, the Wimbledon manager. 'They would appreciate how players feel and react if they worked at it seven days a week and their livelihoods depended on it.' So why do referees do it? Are they power mad? 'I would be worried by anyone who wanted to control 22 people,' said Ken Ridden, the Football Association's director of refereeing. Ellery renounced playing for refereeing at 13. 'I wasn't a gifted player. Because I was young I got some publicity. At university it provided a small source of income to an impoverished student. I enjoyed the physical involvement and set myself high targets.' He has met those targets, even if they are not measured in winners medals. 'I get a greater buzz because of the atmosphere, the crowd and the standard of play. You get a great buzz being on the field with great players in your own right.' Ellery referees 40 professional games a season. He is a house master at Harrow, the prestigous public school in north London. He says the refereeing gives him a break from the pressures of his job and his work keeps his mind off football. But he is incorrigible. On his free Saturdays he even referees school rugby games. Next time I'm down to referee at Clitterhouse I think I'll give him a call to see if he is free.</p>

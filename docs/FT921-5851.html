The trust, like many other recent offers, had a split capital structure, and was linked to a Personal Equity Plan (PEP). Income and capital gains made within a PEP are free of tax.

In addition 20.5m package units, 200,000 ordinary income shares and 45.8m zeroes have been placed with investors. PEP applications were received in respect of 18.1m package units and 38.6m ordinary income shares. Investors can place Pounds 6,000 into an investment trust new issue PEP in a tax year.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belem, 8 Jun (EFE) -- OAS Assistant Secretary  General Christopher Thomas stated here today that so far none of  the 34 OAS member countries have formally proposed Cuba's  readmission into the organization.    Thomas, who represents Trinidad and Tobago, said OAS  Secretary General Joao Baena Soares had proposed that Cuba's  return to the OAS be discussed. He noted, however, that so far  no country has made a formal request to this effect.    In accordance with OAS regulations, Thomas said, the  readmission of a member country into the organization must first  be formally proposed by one member country, and then consulted  with the other members attending the General Assembly.    Thomas is actively participating in the 24th OAS General  Assembly, which opened on 6 June in the Amazon city of Belem, in  northern Brazil. He said: "As Baena Soares said, circumstances  today are conducive to reexamining Cuba's readmission to the  OAS, but so far I am unaware of any country having made such a  proposal."    As assistant secretary general, Thomas will replace Baena  Soares -- whose term expires this month, after having served 10  years in office -- during the two-month period preceding the  installation of the new secretary general-elect, Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria.    Although some Latin American foreign ministers have timidly  defended Baena Soares's proposal that the OAS member countries  discuss the possibility of readmitting Cuba, only Argentina has  formally stated its position on the issue; that is, its  opposition to the proposal.    During a news conference Argentine OAS Ambassador Hernan  Patino Meyer said flatly: "The OAS consists of democratic  states, and as soon as Cuba takes steps toward its  democratization it will be possible to readmit it into the  organization."    Asked why Argentina and Brazil had, then, continued as OAS  member states under the military regimes, Patino Meyer said that  at that time the 1992 clause that provides for the separation  from the OAS of nondemocratic states had not yet been approved.  "Had I been the OAS secretary general at that time, I would  have expelled Argentina and Brazil from the organization,"  Patino Mayer said.    In his opening speech at the 24th OAS General Assembly,  Baena  Soares said: "I have been asking for some time whether it is  the right moment for the member countries to reexamine the  decision they made more than 30 years ago to suspend the Cuban  Government from OAS activities. The nineties are different from  the sixties."    Baena Soares' proposal was not immediately discussed by the  OAS foreign ministers because they were more interested in  discussing the Haitian crisis.    Although President Itamar Franco did not discuss the Cuban  issue in his speech at the OAS Assembly, he stated shortly  before returning to Brasilia that "the OAS must look at the  Cuban position."    Cuba was separated from the OAS in 1962, three years after  the victory of the Cuban Revolution led by President Fidel  Castro.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Danes in Dollars 91m rescue of Faeroe Islands bank THE DANISH government and the country's central bank have made DKr500m (Dollars 91.5m) available to the Faeroe Islands to rescue the islands' second biggest bank, Sjovinnubankin. The bank lost DKr415m in the first eight months of this year. Its share capital has been written down from DKr98m to DKr15m. A condition of the Danish rescue is that the islands' government presents a balanced budget for 1993 and prepares an economic stabilisation programme.</p>

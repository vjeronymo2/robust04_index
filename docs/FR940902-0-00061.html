			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Stand-in Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were a number of commenters who raised concerns and questions about &sect;627.480(g), which is now redesignated as paragraph (f). Several of these commenters were among those who commented on the definition of ``stand-in costs''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters indicated that stand-in costs should not have to be from the same cost category as the unallowable costs. Others pointed out the discrepancy between the definition and this regulation concerning the time when such costs were incurred. As a result, the last sentence of redesignated paragraph (f) is revised so that both it and the definition at &sect;626.5 state that the costs are to be from the same program year and that the substitution cannot result in a violation of the applicable cost limitations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters stated that ``stand-in costs'' should be allowed as substitutes regardless of the year or program/title that generates them. Such an interpretation runs counter to the intuitive concept of substituting to make whole the program that bore the cost of the misexpenditures. It is also contrary to ETA's interpretation of the General Accounting Office (GAO) Comptroller General decision which is the basis for the position on ``stand-in'' costs. The GAO-decision indicates that, when an audit reveals total allowable program costs which exceed the total amount authorized and paid with program funds, the resolving agency is obligated to accept those program costs as substitutes for disallowed costs. This is true because funds which become available due to the disallowance of costs should be treated as funds never expended by the auditee. Thus, the stand-in process constitutes a part of the totality of allowed and disallowed costs which occurs at the audit resolution stage before a collectible debt is established. The regulation, at &sect;627.480(f), is written to incorporate this concept of substitution for unallowable costs incurred by the auditee when the stand-in costs are reported (on the JTPA quarterly financial report form) and accounted for in the auditee's financial system, and are included within the scope of the auditee's audit report. Although potential stand-in costs are aggregated for reporting purposes only, this does not create a pool of stand-in costs at the higher tier when funds are merely passed through from one level to the next ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  State to SDA or other government entity). When ``stand-in'' costs are reported on the JTPA quarterly financial report and included within the scope of an entity's audit, they are readily identifiable and available to substitute for unallowable costs identified in the same report. This is important because by the time an audit report is finally resolved, the three-year availability period for the costs disallowed has often lapsed or is nearing its end. By having contemporaneous allowable JTPA costs incurred (but paid for with local resources) during the same period as the unallowable costs, there is no question about the propriety of the substitution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters raised questions concerning the requirement to report ``stand-in costs''. A few asked if they needed to be reported on the quarterly reports required by the Department. One asked if these costs could be reported after the fact only when needed, instead of being reported whether or not an SDA is permitted to and/or needs use them. Others suggested that they should be allowed even if not reported. One suggested that the requirement to report exceeded the statutory requirement that they be recorded. As explained above, it is ETA's position that ``stand-in costs'' must be subjected to audit coverage in order to be accepted. Imposing the requirement that the costs be reported and providing a line for these costs on the JTPA quarterly financial report(s), insures that these costs are included within the scope of the audit report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters suggested that the JTPA compliance supplements for OMB Circulars A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133 audits be revised to require that such audits include a separate schedule for ``stand-in costs'' and to specify the documentation requirements for same. The documentation requirements, including retention requirements, are the same as for all JTPA costs incurred. While the Department is not in a position to dictate whether A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133 audits include an additional schedule, when the compliance supplements are revised, it may be possible to suggest how ``stand-in costs'' should be treated in such audits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] It should be noted that on 15 June, Washington  asserted that a breach was observed within the Haitian military  institution which, according to the U.S. State Department, is a  consequence of the new sanctions against Haiti. In  Port-au-Prince, Cap-Haitian, and Jeremie, the opposite is being  demonstrated, with military parades and marches expressing  support for General Cedras and against a possible intervention  in Haiti.    On 15 June, Haitian Army battalions marched in  Port-au-Prince  and in other cities, including Jeremie and Cap-Haitian, with  fanfare and flags. The military are reportedly parading as a  show of support for the Army commander in chief. Civilians  accompanying the Army took the opportunity to chant  anti-Aristide slogans on 15 June in Port-au-Prince.    In Cap-Haitian, the military also marched through the city's  streets before placing a spray of flowers at the foot of the  statue honoring the heroes of Haitian independence. Our  correspondent, Joseph Claude Larouse, in Cap-Haitian filed a  report:    [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] In Cap-Haitian,  several hundred military soldiers from the Haitian Armed Forces  paraded this morning through the streets of the city. They  marched to Vertieres, where they placed a spray of flowers at  the monument to the heroes of the War of Independence. The  military advised that this gesture was to ask the heroes for the  strength and courage to resist to the end the difficult  situation the country is facing, especially the threat of  intervention. Colonel Josaphat stated, however, that it was just  the usual parade. This parade nonetheless was held after U.S.  officials made statements such as -- and I quote: We do not  exclude any possibilities, including armed military  intervention, to resolve the crisis in Haiti. Unquote.    Several grassroots organizations condemned those statements,  including the National Cooperative Action Movement and the  Committee for Patriotic Action and Citizens' Defense, rejecting  all plans for intervention in Haiti and asking that the  sanctions against the country be immediately lifted.    On the other hand, groups supporting President Aristide ask  that Gen. Raoul Cedras and Colonel Michel Francois resign from  the Army. They also ask for the immediate return of President  Aristide to stop the suffering of the people. Meanwhile, since  the new sanctions went into effect in the country, activities  have slowed to 80 percent in the Cap-Haitian harbor and airport.  For instance, flights between Cap-Haitian and Miami have been  reduced to one. The situation is almost the same in the harbor.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 7 KYODO -- "Karoshi" or death from  overwork is closely related to Japanese labor practices which  are characterized by conspicuously longer working hours than in  other industrial countries, government researchers reported  Friday [7 January]. This was the conclusion of a study on the  causes of "karoshi" carried out by the Economic Research  Institute of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA). The report is  expected to appear shortly in the agency's publication, THE  ANALYSIS OF ECONOMY.    According to the study, Japanese workers' average annual  working hours came to 2,124 hours in 1990, about 200 hours  longer than those in the United States and Britain, and 400 to  500 hours longer than workers in France and Germany.    Moreover, Japanese workers are believed to work an average  1.5 hours daily of so-called "service overtime" or unrecorded  and consequently unpaid overtime work. Most of the people whose  deaths are suspected to be caused by fatigue from overwork had  worked more than 3,000 hours a year, including overtime.    As of fiscal 1992, one in six Japanese male workers was  reported to be working more than 3,100 hours a year, and 46  percent of workers in a survey answered they are afraid that  they could die from overwork, the researchers said.    Meanwhile, they said, the quality of work has become  increasingly demanding and stressful due to new technologies  being introduced in rapid succession.    "Long, intensive work is a main factor causing an increasing  incidence of health-disorder complaints at Japan's  workplaces...and the most drastic case is karoshi," the report  says.    The researchers said people's sense of values, combined with  the long-standing labor practices in Japan, tends to aggravate  overwork. Individuals and corporations need to change their  attitudes toward work in order to prevent overwork, they said.    They suggest the government should extend workers' accident  compensation insurance to cover karoshi cases and introduce a  new premium calculation method for the insurance based on the  working hours at each workplace.    Higher premiums that employers would have to pay to the  government for longer working hours would eventually persuade  them to take some preventive measures to curb overwork, they  said.    The phenomenon of karoshi was reported as early as in 1960  when the nation's economy was expanding rapidly, and karoshi was  recognized widely as a serious problem in the mid-1970s.    Karoshi is defined as death due to accumulated fatigue from  overwork but it is not a recognized medical term and there are  no official statistics on it. Its most common manifestation is  in the form of sudden death from stroke or heart failure.    The researchers, however, said a group of lawyers has  recorded 1,416 cases of inquiries in four years from June 1988  from people looking for compensation for the deaths of their  relatives from suspected overwork.    According to the researchers, most people would feel tired  on  the day following one when they worked more than 10 hours, and  complaints of fatigue would sharply increase if they worked  overtime of more than 40 hours a month.</p>

			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / At last, a currency that is weaker than the rouble: Ukraine's 'coupon' has given Russian money something of a 'hard currency' status in Kiev GRESHAM'S Law - that bad money drives out good - is alive and well in Ukraine, with a variation. In the second-largest of the former Soviet republics of 52m people, what most would consider 'bad money', a depreciating, inconvertible Russian rouble, is sought after in preference to something even worse - the Ukrainian 'coupon'. When introduced last year, the coupon was a single-use token issued to Ukrainian workers as part of their wages to 'validate' their purchases of foodstuffs. Now Ukrainian workers have no choice. They are paid exclusively in coupons. Even withdrawals from their nominally rouble-denominated savings accounts are paid out in coupons. In theory the coupon is on a par with the rouble. In practice months of easy credit policy by a government under pressure from enterprises to issue cheap, unsecured credits has devalued the Ukrainian quasi-currency faster than the rouble. This has left the coupon distrusted and unwanted. The result is a thriving black market. Kreschatik, the tree-lined main thoroughfare of the capital, Kiev, is thronged with illegal but tolerated money-changers. They also congregate outside the the capital's largest food market, the pre-revolutionary, constructivist-style Bessarabia market, opposite the city's last remaining statue of Lenin. Alongside young hustlers in the latest teenage fashions stand portly housewives and ageing 'babushkas' with headscarves and shopping bags mutely holding wads of coupons in their outstretched hands. While the young hustlers are most interested in changing coupons for dollars or other hard currencies, the 'babushkas' have been allowed to share in the cheap end of the market - the coupons-for-roubles trade. Last week, as Russia's rouble-dollar rate declined in response to doubts over Moscow's ability to restrain a growing budget deficit, the Ukrainian coupon fell even more sharply. Traders outside the Bessarabia market offered 220 coupons for a dollar while the going market rate for roubles was only 155. Given this 30 per cent discount, shop girls, hotels, enterprises and anyone else with access to roubles, substitute coupons from their own pockets and sell the roubles at a profit. In this way a quasi-money designed to prevent Russian and other rouble holders from buying scarce goods in Ukraine has had the opposite effect. By changing their 'hard' roubles for coupons, Russians can effectively buy more cheaply than in Russia. The coupon is essentially the product of old communist thinking about money. Neither the rouble, or any other former communist currency was real money as understood in the west. 'I am totally opposed to the coupon idea and so are all my senior colleagues,' said Mr Alexander Sharov, the young vice chairman in charge of external policy at the Ukrainian National Bank, the central bank. 'But we only took over in April and nobody in the former team is willing to admit it was his idea. The coupon is an orphan.' The Ukrainian government is still committed to introducing its own national currency, the hryvnia, as a fully-fledged legal tender. But the date is unclear as experience with the coupon underlines the dangers of introducing a new currency without creating the sort of monetary, fiscal and institutional framework needed to ensure its value and acceptability. But the shortcomings of the coupon reflect the impotence of the central bank and other institutions such as the finance ministry and the privatisation ministry which have minimal political or institutional weight in post-independence Ukraine. Real power is still concentrated in a handful of former communist apparatchiks and party bosses around President Leonid Kravchuk and Mr Vitold Fokin the prime minister. After three centuries of subservience to Moscow, Ukraine is hard pressed to find the qualified and experienced personnel needed to administer a modern state. Parliament, for example, is also still dominated by former communists who see no apparent contradiction between voting for liberal foreign investment, privatisation and other market-orientated legislation and then voting large cash infusions to bankrupt state enterprises still run by their former communist managers. Similarly, the country's exiguous hard currency reserves are held by the recently formed Export-Import bank, which is essentially the successor to the Ukrainian branch of the Soviet Vneshekonombank. Critics of the bank, which maintains close working relations with Vneshekonombank in Moscow, say this arrangement ensures that control over hard currency usage remains with power brokers around the president and the prime minister. The handful of relatively inexperienced technocrats in the central bank and the ministry of finance appears to bear considerable responsibility but wields little power. They are acutely nervous about Russia's expected response to the eventual introduction of the hryvnia and the likely inflationary consequences of Russia's expected decision to charge world prices for oil and other exports to Ukraine in the autumn. The money changers on the Kreschatik may not be fully aware of the problems that lie ahead. But, in the mysterious way of free markets, the downward course of the coupon on Kiev's streets is probably an accurate barometer of difficult economic times ahead as Ukraine seeks to break out of its former colonial-style dependence on Moscow.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: United Breweries shares fall Shares of United Breweries dropped 2 1/2 p to 5p yesterday after the lossmaking regional brewer and pub operator said it was in breach of its banking covenants. The statement followed completion of a valuation of its public house estate, which showed a decline of some Pounds 7.2m and resulted in a sizeable diminution in net tangible assets and the elimination of distributable reserves. The USM-traded group said that talks with its bankers, first announced in February, were continuing. Directors said proposals for a 'major financial restructuring and acquisitions essential to improve critical mass,' probably including an equity fund raising exercise, would be presented to shareholders in approximately two months. In a move designed to 'strengthen management resources' Mr Stephen Lambert has been appointed as financial director. Mr Michael Roberts and Mr David Ford, the property director, have resigned from the board, although Mr Roberts will remain in a full-time capacity for the time being to assist in the restructuring programme.</p>

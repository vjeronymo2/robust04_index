			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Swiss Bank tops BZW's cash offer for scrip SWISS Bank Corporation has made a late intervention in BAT's enhanced scrip dividend scheme, by offering shareholders a higher cash alternative than BZW. Under the scheme, formulated by BZW, BAT shareholders were offered a scrip dividend of 33.9p per share, a 50 per cent premium to the cash dividend of 22.6p announced on March 10. BZW said that shareholders who wanted cash could take a cash alternative to the enhanced scrip of 32.2p, free of dealing costs - a 5 per cent discount to cover the joint broker's risk in underwriting the deal. Now SBC has said it will offer shareholders a cash alternative of 33.22p per scrip share, free of dealing costs - a discount of only 2 per cent. BAT said its attitude to the SBC offer was 'strictly neutral', adding: 'If they want to make an offer, that is their affair. Our only concern would be if any confusion arose so late in the timetable.' BAT shareholders must communicate their decision on the scrip by Tuesday, and last night nearly 38 per cent of the group's 150,000 shareholders had already made irrevocable elections. BZW claimed that SBC's late entry into the process and targeted method of advertising it - through an advertisement in today's Financial Times - suggested that SBC was more interested in 'creaming off' institutional investors, rather than small shareholders. SBC denied that, and said it had started looking at the scheme because a large number of its own clients were BAT shareholders. Depending on market reaction, to this offer, it would consider making similar offers for scrip of other companies which followed BAT's example. SBC discussed aspects of the scheme with the Stock Exchange, but its offer is conditional on approval being granted by the council of the exchange. The enhanced scrip offered by RTZ Corporation, the mining group which became the second company to follow BAT's example, was accepted by holders of 89 per cent of the group's shares - more than expected. Only 19 per cent of those took BZW's cash alternative.</p>

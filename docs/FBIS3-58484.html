Shevardnadze told a press conference arranged at the end of  his official visit to Turkey that the visit was the beginning of  a new stage for the two countries' relations.    He said the legal basis of the bilateral relations was  completed between Turkey and Georgia with the signature of  agreements adding that these two countries shared the same  opinion on regional issues.    He said a meeting with President Suleyman Demirel (whom he  called an "experienced statesman") was very beneficial.    Shevardnadze said Turkey and Georgia shared the views that  the problems should be solved in a peaceful way adding that the  same view was relevant for Abkhazia.    He said he hoped the UN- mediated talks in Geneva for the  solution of the Abkhazian problem would end positively.    Answering a question, Shevardnadze said "the biggest problem  is the return of the refugees. Some 250,000 Georgians have fled  from Abkhazia. They are left homeless, hungry. If their  security is achieved, peace can be possible with Abkhazia."    Asked if they wanted support from Turkey on the Abkhazia  problem, he said Turkey already joined in the problem.    Turkey earlier extended credit to Georgia and said Georgia's  territorial integrity should be preserved.    Shevardnadze said during the talks that Turkey and Georgia  discussed the improvement of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation  [BSEC] Project adding that the BSEC would contribute to the  peace, stability and economic development of the region being a  bridge between the European Union and the Commonwealth of  Independent States.    He said the BSEC should have a crisis-solving function  adding  that the issue will be discussed in a summit with the heads of  governments and heads of states in Tbilisi in May or June.    He said he invited Demirel, Premier Tansu Ciller and  Parliament Speaker Husamettin Cindoruk to Georgia.    Shevardnadze said they work on an "Asian-European corridor"  project including petroleum and natural gas pipelines, highways,  railways, telecommunication networks and airways that will pass  from Turkey and Georgia.    He said Georgia will cooperate with NATO on the "partnership  for peace" project and open a military representation in NATO's  center.</p>

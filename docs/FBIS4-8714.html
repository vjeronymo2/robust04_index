			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Pavol Kanis by Ivan Brozik; </F> place and date not given: "The Army Will Remain Above Party  Affairs"]    [Text] [Brozik] Following the 8 April talks with your  Polish counterpart, what do you see as the dominant feature of  relations?    [Kanis] There are two main areas of cooperation -- research  and cooperation in the production of weapons and arms systems,  and our moving closer toward NATO within the framework of the  Partnership for Peace project. After the demise of the Warsaw  Pact, its former member states spontaneously started to do  exactly the same things. The system of production sharing,  which made arms production cheaper and more efficient, fell  apart, and as a result, everything became more expensive. The  innovation of the T-72 tank is a case in point. All the former  Warsaw Pact states are working on it independently. Division of  labor is necessary to make the innovation of arms equipment  cheaper. We can cooperate with the Poles in many fields.    [Brozik] But cooperation will not remain bilateral or  confined to the framework of the former Warsaw Pact.    [Kanis] Our orientation toward transatlantic and West  European security structures is an exceptionally serious matter.  We are confronted by new realities. Partnership for Peace,  which is a framework project, should be given specific shape in  so-called presentation documents [prezentacne dokumenty]. This  requires an exchange of opinions within the framework of the  Visegrad Four [V-4] group, including about the division of tasks  within the framework of the project. Cooperation within the V-4  is connected with this. The Czech Republic and the Hungarian  Republic give preference to a race for NATO or European Union  membership. It is apparent that this pursues propaganda aims  without yielding any benefit for the aforementioned states.  First it is necessary to demonstrate the ability to form  integration relations among ourselves and only then is it  possible to consider integration into Western structures. The  Poles' idea of the V-4 is that of a grouping with common  intentions in terms of contents and time. The Polish view is  very sympathetic to us. It is the idea of a cart with four  wheels, one of which is Slovakia.    [Brozik] The post of defense minister should not be combined  with membership in any party. Have you not considered  suspending your membership in the Party of the Democratic Left  [SDL]?    [Kanis] I expected this question, but it is necessary to  view this matter realistically. I am not a soldier minister.  Hence, I do not have to meet the criteria that a soldier would  if he became minister. I am a civilian who has been nominated  by a "certain" party. Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys is  also a high level functionary of a political party. The same  goes for Lajos Fur in Hungary, who is even chairman of the  Hungarian Democratic Forum. A civilian minister must be  considered differently from a soldier minister. However, the  Army should self-evidently be above party affairs. This means  that one must not engage in any political activities on the  premises of Army barracks. A soldier can be politically engaged  when he is out of uniform. My membership or nonmembership [of  the SDL] depends on coalition agreements.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Nickel prices fell sharply on the LME, moving quickly through chart support points in the afternoon. Dealers said volume was not particularly large and the absence of the recent big buyer contributed to the retreat from Monday's six-month highs. Liquidation, commission house and stop-loss selling weighed on the market, with three-month prices hitting Dollars 7,950 a tonne at one stage. Aluminium staged a partial recovery in afternoon trading after earlier losses on liquidation and technical selling following the recent jump to a seven-month high of Dollars 1,340 a tonne for three-month metal. The market found good support below Dollars 1,300, dealers said. Expectations of a resumption in Russian exports soon and the delay in the scheduled closure of Italian smelter facilities has undermined fundamentals this week. New York sugar prices were sliding at midday in a correction to Tuesday's steep rise, which traders and analysts said was generally technical - although some cited news that only four of Russia's 95 sugar processing plants were operating because of a lack of raw sugar. Comex gold futures were firmer at midday on a belief that prices might be headed higher, analysts said. Comex silver prices had recouped earlier losses by midday. Compiled from Reuters</p>

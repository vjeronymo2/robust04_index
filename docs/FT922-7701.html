			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Motoring through France: Coping with the autoroute THE FIRST time my wife and I drove to the south of France we went in our VW Beetle. It took the best part of three days, with two overnight stops. If nearly three days seems a long time to get from Calais to Le Lavandou, remember that in the early 1960s there was virtually no autoroute in France. Most of the N-roads (routes nationales) had changed little since Napoleon had lined them with plane trees to shade marching troops from the sun. Stretches of cobblestones were still in place which is why French cars were noted for their soft seats and resilient suspensions. Driving through France on the autoroutes is now so easy - and even the cheapest family-type cars so good - that a determined driver can make the 700 miles (1125 kms) from Calais to the Mediterranean in a single day. But I would not recommend it. For a solo driver, more than 12 hours at the wheel almost non-stop has to be fatiguing. And for the unfortunte passengers, a feat of endurance. They are, after all, supposed to be on holiday, too. Before anyone reaches for pen or phone to tell me how they have driven from Calais to the Mediterranean in ten hours or less, I would say this. You may (like me) have got away with cruising naughtily at well over 100 mph (160 kph) on the autoroute in the past but you are unlikely be so lucky today. Enforcement of the 81 mph (130 kmh) limit that drops to 110 kmh or 68 mph in wet weather grows stricter by the month, as speeding Britons are finding to their considerable cost. Quite apart from the on-the-spot fine, remember that the delay while the police do the paperwork (and where was your grandmother born, monsieur?) will ruin your average speed anyway. So where to stop overnight? Assuming a mid-morning Dover-Calais crossing, Avallon is convenient. It is almost at half distance between Calais and, say, Marseille. Which hotel? As you will be spending your own money, not a company's, try the Relais Fleuri. Leave the A6 at Avallon, take the first right after the peage and in three minutes it is on your right. We discovered it about 15 years ago. Our usual Avallon hotel, the Chapeau Rouge - not expensive, even though the restaurant used to have one star in Michelin's Red Guide - had been going downhill. It was time for a change. Relais Fleuri, a simple motel with a restaurant in an old farmhouse, was cheap, comfortable and convenient. Now it is twice the size, no longer so cheap (about Pounds 75 for a double room and dinner) but still fair value. Be on the road by 9 am, do not linger over lunch and you should be in good time to dine anywhere between Narbonne in the west or Menton in the east. This assumes all goes well on the autoroute. It probably will if you avoid weekend travel, especially on the Paris-Lyon A6 and Lyon-Marseille A7, between mid-July and the end of August. They become so congested that rush hour travel on our own M25 London Orbital motorway seems quite tranquil by comparison. What about the dreaded Paris peripherique? It is often, but not always, a thrombotic ordeal. A north-south driver can dodge some of it by leaving the A6 just after Charles de Gaulle airport, taking the A3 and joining the peripherique at porte de Bagnolet. On a good day it is then only 15-20 minutes to porte d'Italie and the easily missed slip road for the southbound A6 to Lyon. If you have great confidence in your navigator, miss the perepherique altogether by going from the A3 to the A86 and then the N186 which connects with the A6 just north of Orly airport. Be sure to have a good map such as Michelin's spiral bound motoring atlas of France. I would not cross the Channel without mine - or its companion, the Red Guide to French hotels and restaurants. The good news is that from June 19 it will not even be necessary to take the busy A1 and A6 autoroute for most of a fast drive to the south. The long-awaited missing link in the A26 between Chalons and Troyes is due to open that day. This lightly used autoroute joins the A5 near Langres and continues south as the A31, by-passing Dijon and connecting with the A6 at Beaune. Think of it as a French equivalent of the M40 extension, which lets people like me reach Birmingham from south of the Thames without going near the M1. The 202 miles (325 kms) of the A26 from Chalons to Calais via Reims must be one of Europe's easiest drives. Returning from Geneva a couple of months ago there was so little traffic from Reims onward that I set the cruise control at 140 kph (86 mph) - just a wee bit over the limit  - and left it untouched for more than an hour. Try doing that on any British motorway. I have no favourite stopover in the Champagne country but recommend lunch or dinner at La Terasse in Epernay. It has just one knife and fork in Michelin but a three-course tourist menu of good quality is stylishly presented and costs little more than a decent pub lunch in Britain. Going to Epernay means leaving the autoroute but I reckon La Terasse is worth the detour. French motorways are really quite civilized even if driving behaviour on them is sometimes anything but. There are frequent stopping places with loos and picnic tables. At the big service areas you can eat pretty well. Britain's motorway restaurants lost their greasy spoon and chips-with-everything reputation long ago. But I still look forward to lunch at a l'Arche or a Court Paille cafeteria on the autoroute more than I would at a similar place on a British motorway. You pay a toll to use French motorways, except those around big cities like Paris. At the moment, driving a car from Calais to Marseille costs FFr284 (about Pounds 30) in tolls, more if you tow a caravan or trailer. A credit card like Visa or Access does nicely at the peages. But why rush down to the Mediterranean as quickly as possible? A more leisurely journey by N and D (departmental) roads will prove it really can be better to travel than to arrive. The main and minor roads of France carry much less traffic than their English (though perhaps not Welsh or Scottish) equivalents. Most of them are very well surfaced. Signposting is easy to follow once you get used to the idea that an arrow pointing to the left or right may actually mean you go straight on. You will save on tolls but spend a lot more time and, of course, more on overnight accommodation. But who knows? Thirty years from now you may remember every detail of your slow trip to the Mediterranean. The quick ones you may prefer to forget. If you are taking your car across the English Channel by the short sea route from Dover to Calais. P &amp; 0 and Sealink Stena have their best ships on the run - superferries almost as big as ocean-going liners. Use club class if you are not going to eat and consider a few pounds extra worth spending to be able to read the papers and drink coffee (both free) in the peace and quiet of a nicely furnished lounge. Hovercraft (from about 35 minutes) are faster but that is about the only thing in their favour.</p>

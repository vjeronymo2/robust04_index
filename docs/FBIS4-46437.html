			<p>BFN     [Text] The attacks on Kurdish businessmen began when they  were targeted in a statement by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller at  the Holiday Inn Hotel in Istanbul on 4 November 1993.    During her news conference at the Holiday Inn Hotel, Ciller  said: "Turkey is facing an expanding terrorist movement that has  assumed the nature of a militia movement. We know the names of  the businessmen and artists from whom PKK [Kurdish Workers  Party] levies money. We will call them to account."    Behcet Canturk, a Kurdish businessman from Lice, became the  first victim following Ciller's statement targeting Kurdish  businessmen. Two days after being abducted in Istanbul on 15  January 1994, Canturk and his driver Recep Kuzucu were found  dead in Sapanca district of Adapazari.    After Canturk's murder, Fevzi Aslan and his nephew Salih  Aslan, both businessmen from Lice, were abducted while visiting  a friend at Tokgoz Otomotiv firm in Istanbul's Sehremini  district by armed persons claiming to be policemen. Two days  later, Fevzi and Salih Aslan were found dead in Sapanca.    In statements made after these incidents, police officials  said that the same gun was used in the murders.    Following these counter-guerrilla attacks in Istanbul, Mecit  Baskin, who is from Yuksekova and who was the director of births  registry in Ankara's Altindag district and a relative of Savas  Buldan [another murdered Kurdish businessmen], was found  murdered near the beltway two days after being abducted. After  the murder of Baskin, Behcet Canturk's lawyer Yusuf Ziya Ekinci  was abducted in Ankara. Two days later he was found dead near  Ankara's beltway.    Also, Namik Erdogan, a Kurd from Hakkari who was deputy  chief  of the inspection department at the Health Ministry, was  abducted and murdered last month. Erdogan's body was found by a  fountain near Kiliclar on the Kirikkale-Ankara highway.</p>

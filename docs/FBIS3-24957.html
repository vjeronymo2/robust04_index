[Chissano] "That is a question that I have been asked  constantly, even before I went abroad last week. My answer has  always been that I believe that existing problems are of a  technical, rather than political, nature, so they should be easy  to settle and troop confinement should be over early enough for  us to hold elections by October, as scheduled."    Asked whether government troop confinement delays were not  caused by alleged disorganization, the Mozambican head of state  replied:    [Chissano] "No, that is no true, because troop confinement  does take place in good time when the right means are available  and the orders are given. We have not yet had any problem  caused by internal disorganization."    One journalist asked President Chissano to comment on the  Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader's remark that  Renamo figures, such as first Renamo President Andre  Matsangaissa, also be remembered on Heroes' Day on 3 February.    [Chissano] "Well, our country (?has to define) [words  indistinct] heroes must be recognized at the national level as  Mozambican heroes. Those whose names we mention are the more  representative, but that does not mean they include all  Mozambican heroes. Now, if Andre Matsangaissa had the makings  of a hero or not, that is for the Mozambican people to decide."</p>

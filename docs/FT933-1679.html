			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Morning after the night of the generals A RUSSIAN general who had been up all night in emergency meetings as his country's constitutional crisis unfolded still attended a pre-arranged meeting with a group of foreign journalists yesterday at the General Staff Academy in south-west Moscow. Colonel General Valery Mironov, deputy defence minister in charge of personnel and training, refused to take sides in the stand-off between President Boris Yeltsin and General Alexander Rutskoi. The parliament has also moved to try to oust Gen Mironov's boss, Gen Pavel Grachev, as head of the Defence Ministry. Gen Mironov insisted that the armed forces must stay out of the conflict. After Mr Yeltsin's announcement, he said he managed to contact almost all the commanders of Russia's military districts. 'I have the opinion that the majority of servicemen have stated that they are not going to intervene in these events,' he said. Top defence officials, in hastily called meetings, issued orders prohibiting agitation and political activity in military units, Gen Mironov added. His impression was that these orders had received 'very great support' in the 2m-strong armed forces. Earlier yesterday Gen Mironov and other senior officers listened politely to Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the British defence secretary, when he addressed military officers at the academy. But there were murmurs of disapproval among the senior officers as Mr Rifkind expressed forthright support for Mr Yeltsin. It was not clear, however, whether the disapproval was in response to interference by a foreigner or to Mr Rifkind's support for Mr Yeltsin. Mr Rifkind told the Russian top brass: 'The Russian people are clearly at a vital stage in the development of their democratic institutions. 'Mr Yeltsin's mandate for radical economic and political change has been regularly thwarted by institutions with fewer democratic credentials than his own.' Yesterday, military units were understood to have been placed on alert, with emphasis on guarding arms depots and nuclear sites. The latter move appeared to be largely designed to reassure foreign governments, which during the August 1991 coup attempt became extremely anxious about the command and control arrangements for nuclear weapons. Gen Mironov acknowledged that there were grievances within the armed forces, affected by a loss of prestige, staffing problems and tough economic conditions. He had himself told Mr Yeltsin of soldiers' complaints about pay. There had been delay in payment, especially to troops stationed in other former Soviet republics, and pay had failed to keep up with inflation. 'It is natural that young officers should have doubts about staying in the service,' he said. He did not rule out political agitation by 'certain groups of officers and individuals' - but he predicted that there would be no full-scale movement throughout the forces. 'I do not foresee any possibility of mass activity in the armed forces.' Gen Mironov said that despite the difficulties, Russia was still able to sustain its forces and to manage to restrain servicemen from active political involvement. The forces still maintained 'a certain combat capability', he said. Gen Mironov, 49, graduated from the academy in the same class as Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, former head of the forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States. For three years he was commander of a motor rifle division on active service in Afghanistan, an experience which he said had made him extremely wary of military interventionism. The academy, which is a grandiose octagonal structure, still stands as a symbol of Russian military power and confidence. Its 12 storeys are faced with white marble and its entrances decked with 25-foot mosaics depicting indomitable Soviet heroes. However, like Russia itself, this senior officers' school is nowadays less of a fortress, and the military establishment is gradually adapting to the new political realities.</p>

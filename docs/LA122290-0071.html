			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DOGS GET PERMANENT RIGHT TO RUN FREE IN  PARK  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council has done its bit to let Rover be Rover.  </P> <P> By a unanimous vote, the Council agreed Friday to designate four-acre Laurel  Canyon Park as a permanent haven where dogs may run free, exempt from the  city's leash law.  </P> <P> Since August, 1988, Laurel Canyon Park -- on the south side of Mulholland Drive  west of Laurel Canyon Boulevard -- has operated as an "experimental" leash-free  park for dogs, the only facility of its kind in Los Angeles. But the city has  also kept dog owners on tenterhooks by exempting the park area from the city's  leash laws only for six months at a time.  </P></p>

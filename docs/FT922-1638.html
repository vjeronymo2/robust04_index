			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Grindlays defends India action THE Reserve Bank of India has directed ANZ Grindlays, the Australian-owned bank, to make provision of Rs4.05bn (Dollars 144m) for losses incurred in the country's Rs30.8bn securities market scandal, writes RC Murthy in Bombay. The central bank rejected Grindlays' contention that it had done nothing wrong in crediting five cheques made out to the bank to the personal account of disgraced broker Harshad Mehta. In a statement to the reserve bank after meeting its deputy governor, Mr Bob Edgar, Grindlays manager in India, defended as 'normal practice' the crediting of cheques to Mr Mehta's account. The reserve bank stepped up pressure on Grindlays after the State Bank of India paid Rs7.07bn last Tuesday to the National Housing Bank for losses in similar transactions.</p>

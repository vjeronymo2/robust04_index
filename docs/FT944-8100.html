			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Enron in Yemen of talks on gas sector - Contracts &amp; ventures A delegation from Enron of the US is in Yemen to discuss investment in the gas sector, including a Pounds 2.5bn (Dollars 4.1bn) Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project. Enron had signed a memorandum of understanding with Yemen in December 1993 to exploit gas reserves estimated at between 20 and 30 trillion cubic feet in the Marib-Jawf area. But Hunt Oil, leading a consortium including Exxon and South Korea's Yukong, at the time said it had not agreed to any other company's involvement in the export of the gas it discovered in the Marib area. The issue was shelved during Yemen's two-month civil war, which ended on July 7 with the defeat of southern secessionists. Yemen's Supreme Economic Council, which gives final approval for investment projects, last week agreed to introduce new terms and conditions for gas contracts and told the oil ministry to re-evaluate bids from companies. The LNG project involves a main pipeline from the Marib area to either the Red Sea or the Arabian Sea as well as a pipeline from Safir in the Marib area to the capital Sanaa to meet local requirements. It also involves a liquefaction plant with an annual capacity of 5m tonnes of LNG and an export terminal.</p>

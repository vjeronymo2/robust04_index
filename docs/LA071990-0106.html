			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PADRES LOSE, PROVE ZIMMER TO BE ALL WET  </P> <P> Padre Manager Greg Riddoch leaned back in his office chair, looked at the  cluster of reporters in front of him and raised his hands in the air.  </P> <P> "Anyone got any suggestions?" he asked.  </P> <P> Silence.  </P> <P> Sorry, big guy, this baby's all yours.  </P> <P> The Padres, who only three months ago were virtually everyone's pick to win the  National League West, if not run away with the division, have become  everybody's favorite patsy.  </P> <P> It has been ugly enough as it is, and their losing streak has been downright  nasty, but Wednesday's 4-2 loss to the Chicago Cubs in front of 33,856 at  Wrigley Field turned into the ultimate embarrassment.  </P> <P> Cub Manager Don Zimmer was so fed up seeing his pitcher, Greg Maddux, go  without a victory that he publicly proclaimed before the game that he'd take a  swim in chilly Lake Michigan if Maddux beat the Padres to end a personal  13-game drought.  </P> <P> So, anyone have an extra pair of size-44 swim trunks lying around?  </P> <P> Zimmer, 5-feet-10, 205 pounds, appeared after the game wearing blue sunglasses,  an open life jacket and a buoy strapped around his legs.  </P> <P> "I didn't think anyone would take me seriously," he said. "I swim like a rock."  </P> <P> But just as Pittsburgh Pirate broadcaster Jim Rooker walked across the state of  Pennsylvania last year and Chicago White Sox broadcaster Tom Paciorek shaved  his head on TV after similar statements, don't be surprised if Zimmer is forced  to swim at least a few strokes toward the other side of the lake 60 miles away.  </P> <P> Maddux not only won his first game since May 5, but with the exception of Jack  Clark's homer, he allowed just three baserunners to even reach third during his  seven innings.  </P> <P> Not bad for a guy who was 0-8 with a 6.15 ERA in his past 13 starts and had not  won a game since the last time he faced in the Padres in Chicago.  </P> <P> "What a better team to do it than against us," said Padre starter Dennis  Rasmussen (7-7), the latest victim of their offensive ineptitude. "It isn't  like we're lighting the world on fire.  </P> <P> "Heck, and when we get down, it's like we lay down and die.  </P> <P> "We haven't smelled a rally since San Francisco a couple of months ago."  </P> <P> The Padres' losing ways have reached such epidemic proportions that they have  even gotten Riddoch thoroughly depressed after just a week on the job.  </P> <P> "And I'm an eternal optimist," Riddoch said.  </P> <P> The Padres (38-49) have lost 18 of their past 22 games and are now firmly  entrenched in their worst period of this length since Aug. 21-Sept. 16, 1974,  when they lost 21 of 25. And that was the year they finished at 60-102.  </P> <P> It's little wonder Riddoch already has lost five pounds in a week and was  asking reporters if he really looked like "death warmed over?"  </P> <P> "This is unbelievable isn't it?" said Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn. "Every  day, I come in here thinking that today's the day. That today we'll turn it  around. But we've said that for the last 20 days or so, and what have we won,  three games?"  </P> <P> The Padres, who are left fighting for their dignity instead of anyone in the  National League West race, have resorted to using the second half of the season  as a tryout camp, with third base the position with the "Help Wanted" sign.  </P> <P> After going through 11 third basemen since 1987, the Padres are begging for  someone to step forward and secure the position.  </P> <P> The latest experiment involves Eddie Williams, the 25-year-old San Diego native  who is with his fifth organization. They want to see if Williams can fill the  bill, then say goodby to Mike Pagliarulo, who's eligible for free agency.  </P> <P> Well, while the Padres might be excited about his offensive potential -- .277  (five for 18) with two homers and three RBIs his first four games -- his  defense leaves them wincing.  </P> <P> It was Williams who cost the Padres two runs and perhaps the game Wednesday  with his bases-loaded error in the fifth. Luis Salazar hit a slow chopper  toward the bag, and Williams had no trouble fielding the ball, but his throw to  Clark at first was about seven feet out of his reach, allowing two runs to  score.  </P> <P> There was another ball that probably should have also been fielded by Williams  in the second when Lloyd McClendon hit a sharp grounder toward third. But when  Williams tried to make the play, the ball stayed down and rolled into left  field, scoring a run. The official scorer originally ruled the play an error,  but minutes later changed it into hit.  </P> <P> "I don't want to bury the kid," Riddoch said. "Let's give him a chance and see  if he can play up here. We don't have a whole lot of time left to analyze our  situation, and we want to know by the end of the year whether he can play for  us or not."  </P> <P> Williams, who made 16 errors in 66 games for the White Sox in 1989,  understandably was a bit defensive when talking about his latest fielding  mishaps. Then again, he's quite used to being questioned about his glove.  </P> <P> "I can't worry about it, just because of my reputation," Williams said. "Every  day you step on the field, anybody can make an error. It just so happens that I  made an error today that probably cost us the game.  </P> <P> "If I made a great play every time, I wouldn't have been in the minor leagues,  now would I? If I didn't strike out, I probably would have been Mike Schmidt  overnight."  </P> <P> While Williams is playing, starting successive days against right-handed  pitching, Pagliarulo has been left sitting on the bench pondering his future.  Riddoch has told him that he wants to take a good look at Williams, but it  doesn't help Pagliarulo accept the benching any more easily.  </P> <P> "It's damn tough sitting on the bench," said Pagliarulo, 30. "I'd rather stay  home. I don't really understand it. I'm not a veteran. They haven't really seen  me play, either.  </P> <P> "I don't like it, but what am I going to do, picket? Hold a sign? I don't have  an alternative. But if you're a team player, you do what you're told and keep  your mouth shut, and that's what I'm trying to do right now."  </P> <P> Pagliarulo has started 54 games, batting .249 with three homers and 15 RBIs and  committing 10 errors. The Padres say his production is adequate, but they still  would like to see him with more power.  </P> <P> The Padres also are making it known that they believe Joe Carter belongs in  left field, not center. He likely will remain in left for most of the season,  Riddoch said, with Shawn Abner and Thomas Howard in center.  </P> <P> "I don't know what's more important right now," Riddoch said, "leaving the  veterans in there and winning games, or leave the young kids in and see what  they can do. I think the best thing for the organization is to find out whether  these kids can play or not, but I hate to sacrifice wins doing it, too.  </P> <P> "It's quite obvious we've got some problems right now, and I have to fight  through it. I'm the manager, and I feel responsible for it. Maybe I don't  deserve it, but I'll take the blame for what we're going through.  </P> <P> "I guess that's why I really don't have an appetite right now."  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Padre pitcher Mike Dunne, who was in a half-cast Wednesday after breaking his  right fibula Tuesday, showed reporters X-rays of the fractured bone. It was  shattered so severely, Dunne said, that doctors must X-ray the leg again next  week to determine if it must be re-broken and properly set. "But as bad as my  leg is broken," Dunne said, "my heart is broken worse." Dunne, who missed the  last month of the 1989 season with arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder,  said that he now will look into pitching winter ball in the off-season. "I  haven't talked to anybody about it yet," Dunne said, "but I've got to start  getting some innings in." . . . The Padres have yet to decide who to bring up  to replace Dunne but have narrowed their options to between pitcher John Davis  and utility infielder Joey Cora. . . . Whitey Wietelmann, the former longtime  Padre coach who still works in the organization, is planning to retire at the  end of the season.  </P> <P> PADRES AT A GLANCEScorecard  </P> <P> SECOND INNING  </P> <P> Padres -- Clark homered to left, his 13th.

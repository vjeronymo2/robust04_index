			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 19 Jun (PL) -- The Cuban Foreign Ministry  [Minrex] today reiterated that only through a firm position with  regard to the illegal occupation of diplomatic missions is it  possible to avoid having these actions repeated. Cuba also  confirmed that it will not grant anyone authorization to leave  the country if they have entered a diplomatic mission by force,  even if they subsequently leave the mission. No exceptions will  be made.    A Minrex statement made reference to these actions, which  first occurred on 28 May, by groups of people who entered the  Belgian ambassador's residence, the German Embassy, and the  Chilean Consulate in this capital.    Minrex indicated, as is known, that these actions are  promoted from abroad as political propaganda and that the people  involved in these actions are not subject to political  persecution in any way. They have been denied a visa to legally  travel by foreign countries. It adds that in the first two  cases, Cuba had reiterated its position of principle on the  illegality and the unacceptability of the practice of violating  the diplomatic mission's immunity as a way to emigrate to other  nations. It also points out, with regard to the Chilean  Consulate, that by-laws regarding representation are different  from those regarding diplomatic missions, therefore, no one can  seek to obtain "protection at that site."    Minrex recalled that the practice of entering diplomatic  missions or consulates in that manner, besides violating Cuban  laws, also violates the principles provided for in international  law and in these same type of agreements. It indicated that the  sole solution for the people who have committed the  abovementioned crime is to leave the occupied buildings  peacefully and return to their homes. No legal action will be  taken against them.    It signals that exoneration laws make reference to the  action  of illegally entering a site but do not, of course, include any  other type of crime committed previously or during the violent  entry into those sites.    Cuba assumes that position, the ministry states, to  demonstrate its goodwill to the governments involved and to ease  the way for the quickest solution to the problem, even though,  by committing those criminal actions, these persons are joining  the anti-Cuban campaign that is being promoted abroad and that  violates the nation's laws.    In its statement, Minrex points out that the diplomatic  missions, in turn, should take into account that the best  guarantee for their own immunity lies in respecting the laws in  force in the country to which they are accredited and that their  duties should be carried out within the framework of this ruling  and international law.    It concludes that the Vienna Agreement clearly indicates  that  diplomatic missions must respect the local laws and not meddle  in the nation's internal matters and that their sites should not  to be used in ways incompatible with their duties.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Bonds: French 20-year offering makes impressive debut CAISSE Autonome de Refinancement, the French government-owned agency, made an impressive debut in the Eurobond market yesterday, when its FFr2.5bn offering of 20-year bonds, the longest maturity tested in the sector, was heavily over-subscribed. The deal, arranged by Paribas, successfully tapped both domestic and international demand, in an area of the yield curve which had previously received little attention. Although the French government issues 30-year debt, outside the government bond market the longest duration available prior to the CAR deal was 15 years in the domestic market and 13 years in the Eurobond market. Dealers reported strong demand from both domestic and international institutional investors, particularly insurance companies, which like to match assets to long-dated liabilities. The deal had been marketed ahead of launch to international investors, many of whom were not familiar with the borrower. The CAR is owned by the Caisse des Depots et des Consignations (CDC), the French government-owned bank. CAR refinances loans, mainly government-guaranteed, granted by CDC for public housing projects. The deal was not swapped, since the borrower was keen to lock in fixed-rate funding. The size of the issue is likely to be increased in the future by fungible tranches. The yield curve in the French bond market is virtually flat from 10 to 30 years, but the long-dated paper commanded some rarity value, and the launch spread of 45 basis points above the 20-year French government bond yield was considered attractive. Although there is no paper of comparable maturity, debt issued by government-owned borrowers such as Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer Francais, the national railway and Electricite de France, the electricity utility, trades at 35 basis points to 40 basis points over the 10-year area of yield curve. The deal closed at 97.95 bid, above its fixed price reoffer of 97.75. In the sterling sector, the Republic of Finland added Pounds 150m of bonds to an existing Pounds 200m issue due 1998, which was quoted at a premium to its par value. The fixed re-offer price of 102 1/2 for the new bonds detered some investors, who do not like to buy bonds priced above par. Some dealers said it would have been preferable to add to a more recent Pounds 250m issue due 1997, which was trading below par and at a tighter spread. However, lead manager Baring Brothers said the 1997 issue, launched in February, was not sufficiently seasoned, adding that the spreads of both deals had been taken into account for the pricing of the new bonds, which yield 23 basis points more than the comparable gilt, and offer a pick-up over both outstanding deals. The deal, which was structured as a block trade, widened to 28 basis points when the gilts market rallied after the 25-year auction, but tightened when the gilts market fell.</p>

Shen Maocheng, vice-minister of the forestry, said that  China  has no plan to breed more bears and it will close those breeding  lots that do not meet minimum conditions.    At a press conference hosted by the Information Office under  the State Council, Shen said that though China is abundant in  bears, it has barred hunting bears since 1989, when the animal  came under national protection.    He said that most bears living in the country's feed lots  were captured before 1989. Since then, China has not approved  any hunting of wild bears.    Bear gut, obtained by killing a bear, is a traditional  Chinese medicine. To protect its bear resources, China began in  the 1980's to drain bile from breeding bears.    He said that draining a bear's bile in a breed lot saves 44  wild bears. If one bear's bile can be drained for five years,  that would save 220 wild bears.    He said that the technique is scientific. Moreover, it is  not only bearable, but also painless to the bear. And it  imposes no negative effects on the growth and reproduction of  the animal.    "The method not only protects the wild bear, but also  provides bile to meet the demands of the domestic market," he  said.    The method also complies with international norms on the  protection of wild animals, according to the official.</p>

The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> A.

Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Article 1, Section 3 of the NYSE Constitution states that the term ``member organization'' includes a ``member firm'' and ``member corporation.'' A ``member firm'' is defined as a partnership. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recently, the Exchange has received requests from several member organizations to permit them to reorganize as business trusts or limited liability companies. Neither of these organizational structures is currently specifically included in the definition of a member organization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment would enable the Exchange, in its discretion, and on such terms and conditions as the Exchange may prescribe, to approve business trusts, <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  limited liability companies, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  and other organizational structures as member organizations. However, any such entity would be required to have characteristics essentially similar to corporations or partnerships. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> The term ``business trust'' is generally used to describe a trust in which the managers are principals, and the shareholders are cestuis que trust. The essential attribute is that property is placed in the hands of trustees who manage and deal with it for the use and benefit of beneficiaries. Black's Law Dictionary  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 180 (5th ed. 1979). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A limited liability company (``LLC'') combines various characteristics of both corporations and partnerships. For example, an LLC is a non-corporate entity under which neither the owners nor those managing the business are personally liable for the entity's obligations, however, the LLC is treated as a pass-through entity for federal income tax purposes. See Robert R. Keating et al., The Limited Liability Company: A Study of the Emerging Entity, 47 Bus. Law. 378 (1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Noncorporate or partnership entities would have to be structured in such a format that would qualify as a broker or dealer registered with the Commission pursuant to the Act, since this is a prerequisite to becoming an Exchange member organization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NYSE staff would review each application on a case-by-case basis as it does with all member organization applicants. However, prior to approving any such organization for membership, the staff would have to be satisfied that: (1) the Exchange would legally have appropriate jurisdiction over such an entity; and (2) the permanency of the entity's capital is consistent with that required of other member organizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> PARADE PLANNERS BAR YOUNGEST MARCHERS  </P> <P> The thousands of spectators at today's annual Fourth of July parade can expect  a flashier and snappier event than in previous years, organizers say, but it  will also have a share of controversy.  </P> <P> For the first time in the parade's 68 years, for example, the parade will not  include young children marching up Main Street.  </P> <P> That change is part of organizers' efforts to sharpen and speed the parade. The  15-member parade executive board agreed this year to limit groups to 50  members, bar undecorated flatbed trucks and enforce for the first time a  longstanding rule that children younger than 8 not be allowed to march, Bill  Reed, city public information director, said.  </P> <P> Faced with a large number of applicants, the board -- accepting the advice of  its Lynwood-based event coordinator -- agreed to stiffen its entry standards,  Reed said.  </P> <P> Enough entry applications were received to put together a six-hour event, he  said, but the board pared the parade down to two hours.  </P> <P> Children of all ages will be allowed to ride on floats or other vehicles, but  the younger ones may not march, board chairwoman Donna Cross said.  </P> <P> Several groups of young children, including baton twirlers who have been a  parade mainstay in recent years, were turned away, she said.  </P> <P> Young marchers are mainly barred because "we don't want to have 3-, 4- and  5-year-old children walking two miles uphill in the hot sun," she said. "Last  year, we had irate mothers calling (after the event), saying why did we make  their child walk two miles in that hot sun. . . . My biggest concern is I want  to see the children protected."  </P> <P> Also, until last week it appeared that an Afghan rebel leader whom Rep. Dana  Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) invited to participate would be barred. Originally, city  officials had announced that Gen. Ramatullah Safi would not be allowed to ride  with Rohrabacher on a float because he might pose a security risk.  </P> <P> Police officials and some City Council members feared that Safi, a leading  member of one of seven groups fighting the communist government of Kabul, might  attract protesters opposed to him.  </P> <P> However, after police checked into Safi's background through the State  Department, the general, whom Rohrabacher met during a visit to Afghanistan  last year, was cleared to appear in the parade, Reed said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, two YMCA youth groups had accused parade organizers of blocking  their bid to participate in the parade, as they have done for the last several  years. But the leader of the YMCA Indian Guides and Indian Princesses backed  off after acknowledging that they had not provided proof of insurance for the  vehicle they had planned to use, as parade officials require, Reed said.  </P></p>

This is a last-ditch effort of the traitor to suppress and  stamp out with "government" power the people's struggle for an  end to the "civilian" fascist rule and thus prop up his power on  thin ice.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam is now much embarrassed by the  situation that has turned unfavourable to him.    The South Korean people are waging a relentless struggle  against the treacherous opening of rice market and for the  abolition of the fascist "National Security Law." The  opposition camp, too, is pointing an accusing finger at the  traitor.    At a time when the world public circles including the  Amnesty  International lifted up their voices condemning the fascist  repressive rule and human rights abuses in South Korea, even the  United States, his master, urged the abrogation of the notorious  "National Security Law," driving him into a sorry plight.    All this is a mortal blow and an ominous symptom for the  traitor.    His remarks whipping up fascist suppression are interpreted  as a product of consciousness of crisis in the position of a  fish out of water.</p>

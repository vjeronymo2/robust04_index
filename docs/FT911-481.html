			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Arts: The British Museum holds its breath .. - The runners for the top job at the BM THE CHOICE has been made; the successful candidate has been informed; and it only awaits the approval of the Prime Minister before the world knows the name of the holder of the most important job in the British museum world - the new director of the British Museum, who presides over a staff of 1,000, more than 7m artifacts, and a budget in excess of Pounds 30m. The abysmal salary for such responsibility, not much more than Pounds 50,000, shows the low regard in which the heritage is held in the UK, but the prestige and influence of the position are enormous. It earned the retiring incumbent, David Wilson, a knighthood and the respect of his profession. He will be a hard act to follow, one of the strongest upholders of the old fashioned virtues of scholarship and service to the public among museum directors. He progressed through the Museum, with archaeology and the Vikings his specialities, and he has strenuously opposed admission charges and the pressure to make museums amusement parks and profit centres. He did his bit chatting up sponsors, and the Museum has new galleries to prove it, but he was totally opposed to aiming at the lowest common denominator to boost admissions. There are eight known runners for his job and they present the Trustees with a straight choice between an insider and an outsider. Among the BM staff who are thought to have been interviewed are Jean Rankine, the deputy director; Ian Longwirth, Keeper of Pre-History and Roman British; and Jessica Rawson, 44, who runs the Oriental Antiquities department. There are no mavericks here. Under Thatcher the new directors of the leading galleries and museums tended to be young, energetic but not notably Thatcherite. Neil MacGregor at the National Gallery and Nick Serota at the Tate face renewals of their contracts but seem set to run their galleries in a sensible scholarly way for most of the next two decades. They are defenders of traditional values and opposed to admission charges. Elizabeth Esteve-Coll at the V&amp;A has most of the next ten years to prove that a museum can widen its popular appeal without sacrificing its standards - if she can put up with the backbiting. The outside candidates for the BM also include no Young Turks. The obvious front runner must be Alan Borg, 49, of the Imperial War Museum. He has introduced charges but has also expanded and revitalised the institution. He would be a safe choice, and did himself no harm by escorting John Major around his museum while the interviews were proceeding. Richard Marks, 45, has worked at the BM, made his name at the Burrell in Glasgow, but has not done much as director of the Brighton Museum. Robert Anderson, 46, of the Royal Museum of Scotland, is the dark horse, a low profile career museum man who gets things done with little ostentation. Another outsider is David Phillipson, who runs the museum of archaeology and anthropology at Cambridge. Sir David learned his archaeology at Cambridge. The joker in the pack is Jessica Rawson, who runs the oriental antiquities department of the BM. Sir David was a BM insider who rose to the top and the Museum likes to think itself impervious to outside political and economic pressures. If the Trustees think that with John Major as PM they can choose their own man they might go for the woman. If they want a sympathetic outsider they will go for Anderson. If they want the Establishment choice it will be Borg. But one other candidate was apparently interviewed despite denials - Timothy Clifford, 45, of the National Galleries of Scotland. Clifford has thoroughly enjoyed himself becoming more Scottish than the Scots, but he has cherished ambitions to run the BM since he was a humble assistant keeper there in the 1970s, and he has now given Edinburgh seven years. Clifford arouses strong emotions. He puts up backs but he gets things done, and there is little doubting his scholar's eye. If the Trustees want a re-charged BM he would be the man: but tradition suggests that they will go for a more cautious director. No one plays market forces better than Sir George Christie, the Glyndebourne supremo. He is building the first commercial opera house in the UK for almost 60 years (the last actually was Glyndebourne) by threatening to deprive businessmen of their tickets unless they pay for the Pounds 33m new auditorium, due to open on May 28th 1994. To stay a corporate friend companies have to pay up to Pounds 90,000. This enables them to buy 120 tickets a season (but no more than eight a night) for 20 years. No cheque, no guaranteed tickets. Most old friends have paid up and Sir George has raised Pounds 24m even before foreign companies are allowed to join the club. Now the offer you can't refuse has been applied to the 10,000 on the list to become individual friends of Glyndebourne. To continue as an opera lover in waiting you must pay Pounds 50. It's a hard nosed approach that has worked for other popular clubs, like MCC, and almost half the wannabees have forked out. Money apart, the extra 320 seats in the new theatre should reduce a membership wait which currently exceeds 15 years even though more tickets will be taken up by companies - and by the general public who, for the first time, will be guaranteed some seats each night, plus 40 standing places. The death of Graham Greene has profoundly changed the life of his nephew, Graham Greene. He was also in the books business as a publisher with Jonathan Cape, and to avoid any confusion was always known as Graham C. Greene. Now he has dropped the 'C'. At the same time he has added another job, as chairman of the Trustees of the Museums and Galleries Commission in succession to the ebullient Lord Morris. The loquacious Welshman raised the profile of the MGC several notches; Greene intends to continue the process.</p>

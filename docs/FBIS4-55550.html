			<p>BFN     [Text] If they come to power, the Socialists and the Free  Democrats will conduct a foreign policy which gives equal  priority to relations with the East and the West and with  Hungarians living beyond the country's borders. Laszlo Kovacs  and Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, foreign policy experts for the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ], respectively, have announced that Hungarian  foreign policy will change substantially both in its style and  methods.    The SZDSZ politician also said that with respect to  neighboring countries, they will present a pragmatic policy  which is adjusted to Hungary's dimensions and true significance.</p>

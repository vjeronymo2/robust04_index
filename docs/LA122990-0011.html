			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CALABASAS CITY BID LURES 13 CANDIDATES  </P> <P> If Calabasas voters approve incorporation as a city in a special election March  5, they will have their pick of 13 candidates for five seats on the new city  council.  </P> <P> The candidates, who had until Thursday night to file election papers, will be  on the same ballot with the cityhood proposal, the final step in a long effort  by activists in the community of 27,000 to take control of their own affairs  from the County Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> Most candidates polled Friday espoused the need for "sensible development" in  an area that has seen rapid growth over the past decade. The most pressing task  confronting a new city, most candidates agreed, will be initiating city  services and formulating a plan for environmentally sensitive development that  preserves open space.  </P> <P> An obstacle to cityhood was eliminated last week when developer Cal Johnson  abandoned his legal challenge to the incorporation. Johnson, who owns Freeway  Properties, filed suit against the Local Agency Formation Commission,  contending that the agency should have required an environmental impact report  before approving the proposed incorporation.  </P> <P> Johnson feared that several planned road extensions would be canceled by a new  city government, but dropped the suit when he was assured that the roads would  be completed.  </P> <P> The candidates include the following:  </P> <P> * Jack Bethel, 33, a commercial loan officer with Union Bank, moved to  Calabasas from Canoga Park three years ago, and since then has been president  of two homeowners associations and served on the executive board of the  cityhood committee for a year. Bethel, who has a degree in business  administration from USC, said he can help the city establish financial  responsibility.  </P> <P> * Writer Lesley Devine, 48, is involved in efforts to preserve Santa Monica Bay  and the Santa Monica Mountains. She has been a director of the Topanga-Las  Virgenes Resource Conservation District for a decade and served as its  president for five years. She has also been active in the cityhood movement for  more than a decade and served as president of the Greater Mulwood Homeowners  Assn.  </P> <P> * Peter Eason, 35, a special projects coordinator for California Federal Bank,  moved to Calabasas 1 1/2 years ago from Northridge, where he was president of  the Variel Homeowners Assn. Eason, who has a master's degree from USC in public  administration with an emphasis on environmental management, also has been  involved in the cityhood committee.  </P> <P> * Michael Fichera, a businessman and attorney, could not be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> * Karen Foley, 54, a real estate agent, wants to ensure sufficient parks and  recreational programs. Foley, who graduated from UCLA with a degree in  recreation, has worked in the Los Angeles and Culver City parks departments.  She also worked with Pierce College's Department of Community Services.  Currently president of a homeowners association, Foley has been active on the  Cityhood Study Committee since its inception five years ago.  </P> <P> * Ron Gold, a graduate of UCLA and Loyola Law School, served as deputy state  attorney general from 1972 to 1978. As a private attorney, Gold helped parents  win the right to send their children to school in neighborhoods where they work  instead of where they reside.  </P> <P> * Bob Hill, a stockbroker, has been president of the cityhood committee for  five years, and previously served as president of his homeowners association.  He could not be reached for comment Friday.  </P> <P> * Gary Klein, 43, a Los Angeles city planner, has lived in Calabasas for a  year. With a degree in urban planning from Cal State Northridge and 15 years of  planning experience, Klein said he could help the city write a strong general  plan that would effectively manage growth. He is treasurer of his homeowners  association.  </P> <P> * Jeffrey S. Kurtz, an attorney, was on vacation and could not be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> * Doris Laziolette said she has been "active in almost every community project  that has come along" in her 25 years in Calabasas, including school projects  and charitable groups. She has been president, secretary and treasurer of her  homeowners association and was involved in the cityhood movement for seven  years.  </P> <P> * Marvin Lopata, 49, an independent real estate appraiser who teaches real  estate appraising, worked on the cityhood campaign for five years, served as  president and vice president of his homeowners association and has been a  delegate to the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation. An 11-year Calabasas  resident, Lopata is also a member of a group of Conejo Valley residents  studying the area's long-term problems.  </P> <P> * Bill Melcher, an attorney, could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> * Dennis Washburn, 48, a senior account executive for a marketing and  advertising firm, has been active in the cityhood drive for more than a decade.  He has a degree in political science and international relations and served as  president of the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation for two terms and as  president of the Greater Mulwood Homeowners Assn. for seven years. He has been  a director of the Topanga-Las Virgenes Resource Conservation District since  1986.  </P></p>

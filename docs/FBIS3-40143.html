			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Yunling (3769 0061 0407): "November Worker </F> Increase Relatively Low"]    [Text] In line with deeper reform of the labor, personnel  and allocation systems, in November the numerical increase in  workers nationwide was relatively low while total wages rose  steadily and maintained a rather high increase.    According to statistics, at the end of November the number  of  workers nationwide was 147.72 million, up 180,000 people from  the end of October but still down 200,000 people from the end of  1992. Growth in the number of workers at state-owned economic  units and urban and rural collective economic units was slow  while growth in the number of workers at various other economic  units rose rather greatly. At the end of November the number of  workers in the last category was 3.36 million people, up 540,000  people over the end of 1992 and up 850,000 over the same period  in 1992. In state-owned economic units the number of workers was  108.84 million people, up 160,000 people over the end of October  and down 60,000 people over the end of 1992, or basically the  same as the end of October. In urban and rural collective  economic units, the number of workers was 35.52 million people,  down 690,000 people by the end of 1992, basically the same as  the end of October. Besides greater flexibility of worker use  in enterprises and ever stronger worker use mechanisms, the main  reason for the rather slow recovery growth in the number of  workers is the change which has occurred in people's choice of  occupations in line with the transition toward a socialist  market economy. There has been a non-stop increase in some  surplus or terminated workers or workers who are retained with  no salary who engage in indidivual operations or are reemployed  by private enterprises.  There is a steady increase in workers in the contract system  of state-owned economic units. At the end of November, the  number of such workers reached 22.31 million, up 1.72 million  people from the end of 1992. The number of fixed workers was 74  .07 million people, down 1.54 million people from the end of  1992. The number of temporary workers and those used outside  planning was 12.46 million people, down 240,000 people from the  end of 1992.    In November, workers nationwide were issued 40.02 billion  yuan in wages, up 7.8 billion yuan over the same period in 1992,  or up 24.2 percent. Of this figure, state-owned units accounted  for 31.3 billion yuan, up 6.0 billion yuan over the same period  in 1992, or up 23.6 percent. Urban and rural collective economic  units accounted for 7.18 billion yuan, up 1.1 billion yuan, or  up 17.9 percent. Various other economic units accounted for 1.54  billion yuan, up 750 million yuan, or nearly 100 percent.    Considering January to November as a whole, workers  nationwide were issued 395.5 billion yuan, up 70.92 billion yuan  over the same period in 1992, the highest point for accumulated  wage growth in 1993. Of this figure, state-owned units rose 21.9  percent, urban and rural collective economic units rose 15.1  percent, and various other economic units rose 73.5 percent.  Total wages continued to maintain a fairly high increase rate.  The main reasons for this are: one, in 1993 material price  inflation has been consistently rapid, accelerating wage  increase; two, there has been a turn for the better in  enterprise overall economic efficiency. Bonuses and subsidies  correspondingly rose substantially. According to statistics,  from January to November, as a whole nationwide workers were  issued 81.44 billion yuan in bonuses, up 34.5 percent over the  same period in 1992. State-owned units accounted for 67.07  billion yuan of this figure, up 17.34 billion yuan over the same  period in 1992, or up 35.1 percent. Allowances and subsidies  accounted for 94.07 billion yuan, up 20.57 billion yuan over the  same period in 1992, or up 28.0 percent.    Since 1993, worker wages nationwide have consistently  maintained a fairly high growth rate. In some areas the pace of  wage increases has consistently been lower than the national  average due to sliding enterprise economic efficiency.  Heilongjiang Province consistently has had China's lowest wage  increase level. According to reports, four large complete coal  mines, large-scale military industrial enterprises and forestry  industry enterprises in Heilongjiang defaulted on approximately  1.1 billion yuan in worker wages, seriously affecting workers'  security and stability. Therefore, further deepening reform,  accelerating the transformation of the operating mechanisms of  state-owned enterprises, especially large- and medium-sized  ones, will allow them to develop in a fair and rational market  competition environment in a healthy manner. This is the key to  fundamentally turning around the overly low growth in worker  wages at large- and medium-size enterprises.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy fall by United Biscuits UNITED Biscuits, which confirmed the sale of its Terry's chocolate making subsidiary to Kraft General Foods International, failed to follow the strong trend of the rest of the market because of disappointment that it had not been able to secure a higher price. The company said it was selling Terry's to the Philip Morris subsidiary for Pounds 220m, although a number of market watchers had predicted a figure around the Pounds 250m mark. The stock fell heavily, giving up 13 to 379p in trade of 4.1m. As it has outperformed the market by around 10 per cent over the past two weeks in anticipation of the sale, some of the day's selling was put down to simple profit-taking. Mr Carl Short at Nomura commented: 'It is a sensible deal given United Biscuits' desire to invest in other snacks and biscuit companies.' He was, however, among those who advised investors to take profits following the recent strength of the shares.</p>

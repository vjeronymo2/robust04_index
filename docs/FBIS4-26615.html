			<p>BFN     [Text] Changsha, June 21 (XINHUA) -- The foreign-funded  enterprises in central China's Hunan Province have increased in  number, scale and efficiency, according to a local senior  official.    Now the province has 2,499 foreign-funded enterprises, and  the actual use of foreign funds amounts to 1.793 billion U.S.  dollars, said Tao Na, director of the Provincial Committee of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.

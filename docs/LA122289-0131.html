			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMBAT IN PANAMA;  </P> <P> COUNTY LEADERS RUSH TO BACK THE INVASION OF PANAMA;  </P> <P> POLITICIANS: NO LOCALLY ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE CHALLENGED BUSH'S ACTION, THOUGH  THEY DIFFER ON HOW LONG TROOPS SHOULD STAY.  </P> <P> Orange County Congressman C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) didn't wait to  be asked by the media what he thought of the Panamanian invasion: He called  them.  </P> <P> The same was true for other elected officials who either transmitted their  reactions over facsimile machines or had media liaisons pitch their bosses'  reactions to newspapers, radio and TV, as the county's political figures  scrambled onto the patriotic bandwagon.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), known among his Sacramento  legislative colleagues as "Rambo," bypassed the media and went right to the  source: President Bush.  </P> <P> "I sent him a telegram," Ferguson said proudly. "I let him know I supported his  action."  </P> <P> Most elected officials in Orange County are Republican, and none has publicly  challenged Bush's action. Some, like Orange County Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates,  called on U.S. citizens to understand the difficulties that American soldiers  face as they try to find and arrest former Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel A.  Noriega.  </P> <P> "Citizens have to remember that when somebody here in the United States sells  dope in our neighborhoods, or to our kids, you don't know where they are or  where they live," Gates said. "It's a problem for law enforcement. It takes  time, and I'm confident the U.S. will find (Noriega). But the American people  should not look at that as an easy task."  </P> <P> Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez strongly endorsed the President's actions but said  he hopes that U.S. troops don't become involved in a long-term occupation of  Panama.  </P> <P> Many Orange County officials said the only thing standing in the way of a total  military success is the failure to capture Noriega.  </P> <P> "I'm just sorry we didn't get him yet," said Assemblywoman Doris Allen  (R-Cypress). "I think as long as Noriega is on the loose, he can rally  guerrilla warfare."  </P> <P> Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder: "There was no other course of action we could  have taken to protect the Americans in Panama, the Panama Canal and our  interests there from that bully Noriega. He pushed us into action. . . . If  Noriega is captured the President will be a hero."  </P> <P> Board of Supervisors Vice Chairman Don R. Roth said he regrets that the  military action began just before Christmas because he remembers how important  the holidays were during the 20 years he served in the Navy. "It's tough but it  has to be done. . . . When you are called to do it you do it."  </P> <P> Sheriff Gates said the U.S. troops are "heroes who should be treated like  heroes when they arrive home."  </P> <P> On the subject of Noriega's U.S. indictment for his alleged involvement in  international drug trading, Gates said, "I want to see a crooked Noriega in  jail where he belongs."  </P> <P> Ferguson, a former Marine Corps lieutenant colonel, is very public about having  fought in World War II, Korea and Vietnam.  </P> <P> "All the do-gooders say, 'Oh we assassinated somebody and we shouldn't have.  But public opinion in America will no longer allow this country to act on  behalf of its own self-interests," Ferguson said. "The president had to extend  diplomacy and that meant, in this case, force."  </P> <P> While there was support for Bush, elected officials differed on how long U.S.  troops should occupy the Panamanian capital. Vasquez said that "our presence  should be eliminated as quickly as possible after the new government is  operating."  </P> <P> Not everyone had Panama on their minds.  </P> <P> Kevin Parriott, an administrative assistant for Assemblyman John R. Lewis,  (R-Orange), said "no one" brought the subject up during an open house at Lewis'  office that attracted several hundred constituents Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Rose Ellen O'Connor contributed to this report.  </P></p>

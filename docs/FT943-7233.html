			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: Avesta Sheffield swings back to black Avesta Sheffield, the Swedish-British stainless steel maker, yesterday announced a swing to profits of SKr431m (Dollars 57.1m) after financial items in the first six months, from a loss of SKr21m in the same period last year. It said it expected a further increase in earnings in the second half. The result put the group firmly on a profits path for the first time since it was formed in late 1992 through a merger between Avesta and the stainless steel interests of British Steel. British Steel owns 40 per cent of the group. Avesta Sheffield attributed the turnround to rising demand in Europe, particularly for cold rolled steel plate, its main product, and the effects of internal savings and favourable currency movements. Sales rose 16 per cent to SKr8.3bn during the first half, compared with SKr7.14bn last year, and operating profits after depreciation jumped to SKr546m from SKr93m. 'The group result is influenced strongly by currency and price changes for stainless steel. With a continuation of current conditions, the result for the second half is expected to exceed the result for the first six months,' said Mr Per Molin, chief executive. Avesta said higher consumption and stock-building of cold rolled plate had shifted the balance between supply and demand in Europe. This had pushed up prices by 30 per cent compared with the end of last year, although only to the levels of mid-1993. Overall, the market had improved since the end of year, with European producers diverting sales to Europe from other markets to satisfy the demand surge. The company, which earlier this year raised more than SKr590m through a rights issue, plans to invest more than SKr1bn over the next three years. The board yesterday gave the go-ahead for a SKr250m investment, part of a SKr600m allocation approved in March.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Our daughter is bankrupt Three years ago, my husband and I made substantial interest-free loans to our daughter to set up a small retailing business which has, unfortunately, made an annual trading loss. Do you think we would have any chance of claiming these losses against any possible future gains? If your daughter is effectively bankrupt, you and your husband can each make a claim under section 253 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 for your respective irrecoverable loans. You must, of course, send your daughter formal demands for immediate repayment of the loans in part, if not in full. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

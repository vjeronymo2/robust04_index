			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> ART MARKET RISES, FALLS ON SELECTIVITY;  </P> <P> AUCTIONS: SALE PRICES WERE MIXED, WITH SOME PAINTINGS SELLING FAR BELOW  EXPECTATIONS.  </P> <P> Don't be fooled by an $82.5-million Van Gogh or a $78.1-million Renoir. The art  market isn't rising as fast as it was a couple of years ago. Or is it?  </P> <P> As a two-week round of contemporary, modern and Impressionist art auctions drew  to a close on Friday, results were sharply mixed.  </P> <P> The auctions had brought unprecedented prices -- $82.5 million for Vincent van  Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" and $78.1 million for Pierre Auguste Renoir's  "Au Moulin de la Galette," easily shattering the record set in 1987 for Van  Gogh's "Irises" -- but two of five major sales fell below the auction houses'  low estimates and about a third of the works failed to sell in three of these  highly publicized auctions. While the five big evening sales set 50 artists'  records, highly valued works by Clyfford Still and Willem de Kooning failed to  attract buyers.  </P> <P> After several years of rapid escalation, the auction scene cooled a bit last  November and controversy over Sotheby's highly leveraged sale of "Irises" to  Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond had led to charges that auction prices were  artificially inflated. Bond sold the painting to the J. Paul Getty Museum for  an undisclosed sum after his financial empire tumbled and he couldn't pay off  his $27-million loan from Sotheby's.  </P> <P> When the spring auctions opened last week, the settlement of the Bond affair  had cleared the air, but it was anybody's guess as to whether the market could  sustain another bullish season. At first the answer was no. Lackluster auctions  of contemporary art last week indicated that the market was leveling off -- if  not taking a nose dive -- after a period of runaway record prices.  </P> <P> This week when big-ticket auctions of Impressionist and modern art began,  Christie's spectacular $82.5-million sale of Van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr.  Gachet" didn't hide the fact that 24 of the 81 lots didn't sell and that 22  others brought less than their low estimates. Without "Dr. Gachet" and a Van  Gogh self-portrait that brought $26.4 million, the auction would have been  perceived as a disaster.  </P> <P> At Christie's Tuesday sale, Edouard Manet's "The Bench," estimated at $20  million to $25 million, sold for $16.5 million; and Piet Mondrian's "Tableau  Losangique II" ("Diamond-Shaped Painting II"), estimated at $12 million to $16  million, sold for $8.8 million.  </P> <P> The signals appeared to be clear: Unless they are dealing with unquestionably  great or popular works of art, sellers must lower their expectations and  auction houses must estimate prices more cautiously in the future.  </P> <P> But this consensus broke down on Wednesday and Thursday when Sotheby's held two  sales that lived up to the auction house's rosiest predictions, "Hey, this is  like the good old days," one collector said on Wednesday night, when works by  Kurt Schwitters routinely doubled presale valuations and collages by Enrico  Prampolini, a little known Italian artist, commanded up to eight times their  high estimates in an auction of the Lydia Winston Malbin collection of modern  art.  </P> <P> The Malbin auction totaled almost $75 million, just shy of Sotheby's most  optimistic estimate, and sold all but two of the 93 lots offered.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Sotheby's $78.1-million sale of "Au Moulin de la Galette" soared  above the pack of 70 works, but several highly valued items outstripped their  estimates. Among the successes was Wassily Kandinsky's "Fugue," which was  estimated at $10 million to $15 million and sold for $20.9 million The  $286-million auction upset the $270-million record for an Impressionist  auction, set last November at Sotheby's.  </P> <P> "The art market is very solid. We've been saying it and saying it and saying  it, but we keep reading other things in the press," said Sotheby's chairman  John L. Marion after the Thursday auction.  </P> <P> Officials of both Christie's and Sotheby's have consistently argued that the  market is robust, but last week they admitted that the market couldn't continue  its recent trajectory. A leveling-off period was welcome and "very healthy,"  they said.  </P> <P> What's going on here? Several things. One is what the auction houses call  "selectivity," meaning that buyers will pay almost anything for what they  really want, but they will no longer snatch up every third-rate Renoir that  goes on the block.  </P> <P> In the case of the Malbin sale, sophisticated collectors eagerly vied for  Italian Futurist works and other modern pieces that hadn't been on the market  for years and carried the cachet of Lydia Winston Malbin, a perspicacious  collector who was the daughter of architect Albert Kahn.  </P> <P> Another development is that the contemporary market, which has risen abruptly  over the last decade, seems due for a stronger correction than the better  established Impressionist and modern art market.  </P> <P> Christie's first contemporary art sale, in 1978, for example, brought $574,850  for 70 works. Exactly 10 years later, in May of 1988, Christie's auction of 63  contemporary lots totaled $19.8 million. The figures continued to rise: $37  million for 86 works in November, 1988, and $62 million for 93 works in  November, 1989.  </P> <P> But this month, when 26 contemporary works went unsold at Christie's, 51 lots  brought only $40 million, with several works selling below -- or at the low end  of -- their estimates. At Christie's May 7 sale, "1949-A No. 1" by Clyfford  Still, estimated at $3.5 million to $4.5 million, did not sell. Still's  "1955-D," estimated at $3 million to $5 million, sold for $1.1 million. Roy  Lichtenstein's "Kiss II," estimated at $5 million to $7 million, sold for $5.5  million.  </P> <P> Sotheby's contemporary sales took an even bigger plunge, from a total of $98  million for 68 works in November, 1989, to $56 million for 55 works this month.  At Sotheby's May 8 sale, Willem de Kooning's "Woman as Landscape," estimated at  $9 million to $12 million, did not sell. "Palisade," also by de Kooning,  estimated at $8 million to $10 million, sold for $7.15 million. Richard  Diebenkorn's "Girl and Striped Chair," estimated at $1.5 million to $2 million,  sold for $880,000.  </P> <P> Yet the average price for contemporary work in one of these big-ticket auctions  remains high, around $900,000.  </P> <P> Not as pricey as Impressionist and modern art, however. The average price of an  Impressionist or modern work at these New York auctions has escalated steadily  from around $1 million in 1988 to nearly $5 million.  </P> <P> MAJOR ART AUCTIONS  </P> <P>

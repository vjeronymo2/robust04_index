			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Closed skies EUROPE'S AIRLINE passengers are still suffering from high fares nearly a year after the European Community's open skies policy came into force. Competition has been slow to develop and, according to a report yesterday by the UK's Civil Aviation Authority, there is little prospect of improvement. Part of the explanation is that the middle of a deep recession is not the best time to raise funds to develop competitive services. But the main problem is the entrenched position of Europe's flag-carriers. About 95 per cent of international scheduled routes within the EC are served by monopolies or duopolies but only 26 by three or more carriers. Where two flag-carriers operate, the prospects of competition are slim. Established players, which have lived for decades in a culture of state-sponsored collusion, have little incentive to start price wars. But where three players operate, the dynamics are more promising, the CAA report shows. The most significant price cuts this year have occurred on routes where British Midland has started to run services. The snag is that it is still hard for third operators to enter the market because most of the Community's busiest airports are congested, with scarce take-off and landing slots already allocated to flag-carriers. Matters are made worse by governments' habit of subsidising their airlines, which means potential rivals are not competing on a level playing field. The ideal solution would be to increase the supply of slots by building more airports or runways and to ban state aid. But such radical actions are unfortunately not practical politics. The French government's recent u-turn over plans to restructure loss-making Air France shows the difficulties of curbing state aid. Equally, building new airports runs smack into environmental lobbies. The CAA's answer is to put forward proposals which go some way towards creating the conditions for effective competition but also stand a chance of being politically acceptable. It wants the Commission to insist that state aid is linked to plans to cut costs sharply so that further hand-outs are not needed and that subsidies are not used by airlines to buy market share through the purchase of smaller competitors. The CAA also argues that slots should be freed up for use by those airlines which are most likely to challenge the established order. Here its approach is incremental, relying on distributing any new slots that become available rather than confiscating existing slots from flag-carriers. Yet it is still more radical than the Commission's current policy. Passengers may feel that the CAA's proposals do not go far enough. But vested interests are so powerful that it will not be easy for even these modest ideas to win acceptance. If passengers want more, they will have to make their voices heard loud and clear.</p>

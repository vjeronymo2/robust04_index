			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Clouds over the Clinton plan President Bill Clinton's economic plan got off to a wonderful start. At last, it was said, somebody is facing up to the US's long-term economic problems; somebody is treating the electorate like adults. Since those heady days in February, support has melted away. Today, Mr Clinton is facing vociferous congressional opposition, not just from die-hard conservative Republicans but from moderate Democrats such as Senator David Boren of Oklahoma, the kind of person whose support ought to be automatic. 'If this president were to get his wish of passing this budget . . . it would be the surest formula for the destruction of the Democratic party and any chance he has for reelection,' Mr Boren told the Washington Post last week. He had just unveiled an alternative budget plan co-sponsored by two leading Republican senators. As Mr Boren represents an energy-producing state and is proposing, among other changes, the abolition of the planned energy tax, the White House tried to dismiss his challenge as mere special-interest pleading. But the heart of his objection is that the Clinton deficit-reduction plan relies too heavily on tax increases and not enough on spending restraint. Spending 'cuts' represent only about a third of the net deficit reduction proposed by the White House. Mr Boren is demanding that each dollar in new taxes should instead be accompanied by at least Dollars 2 in spending cuts, thus effectively reversing Mr Clinton's priorities. He would more than make up the revenue lost in scrapping the energy levy by imposing tougher curbs on 'entitlement' spending, such as federal health programmes. The Boren amendment is not reckoned to have any chance of passing in the Senate. But the doubts he raises about the balance between new taxes and spending cuts are shared by many moderate and conservative Democrats, and by nearly all Republicans. Even if the beleaguered Clinton plan survives a vote by the full House of Representatives next week, it will face an uphill battle in the Senate. Since Democrats have only a 11-to-9 majority on the crucial Senate finance committee, a single defection by Mr Boren or one of his colleagues could threaten the legislation. Polls suggest that Americans accept the need for the modest deficit reduction proposed in the Clinton plan, which would stabilise the structural budget deficit (the deficit adjusted for the economic cycle) at about 3 per cent of gross domestic product. But with the economic recovery still perceived as fragile, there is great unhappiness about the reliance placed on new taxes. The energy tax is unpopular but economically defensible. But it seems perverse to be calling for a steep increase in the top marginal income tax rate from 31 per cent to more than 40 per cent (before allowing for state taxes of 6 to 9 per cent). Businessmen are also worried about a higher corporate tax rate and the prospect of new payroll taxes to pay for what promises to be an expensive reform of the healthcare system. Mr Clinton's plan is meeting stiff opposition because there is nothing in it that seems likely to stimulate growth or entrepreneurship immediately. The White House says this is the fault of Senate Republicans, who killed the Dollars 16bn short-term fiscal stimulus planned for this year, and Democrats such as Mr Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House ways and means committee, who axed the proposed new investment tax credits. But neither of these proposals was sound. It made no sense to begin a programme of deficit reduction by raising the deficit. Investment tax credits, meanwhile, merely represented the reintroduction of fiscal loopholes that Mr Rostenkowski's committee had sweated blood to eliminate in 1986. What Mr Clinton needed was a deficit reduction programme that preserved or, better still, enhanced existing incentives for work, saving and investment. This was perfectly possible. Mr Clinton did not need to raise marginal tax rates on anybody; he could have raised huge sums by restricting concessions such as mortgage interest relief (available on loans up to Dollars 1m) and by taxing fringe benefits including generous corporate health plans. If he still needed revenue he could have proposed a broad value-added tax at a rate of under 10 per cent. At minimal cost, he could have bought many Republican votes by indexing the capital gains tax for inflation. The present 28 per cent rate on nominal gains is high by international standards and may be impeding entrepreneurial activity. Why were none of these economically rational options considered? The answer is simple. Mr Clinton believes higher public investment is necessary to raise productivity growth. And he wants to reverse what he regards as the unfair tax policies of the Reagan/Bush years. The plan has to be top-heavy with new taxes because 'cuts' in old spending programmes are largely offset by new spending in areas such as education, infrastructure and technology. It has to raise top rates on the rich so as to be seen as fair. In reality, the share of federal taxes paid by the wealthy rose in the 1980s while US manufacturing productivity growth outpaced that of rivals such as Japan and Germany. In a parliamentary democracy, Mr Clinton's plan would be invulnerable; that it is not is part of the strength of the US system.</p>

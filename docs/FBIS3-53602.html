The lengthy talks between Clinton and al-Asad -- that were  held in two sessions, first accompanied by senior political  delegations of both countries, and then on private and personal  basis -- were in fact preliminary discussions for bringing  closer the views of the two countries on issues such as the  crisis in the Middle East, the plans and efforts for a deal, and  expansion of bilateral relations.    Many political observers believe that no great deal should  be  expected from yesterday's meeting between the leaders of  Washington and Damascus, and without doubt, if they had reached  unexpected results in the talks -- the prospects of which are  not strong -- it would not be possible to announce the results  in the short term, and this would need at least several months.    Basically, evaluation of talks held behind closed doors are  made on the basis of official and open remarks of the  participants usually made for the press, but these will  definitely fail to present a full image of the secret  discussions.    In a joint news conference at the end of their meeting,  Clinton and al-Asad emphasized the need for a brave peace in the  Middle East region, but also acknowledged the existence of  differences of views and interpretations.    The Syrian president said: We want a true peace that would  live, guarantee the interests of all sides, and re-acknowledge  the rights of everyone.    Hafiz al-Asad also said the return of the Israeli-occupied  Golan Heights to Syria was not sufficient for a comprehensive  peace, and emphasized that according to historic facts,  individual peace and minor solutions cannot establish true peace  for the region.    In his turn, the American President referred to the key  Syrian role in establishing a deal in the region.    The repeat of the Syrian stance by its president, and  following his meeting with the American President, indicates  that not only fundamental hurdles have not been removed on the  path of a deal in the Middle East crisis, but also the meeting  has not had an extraordinary achievement for American Middle  East efforts.    The only practical achievement of the meeting-for-a-deal  between Clinton and al-Asad was the resumption of talks in  Washington, which itself resembles a thin thread that neither  America nor Israel wish to break, and which Syria prefers to  hold on to rather than hold individual talks with Israel.    In reality, the main hurdles in the Middle East region exist  manifestly, and historic experience proves that until the real  hurdles are not removed peace will not return to the region and  signing of the so-called peace agreements cannot have a  fundamental effect.    The signing of a peace accord between Egypt and Israel in  Camp David 16 years ago and the signing of the Gaza-Eriha  autonomy agreement in Washington four months ago have failed to  bring the Middle East crisis to an end or to stop the regional  wars that are related to this crisis.    The signing of these agreements have, in fact, led to the  fall of elements such as Saddat and 'Arafat and their followers  without allowing American and Israelis to achieve their aims.    The signatories of peace agreements with Israel not only  failed to bring legitimacy for the usurping Zionist regime but  lost their own popular, political, and practical legitimacy and  intensified their own crisis.    In other words, although they held a superficial concern for  confronting Israel until a deal was made, after signing [the  peace agreements] they were confronted with a domestic crisis  and had no opportunity to continue their rule.    It is not possible to solve the Middle East crisis on paper  and this will not come about through a deal with the Zionist  regime.    Those concerned about the historic Middle East and  Palestinian struggle should concentrate on the destruction of  the Zionist regime and the correction of the region's  geo-politics.    In short, and finally, it is possible to say that the most  important and practical achievements of the Geneva meeting were  in the possible expansion of relations between Syria and  America, rather than a fundamental change in the regional  process.    This is so, despite the fact that America and Israel will  try  to exploit the meeting for their own particular ends.</p>

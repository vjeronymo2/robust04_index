In mid-June, the emperor and the empress are expected to  travel to the U.S., where they will visit eastern, southern and  western cities. They also plan to make a stopover in Hawaii  during the journey, official sources said.    Preparations are also under way for their trip to Britain  and  France in autumn, the sources said.    It will be the first time that a Japanese emperor will make  more than one overseas trip in a year, they said.    A visit to the Middle East by Crown Prince Naruhito and his  wife, Princess Masako, is also being considered, the first  overseas trip by the couple since they got married last June,  the sources said.    Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko spends [as received] the  New Year's Day at a newly constructed residence within the  Imperial Palace compound in central Tokyo.    On the opening of the New Year, the emperor said in a  statement that he hopes disaster-stricken people will be able to  stand firmly on their feet as quickly as possible, saying that  the past year was full of numerous sufferings.    "It is highly regrettable that throughout the world many  people are still victims of local conflicts," Emperor Akihito  said in the statement. "On the other hand, it is gratifying to  note signs of movement in the right direction, as in the case of  Cambodia."    An unusually cool summer hit the already harsh economic  environment and more than 400 people died or went missing in an  earthquake and cloudbursts in Japan.    On the quake-battered Okushiri Island in Hokkaido, Emperor  Akihito said in one of his waka [Japanese-style poem], "I am  sorrowful, to see the smoke wreaths rising, from things burning  out,    There along the island shore, all strewn with broken  houses."    In February, the emperor and the empress will visit Iwo Jima  and the Ogasawara islands, where the fiercest fighting in World  War II took place. The imperial couple will make the visit to  the islets in the Pacific Ocean, far south of Tokyo, to mark the  25th anniversary of their return by the United States in 1969,  Imperial Household Agency officials said.    Empress Michiko expressed her joy in her waka at her eldest  son's marriage to Masako Owada, a former career diplomat.    "Hand in hand, may you climb together,    The mountain, which, now green with foliage, must be  garmented in serene beauty," her waka said.    Empress Michiko, who collapsed on her 59th birthday last  October 20 and suffered speech impairment, has partially  recovered her ability to speak, and her condition is slowly  getting better, doctors said.</p>

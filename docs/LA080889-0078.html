			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHEVARDNADZE SAYS IRAN SUPPORTS TALKS TO END AFGHAN CONFLICT  </P> <P> Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said Monday that Iran is showing  a new realism in its attitude toward the Afghan conflict, and he expressed hope  that Pakistan will join negotiations for a settlement.  </P> <P> He told the Afghan news agency Bakhtar that Iran, which like Pakistan has  provided bases for thousands of Muslim rebels, has adopted a "wholly positive  attitude" on the problem of Afghanistan.  </P> <P> "Iran is calling for broad internal Afghan dialogue, the aim of which is to  create a representative government reflecting the whole political spectrum of  Afghanistan," he said.  </P> <P> Last week, Shevardnadze held talks in Tehran with Iranian President Hashemi  Rafsanjani, after which both men said their positions on Afghanistan had grown  closer.  </P> <P> The text of the interview with Bakhtar was distributed by the Soviet Foreign  Ministry as Shevardnadze flew home from a 24-hour visit to Kabul, where he held  talks with Afghan President Najibullah.  </P> <P> Rebel rockets pounded Kabul again Monday, killing at least 10 people and  wounding nearly 40. More than 40 rockets fell, some landing on a fruit market  and others on the city's leading hotel, the Continental, briefly setting it  ablaze but causing no casualties.  </P></p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Scantronic and Menvier-Swain terminate bid talks A dispute over a confidentiality agreement resulted in the termination of discussions between Scantronic Holdings and Menvier-Swain, a potential buyer, Scantronic announced yesterday. The shares fell 2p to 17 1/2 p, against a high for the year of 90p. Mr Chris Brookes, chief executive of Scantronic, the security components company, said: 'They refused to sign a confidentiality agreement which they were involved in negotiating.' Scantronic had asked for such an agreement before disclosing financial information to Menvier-Swain. Mr Carl Hadley, finance director at Menvier-Swain, the emergency lighting and alarms manufacturer, said that it had no comment to make on the discussions. He said that the company was yet to decide whether to proceed with plans to bid for Scantronic. On October 27, Menvier-Swain announced that it might make an offer for Scantronic, after it had analysed the company's financial position. At the same time it increased its stake to 4.49 per cent. Scantronic has appeared vulnerable to a takeover bid in the last year. In the six months to September 30, it incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.4m against a profit of Pounds 1.4m. Acquisitions have resulted in net debts rising from Pounds 3.5m in March 1993 to Pounds 10m at present. In June Mr Ray Dias, the then finance director, left after the board said that he had failed to alert it to the impact of increased borrowing and difficult trading conditions. Silvermines, the Dublin-based electrical services and property group, is also thought to be a potential bidder.</p>

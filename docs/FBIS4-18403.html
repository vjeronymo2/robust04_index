			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Axel Hofmann and Guenter Stauch: "Clearing the </F> Way for It To Be Shot Down"]    [Text] A fighter becomes the one being hunted. The  multinational combat fighter, the Eurofighter 2000, is fighting  on all fronts. So long as the high-tech plane, which is coveted  by the military, did not manage to get off the ground, the  project was criticized by both opponents and supporters. The  latter targeted the billion-mark project because any delay makes  the fighter more expensive and thus even more problematic in  public.    Hardly had the new bearer of hope completed its first  flights  over Manching in Bavaria, when the jet flew into even worse  turbulence. For the opposition the first flight, which was two  years late, was the starting signal to shoot the plane down.    Just one day later Walter Kolbow, defense policy spokesman  of  the Social Democratic Party [SPD] Bundestag group, called for  the attack.    Surprised by the press release from Deutsche Aerospace  (Dasa)  about the successful first flight, the German participant in the  project declared stubbornly: An SPD-led Federal Government will  do without a new fighter plane. "A plane that costs 100 million  German marks [DM] apiece does not fit into the financial policy  landscape." Furthermore, it has not yet been proven that a new  combat fighter is needed in the first place.    Suddenly the Free Democratic Party [FDP] Bundestag group  also  got a bellyache in view of the plane's steep climb into the  white-blue [Bavarian] sky, after the FDP defense politicians had  long remained silent about the Eurofighter; the party leaders  were worried about relations in the coalition. FDP Defense  Policy Spokesman Juergen Koppelin was the first to break cover  and note critically that more partners should have been sought  for the four-nation project (Germany, Britain, Italy, and Spain)  to keep down costs.    Koppelin also attacked the Defense Ministry. At the  beginning of the week he complained it was outrageous that "at  no time did the Defense Ministry know exactly what the new  fighter would cost."    The FDP politician is also angry about project partner Dasa:  "Regarding the cost estimates, I get the feeling that we are  being cheated by Dasa." Koppelin's suggestion for a solution:  "We should have a group of neutral experts look into the costs."    Such tones are nothing new for Dasa; the reaction is  therefore rather calm. Spokesman Eckehart Rotter, responsible  for aviation projects, said: "We do not participate in  political discussions. The decisions about financing must be  made by the Defense Ministry."    The Ottobrunn headquarters has long adapted itself to  political interference. Thus, the modern plane flew into heavy  turbulence even during the stage of development, which almost  caused it to crash. In the spring of 1992 Defense Minister  Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union), who at the time had  just assumed office, cleared the way for the then Fighter 90 to  be shot down.    Industry cried out. Half a year later, however, the "slimmed  down" version with the stylish name Eurofighter 2000 emerged.  Dasa chief Juergen Schremmp pulled the thrift version "light  fighter" out of his pocket. Money was saved regarding radar or  the possibility of flying 10 targets simultaneously. Air Force  jargon: The sports plane is coming.    Volker Ruehe, still not exactly an ardent supporter of the  new fighter, lost a few feathers, because he attracted the ire  of his foreign colleagues, the fans of the fighter, and the  armament lobbyists among his party colleagues.    The metamorphosis of Fighter 90 to Eurofighter 2000 was  incredible not only in the eyes of the opponents. Many deputies  and experts think that the renaming is simply cheating. FDP  security expert Koppelin: "This was and is pure deception."    From the very beginning Dasa has been under pressure to  succeed. With the successful first flight of the German  prototype DA-01 last Sunday [27 March], the armament corporation  made points -- just in time before the Bundestag elections in  October.    The Defense Ministry's decision about the acquisition of 140  planes is to be made in 1995. Before that, however, the  question of overall costs for serial production must be  clarified. This is not an easy undertaking in view of the  threatening red pencil of Finance Minister Theo Waigel, who has  demanded another DM1.25 billion in savings from the defense  budget.    Dasa provides information about the cost analysis in the  same  way as it pursues public relations work for the Eurofighter:  bit by bit. Spokesman Rotter only reveals: "Our fly-away  price is DM57.8 million."    What he means is the purchase price of the "naked" fighter.  Dasa does not like to talk about the additional costs for  maintenance, armament, and personnel. Then -- according to  security experts -- the new star in the sky will cost up to  DM130 million.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Oil price It is a matter of debate whether the market was more unnerved yesterday by the length of the Opec negotiations or by the unpleasant implications for the sector of BP's annual results the day before. On balance, the former was less relevant to the weakness of oil shares, if only because the haggling in Geneva was always likely to be long-winded. The stakes for individual members were too high. In the absence of agreement on whether the production cuts needed to lift the oil price should be shared according to past output, countries like Algeria and Venezuela had little to lose by sticking to demands for special treatment. In any case, a realistic interpretation might be that in getting even close to an agreement by late yesterday, Opec had made good progress. The odds are that it will keep up its history of pulling off a deal when it really matters. The obvious precedent is the meeting after the price collapse to Dollars 12 per barrel in November 1988. By the next quarter, the price was stable at Dollars 18.</p>

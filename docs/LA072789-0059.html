			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: DOES PANEL HAVE TOO NARROW A VIEW OF DOWNTOWN PLANNING?  </P> <P> When it comes to community advisory groups, the Centre City Planning Committee  (CCPC) could outwrestle them all with its political muscle.  </P> <P> Appointed in 1987 by the San Diego City Council, the 25-member panel was  charged with developing a 20-year master plan for downtown that would  accommodate the desires of a broad range of interest groups.  </P> <P> Led by Horton Plaza Shopping Center developer Ernest W. Hahn, the committee is  stacked deep with the heavy hitters of downtown. So deep, in fact, that some of  its own members admit the committee may sometimes have a focus too narrow for  its own good.  </P> <P> "I do sometimes feel like a lone voice or minority," said Susan Carter, a CCPC  member also active in Citizens Coordinate for Century 3, a group described by  Carter as "dedicated to improving urban planning through education and citizen  participation."  </P> <P> But CCPC, she said, "is planning a downtown, which is a central business,  government and financial core. So it's not surprising or inappropriate to have  it weighted with those kinds of interests."  </P> <P> "These people are a familiar with how the process works," said Bill Nelson, a  committee member who serves on the boards of Scripps Bank and the Centre City  Development Corp. "It was recognized that you have to have people who can  devote time to the process. You're going to find that people who have something  at stake or who are in control of their destinies can take time to do this. It  means lots of meetings and homework.  </P> <P> "The plan that emerges is processed through organizations and people more  widely representative and responsive: city planners, planning commissioners and  the city council."  </P> <P> And yet, Carter says, the committee might be doing things differently if it had  a broader mix including, for example, more ethnic minorities, artists,  architects and educators.  </P> <P> "One thing I've noticed is we get hung up" on minute details, she said. "At  some point, your mind steps back and says, 'What are we doing here? Have we  lost sight of what we're doing?' Perhaps this is due to the makeup of the  committee."  </P> <P> Charles Kaminski, one of two architects on the panel, thinks CCPC meetings,  which are open to the public, could focus more on the tangibles of a great  downtown and less on black-and-white data.  </P> <P> "We might be weighted on the analytical side, not the creative. Every time we  look at something, we have to think, 'If I'm a person on the street, what kind  of experience do I want to have? Do I want to walk through a residential  neighborhood of high-rise Meridian-type buildings or 3- and 4-story walk-ups  that might make a more active street life?' I don't think we do that as often  as we should."  </P> <P> Not only does the committee's makeup seem skewed toward business concerns, but  several CCPC members have vested stakes in the financial future of downtown San  Diego.  </P> <P> Among them are Lee Stein, president of Seaport Village; Scott MacDonald, an  executive with the Hahn Co., owners and operators of the Horton Plaza Shopping  Center; Paul Peterson, a prominent land-use attorney known for representing  large developments before the San Diego City Council; Al Ziegaus, a partner in  Stoorza Ziegaus &amp; Metzger, a large public relations and marketing firm that  has represented a variety of major downtown developers; and Lou Wolfsheimer, a  port commissioner and attorney specializing in land-use matters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Have Vested Interests  </P> <P> And in January the CCPC appointed a six-member subcommittee to speed completion  of a downtown plan draft made up of powerhouses like Wolfsheimer and Ziegaus,  but not members like Carter, Glenn Allison from Episcopal Community Services,  Betty Slater, who owns property in the proposed arts district east of downtown  and Percy Myers, the committee's lone black, who works in community relations  at General Dynamics.  </P> <P> "I was bothered by it," admitted Carter. "But perhaps it was necessary. It's  very difficult to do anything with a committee of 25 people. The steering  committee came up with a report, and it's now going through an exhaustive  review."  </P> <P> "Certainly the subcommittee consists of several individuals who have a major  stake financially downtown," conceded Bill Sauls, an attorney and downtown  resident who serves on the CCPC. "But I can also assure you that the  subcommittee did not make decisions for the CCPC. Plans were thoroughly  reviewed and well deliberated."  </P> <P> The most recent draft of the plan for downtown was issued last month. Some of  the important ideas included are: linking the bay to Balboa Park through  ceremonial streets such as Broadway, preserving historic buildings, encouraging  alternative modes of transportation and giving developers incentives to include  such public features as museums and plazas in their projects.  </P> <P> Several disagreements over the plan are being hashed out at CCPC meetings,  sometimes heatedly.  </P> <P> Detailed recommendations regarding the Navy's property at the foot of Broadway  are being generated by a CCPC subcommittee chaired by San Diego City Councilman  Ron Roberts. Roberts wants the Navy to drop one of its proposed high-rises and  expand a public plaza, and others feel the Navy's plans for multiple office and  hotel towers are too intense for the waterfront.  </P> <P> In the area called Harborview, which includes the stretch of India Street north  of downtown known for its Italian restaurants and bakeries, some committee  members want new buildings of up to 90 feet, while others are lobbying for  smaller-scale neighborhoods with more residential uses.  </P> <P> The whole issue of housing is still very much undecided. In Harborview, Cortez  Hill and Centre City East, areas designated in the plan for housing, there is  disagreement about the density and types that should occur.  </P> <P> As for the future of the arts downtown, the plan recommends mandatory public  art budgets for all new projects and a residential arts district in Centre City  East. Some artists, though, don't think the committee is adequately addressing  their needs.  </P> <P> "I look at the CCPC plan, and even though I still strive to preserve a real  arts community downtown, I'm just not sure it's not a futile battle," said  Gloria Poore, an artist and businesswoman who owns and rents out downtown  spaces to artists. She's spoken to the CCPC twice about what artists need  downtown, but isn't sure she's been heard.  </P> <P> She said more effort should be made to encourage combination studio/residence  spaces, keeping costs down by leaving the interiors unfinished. Right now,  Poore said, the city's Building Inspection Department is too strict about  requiring formal kitchens and bathrooms and heaters, and this drives up costs  beyond what artists can afford.  </P> <P> "I'm not happy with the way they gather input from the community," said  architect Richard Bundy, president of the Central City Assn., an alliance of  downtown businesses.  </P> <P> "They go about it in a fairly token way. Their workshops aren't designed to get  input, but to reinforce their decisions. I represented the CCA at a couple of  CCPC meetings, and, when I got done, Hahn said, 'Thank you, we appreciate your  help,' and I knew nothing would happen with it, it was mist in the wind."  </P> <P> Bundy, who has conducted various architecture and planning workshops in the  past, will help the CCA conduct workshops on the CCPC plan for a variety of  downtown groups.  </P> <P> An interim version of the plan is expected to be adopted by the City Council  this fall, with a final version due next year.  </P></p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Damages rejected against industrialist A MILAN court yesterday rejected an appeal for L81bn (Pounds 32.9m) in damages against Mr Carlo De Benedetti's Cir holding company by the liquidators of Banco Ambrosiano, the Italian bank which collapsed in 1982, writes Haig Simonian. The finding concludes a long-running civil court battle brought by the liquidators in relation to share dealings during Mr De Benedetti's two-month stint as the bank's deputy chairman. A separate criminal case against Mr De Benedetti, who was last year sentenced to more than six years' imprisonment in connection with his role at the bank, is still pending. Although Mr De Benedetti's lawyers have launched an appeal, further hearings remain blocked until the judges reveal the motivation for their sentence. The delay in the case, which has now reached 20 months, is a record, even by the slow-moving standards of Italian justice. Yesterday's decision was 'a vote of confidence in what we've always sustained,' said Mr De Benedetti. Earlier this week, he said new evidence would soon come to light proving his innocence in the Banco Ambrosiano affair.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRAGUE: REBIRTH BY STUDENTS;  </P> <P> CZECHOSLOVAKIA: THE OPPOSITION WON THE FIRST ROUND OF REVOLUTION. NOW COME  HARDER QUESTIONS: WHO WILL GOVERN, HOW TO PROCEED?  </P> <P> The current Prague revolution began without me in mid-November; my anguish  about sitting in Santa Cruz increased daily until I grabbed an opportunity to  go back to Czechoslovakia, to visit the city where I grew up, attended college,  earned my first political credentials as a dissident -- the city where old  friends are often closer than brothers.  </P> <P> This revolution is not much like the Prague Spring of 1968. First, this is  indeed a revolution; 1968 was a reform. No matter how strong the push of  popular forces, no matter how enlightened the leadership of Alexander Dubcek,  the 1968 process was managed -- and its limits dictated -- by the Communist  Party.  </P> <P> In 1989 no such limits are apparent. The Communist Party is being swept away,  almost as an irrelevant irritant, stripped of its hitherto constitutionally  guaranteed "leading role." This is a step we never dreamed of in 1968. The  country is heading for free elections; the Communist Party might win only 10%  of the electorate, losing two-thirds of its own members' votes. In 1968, such  results were unthinkable.  </P> <P> Everyone I saw in Prague was astonished by the speed of change: They talked  about 10 years for Poland, 10 months for Hungary, 10 weeks for East Germany and  10 days for Czechoslovakia. Not boasting -- pure wonderment. They understood  that speed was multiplied by developments in other East European countries;  there could have been no Prague without a Warsaw, no Prague without a Budapest  or Berlin. But they also told each other that speed is testimony to the  rottenness of the old regime.  </P> <P> Dizzying speed, however exhilarating, makes it hard to see where you are going.  The leadership of the Civic Forum, an umbrella group that has emerged as the  most powerful opposition voice, relies on a handful of individuals who carry  extraordinary physical and psychological burdens.  </P> <P> Playwright Vaclav Havel, the best-known personality of the Forum, has more  mandates than minutes. He is needed everywhere simultaneously: to negotiate  with the government, to confer with colleagues, to meet emissaries from the  provinces, to address the public, to draft documents, to comment on position  papers. To maintain some semblance of physical control, Havel seems to travel  with a half-dozen karate experts -- guarding him from journalists as much as  from other dangers. When I saw him in Prague at the end of November, the strain  showed.  </P> <P> Civic Forum was operating out of execrable spaces. Headquarters were in the  basement of the Laterna Magica theater in the center of Prague: only a couple  of telephones, none with multiple lines; no copying machines on site, never  mind faxes or computers, no secretarial support to speak of. Information flowed  by courier. The press of people trying to get into the basement was constant.  Only one narrow section of the entrance was kept open; a visitor's business had  to be ascertained before entry to the foyer of the theater; to reach the  basement, one needed a special pass reserved for Civic Forum activists.  </P> <P> An old friend from 1968 was my passport. Vlado Prikazsky is a former radio  journalist who covered "our" student strike in November, 1968. He was kicked  off the air during subsequent government purges. Now Vlado is back in action,  part of the Civic Forum, one of dozens of old friends reunited after more than  20 years. With each of them, I continued interrupted conversation. The only  evidences of time passed were our graying hair and pictures of 15-year-old  children.  </P> <P> The old friends helped reconstruct what had happened. The first phase of the  revolution erupted on Friday, Nov. 17, when a special unit of riot police from  the Interior Ministry savagely beat up as many as 2,000 demonstrators, most of  them students. The assault was unprovoked; the protest was nonviolent. The  demonstrators' only crime was failure to disperse; instead, they sat down on  the cold Prague pavement and refused to budge. Vlado took me to the site; the  pavement has become a little shrine, adorned with dozens of candles.  </P> <P> Police brutality lit the fuse. Over the weekend, students made nationwide plans  for a general strike and people started gathering in the city center, at  Wenceslas Square. The regime realized it had gone too far; the Wenceslas Square  crowd was not attacked. On Nov. 20, the demonstrators issued a list of demands,  vowing to strike until demands were met.  </P> <P> This is a students' revolution. They spearheaded it, had the courage to face  police, mobilized the population at large -- frequently against the wishes of  parents who had found a way of cohabiting with the regime.  </P> <P> I visited a couple of universities and talked to striking students. They wanted  to know about Prague Spring -- about democratic political processes the regime  never taught.  </P> <P> The students were joined in the strike by actors who added professional skills  to convey the message, helping win over factory workers. In the battle for  hearts and minds, Communist Party propaganda hacks were completely outclassed.  Theaters were open every evening for panel discussions with students and other  opposition speakers. And every night every house was packed.  </P> <P> During my visit, what can best be described as a revolutionary gala was held at  the National Theater. Arias from Bedrich Smetana's patriotic operas were  sandwiched between appearances by popular scholars and actors -- some of whom  had been banned from the stage for 20 years.  </P> <P> This has been a disciplined, gentle, even good-humored revolution. Hundreds of  thousands of people gathered daily in city center, with no police presence. Not  a single window was broken. Current playfulness contrasts dramatically with the  dourness of the Communist Party. A Hungarian dissident addressed the crowds one  day and apologized for his awkwardness with the Czech language. The crowd  roared immediate response; one man yelled, "He speaks better than Jakes,"  referring to Milos Jakes, the former party boss famous for his inability to  string a decent sentence together.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Nov. 21, a loudspeaker was installed on Wenceslas Square. Civic  Forum leaders could at last address the throng and the people took direction.  From then on, revolution was unstoppable -- short of a Tian An Men Square  massacre. Even the soon-to-be deposed apparatchiks didn't have the stomach for  that, although there is evidence that militia troops were brought in to the  outskirts of Prague from outlying areas.  </P> <P> The people have won the first phase hands-down. The opposition demands  presented to Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec were accepted -- including free  elections. Then Adamec resigned. His designated successor was Marian Calfa. The  people were still unsure last week. They had won but could hardly believe it.  It all seemed too easy.  </P> <P> A more difficult phase has opened, with questions about composition of the  government, the timing of elections, the identity of Civic Forum -- a political  party or a Solidarity-type trade union? Prime ministers change within days.  Real economic and social difficulties remain. Parties spring up from nowhere,  frequently representing no more than the megalomania of individuals.  </P> <P> The chasm between freedom of speech and freedom to vent hot air grows more  apparent. No multiparty elections have been held since 1946. Ignorance about  the democratic process, about electoral systems, about campaign mechanisms is  endemic.  </P> <P> Yet fundamental assets are equally apparent: a smart people who will work hard,  determined to end the nightmare of communist control. Many of us who have been  biding time abroad are now deciding how best to contribute to the new  Czechoslovakia, the one students have freed.  </P></p>

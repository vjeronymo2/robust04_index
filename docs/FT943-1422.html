			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Tourism body claims 12.3% stake in GDP The tourism industry is far bigger than previous estimates have suggested and produces a balance of trade surplus rather than the deficit reported in government statistics, the World Travel and Tourism Council said yesterday. The council, which was set up in 1990 by a group of travel industry chief executives, said that tourism would account for 12.3 per cent of gross domestic product next year. The travel industry would employ 3.2m people directly or indirectly - 12.4 per cent of the workforce. The council's figures are far higher than those in the statistics produced by government departments and tourist industry bodies. A study of tourism published by the Confederation of British Industry in May said government figures indicated that the industry accounted for 5.6 per cent of GDP and employed 1.4m people, or 6 per cent of the workforce. Mr Geoffrey Lipman, the council's president, said previous figures took account of spending on hotels and other tourist services but did not include travel-related investment, such as building hotels and aircraft. Mr Lipman said that, taking these industries into account, tourism had consistently produced a big balance of payments surplus, aided by British-based aircraft manufacture and hotel construction abroad by UK companies. The council said that, when the travel-related investment was included, then the tourism balance of payments surplus was Pounds 4.9bn in 1992. This compares with government statistics which recorded a Pounds 3.4bn deficit in 1992. The council shows a surplus for every year from 1987 to 1992 - when official statistics recorded deficits. Mr Lipman said the council - which has Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of British Airways, and Sir John Egan, chief executive of airports group BAA, as members of its executive committee - had presented its study to Lord Astor, the tourism minister. He said the council's figures showed that tourism was an industry which should enjoy a far higher profile in government policy and decision-making than it did. Mr Lipman criticised the decision, announced in last year's Budget, to introduce a departure tax of Pounds 5 for flights in the European Union and Pounds 10 for flights elsewhere. He said that tourism, as a successful export industry, should receive tax incentives rather than additional burdens.</p>

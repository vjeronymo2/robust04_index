			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / People: Coutts' new chairman Sir Ewen Fergusson, the former British ambassador in Paris, is to take over from Sir David Money-Coutts as non-executive chairman of Coutts &amp; Co, bankers to Britain's royal family since the reign of George III. Sir David, who joined Coutts in 1954 and has been chairman since 1976, is the great great great great grandson of Thomas Coutts. He will remain on the board as a non-executive director. Although it is unusual for Coutts, now owned by National Westminster Bank, to bring in an outsider as chairman, it is not unknown. Sir Seymour Egerton, who was chairman for 25 years before Sir David took over, was not a member of one of the founding families. However, he did work in the bank for five years before becoming chairman. Sir Ewen, by contrast, joins the board in May and becomes chairman at the end of September. He will also be chairman of Coutts &amp; Co Group and Coutts &amp; Co International Holding in Zurich. A former Scottish rugby international, Sir Ewen, 60, joined the Foreign Service in 1956. Apart from serving in the British embassy in Addis Ababa and the British Trade Development Office in New York, his career has included stints as ambassador to South Africa and principal private secretary to three foreign secretaries: James Callaghan, Anthony Crosland and David Owen. Although Coutts has a reputation as one of the world's most exclusive private banks, its recent performance has been lacklustre. Having made pre-tax profits of Pounds 19.3m in 1990, it lost Pounds 15.2m in 1991, before making Pounds 3m last year. Coutts was acquired by National Provincial Bank in 1920, but it has remained an autonomous part of the NatWest group for many years. Ian Farnsworth, the managing director, has been appointed a deputy chairman of Coutts &amp; Co from June 1, along with The Hon Nicholas Assheton. (See Observer).</p>

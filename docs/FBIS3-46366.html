The purposes of the (enlarged) plenary session are to  implement the spirit of decisions adopted at the Third Plenum of  the 14th CPC Central Committee under the guidance of the  socialist theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and the guidance of the 14th CPC  Congress' guidelines; to put forward tasks and ideas for the  region to accelerate the reform and development and to safeguard  the unity and stability in line with the target of establishing  the systems of socialist market economy; and to mobilize all  Communist Party members as well as the cadres and people of  various nationalities across the region to unite as one, to wage  arduous struggles, and to concentrate their thinking and energy  on accelerating the reform and development so that they can  greet the new and crucial year and create a new situation with  the mental attitude of emancipating minds and daring to pioneer  and to try to promote the sustained, accelerated, and healthy  development of the region's economy.    During the plenary session Wang Qun, secretary of the  autonomous regional party committee, delivered a report entitled  "Reinforce the Strength in Reforms, Accelerate the Economic  Development, Vigorously Create a New Situation for Establishing  the Systems of Socialist Market Economy." Wu Liji, deputy  secretary of the autonomous regional party committee and  chairman of the autonomous regional people's government,  presided over yesterday's plenary session, which was also  attended by Qian Fenyong and Bai Enpei, deputy secretaries of  the autonomous regional party committee; as well as Geroletu,  Yang Enbo, and Wuyunqimuge, members of the autonomous regional  party standing committee.    Comrade Wang Qun's report includes the following five parts:  1) The brief summation of 1993 work; 2) Efforts should be made  to apply the spirit of "decisions" adopted at the Third Plenum  of the 14th CPC Central Committee to unify thinking and to  enhance the people's morale in line with the grand target of  "being the advanced"; 3) Efforts should be made to promote the  sustained, accelerated, and healthy development of the national  economy and to ensure the fulfillment of the two periodical  targets within the given date; 4) Efforts should be made to  promote reform in an overall way, to make breakthroughs in key  fields, and to accelerate the pace of establishing the socialist  market economy system; 5) Efforts should be further made to  enhance or improve the party's leadership and to unswervingly  implement the principle of "building the two civilizations  simultaneously and scoring achievements in both of them."    Wang Qun said: Over the past year the concept of socialist  market economy has been accepted by an increasingly large number  of people. In particular, leadership at all levels has greatly  upgraded their understanding on the socialist market economy.  Reforms conducted in line with the target of establishing the  systems of socialist market economy have achieved new progress.  The economic structure has been further improved under the  guide of markets and of macro readjustment and control. Both  urban and rural productive forces have been emancipated or  achieved development in the course of reform and opening up.  Their specific manifestations are as follows: The reform in  rural and pastoral areas has achieved new progress and a bumper  harvest in both agriculture and animal husbandry has been  obtained in the disaster-plagued year. The industrial and  commercial enterprises have steadily deepened their reform and  their economic results have somewhat increased. The activities  of introducing foreign advanced technologies and setting up  technical and economic associations with domestic localities  have taken a new step. The pace in building the basic  industries of energy resources, communications,  telecommunication, and raw materials, as well as in building  infrastructures has been quickened. Township enterprises have  fostered a trend of doubling their output value and privately  owned enterprises have achieved faster development. The  principle of "building the two civilizations simultaneously and  scoring achievements in both of them" have been further  implemented, new achievements in party building and in the  construction of spiritual civilization have been scored, and the  political situation of unity and stability has been further  consolidated. Wang Qun said: While fully acknowledging the  achievements and the main stream in the current situation, we  must also analyze by seeking truth from facts the difficulties  and problems cropping up along our advancing road. We should  also note that along with gradually deepening the reform and  developing the undertakings of modernization, it is possible for  us to gradually deal with these problems and difficulties.    In his report Comrade Wang Qun pointed out: We should  apply the spirit of the "decisions" adopted at the Third Plenum  of the 14th CPC Central Committee to unify thinking and enhance  the people's morale in line with the grand target of "being the  advanced." He said: The decisions adopted at the third plenum  represent an important policy decision, a grand blueprint of  turning the old economic system into a new one, and a guiding  principle of leading the entire party and the people of various  nationalities throughout the country to accelerate the reform  and development in a timely manner. By regarding the  implementation of these decisions as a sign, we can be sure that  our country's programs of conducting reform among the economic  systems and of carrying out economic construction have entered a  new development period. At present, a good job should be done  in emphatically dealing with the following problems: 1) Efforts  should be made to adopt a correct attitude toward the region's  strong points under the conditions of socialist market economy  and to enhance the confidence in quickening development; 2)  Efforts should be made to smash the fetter of old thinking and  concepts developed under the system of the planned economy and  to foster the new thinking and concepts of socialist market  economy; 3) Efforts should be made to firmly foster or to always  uphold the criterion of "three advantages" and to apply this  criterion to analyzing the new situation, new problems, and new  things cropping up in the course of establishing new systems as  well as to measuring the failure or success cropping up in  reforms. Meanwhile, efforts should be made to correctly deal  with the relations among reform, development, and stability and  successfully deal with the relation between the whole interest  and the partial one, as well as the relation between the  immediate difficulty and the distant view of development. He  said: In 1987 Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out in his  speech: Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is endowed with vast  grassland and has a small population. It is possible for the  region to be advanced in development in the future. This  judgment represents his ardent hope for the region and his  scientific foresight and the people of various nationalities  throughout the region should regard his judgment as a spiritual  motive force. The grand target of "being the advanced" shows  the region's glorious prospects in economic and social  development and conforms with the fundamental interest and  common desire of the people of various nationalities throughout  the region. By judging from the development of both domestic  and foreign situations, from the tendency of the state  macroeconomic policies, and from the region's existing  foundation and development potential, it is possible for us to  realize the grand target through a longer period of arduous  struggles. We should regard the grand target as a banner and  guide the people of various nationalities throughout the region  to have lofty ambitions and to make unswerving efforts to  realize the target.    In his report Wang Qun said: In order to realize the grand  target, it is imperative to fulfill in a timely manner the two  periodical targets put forward at the sixth (enlarged) plenary  session of the fifth autonomous regional party committee; to  become better-off by the end of this century; and to reach the  level that is little higher than the national intermediate level  in this regard. This is the second year in fulfilling the first  periodical target and a failure or success in economic  development has a vital bearing on whether we can realize the  first periodical target on schedule. Therefore, we should adopt  every possible way and means to successfully conduct the  economic work in 1994 and to achieve faster progress in economic  development. In line with the current situation in the region's  economic development, the region's gross national product may  show a 10 percent increase in 1994 and we should strive to show  a 12 percent increase. In order to realize the increasing  speed, it is imperative to work out a new way with economic  results as a center for developing the economy. A good job  should be done in emphatically grasping the following tasks: 1)  Efforts should be made to actively consolidate the structure of  agriculture and animal husbandry and to further accelerate the  economic development in rural and pastoral areas; 2) A good job  should be done in emphatically encouraging enterprises to show  an increase in both speed and economic results and to take up  the work of switching losses to profits to improve industrial  production across the region to a new level; 3) A good job  should be done in continuously establishing pillar industries  and in building key projects to add actual and reserve strength  to the region's economic development; 4) Efforts should be made  to vigorously develop township enterprises and to enhance the  actual strength of the banner-county economy; 5) Efforts should  be made to let the society continuously have a free hand in  developing publicly owned enterprises.    Wang Qun said: A fundamental way to accelerate the economic  development in the region lies in seizing the opportunity of  reforms, reinforcing the strength in reforms, and quickening the  pace in establishing the systems of the socialist market  economy. Proceeding from the region's reality, a good job should  be done in realistically grasping the following reforms: 1)  Efforts should be made to accelerate the pace in enterprise  reform by regarding as an orientation the establishment of  modern enterprise systems and regarding the task of  straightening out the relations among property rights as a  breakthrough; 2) Efforts should be made to further deepen the  reform in rural and pastoral areas by emphasizing the task of  establishing or improving the socialized service systems of  agriculture and animal husbandry; 3) Efforts should be made to  accelerate the pace of fostering and perfecting the market  systems by emphasizing the task of establishing the markets of  essential factors for production; 4) Efforts should be made to  accelerate the pace of conducting reform among organs by  emphasizing the task of shifting the governmental function; 5)  Efforts should be made to ensure the implementation of measures  for conducting macroeconomic readjustment and control by  emphasizing the task of conducting reform among the systems of  finance and tax, banking, investment, and planning; 6) Efforts  should be made to accelerate the reform among the systems of  public security by regarding as a breakthrough the method of the  society making overall arrangements for severance pay; 7)  Efforts should be made to further deepen the reform among the  systems of science, technology, and education to meet the needs  of reform, opening up, and economic construction; 8) Efforts  should be made to open the region in an overall way to  localities both at home and abroad by regarding as a  breakthrough the task of vigorously bringing in foreign advanced  technologies and vigorously setting up economic and technical  associations with domestic localities.    Wang Qun pointed out: In order to win a victory in directing  these unprecedented and pioneering undertakings, we must  realistically enhance the party's self improvement and provide a  strong and effective political guarantee for reform, opening up,  and modernization. We must unswervingly and persistently carry  forward the strategic principle of "building the two  civilizations simultaneously and scoring achievements in both of  them" and create a good social environment for accelerating the  reform, opening up, and economic construction. Wang Qun urged  that in enhancing the party building, it is most important for  us to apply the socialist theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with  regard to building socialism with Chinese characteristics.  Efforts should be made to enable the leading body to become a  strong and effective core of political leadership, which is  leading the masses to establish the new systems of socialist  market economy. A good job should be done in realistically  building socialist spiritual civilization by regarding as a  target the task of training new successors in conformity with  the "four requirements" and by following the principle of  regarding construction as an important point and regarding  upholding as a precious point. Efforts should be made to  successfully conduct the party's united front work in the new  historic period, to enhance the work involved in nationalities'  affairs and religious affairs, and to bring all contributing  factors into play. By earnestly implementing the central  arrangements, efforts should be made to steadily deepen the  struggle against corruption.    Attending the plenary session were members and alternate  members of the autonomous regional party committee; members of  the party committee (leading party group) under the autonomous  regional people's congress, the regional people's government,  the regional Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  committee, the regional military district, and the regional  discipline inspection commission; veteran comrades who had long  worked in the region; responsible persons from the party and  government organs of various leagues, cities, banners, and  counties, (county-level cities and districts); as well as  party-member responsible comrades from the regional level  departments, commissions, offices, and bureaus, as well as from  the mass organizations, the higher educational institutions, and  a number of large enterprises and establishments.    At the preparatory meeting for the plenary session on the  evening of 21 December, Comrade Qian Fenyong delivered a speech  on the session's tasks and significance, as well as on the  methods and demands for proceeding the session.</p>

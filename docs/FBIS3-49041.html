The Croat delegation said the announcement would be made at  noon (1100 GMT), on the second day of discussions in the old  imperial palace at Hofburg. The talks were expected to focus on  a ceasefire, internal borders and access to the sea for the  Bosnian Moslems.    The Vienna-based U.S. ambassador to Bosnia-Hercegovina,  Victor Jakovich, was at Wednesday's opening of the talks, but  the international mediators Lord Owen for the European Community  and Thorvald Stoltenberg for the UN, who attended on Tuesday,  were not present.    The two delegation chiefs, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic, both  described their discussions on Tuesday afternoon as  "constructive." They said "real progress" had been made on the  passage of humanitarian convoys and prisoner swaps.    Silajdzic also said he was "encouraged" by a Craotian pledge  supported Bosnian proposals to allow residents of Mostar, a  southern Bosnian city hit hard by the ethnic conflict, to return  home. The talks here follow a recent escalation of fighting  between mainly Moslem Bosnian and Bosnian Croat forces in  central Bosnia.</p>

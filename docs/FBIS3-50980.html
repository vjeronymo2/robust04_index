Outgoing Social Welfare Minister Monserrat Butina, accused  of  nepotism by the opposition, will be replaced by Deputy Alberto  Cardenas, a member of the ruling Republican Unity Party.    Education Minister Eduardo Pena, who at the end of 1993 had  to deal with a two-month long strike by approximately 100,000  teachers and professors who work for the state, will be replaced  by the Education Ministry's Assistant Culture Secretary Rosalia  Arteaga.    Industry, Commerce, and Integration Minister Jorge Garcia,  who recently criticized several government policies, will be  replaced by Jose Vicente Maldonado, who until today held the  post of secretary general of the administration.    Maldonado will be replaced by his former assistant secretary  Carlos Larreategui.    Cardenas and Maldonado are the third individuals appointed  to  the Ministries of Social Welfare and Industry, Commerce and  Integration, respectively, by Duran-Ballen during his first 18  months in office.    The president also appointed economist Marcel Laniado de  Wind  as executive director of the National Council of State  Modernization.    The announced changes, expected since December, are the  result of specific situations faced by the outgoing ministers  and not general political changes within the government.    Most of the new officials will take the oath today during a  ceremony that will be presided over by Duran-Ballen at  Carondelet Palace, the presidential headquarters. The rest will  be sworn in within the next few days.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Developing Kodak The new Kodak is coming into focus. Yesterday's Dollars 1bn disposal of its clinical diagnostics business is the group's third billion dollar-plus asset sale since June. Not only has Mr George Fisher, who took Kodak's helm last December, exceeded investor expectations by the speed with which he has shed its peripheral health care businesses; the prices achieved are also surprisingly good - no doubt helped by the current worldwide enthusiasm for acquisitions in the sector. So far, disposals have brought in Dollars 5.6bn. L&amp;F, Kodak's household products arm, is expected to realise a further Dollars 2bn. The total proceeds will virtually wipe out Kodak's debt. Mr Fisher now faces an even tougher challenge - expanding Kodak's core imaging business. That will determine whether it can shake off its reputation as a technological giant that lost its way. Mr Fisher, who in his time has worked at AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories as well as running Motorola, has sketched out an exciting vision of how Kodak can apply its photographic expertise in emerging multimedia markets. Undoubtedly, image processing has a bright future, and Kodak has developed strong technological positions in fields such as image processing software and digital sensors. But the company has a poor track record in bringing such inventions to market. It also faces stiff competition, particularly from Japanese groups such as Fuji, Canon and Sony. The real test will be whether Kodak can put together alliances that provide it with access to additional technologies and markets. But given Mr Fisher's proven ability to spring favourable surprises, he deserves the benefit of the doubt.</p>

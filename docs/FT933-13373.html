			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / ITC seeks new bids for Channel 5 THE Independent Television Commission yesterday tried to revive the concept of a new national Channel 5 by calling for expressions of interest from prospective channel operators. The appeal comes more than six months after the ITC rejected the only application for the franchise from a consortium put together by Thames Television. The ITC yesterday set out three options for a future Channel 5: Re-advertisement of the original franchise which would cover 74 per cent of the population with 33 transmitters. Since the rejection of the Thames bid an ITC technical study has looked at ways of using different frequencies to reduce the number of video recorders requiring retuning as a result of Channel 5 interference. It has also looked at ways of reducing the number of homes that would need an additional aerial to receive the channel. The ITC believes such measures would not make enough difference to justify changing the technical plan. Using the available frequencies to create local city-based television stations. Unless such stations were part of a national network, new legislation would be required. The ITC has said it would like to see evidence on the commercial viabil-ity of such an approach. Using the frequencies as part of a plan to introduce digital television. The ITC recently published a discussion document on digital - as opposed to the present analogue - television. It argued that new digital channels could be introduced alongside the simultaneous transmission of existing PAL services on BBC, ITV and Channel 4 until early in the next century. Mr David Glencross, chief executive of the ITC, said it was neutral on the three options. Expressions of interest have to be presented by October 15. A number of media organisations, including it is believed Times Warner, the world's largest media group, are understood to be still interested in running Channel 5 as a conventional national channel. Thames Television also remains interested in the project but its role would likely be a lesser one than at first proposed. The independent production company has since been bought by Pearson, the publishing and banking group which owns the Financial Times, and would be caught by rules limiting cross-media ownership. Mr Chris Rowley, involved in last year's Channel 5 bid, said yesterday he was pleased that there now seemed to be greater interest in Channel 5.</p>

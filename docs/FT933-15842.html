			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / A case of 'justice first and efficiency second': Plan to reduce City 'mega-trials' ruled out - Custody video recording recommended / Lawyers express alarm THE Royal Commission on Criminal Justice put 'justice first and efficiency second' before finally publishing its 352 recommendations, its chairman Lord Runciman said yesterday. Yet in attempting to find the right balance between prosecution and defence, the commission has made a number of inroads into long-established and fundamental rights of defendants. These include the right to elect trial by jury and the so-called right to silence. The commission was set up in March 1991 with the primary task of recommending changes to the criminal justice system to prevent further miscarriages of justice. Launching the commission's report yesterday, Lord Runciman said it had taken a much broader view of its remit: its recommendations were aimed as much at reducing the risk of the guilty being acquitted as trying to prevent the conviction of the innocent, he said. Of the proposals for change only 22 are directly related to correcting miscarriages of justice. Almost half of the remainder are addressed at improving efficiency and productivity in the system. The most controversial recommendation is to abolish the defendant's right to elect trial by jury in cases which can either be tried by magistrates or crown courts. This proposal is opposed by the legal profession, many senior judges including Lord Taylor, the lord chief justice, who has called it 'an inalienable right stretching back to Magna Carta', and by civil liberties groups. The commission was urged to adopt this proposal by Mrs Barbara Mills QC, director of public prosecutions, as a way of cutting costs and delays in the system by limiting the number of crown court cases. Of roughly 100,000 cases committed by magistrates to the crown court each year, about 30,000 go there because defendants elect jury trial. The average daily cost of a crown court trial in 1992-93 was Pounds 6,850. The daily cost of trial by magistrates is unknown, but is estimated at less than half that figure. Lord Runciman yesterday denied that this was purely a cost-cutting measure. He said most defendants opted for jury trial in the mistaken belief that they would either receive a fairer trial or a lighter sentence. Research showed that crown court judges were three times as likely to impose a custodial sentence and sentences were on average 2 1/2 times as long. Lord Runciman said the recommendation that magistrates should decide whether a case should go to the crown court when prosecution and defence could not agree would make the system 'quicker, fairer and more consistent'. Defence lawyers dispute that. Lord Williams QC, last year's Bar chairman, has said that allowing magistrates to decide according to factors, such as the defendant's reputation, would result in jury trial being allowed 'for the vicar's wife, but not for the postman or the betting-shop manager'. The commission has preserved the basic principle that a person is innocent until proven guilty by recommending that defendants should keep their right to remain silent at the police station. Yet in spite of research that suggested a defendant's silence was not a problem in the vast majority of cases, the commission has made significant inroads into the right to silence. It has recommended that defendants who intend to advance a defence at trial must tell the prosecution the substance of it before the trial or risk adverse comment being made to the jury. The commission has also failed to recommend a requirement that confessions should be corroborated before they can be admissible as evidence at trial in spite of the fact that disputed confessions have been central to the overwhelming majority of recent miscarriages of justice. It has chosen instead to recommend that judges should warn juries of the dangers of convicting on the basis of confessions alone. The measures aimed directly at preventing and correcting alleged miscarriages of justice have been warmly welcomed. Among these is the establishment of an independent review authority to take responsibility from the Home Office for investigating and referring suspect cases back to the Court of Appeal. Concerns remain however that the actual investigation of alleged miscarriages of justice will still be carried out by the police. The establishment of an independent forensic science advisory council to oversee standards and ensure forensic science facilities are available equally to defence and prosecution has also been welcomed. Measures to tighten police procedures, introduce video recording in police stations, and the overall emphasis on the need for higher standards and more training for police, defence lawyers and judges should help to reduce further miscarriages of justice.

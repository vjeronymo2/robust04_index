Speaking after hearing the deputies' speeches, Li Tieying  said: To ensure a smooth implementation of various important  reform measures this year, we should first of all make sure that  the system is observed, to be followed by gradual adjustment of  interests. The two should not go simultaneously. Governments  at various levels should meticulously organize, conduct in-depth  studies and investigations, and continuously make adjustments.    Touching on Zhejiang's reform and economic development, Li  Tieying said: Zhejiang's economic development has been quite  unique; it depends neither on heavy state investment nor large  Hong Kong, Macao, and foreign funds and achieves development  with its own special economic potential, reflecting the inner  quality of its economic development. Zhejiang is leading the  nation in market construction, securing its leading position in  China's markets, particularly the commodity market. Li Tieying  expressed the hope that Zhejiang will continue to give play to  this superiority; conduct bolder reform and exploration; develop  intermediary service organizations; and standardize market  construction by formulating as soon as possible trading rules,  regulations, or interim regulations. In addition, it is  necessary to develop markets for production factors. Government  departments in charge of resources of production factors should  study ways and means to standardize the production factors  markets and gradually mature them.</p>

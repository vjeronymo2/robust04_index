			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Bush joins Turkey in urging end to clash over enclave PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday joined in calls for an end to the fighting between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. The White House in Washington said he discussed the trouble spot in a telephone call with Turkey's Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel, as international efforts continued to try to prevent the dispute getting out of hand. The violence 'threatens to scar this region for generations to come,' the US administration said. Both sides should show restraint. Mr Demirel said in Istanbul he phoned Mr Bush to warn that the fighting could make the whole region unstable. He said Azerbaijani leaders believed only the US could settle the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely Armenian populated enclave within Azerbaijan. Pressure is growing on the former Soviet army, meanwhile, to pull all its forces out of the troubled Caucasian republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. The mood for withdrawal was evident at a meeting yesterday of the Co-ordinating Council of officers of the Commonwealth of Independent States  -the successor to the Soviet Union. Latest demands for a pull-out follow the capture, and subsequent release on Wednesday night, of 10 army hostages by Armenian militants at a base at Artik, near the Turkish border. The Armenians demanded rocket launchers and other military hardware, but the army would not say yesterday if the demands were met. Georgian police reported they had shot dead two former soldiers, both Azerbaijanis, said to be running guns and ammunition to Azerbaijan. The Armenians yesterday reported rocket attacks on Stepanakert, the Nagorno-Karabakh capital, and a tank assault on the Armenian-held town of Askeran, close to the Karabakh border with Azerbaijan. Mr Hasan Hasanov, the Azerbaijani prime minister, said in Baku the chances of peace or full-blown war were about equal. Mr Jiri Dienstbier, the Czechoslovak foreign minister, who has been charged by the Nato co-operation council with leading a mediating mission to Stepanakert, said that an observer mission, by member countries of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), could go to Karabakh only when a ceasefire was declared.</p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Exchange rates limit Glaverbel GLAVERBEL, the Belgian glassmaker, yesterday blamed 'competitive devaluation' of European currencies for a slump in export sales during the second half of 1992. Net profits at Glaverbel, western Europe's third-largest producer of flat glass, edged up to BFr715m (Dollars 21.4m) in 1992, from BFr710m in 1991. Sales rose to BFr33.1bn, from BFr30.8bn overall - an increase of 7.7 per cent. But, in the second half, sales grew by only 3 per cent, excluding the group's Czech operation. Glaverbel blamed a decrease in sales to Italy, Spain and the UK after devaluation, or suspension of their currencies from the European exchange rate mechanism in the autumn. Belgium has insisted on linking the Belgian franc to the D-Mark, which has given Glaverbel's competitors, such as Pilkington of the UK, a hefty price advantage. The group said it had also suffered from further price reductions in the European market, although increased sales in added-value products, such as automotive glass and laminated products for construction, helped compensate for the decline. Glaverbel is struggling to regain the prosperity of 1990, when net profits stood at BFr2.27bn. The economic slowdown in Europe and the US has undercut the group's sales of raw glass over the last two to three years. Net income for the group increased last year to BFr1.02bn, from BFr799m, but Glaverbel said that most of the growth was in partly-owned subsidiaries outside Belgium.</p>

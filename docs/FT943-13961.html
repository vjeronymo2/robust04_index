			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Lower tax credit Since when have public limited companies been giving a tax credit of 20 per cent on dividends instead of 25? Also, for how many years is a taxpayer supposed to keep dividend tax vouchers and other tax records? Norman Lamont, then chancellor of the exchequer, cut advance corporation tax to 20 per cent in his March 1993 Budget. Generally, it would be wise to retain tax papers for seven years if there are likely to be any queries or reclaims involved. (Murray Johnstone). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

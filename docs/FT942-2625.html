			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Prince of Wales to pay Pounds 1m tax The Prince of Wales is expected to pay about Pounds 1m in his first tax bill since he volunteered last year to pay income tax. The prince will pay 40 per cent of the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall, which totalled Pounds 4.08m in 1993, after deducting the costs of his official duties. The details of his tax returns have not been finalised, but the total is expected to be similar to the sum under the former system when he voluntarily surrendered 25 per cent of the duchy's total income. The duchy's accounts, published yesterday, showed that net income for the year had increased from Pounds 3.41m to Pounds 4.08m. The value of the duchy's assets increased from Pounds 76.2m to Pounds 87.7m. Income from farmland and property was Pounds 9.1m compared with operating costs of Pounds 5.6m. The high operating costs stemmed from the wide geographical spread of holdings and higher-than-average maintenance standards. A further Pounds 1.05m of income came from stockmarket investments, offset by a Pounds 1.05m interest charge that stemmed from acquisitions of commercial property in the late 1980s. The Duchy of Cornwall was created in 1337 by Edward III for the Black Prince to provide an income for the heir to the throne. It comprises 130,000 acres of agricultural land, mainly in the south-west of England and the Isles of Scilly, a residential and property portfolio, and a Pounds 40m quoted investment portfolio in environmentally sound companies. The duchy said it aimed to be efficient, forward-looking and commercially sensible while seeking to respond to the interests and concerns of the prince. The prince's advisers are finalising his tax return with the Inland Revenue. All expenses connected with official duties, including the running of his 62-strong office, entertainment and uniforms, are allowable against tax.</p>

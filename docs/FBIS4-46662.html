In actuality, man is moving into the unbounded expanses of the  universe in short careful jumps. First we launched  reconnaissance vehicles into space, then to the closest  celestial body -- the moon, and only then to the planets in a  strict sequence, depending on the range. And landings of space  vehicles on these bodies took place in the same sequence, none  were skipped: Moon (1959), Venus (1966), Mars (1971). The next  in turn, with the numbers "5" and "6," were Mercury and Jupiter,  but the closest of all was "number 4" -- not a planet, but  something like a real jumble, a mass of space trash known as the  "asteroid belt."    So, in any case, it was thought earlier. In the past century  astronomers noticed an empty unoccupied place between Mars and  Jupiter, wanted to discover a planet there, but instead found .  . . thousands of fragments. Arguments about their origin are  still continuing: these are either remnants of the exploding  planet Phaeton or "semifinished material" -- nonadhering pieces  for constructing a planetary body. The arguing parties agreed on  only one thing: it was assumed that the asteroid belt would not  allow the passage of spaceships because they inevitably would  collide with some small piece of rock, which at great velocities  is equivalent to an encounter with a land mine. But now four  emissaries from the Earth have passed through this mine field  and the fifth is in flight. And this demonstrates that the Earth  is not at all blocked from outer space by an impenetrable wall.  Breathing more calmly, specialists already intended to forget  about the irritating interference on the path to the giant  planets, but . . . .    . . . But the scientists of the Moscow Aviation Institute  and  Hesse University (FRG), meeting together, thought a little and  decided that the minor planets, of which the asteroid belt  consists, is of enormous interest for science. In actuality,  whereas ordinary planets during the billions of years of  evolution, as a result of strong gravitational compression,  internal heating and chemical reactions, have not retained a  trace of the primordial matter of the protoplanetary cloud, on  the tiny cosmic bodies, with a total absence of an atmosphere,  any matter should be preserved almost eternally.    If we learn the composition of these space "preserves" and  compare it with today's state of the Earth's deeper layers, many  geological riddles about our own planet will become  understandable. It is one thing to trace changes in the Earth  over the course of tens of years and something else to learn  about events which occurred billions of years ago. It appears  that for geologists it is far more important to make a a soil  analysis for asteroids, absolutely dissimilar to the Earth, than  for planets similar to ours.    Such a thought is evident for scientists throughout the  world. In any case, this was true at a second Russian-German  conference held recently in Moscow and devoted to these  problems, attended by specialists from the United States, Great  Britain, Italy, France and Japan. It goes without saying that it  is not enough to study these space stones; it is necessary to  know further how to get our hands on this material itself. The  fact is that the ordinary chemical rocket engines by means of  which all our flights into space have been made have now already  almost attained the peak of their possibilities. The farther we  glance into space, the more we sense our helplessness. Flight  with modern engines to the outskirts of the solar system may  last for tens of years. Is it possible to fly by developing a  higher-velocity engine and getting to the goal sooner?    Most of the conferees see an electric rocket engine as such  an alternative. And among all the proposed variants the most  advantageous proved to be the following variant: the body of the  spacecraft, scientific equipment and instruments are to be  fabricated by the Lavochkin Plant, Messerschmidt and other  European concerns. As a booster for entry into orbit it was  decided to use our Proton, but as the power plant for the entire  complex -- a Topaz nuclear reactor. The engine also was  selected. Here the plasma accelerator proved to be ahead of all  the rest.    When the entire world learned of the invention of this new  class of accelerators by Professor Aleksey Morozov in the  1970's, it was decided that the results of the experiments be  put to practical use at once. Now, however, when the time had  come to compare the results and simultaneously lay out on the  table the tens of reports on the tests, an objective jury gave  preference to the quasistationary P50A "Giperboloid"  accelerator, constructed at the Scientific Research Institute of  Applied Mechanics and Electrodynamics of the Moscow Aviation  Institute. Gari Popov, scientific research institute director,  was extremely restrained in his evaluations. He declared to a  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI corespondent that he had no doubt about the  competence of his specialists, they dealt beautifully with the  scientific-production problems but ahead was the most difficult  stage of marketing and sale of products with a high scientific  content, which remains unmastered by the Russians.    In actuality, whereas in purely technical knowledge Russian  and Ukrainian scientists have simply had no equals, our  professors, to speak bluntly, have not been too brilliant in  elementary entrepreneurship. Petr Tsygankov, a specialist at the  Technical University imeni Bauman, after the next report of  foreign luminaries, bitterly joked: "Everything on which they  are working there, that which they only intend to do after many  years and on which they are spending millions of dollars,  already has long gathered dust on the shelf in our country. Let  them come to us, for 10 000 we will not only blow dust from an  absolutely finished item, but also wrap it up . . . ."    To be sure, the funding of our science, which is extremely  far from ideal, is responsible for all. So is it possible to  advise our specialists to leave space at rest, so to speak, to  better times? Especially since the accumulated experience is  sufficient for fully satisfying "terrestrial" orders. Due to all  these same space technologies the Applied Mechanics and  Electrodynamics Scientific Research Institute now can perform  the spraying of virtually any material on any base. Imagine for  yourself what a scope this gives production people. The  Americans have already acquired such apparatus in our country  for the spraying of gold; now they are looking very closely at  the "plasma boiler" made in Moscow.    But the greatest stroke of luck for scientists is  unquestionably the contracts from which they will receive  well-deserved money for ... their principal work -- the  designing of space equipment. Indeed, whereas in economic fields  there are an enormous number of competitors, there are not many  who prefer to deal with superdistant space flights -- they are  technically too complex.    Judge for yourselves: approximately in the year 2000 an 18-m  spacecraft with a nuclear reactor and as a minimum five engines  sets off on its trajectory with a constant acceleration. After  two years it will approach the asteroids, each time even out its  velocity near each body, select the most typical from among  them, release a descent module to reach its surface, which then,  using a liquid-propellant rocket engine, will return to the  Earth. The nuclear ship itself, however, will wander in space,  seeking out and studying newer and newer celestial bodies as  long as the fuel in its reactor suffices.    In the opinion of Gari Popov, the planned mission is so  multiaspect that the ship intended for it can fully execute a  flight to virtually any place in the solar system. Bartelli  Chezeri, a representative of the European Space Agency, revealed  the secret that his organization already has on hand 53  proposals for making flights into distant space for different  scientific missions: study of the satellites of Jupiter, the  rings of Saturn, search for gravity waves, neutrinos, etc. And  this means that they can be regarded as potential orders for the  planned vehicle, which in turn, could become the first  standard-produced general-purpose ship for the solar system.    Europe feels that Russia is the best candidate for carrying  out such an interplanetary mission. But will Russian scientists  live to see its beginning? Recently, incidentally, they learned  that ordinary aluminum spoons from a student's dining table,  covered with gold in space engines, can be sold to cooperative  kiosks. It is true that there are no forks. They have already  disappeared for three years from Moscow institutes. But there  are so many spoons that I am calm for Russian space science and  industry. They will suffice right up to the year 2000.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Plastic has the edge but don't ditch paper yet - What you pay for the money you spend abroad THE GREAT British package holiday is now complete. Not only can the Englishman abroad go to the Costa del Sol and still buy a pint of Watneys and a portion of fish and chips: he can also put his credit or bank card into a hole in the wall and withdraw the local currency from it. The logos of the main plastic card issuers - Visa, MasterCard, Diners Club and American Express - are ubiquitous. They follow you all around the world. Increasingly, banks are plugged in to international networks, and plastic does the work once done by legions of clerks and tellers. But should this be taken to its logical extension - abandoning paper when making foreign transactions? This logic is seductive, but the time has not yet arrived to throw away paper altogether. Diversification is always desirable. Give yourself access to as many forms of payment as possible, even if some are less convenient than others. Then, there is the issue of cost. The surface simplicity hides two factors that can mask the true rate you pay: the bank which issued the card, and the exchange rate. MasterCard and Visa are just brand names into which banks can plug, setting their own terms in the process. Some will charge more than others for foreign currency. The exchange rate is something else. Visa and MasterCard apply a basic conversion rate - generally regarded as reasonable - which different issuing banks are free to alter. This allows them effectively to add extra commission. This can easily be quantified, but even the banks seem confused. The Consumers' Association recently asked them for details of commission via credit cards. The AIB, Amex, Barclays and Northern banks, and the Chelsea and Leeds Permanent building societies replied unequivocally that they did not alter the basic exchange rate. Others, including Lloyds, declined to answer. The CA found that several banks refused to reveal details of changes to exchange rates when asked by customers. But others gave the CA the following information: Beneficial adds 0.25 per cent in commission via the exchange rate. Clydesdale adds 0.6 per cent to Visa rates and 1.6 per cent to Access rates. Halifax adds 1.9 per cent for transactions in Europe and 2.75 per cent for the rest of the world. NatWest adds 2.75 per cent to the standard rate. National &amp; Provincial adds 1.25 per cent. Royal Bank of Scotland adds 1.75 per cent. TSB Northern Ireland Bank adds 2.75 per cent. Ulster Bank adds 2.75 per cent, and; Yorkshire Bank adds 1.2 per cent in Europe and 0.6 per cent in the rest of the world. First Direct and Midland say only that 'the exchange rate will be within 2 per cent of the typical tourist rate as advertised in the UK press.' Barclays uses its own rate, which it says will be 'within 2 or 3 per cent of published commercial rates.' All issuers apply the same rate for currency withdrawals as they do for purchases. None of these rates is outrageous compared with those available elsewhere, but they add up when they are placed on top of commissions and high interest rates for withdrawing currency. When you are making a purchase, credit cards are much more competitive. According to the Credit Card Research Group, which is funded by credit card-issuers, the cost of Dollars 100 on June 1 this year would have been Pounds 56.21 via a credit card, Pounds 58.15 for cash, and Pounds 58.83 by travellers' cheque. These figures take the average of CCRG members' credit card rates plus the average of five high street foreign currency rates (including three clearing banks), and five travellers' cheque rates. For 5,000 pesetas, you would have paid Pounds 28.08 by credit card, Pounds 30.42 for cash and Pounds 31.57 via travellers' cheques. This helps to explain the verdict reached in a recent issue of Which? which compared plastic and paper: 'Plastic generally wins for flexibility and cost, but it's not wise to rely on it completely. In theory, cards should give you access to cash 24 hours a day, but there can be problems.' Paper money comes in more forms than the simple travellers' cheque. For business travellers, Eurocheques have attractions. You pay a stiff annual fee - from Pounds 4 to Pounds 10 - and there will usually be commission of around 1.6 per cent on each transaction. But you can then write a cheque in the local currency, debiting from your normal current account at a standard retail exchange rate. You also receive a guarantee card, which can be used to withdraw money from cash machines - a useful service in Germany where there are 10,650 Eurocheque dispensers compared with 5,449 for Mastercard and 536 for Visa. The cheapest accounts, according to Which? come from the Northern and Ulster banks (Pounds 4 annual fee), Clydesdale (Pounds 5) and AIB bank (Pounds 6). Girobank offers Postcheques, which enable you to draw money from 90,000 post offices around the world but cannot be used for purchases of goods. A book of 10 cheques costs Pounds 6, with a limit of two books per year. The maximum amount you can withdraw varies from Pounds 100 to Pounds 140, and there is a flat 1 per cent commission on each cheque with no variable foreign charges. These may be a slightly expensive way of giving yourself a stop-gap, but they are secure and convenient. Charges on travellers' cheques vary widely. They have the big advantage of security, provided both by the ability to provide replacements and the usual need to produce identification when cashing them. But they are more cumbersome than credit cards, so it is worth buying a few cheques for low amounts - Pounds 10 or Pounds 20. If you are in the US, dollar-denominated cheques change hands as easily as hard cash. Cheques in any other currency are more or less unusable. According to Which?, best buys for travellers' cheques come from Britannia, Halifax, Northern Rock, Portman and Yorkshire building societies, and Northern Bank, at only 1 per cent commission with no minimum. Finally, it is worth shopping around for other good deals. The advent of new payment mechanisms, and the increased willingness of Britons to travel, particularly to Spain, have brought several innovative products in their wake. Travelex, an operator of bureaux de change, is allowing customers to sell back up to 30 per cent of the original amount of their unused currency or travellers' cheques at the same exchange rate and without paying commission. This removes the irritation of spending less than you expected on holiday and getting hammered by the new exchange rate when you return. All the Great British package holidaymaker needs to do is shop around before he leaves, and the Watney's he drinks in Benidorm could be so much cheaper . . .</p>

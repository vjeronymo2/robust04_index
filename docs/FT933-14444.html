			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Electron House up 58% to Pounds 2.25m Steady growth in all market areas enabled Electron House, the electronic components distributor, to record a 58 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 2.25m pre-tax for the year to end-May. The figure was bolstered by a drop in interest charges to Pounds 1.18m (Pounds 2.47m) reflecting lower borrowings following the disposal of the computer wholesaling business in August 1992. The disposal had the effect of reducing year-end gearing on a pro forma basis from 33 per cent to 23 per cent. Group turnover declined from Pounds 125.4m to Pounds 89m. However, sales from continuing operations showed an improvement of Pounds 15.9m at Pounds 78.4m. Earnings improved to 4.92p (2.62p) per share and a proposed final dividend of 1.55p makes a 2.6p (2.35p) total. Mr Robert Leigh, chairman, said early indications were encouraging with strong sales and order intake in the first weeks of the current year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign policy is an area that did not much divide  the parliamentary parties after the change of the regime. After  1990, it was almost fashionable to talk about foreign policy as  a kind of success story and to refer to the foreign policy  consensus between the parties. However, by now, this consensus  is almost entirely broken and foreign policy has become an  organic part of the election campaign. In fact, disagreements  can be suspected in the approach to certain issues within the  coalition and within the opposition parties. Regarding major  foreign policy goals, the political parties tend to agree;  however, there is a sharp debate among them on the order of  priorities and the means to implement these goals. In our  report, we investigated how the current and possible future  parliamentary parties would form foreign policy in the next  governmental cycle.  <H5>  Federation of Young Democrats: Foreign Policy Triangle </H5>   The Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] has formulated  its  concept as a foreign policy triangle that coincides considerably  with the line followed by Hungary since the change of the  regime, Jozsef Szajer, chairman of the party's National  Committee, told MAGYAR NEMZET. Szajer said that this triangle  consists of European integration, national minority policy, and  regional and neighborly cooperation, three factors that are  closely interrelated. The Young Democrats believe that, for  Hungary, there is no alternative to integration and gaining  membership of the European Union [EU], because the cost of  staying out of it would be much higher than the possible costs  of joining.    The Fidesz believes that drawing up the program of domestic  preparations is the most important element of membership, namely  forming the real mechanisms of market economy in a way that will  also conform to the EU's conditions. The Fidesz also considers  legal harmonization necessary, which presumes social and  economic decisions that may cause serious problems and can even  attract heavy burdens. Therefore, the Fidesz believes that the  aim has to be that this preparedness can be proved when the  conditions of joining are set out.    In the case of a nation a third of which is living outside  the borders, the national minority issue will always be a  fundamental and central element of foreign policy, Szajer said.  Neglecting this can cause serious domestic political problems  both in Hungary and in the neighboring states. Therefore, the  Fidesz believes that it has to have a very circumspect policy,  bearing in mind the sentiments of national minorities and of the  majority nations. They see the Antall government's national  minority policy as basically correct, but they found it lacking  empathy with the nations of the neighboring countries.  Hungarian leaders have made statements on a number of occasions  which were ambiguous and did not improve the relationship  between the minority and majority; however, in terms of deeds,  the government has not made any serious mistakes in the past  period, Szajer said. In addition to all this, the Fidesz feels  it necessary to improve communication with the leaders of the  neighboring countries, and considers the continuation of  dialogue very important even if it does not lead to early  results. The long-term solution of the national minority issue  presumably depends on the development of economic cooperation,  which in turn can be very positively influenced by  intergovernmental dialogue. In connection with signing the  basic treaties, Szajer said: If these documents lay down  national minority protection guarantees -- which are essential  for the region's stability -- then the Fidesz does not see any  obstacles to this "symbolic decision." At the same time, they  feel that the basic treaties have to be based on already  functioning economic, cultural, and church agreements.  <H5>  Christian Democratic People's Party: A Quicker Way to Europe </H5>   For us, of primary importance is to live in peace with  neighboring states, which in turn have to respect the rights of  the Hungarian minorities. It is important to accelerate our  approach to Europe. In the interest of strengthening our  security, we believe that NATO should give certain guarantees to  Hungary even before we become full NATO members, was how Laszlo  Varga, deputy chairman of the Christian Democratic People's  Party [KDNP], summed up the party's foreign policy goals.    Talking about relations with our neighbors, he said that the  UN decision of 19 December 1992 clearly laid down the rights of  the national minorities. According to Varga, there is no point  again including the border issue in the basic treaties to be  made with our neighbors because this issue was clearly settled  by the Helsinki Final Act: The borders of countries cannot be  forcefully changed, but it would be a mistake to surrender the  possibility included in the Final Act on facilitating certain  changes through peaceful means and negotiations.    Varga also said that our neighbors should realize that the  Hungarian minorities do not threaten their statehood and  territorial integrity; therefore, it is pointless raising  anxiety and fears. According to Varga, the settlement of the  national minority issue might be advanced by the fact that,  after the emergence of the south Slav crisis and the critical  areas in the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the  West has also recognized the importance of this issue.    Talking about our approach to Europe, Varga explained that,  according to their experience, our membership request that was  submitted at the beginning of April has the support of all the  EU member states, and our efforts are viewed with sympathy;  therefore, it would presumably be possible to accelerate our  process of gaining membership, which might, in an optimal case,  lead to membership in 1998 or 1999.  <H5>  Hungarian Democratic Forum: European Integration and </H5> Hungarians Beyond the Border    The foreign policy priorities of the Hungarian Democratic  Forum [MDF] can be summed up as two points: European  integration and Hungarians beyond the border, Gyorgy Csoti,  foreign affairs spokesman of the MDF, told MAGYAR NEMZET. These  two elements of the foreign policy program are inseparable and  neither can be placed above the other. Good-neighborly  relations have a basic importance and they are in the interests  of Hungary and of the Hungarians living beyond the border,  while, at the same time, they are inseparable from the situation  of these Hungarians. Good-neighborly relations can only be a  result of the settling of the problems of minority Hungarians  because this is virtually the only reason for our tense  relations with the neighboring countries. According to Csoti,  it is inconceivable for the Hungarian Government first to form  good relations with the leadership of the neighboring countries  and then the situation of the Hungarians beyond the border to  improve as a result of this. He pointed out that, in the  history of the past 74 years, none of the governments was able  to resolve this issue; in fact, although interstate relations  were excellent, the situation of the Hungarians beyond the  border has continued to deteriorate over the past 45 years.  According to Csoti, the situation of the minority Hungarians is  most critical in Romania. Owing to the new Moravcik government,  the prospects are better in Slovakia, and in Serbia, too.    Csoti denied that the MDF's foreign policy has changed in  connection with Yugoslavia. A year and a half ago, the  Hungarian Government said that limited military intervention can  curb the violence and the escalation of the war, and, at that  time, a chance still existed for this. However, these constant  threats that are never implemented will lose their credibility,  and even if Belgrade takes them seriously, they are having a  decreasing effect on the events. By now, we probably have a  Lebanon-style crisis that can only be handled in the long term.  For this very reason, certain doubts were raised, among other  things, in connection with the fruitless embargo. Csoti  believes that it has to be reassessed, rather than discarded.  It has to be eased, or made total, even together with military  actions, in the interest of an early result, because it is  untenable since a long drawn-out embargo is also a burden on  other countries of the region. However, on the embargo issue,  the MDF is not in favor of unilateral Hungarian measures; UN  decisions have to be observed even if Hungary, as a badly  affected country, raises doubts.    Csoti also denied that, even initially, the government had  tried to keep distance from the region of the former Soviet  Union. The initial difficulties can be explained through the  completely collapsed economies and the approximately $2 billion  debts of Russia, Ukraine, and the other former Soviet republics.  However, the Hungarian Government immediately stood by  Gorbachev and Yeltsin when anti-democratic coups were attempted  against them, and it was Budapest that first made an agreement  with Russia and Ukraine. However, according to the MDF, Hungary  cannot commit itself to any of the major powers even if, for  historical reasons, relations with certain countries are closer  than with others.  <H5>  Hungarian Socialist Party: To Reestablish Consensus </H5>   It is the responsibility of the future governing parties to  change the perception of consensus and to reestablish it by  including the opposition in foreign policy decisions that affect  the country's fundamental interests, and by acquiring for these  the support of the broadest possible public, Laszlo Kovacs,  chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, said  for the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], also using this as an  argument for his party's proposal to confirm our EU and NATO  membership in a referendum. In his view, the major directions  of foreign policy that were contained in the 1990 government  program accepted by Parliament have to be preserved: close ties  with the West, normal relations with the neighbors, and support  for the assertion of the rights of Hungarians living beyond the  border. These major directions follow from Hungary's interests  and circumstances, and from the international conditions, and  the parties have had a consensus on these issues. However,  Kovacs believes that, owing to the "government's clumsiness," we  have not managed to get as close to these goals as was possible;  in fact, relations with our neighbors have deteriorated -- "with  some of them expressly" -- which, together with other factors,  has damaged Hungary's foreign image and limited the  effectiveness of Hungarian foreign policy, including the  efficiency of efforts made in the interest of Hungarians living  beyond the border.    In his party's view, the relationship between the major  directions of foreign policy has to be changed. A balance has  to be established because these three directions are closely  interrelated and if we try to assert any one of them to the  detriment of the other two, this will have a negative effect on  the whole foreign policy. The foreign policy attitude also  needs to be changed. We cannot start from a sense of a mission,  and foreign policy cannot be based on historical grievances or  merits, on desires or assumptions. Foreign policy has to be  based on interests, mutual interests of Hungary and the partner  states have to be found, or the opportunity has to be  established to coordinate these interests, Kovacs emphasized.  He also said that we have to take international realities as a  basis, and we have to keep assessing them and gauging the  changes. We have to start from the "actual support" for the  country's international efforts, and we "must not overestimate  Hungary's international importance and role."    The MSZP would also like to change the foreign political  instrument system and the style of foreign policy. It would  stop the practice of trying to "exert pressure" on our neighbors  as this has not been successful in the past four years, either.  The restriction of relations cannot be a foreign policy  instrument, either, because none of our neighbors needs  cooperation as much as we do; and we must not try to isolate any  of our neighbors and hinder their access to international  organizations.    At negotiations, the partner must not be treated in a  condescending manner or lectured, not even on Hungarian history.  It is not the task of Hungarian politicians to make up for the  deficiencies, for example, of Western history education, Kovacs  says. On the other hand, we have to initiate  confidence-building gestures. In politics, we need "to  understand the partner's way of thinking," and it is very  important to remove the possibilities of misunderstandings and  misinterpretations. This is one of the reasons that respect for  expertise in foreign policy has to be restored, and the practice  that "ambassadors and diplomats, fearing their positions, report  what they believe the government or the Foreign Ministry  leadership would like to hear" has to be stopped.  <H5>  Workers' Party: Opening Also to the East </H5>   A serious party cannot ignore the European directions of  development; therefore, the Workers' Party is in favor of  developing extensive relations in all directions, including the  East, Joachim Vasas, member of the party's Executive Committee,  emphasized. However, a referendum will have to decide on EU and  NATO membership. It is essential that the integration processes  are not implemented to the detriment of the country. Up to now,  the agricultural sector and industry have been sacrificed at the  altar of EU membership and the market of Hungarian goods in  Hungary and in the neighboring countries has been destroyed.  The country will continue to be waiting for EU membership for  years to come because the European Union always backtracks,  shuts itself off, makes conditions, and dictates. For  professional and political reasons, the Workers' Party does not  support NATO membership, because this is against Hungary's  elementary national interests. Yugoslavia, Romania, or Ukraine  are unlikely to become NATO members, and a Hungarian membership  would only increase distrust, further annoy our neighbors, and  damage the situation of Hungarians living there. We must strive  for normal and balanced economic and political relations with  the neighboring countries, Vasas continued, because this  establishes the basis for improving the situation of Hungarian  minorities living there. As a matter of fact, the Hungarian  Parliament, by denying the right to the national minorities  living in Hungary to set up independent electoral lists, has  lost its ground to speak up for the Hungarians living beyond the  border in a credible way.  <H5>  Alliance of Free Democrats: Small Steps Toward Our Neighbors </H5>   The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] starts from the  premise that the three major foreign policy areas, namely  European integration, relations with neighboring countries, and  the problem of Hungarian minorities living beyond the borders,  need to be handled together, Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, foreign  affairs spokesman of the SZDSZ, told MAGYAR NEMZET. As for the  Europe policy, it is the party's strategic goal that membership  of the European Union must follow adequate preparations. This  foreign policy task also has many domestic political  implications, mainly in the area of the economy and legal  harmonization, and the necessary institutions will have to be  established to coordinate the preparations.    Rather than the time of membership, they consider it vital  that the process actually begins and talks on membership are  started as soon as possible. Until then, the SZDSZ advocates  that cooperation with the European Union should be increasingly  diverse. At the same time, in the area of foreign and security  policy, they wish to ensure an earlier participation of Hungary  in European institutions, and they would also like to achieve  our participation in the work of the important European  decision-making bodies with consultative rights before full  membership is achieved.    As for neighborhood policy, according to Szent-Ivanyi, this  is the weak side, the most vulnerable part of Hungarian foreign  policy at the moment. While there is a general consensus of  goals on Europe policy, the approaches fundamentally differ on  neighborhood policy. We must not set ideological-style  conditions; rather, our interest lies in the ability to make  progress concomitantly in two closely related areas, namely in  ensuring the rights of Hungarians beyond the border and  improving bilateral relations. In the area of neighborhood  policy, the politics of small steps is important to make various  economic agreements and strengthen cultural links, and it is the  SZDSZ's goal that we contribute to the improvement of the  situation of Hungarians beyond the border through these links,  too. As for the possible signing of the basic treaties, the  SZDSZ starts from the premise that these treaties are a means  rather than an end: A means to settling the existing problems.  Therefore, they advocate such basic treaties that can  contribute to easing the disagreements. They do not reject that  issues considered important by the partners -- including the  border issue -- can be part of these treaties; however, they  only see any point in this if the treaties can also resolve the  issues considered important by Hungary.    In the SZDSZ's view, security policy is inseparable from  foreign policy. They consider Hungary's NATO membership a  strategic goal. They hope that this can be achieved in a  foreseeable period, within a few years. Until then, it is  necessary to prepare the proposal that outlines Hungary's tasks  within the "Partnership for Peace" program as soon as possible.  <H5>  Independent Smallholders Party: Turning Toward Asia </H5>   Although the traditional directions of foreign relations  have  to be maintained, instead of the "one-sided foreign policy  orientation," the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP] wishes  to lay emphasis on areas hitherto neglected. The party led by  Jozsef Torgyan would conduct a foreign policy that also  considers our economic interests and would pay more attention to  Europe, and, for example, to the Scandinavian region. An  orientation toward Asia is marked in the party's foreign policy  program, they would a "give new meaning" to our policy on this  region, mainly to cooperation with India and China, and they  would also lay more emphasis on relations with Japan and the  "Asian tigers," including Taiwan.    On the issue of Hungarians living beyond the border, the  FKGP intends to form good-neighborly relations with all  neighboring countries, but a triple autonomy, namely cultural,  personal, and territorial autonomy, is a condition for this.  According to the FKGP, collective rights, self-determination,  and autonomy are the three basic pillars of the rights due to  Hungarians living beyond the border.  <H5>  Hungarian Justice and Life Party: National Interest Comes </H5> First    The Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP] considers  European integration important but this cannot enjoy priority  over national interests, MIEP Cochairman Lajos Horvath said.  The MIEP feels that Hungarian foreign policy's lukewarm  attitude to the national minorities is due to the fact that, in  the interest of European integration, its politicians are trying  to give the impression that Hungary would even be prepared to  abandon the interest protection of its own national minorities  in the interest of gaining membership. From the Hungarian  security point of view, it would be good if NATO accepted it as  a member, but we have to be aware that, through the peace  partnership, NATO has actually rejected Central Europe, so we  have to organize our security policy cognisant of this fact.  Only a referendum can decide on possible membership.    The fate of the national minorities living beyond the border  has a definite priority within the MIEP's policy. It is  important to build good relations with the neighboring countries  but this cannot depend on basic treaties, and certainly cannot  be a repeat of the formula laid down in the basic treaty with  Ukraine. In the spirit of the Helsinki Accord, the MIEP is  against the forceful alteration of borders but, apart from this,  it is totally unnecessary to lay down these principles again.  This would be a gesture submitting ourselves to the will of  others, which cannot be accepted by a proud nation.</p>

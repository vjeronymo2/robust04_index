			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / USAir disaster is fifth in five years: British Airways affirms its partnership with the financially troubled US carrier US federal aviation investigators yesterday mounted a search to discover the cause of the fifth crash of a USAir passenger airliner in as many years, which was feared to have killed all 132 people on board. The accident is a further blow to the financially troubled airline, in which British Airways holds a 24.6 per cent stake, and led to the brief suspension of USAir's shares on the New York stock exchange. But Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, said in Atlanta the UK carrier had no plans to pull out of its partnership with USAir, the sixth largest US carrier, which is trying to put together a sweeping restructuring package to stem heavy losses. He denied suggestions that the US carrier's financial problems were connected to the crashes. The accident, involving a Boeing 737-300 twin-engine aircraft on its landing approach near Pittsburgh airport on Thursday night, was the worst in the US since a Northwest Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-80 crashed on take-off at Detroit in 1987, killing 156 people. Although investigators found the aircraft's 'black box' flight recorder, which they hoped would provide clues to the cause of the crash, officials yesterday said the cause could take weeks to establish because of what one called 'the severity' of the accident. The aircraft, en route from Chicago, was preparing to land when it plunged into a ravine about half a mile from a shopping centre. Some witnesses said the aircraft lost power and appeared to have suffered a shutdown of both engines. Others said there was an explosion before the aircraft nosedived into the wooded ravine. Weather conditions were clear in the area before the crash. Pittsburgh airport lost radar contact with the aircraft at 6,000ft seven miles west of the airport, a Pittsburgh airport official said. BA has extensive commercial links with its US partner and has already warned it will not inject any further money into USAir until it is satisfied with the restructuring. It has also warned it may write off its Dollars 400m (Pounds 258m) investment in the airline. In New York, USAir shares dropped by 7.5 per cent to Dollars 6 1/8 at the close on heavy volume of 2m shares. BA shares closed in London 9p lower at 401p, reflecting the overall decline in the stock market but also concerns over USAir. The crash came just before public hearings into another fatal accident this year, involving the crash during a thunderstorm of a USAir McDonnell Douglas DC9 near Charlotte-Douglas airport in North Carolina on July 2 which killed 37 of the 57 people on board. Boeing said the 737-300 which crashed on Thursday was delivered to USAir in October 1987. It also said that more than 2,600 737s had been delivered to airlines throughout the world since 1967. The 737-300, which can seat 128-149 passengers, is the mid-sized member of the current second generation of the 737 family. Boeing has launched a programme to develop a new generation of 737s.</p>

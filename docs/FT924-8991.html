			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Fashion: How to keep water out and heat in - Daniel Green has two questions for ski clothes manufacturers IT IS HARD to be chic when you are cold and wet. But while some fashion-conscious skiers dress to impress the dog-walkers of Gstaad, a snowstorm would leave them no better off than the poodles: miserable and bedraggled. Stay dry and warm by asking two questions about any garment that you fancy: Is it waterproof? Of course, the fabric should be waterproof, but that is not much help if the seams leak. Seams must be sealed with tape. They may be glued shut, but then cleaning with detergent could turn this season's waterproof into next season's sieve. Is it breathable? Sweat needs to be able to evaporate through the material. The alternative is to leave a trail of salt water on the floor of your favourite mountain restaurant as the sweat emerges the only way it can: through the bottoms of your ski pants. The result of these inquiries will probably lead you to an item with a Gore-Tex label. Gore-Tex is a lining with microscopic holes that are big enough to let water vapour from evaporated sweat out but too small to let liquid water from rain or melted snow in. Gore-Tex is not the only waterproof breathable fabric, but it is one of the most highly-rated and the most heavily marketed. It is also the most expensive. Alan Waugh, a director of Phoenix which makes some of the highest specification ski-wear in the UK, said: 'The materials in a Gore-Tex garment account for 50 per cent of the cost of manufacture. On a normal item, the figure is only 30 per cent.' A Phoenix Gore-Tex jacket retails at Pounds 265 and similar makes such as Degre 7 and Mover cost about the same. Alternative fabrics include Sympatex, more common on the Continent, Entrant, on Canada's Couloir label, MPC from Tenson and DPS from Head. Since 1990, Gore-Tex garments have been given a three-year dryness guarantee. Each design is tested in a rain chamber to one of seven standards: ordinary skiers need the GPS1 standard while ski-tourers need the higher specification GPS2. The other standards cover such sports as hunting and motorcycling. Gore-Tex is, however, not the answer to every problem. If you only ski when it is sunny, it is overkill. 'The breathability is never as good once you add extra layers, even Gore-Tex,' says Toyin Latunji, ski-wear buyer at Harrods. 'And it doesn't matter if the seams leak if it's not raining.' Paradoxically, she says, it is beginners who need waterproofing most, as they fall over on lower, wetter slopes. Good intermediates and experts might want to sacrifice some waterproofing for improved breathability. The experts' choice is microfibres, found in ICI's Tactel Micro. When microfibres are used for both weft and warp, clothing can withstand several minutes of rain. Although not as waterproof as Gore-Tex or its rivals, prices are slightly lower: Head's 2169 jacket, for example, retails at around Pounds 220. Water can still get in up sleeves and down necks. Make sure that the fit is snug and watch out for cost-cutting at the cuff. A simple elasticated cuff, such as on the GSL ladies patterned ski top (Pounds 99) or the polar bear and snowflake patterned lilac one-piece ski-suit from Luhta (Pounds 169.50) could end up a slush trap after a day's skiing. A better design is for the sleeve to extend beyond the wrist before turning inwards and backwards to meet the elasticated cuff. Any cuff should have a velcro strap or buckle for tightening over or under a glove. For warmth, the choice is between having separate thin layers or buying one item with several layers sewn in. Manufacturers favour the multi-layered approach, perhaps because they sell more garments that way. But modern insulating materials are very effective. The main advantage of layering is that if the weather is warm and dry, you can peel off gradually. US-brand Patagonia specialises in selling eight separate inner layers to draw sweat away from the skin, 12 middle insulation layers and 12 outer water and wind-proofing layers. Whatever you choose, that inner layer should be of an artificial fibre. Natural materials absorb and hold on to moisture. Your arrival home at the end of the day in the mountains might be too clammy even for your poodle to appreciate.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Response to the Jordanian Proposals"] </F>   [Text] During His Majesty King Husayn's meeting with U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher in London yesterday, the  U.S. secretary said that the United States has responded to the  proposals presented by Jordan to lift the siege of al-'Aqabah.  He added that the inspections will be carried out by a neutral  civilian body in the Port of al-'Aqabah instead of by offshore  military vessels.    The U.S. response to the Jordanian proposals came as a  result  of a solid Jordanian stand following Jordan's announcement on  many occasions on its compliance with the UN resolutions. The  inspection of 1,700 ships bound for al-'Aqabah has proven that  these resolutions were not violated.    Jordan has also announced that the offshore inspections are  useless because there are too many other gateways to Iraq and  because no inspection is carried out at these gateways.  Therefore, there is no point in continuing the siege of  al-'Aqabah alone unless the siege has other objectives related  to the Jordanian stand vis-a-vis the peace process and  negotiations.    As the prime minister asserted in his meeting with the Arab  and foreign journalists yesterday, Jordan rejects any  encroachment on its sovereignty by any foreign side. The  proposals presented by Jordan stipulate that a non-political and  not-for-profit party should carry out monitoring work, not  inspection, while Jordanian customs employees inspect the  containers that arrive at the port on board al-'Aqabah-bound  ships. The proposals also stipulate that the recommended party  -- Lloyds Register -- is to monitor, check the documents of the  cargo, and to report to those in charge of implementing the  sanctions on Iraq.    The U.S. agreement on the Jordanian proposals will end a  clear contradiction between the objectives of the peace process  and the unjustified imposition of sanctions on Jordan, for which  it has paid dearly from its national economy.</p>

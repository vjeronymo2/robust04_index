			<p>BFN     [Text] Government and communist rebels have agreed to hold  the second round of exploratory talks during the third quarter  this year. The government panel, headed by Ambassador Howard  Dee and the National Democratic Front (NDF) panel led by Luis  Jalandoni reached the agreement during a marathon meeting at  Breukelen, the Netherlands last 10 to 14 June.    In a joint statement, Messrs. Jalandoni and Dee said the  next round of talks will "discuss and agree" on the sequence and  the functions of different working committees. The reciprocal  working committees in turn will study and make recommendations  for the panels in order to forge a lasting peace settlement.    The talks were earlier stalled because of several  misunderstandings on key issues. The NDF had also repeatedly  questioned the sincerity of the government.    Last month, negotiations between two parties almost broke  apart with the capture of Communist Party of the Philippines  Secretary General Wilma Tiamzon. After President Ramos ordered  her release, optimisms were raised on the gesture's effect on  the talks.    Mr. Jalandoni said the talks which ended yesterday resulted  in the "clarification of issues and perspectives on both sides."    Mr. Dee earlier complained about the NDF's hesitance to  engage in preliminary talks, saying the political wing of the  communist party failed to communicate with the government panel.  Mr. Jalandoni said he is pleased with the outcome of the  preliminary meeting.    "The Breukelen meeting is significant step on the long and  tortuous road towards a just and lasting peace in our country,"  he said. He added the meeting showed the NDF's commitment to  lasting peace in the country.    The two panels also signed a ten-point agreement preparatory  to the resumption of the second round of talks.</p>

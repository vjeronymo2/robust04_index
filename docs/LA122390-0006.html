			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHERE IS MR. SMITH?  </P> <P> Television is a big problem in American political apathy. We need to limit its  use politically.  </P> <P> There should be one week, and one week only, when candidates should be allowed  on television. There should be a week of debates in which candidates'  qualifications and backgrounds are discussed, when voters can see them over  some time, not just in 30-second bites.  </P> <P> If we insist that politicians not have access to television to manipulate, it  will be a different world.  </P> <P> SKIP PRESS  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

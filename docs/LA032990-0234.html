			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> RAIN DELAYS SENIORS' TRADITION  </P> <P> Rain and hail washed out first-round play today and reduced the Tradition at  Desert Mountain tournament to a three-day, 54-hole format.  </P> <P> Jack Nicklaus, scheduled to make his first official start in Seniors Tour play,  had not teed off when play was called for the day at 1:28 p.m. MST.  </P> <P> None of the 78 players had reached the turn when heavy rain and hail sent them  scurrying for cover. Part of the course was flooded. Bunkers filled to  overflowing. Tees and greens became ponds, and some gravel roads leading to the  course were washed out.  </P></p>

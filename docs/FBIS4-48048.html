			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jovial Rantao] </F>   [Excerpt] The National Party [NP] intends to attempt to  wrest control of the foreign affairs and defence portfolios from  the ANC, reliable sources have informed THE STAR. The NP wants  its own men in the new Cabinet in the places of Alfred Nzo and  former Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military  wing] commander Joe Modise, who were appointed to those  Ministries by the ANC on Friday [6 May].    THE STAR's sources said De Klerk wanted to retain both Pik  Botha and Kobie Coetsee in two of the most powerful positions in  the Cabinet. A confrontation between the outgoing and future  governments is expected over the posts.    However, ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said as far as his  organisation was concerned, the Cabinet issue had not reached  finality and Cabinet positions would, in the spirit of the  government of national unity and reconstruction, be negotiated  with the NP, the Inkatha Freedom Party and other political  players. NP sources told THE STAR that Roelf Meyer, the  Government's chief negotiator in the multiparty negotiations  would retain his Constitutional Development Ministry.    The other four NP men tipped to fill Cabinet seats are  Public  Enterprise Minister Dawie de Villiers and Leon Wessels, the  current Minister of Manpower.    Derek Keys would retain his finance portfolio, so would Abe  Williams retain sports.    In the three NP Deputy Ministers' posts, De Klerk is said to  be willing to reward some up and coming black, coloured and  white politicians. The posts could either go to David  Chuenyane, who was the highest black on the party election list;  Sheila Camerer, outgoing Deputy Minister of Justice; Chris  Fismer, a Deputy Minister in the State President's office, Jac  Rabie, former Minister of Population Development and Bhadra  Ranchod, the current Minister of Tourism.    The Inkatha Freedom party's three seats would be filled by  Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Joe Matthews and Dr. Ben Ngubane, THE STAR  learnt last night. [passage omitted]</p>

The paper pointed out that Iraqi intelligence prepared a  plan  to lure a number of Iraqi opposition leaders living in Syria to  the Kurdish area and from there to Mosul, where they were left  to contact active elements of the [Iraqi] opposition; then they  were arrested. The paper added that the plan succeeded and that  death sentences were carried out on at least 10, including  Muhamad al-Tai, who was described as a member of the dissident  Iraqi regional command.    Sources of the dissident Iraqi regional command leadership  in  Damascus remained silent, but AL-WATAN paper reported these  sources as saying that al-Tai acted individually and without  orders from the leadership.    The paper said it was announced in Mosul that the bodies of  five victims have been received, and that the rest are believed  to have been killed during interrogation.</p>

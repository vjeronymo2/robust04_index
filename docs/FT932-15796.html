			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Warrant triggers a war of words RELATIONS between Fiat, the Italian vehicle manufacturer, and the Milan magistrates investigating alleged political corruption have deteriorated ahead of the expected return to Italy next week of Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, the company's chief operating officer. Magistrates issued a warrant on Wednesday for the arrest of Mr Garuzzo, former managing director of Fiat's Iveco truck and bus subsidiary, who is in London. The move was in connection with alleged kickbacks on purchases of Iveco buses by the Milan municipality. Mr Piercamillo Davigo, one of the magistrates conducting inquiries, said the problem of arrests of leading businessmen would be resolved 'the day Fiat stops paying kickbacks or behaving in a way which allows them to be paid'. His comments were in response to a statement from Mr Garuzzo on Wednesday night that he had offered to testify before magistrates last week and had been turned down. 'I can only think that, as has happened to a number of people recently, the Italian investigating authorities prefer to hear from persons after they have been arrested,' he said. The arrest and imprisonment of suspects has been criticised by some lawyers, who claim indiscriminate prison spells have been used to extract confessions and implicate individuals. The Milan magistrates' tough response suggests there will be confrontation when Mr Garuzzo returns to Italy after Easter. In a statement from its Turin headquarters after the warrant was issued, Fiat said it was 'preoccupied' by the affair. Separately, Naples magistrates requesting parliamentary permission to investigate five prominent local politicians are believed to have identified Mr Antonio Gava, a leading Christian Democrat senator and former minister, as the central figure in alleged links with organised crime. The allegations stem from leaked details of a 200-page document sent by magistrates to parliament outlining the allegations, which are based on testimony from a local boss of the Camorra criminal organisation who is now co-operating with the authorities. Mr Claudio Moreno, the Italian ambassador to Argentina, has been arrested on charges of involvement with corruption and kickbanks in Italy's aid programme to developing countries. Mr Moreno is the third senior diplomat to be arrested by Rome magistrates following the earlier detentions of Mr Giuseppe Santoro, former head of the aid programme, and Mr Michele Martinez, ambassador to Indonesia.</p>

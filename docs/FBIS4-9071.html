			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 18 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Lyuben  Berov is working in the privacy of his hospital room at the  Lozenets Hospital of the Military Medical Academy in Sofia, the  government Press Office said today. "Prof. Berov is in a good  state of health. His stomach complaint and the slight yellowing  of his eyes have passed," says a communique issued today at noon  by Dr. Todor Gerasimov, chief of the Lozenets Hospital. Berov's  liver function is returning to normal, biochemical tests carried  out in Bulgaria show. Blood serum has been sent to Germany to  be tested for hepatitis type C but the results are not out yet.    A month ago Berov had a quadruple bypass operation from  which  he recuperated enough to attend a government meeting. Early  last week he was hospitalized again as he developed the symptoms  of an acute liver condition. The diagnosis has not been  specified yet. Medics assume that Berov either had a passing  mechanical obstruction of the bile ducts or suffered from a  light form of viral hepatitis type C.</p>

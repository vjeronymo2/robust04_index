			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Ireland in drive to halve 20% unemployment rate MR Ruari Quinn, Ireland's minister for enterprise and employment, believes Ireland's unemployment rate can be halved by the end of the decade from 20 per cent to around 10 per cent, as a result of policies being manoeuvred into place by the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition government. These include renewed emphasis on promoting indigenous Irish industry, on targeting small businesses with venture capital funding, on legislating for new investment products which will encourage equity investment by fund managers in Irish industry, 'and massive investment in improving the skills base of the workforce,' he said. Until January Mr Quinn was the Irish Labour Party's spokesman on economic affairs. Labour's breakthrough at last November's election gave it leverage to negotiate for powerful positions in the coalition government. One of those was Mr Quinn's, which merged the ministerial post of labour with those of industry and commerce. 'We have merged the two departments because we want to do away with the old adversarial approach in the process of wealth creation and replace it with a social partnership approach. We want agreement between industry, the unions and government on a long-term strategy - so that any foreign investor can come here to Ireland and knock on the door of any of the three and know that we are all talking the same langauage,' he said. Ireland's past three finance ministers, starting with Mr Ray MacSharry in 1987, all adopted this approach, firstly through the Programme for National Recovery, and later through the Programme for Social and Economic Progress. The public sector pay elements of this agreement will expire at the end of this year. Both programmes have sought to lay down macro-economic parameters to attain price stability, reduce government debt and to improve incomes through economic growth and gradual tax reductions. They have been largely successful. Ireland's economy has outperformed most EC partners over the past five years in GDP growth. The cost, however, has been heavy in unemployment. Labour's success at the polls last year was largely on the back of the lengthening dole queues and the expectation that Labour would do something to reverse the trend. 'Our strategy is to build on a skill-based workforce. We are no longer a country of low-cost labour, and we don't aspire to return to that. Low-cost manufacturing jobs are drifting out of Europe anyway. We want intellectual skills-based industry here, such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, telemarketing and software. We shall continue to promote foreign investment, but our central focus will be on building and strengthening indigenous companies,' he said. Where will the funding come from to finance these plans? Mr Quinn says that the IPounds 8bn (Pounds 8bn) in EC structural and cohesion funds due to be paid to Ireland over the next seven years will go a long way to help finance improvements. But he hopes the bulk will come from new equity investment.</p>

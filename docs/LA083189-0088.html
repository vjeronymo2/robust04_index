			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANNED ENERGY;  </P> <P> GRAFFITI KING WHO FOUND A WAY TO MAKE HIS TALENT PAY EXPLAINS THE LURE OF BARE  WALLS  </P> <P> Matthew C. Dunn has done some "burningest" pieces in his time, but his days as  a Los Angeles graffiti king are, for the most part, behind him.  </P> <P> The 26-year-old Venice resident now holds a grown-up's job as a computer  graphics designer. Graffiti are strictly a sideline these days, and a  commercial one at that -- his work has appeared in advertisements in Rolling  Stone, Sports Illustrated and L.A. Style magazines.  </P> <P> And now, Dunn, who boasts of having once stolen 75 cans of spray paint at a  time, will "burn" a graffiti "piece" on your baby's bedroom wall -- for a  price.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ties to Streets  </P> <P> "I'm a gang of one," said Dunn, brash and affable. "I've always done pretty  much what I wanted."  </P> <P> To encounter Dunn is to encounter a grown-up version of the hundreds of  graffiti "taggers" and gang-member look-alikes who roam Los Angeles each night,  engaging in an activity that will cost the Southern California Rapid Transit  District alone $8 million this year in cleanup costs for its buses and  buildings. But grown up or not, he retains strong ties to the street and  remembers with affection the nights of his youth spent with his graffiti crew.  </P> <P> "We did it for fun and fame," said Dunn, dressed in sweat-top and knee-split  jeans after a day of computer design work at a Beverly Hills travel agency.  And, although he has shaken the habit -- turning instead to steady work, a  girlfriend and a lucrative graffiti-painting hobby -- he sees little evidence  that many other painters will soon follow.  </P> <P> Dunn grew up in a middle-class Westside neighborhood and attended Culver City  High School and Santa Monica College. There, he toyed with the punk-rock  movement, break-dancing and rap music. Members of his old graffiti group still  work in music, art and dance across California and in New York.  </P> <P> Sitting at a kitchen table in the Venice house he shares with two roommates and  their dog, Dunn leafs through his portfolio, a set of Polaroid photographs and  a pile of his graffiti sketch books, the vital ledgers he used to measure his  life's work as recently as two years ago.  </P> <P> "Some people live for this," he said, showing dozens, then hundreds of pages of  sketches, highly stylized, broadly imaginative, bursting with color. Some are  whimsical, some menacing.  </P> <P> "They spend their days racking (stealing) paint, sketching pieces. There are  graffiti conventions, underground newspapers," he said. Dunn remembers how,  fresh out of Culver City High School in 1980, he worked ideas for his book of  drawings in cars, at work, at friends' homes, anywhere he had an instant. Then  came nights spent searching for concrete canvases.  </P> <P> Dunn, who has enrolled in several art courses but never completed one, says he  was drawn by "the finished product," the artistic impact of the graffiti.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Energy and Impact  </P> <P> "You break letters into bits, you change the whole style of a letter, you whack  it out, you really exaggerate its curves or harden its corners, you slice it  up, add thickness, put arrows through it or give it motion," he said.  </P> <P> "You make it bust," he concluded. "Bust," it becomes clear, is a central  concept of graffiti art; it refers to the energy of the completed work, and the  impact it has on a viewer.  </P> <P> "There's an energy to that (spray) can," he insisted, hands shaking with  intensity and eyes staring at a remote point, "It's carried out to that paint.  It's part of that experience."  </P> <P> It is an experience, he says, that is hard to let go.  </P> <P> "I was hooked," he confessed. And even now, Dunn says, he has an occasional  relapse; just two months he was out on a midnight burn, which was interrupted  by the arrival of police.  </P> <P> But in his bedroom there is evidence that Dunn has moved to different concerns.  On the wall is a spray-painted 4-by-6-foot self-portrait on canvas. "I haven't  decided if I'm going to sell it," he said.  </P> <P> He has fewer reservations about parting with other, less personal works. In his  first venture into commercial art, he sold a work for a case of beer. This  year, he launched a personal venture called Coolart -- involving the home  delivery of graffiti. For somewhere between $25 and several hundred dollars,  depending on the size and complexity of the job, he will paint a wall, a room,  a storefront or the side of a garage. Together with his work for advertisers,  Dunn says his painting has netted him between $6,000 and $7,000 so far this  year.  </P> <P> His television and print credits include backdrops for music videos and  advertisements for H. J. Heinz Co.'s Steak-Umm microwaveable snack and TDK  Electronics Corp. (the latter netted him $2,000). A work on an 8-by-10-foot  piece of denim brought $700, although Dunn learned that the item later sold for  $10,000 to a group of clothing designers interested in the look, he says.  </P> <P> But most young graffiti crew members paint only out of competition, ego, and  fascination. "They don't care" about money or what society thinks, Dunn says.  "They want the exposure, they want to be up, they want the approval of their  fellow artists."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Broken Homes  </P> <P> Dunn, though no social scientist, believes urban graffiti are a symptom of  broader social problems:  </P> <P> "Society has inherent problems. Families are broken up, everybody comes from a  broken home, right? Kids don't have their needs met; then, on the street, they  find some way of getting their needs met, if it's punk or dance or art."  </P> <P> Dunn's father left the family when he was 2 months old.  </P> <P> "All the best painters I know and the people into the underground scene come  from an alcoholic family or an abusive family or a broken home," he said.  </P> <P> "I'm a conscientious painter," he added, insisting that he works only in  "places that are OK to paint." For Dunn, these include public areas, run-down  buildings, freeway retaining walls, auto or train yards, alleys -- anywhere, in  short, where he determines that "there's a cement wall there and (paint)  doesn't do any harm."  </P> <P> He offhandedly condemns what he sees as ugly graffiti: black, one-line scrawls  typically written by gang members in roll-call fashion, or bland pieces put up  by graffiti painters who are simply after exposure.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Wrong Way  </P> <P> But moments later, he insists that there is no need to be judgmental. "It does  violate (a code) for me to tell what another artist should be doing," he said.  "I could never say what another artist does is wrong."  </P> <P> Clean-up efforts, which do not attack the underlying social issues, will keep  failing because they don't meet the painters at their level, Dunn says.  </P> <P> "There really is no way to do it," Dunn contended, dismissing the latest effort  by Los Angeles against graffiti: legislation that would pay property owners to  clean off paint or face heavy penalties. "The only way to get control of it is,  if the leaders of the crews stop tagging up nice buildings in nice  neighborhoods. And that'll never happen."  </P> <P> Reduced to their basics, Dunn says, graffiti are just communications from a  group of youths who feel they have no other voice.  </P> <P> "There was such a rush the first time I went out and did it," he said, "It's  not gang activity. . . . It's not bad street stuff. Everyone's just trying to  bust better."  </P> <P> "For me, it's a part of me, it's my vision, my heart," Dunn said. "It's my  best, busting out to you to see what you can do."  </P></p>

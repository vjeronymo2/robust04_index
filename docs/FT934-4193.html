			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / As They Say in Europe: Mistaken identity Now to get back to a subject I would have tackled in the past couple of weeks except for other matters intervening. I shall not allow the week's dreary round of comment on the British Budget to deflect me. Last month, the 75th anniversary of almost everything was celebrated, including the foundation of the Austrian republic. Never has this November date seemed so relevant to current events, at least to the Austrian press. The significance of the collapse of the empire was summarised in the biggest-selling tabloid, Kurier. It noted that the monarchy's multi-racial army occupied huge tracts of foreign soil by late-1918 and, 'in a typical piece of Austrian nonsense,' surrendered in Padua to an Italian army it had already beaten soundly. We are still dealing with the consequences of the subsequent collapse: Czechs and Slovaks pushed into a common state; millions of Hungarians left as minorities and as potential problems for Romania, Serbia and Slovakia; and Slovenes and Croats locked into a south Slav state where the Serbs played the role of victor. In Bosnia, there began a wave of persecution of those Moslems and Croats who had been loyal to the monarchy. Austria lost South Tyrol and became 'the state nobody wanted'; all the natives did want was union with Germany, so the Nazis entered the country 20 years later under the pretext of 'expressing the true will of Austrians.' Kurier concluded that the end of the empire was the 'beginning of an endless tragedy of ethnic and national conflicts in central Europe.' Die Presse adopted a complementary theme: in a modern Europe free of trade restrictions, with open frontiers and possessed of a single currency, there was only one historical precedent that mattered. The Habsburgs had provided all this for a large part of the continent until 1918. In the Salzburger Nachrichten, we read that the real anniversary was that of 1,000 years of Austria, which falls in 1996 - the year it plans to enter the European Union. That, said a contributor to the paper, meant the country would sacrifice a 'thousand million schillings' and 1,000 years of history while receiving Ecus in exchange. So, if Austria was at the centre of the storm which generated all the European disasters of this century, it also provides the metaphor for a full European union, for which it will sacrifice itself yet again. The Dual Monarchy should indeed influence those in Brussels who are creating a more boring Europe. The Austro-Hungarian model can add a dash of colour and satisfy Euro-sceptics of different hues. If Jacques Delors were to become, say, the Count of Brabant, he would appear an even more attractive figure to the diverse populations of the Union. (The title might carry with it the captaincy-general of the Belgian football team). Articles in Hello, and long-distance shots in the seedier London tabloids of his wife on distant island beaches, would elevate this somewhat forbidding figure to celebrity status. He would be assisted by various new commissioners - the Duke of Connaught would be the hereditary Commissioner for Peasants and Gentry, and the Duke of Burgundy would make a fine food and drink supremo. A resurrected Elector-Palatine would be president of the European Parliament, members of which he would select personally. By its very nature, the system would ensure the realisation of certain socialist aspirations - a 'Europe of regions' would be an inevitable result. Work sharing and jobs for life are at the core of the concept. The post of head of state would pose some problems, though. Many would think twice about a European emperor based in Vienna; but turning Otto von Habsburg into a Carolingian figurehead enthroned in an already existing European institutional capital, Strasbourg, would provide a decorative addition to the scene. The Queen of England, as the first among equals of European royalty, would supply the balance in the other half of a Dual Monarchy. And, finally, we should have a solution for the German problem. The country's unification has not proved beneficial - it never has - so the answer is to split it up again. The old German Democratic Republic could re-emerge in slightly different form as Prussia; Bavaria could gain what it always wanted - independence of a sort; and Hamburg would concentrate on making money around the Baltic and up and down the Elbe. Any number of daft and varied constitutions could be provided to ensure that subsidiarity flourished. To conclude with what might be an apocryphal tale, but one which has the ring of truth: in 1920, a German weekly, presumably Simplicissimus, ran a competition for the most startling headline of all time. The winner was: 'Archduke Franz Ferdinand Alive: Great War a Mistake.' The time has come to rectify that mistake. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

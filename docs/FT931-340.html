			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (6): Privatisation helps SKB it has a clean balance sheet. Founded in 1965 as a subsidiary of Ljubljanska Banka, SKB was responsible for housing and municipal construction loans. Under the banking reform law of the former Yugoslav federation, SKB - then known as Stanovanjsko-Komunalna Banka - broke away from Ljubljanska in January 1990 to become a joint stock company. Some 700 Slovene companies and institutions, including the city of Ljubljana, now own shares in SKB. The original shares were withdrawn in 1992 and reissued. They are now denominated in Ecus, with 30 per cent preferred and the remainder as regular shares. The second biggest Slovene bank, SKB is now the only bank whose shares are quoted on the Borza, the Ljubljana stock exchange. Mrs Cvetka Selsek, deputy general manager, believes privatisation of SKB has compelled management and employees to work harder and more efficiently. 'They want to do as good a job as possible to keep up the value of the shares,' she says. Retail, corporate and trade finance, together with international banking comprise SKB's main operations. Its acquisition of a bankrupt subsidiary of Beogradska Banka, the Belgrade-based bank, has provided it with an extensive branch network. While SKB has largely managed to avoid the pitfalls of the other Slovene banks, Mrs Selsek worries about 1993 when the process of banking rehabilitation begins in earnest. 'If this will be the most difficult year I'd be happy. We are all eagerly waiting for the process to be behind us.' she says.</p>

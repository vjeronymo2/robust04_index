			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Estonian President  Lennart Meri, who just came back from a visit to China on Sunday  [19 June], today praised China for the great achievement it has  made in reform and opening to the outside world.    Speaking at a press conference here, the president said  China  is a great country and plays an important role in international  affairs as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.    During his stay in China from June 12 to 18, Meri said, he  held meetings with Chinese leaders, including President Jiang  Zemin and Premier Li Peng, on bilateral relations and  cooperation in the political and economic fields.    Talking about China's economic achievement, he said Chinese  economy has been developing rapidly over the past few years,  adding that the Estonian press has failed to discover these  great changes in China.    The president believed that the two countries have a great  potential in economic and trade cooperation.    As to the issue of Taiwan, Meri reaffirmed that Estonia only  recognizes one China and will never set up any political link  with Taiwan.</p>

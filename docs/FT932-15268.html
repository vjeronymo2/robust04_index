			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Alcoa of Australia ahead by 26% ALCOA of Australia, the aluminium and gold producer, yesterday announced a 26 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 80.9m (USDollars 57.4m) for the first quarter to the end of March, on turnover up 3.4 per cent to ADollars 505m. The group, which is jointly owned by Aluminum Company of America and Western Mining Corporation (WMC), the Australian resources group, said it had benefited from a weaker Australian dollar and new refinery capacity at Wagerup. It said the next instalment of capacity at Wagerup, which will increase capacity by 200,000 tonnes a year to 1.7m tonnes per annum, would be speeded up to come on stream in 1994. The group declared a fully-franked dividend of ADollars 80m on March 31, representing a return of 19.3 cents a share. It paid fully-franked dividends of ADollars 260m during 1992. People's Jewellers, the Canadian retail chain in bankruptcy protection, cut its loss by more than half to CDollars 57.6m (USDollars 45.8m), or CDollars 4.72 a share, in the nine months to December 26, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The chain operates 228 stores. Revenues dipped 9 per cent to CDollars 145m.</p>

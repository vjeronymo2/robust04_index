			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Waste group in Dollars 500m offering A Dollars 500m (Pounds 276m) public offering of shares in Waste Management International is being brought forward and is likely to take place in late March, according to City firms with a close knowledge of the company. The flotation is expected to value the whole of the business, which is a subsidiary of the US company, Waste Management Incorporated (WMI), at between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn. WMI is the world's biggest waste disposal and treatment company and has a market value of Dollars 20bn. It wants to float Waste Management International to help finance rapid expansion of this overseas business. The timing and structure of the share sale is similar to the offering of shares planned by Guinness Peat Aviation, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company. A listing for Waste Management International will be obtained in both London and New York. Around 50 per cent of the shares are earmarked for the US: the rest will be distributed throughout Europe. The sale is being organised by the US investment banks, Merrill Lynch and Kidder Peabody, with the City of London merchant bank, Lazard Brothers, and the City stockbroker, Cazenove. At the end of last week, UK fund managers received a document on Waste Management International prepared by Cazenove. One who received the document said it was an obvious signpost on the road to flotation. WMI currently has a direct shareholding of 70 per cent in Waste Management International. It has an interest in the remaining 30 per cent through two quoted subsidiaries, Wheelabrator Technologies and Chemical Waste Management, which have respective holdings of 15 per cent in the international business. After flotation, WMI's holding is expected to fall to 56 per cent. Wheelabrator and Chemical Waste are expected to reduce their holdings to approximately 12 per cent each. Waste Management International is likely to make a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities regulator, in the next few weeks, in preparation for the share sale. It cannot discuss flotation until it has done this, so yesterday it refused to comment. Over the past 20 years, WMI's annual turnover has grown from Dollars 16m to Dollars 7.5bn and earnings per share have risen at a compound annual rate of 29 per cent.</p>

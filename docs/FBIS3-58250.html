			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jacques Isnard: "A New Nuclear Missile on the </F> Plateau of Albion?"]    [Text] For the first time, Francois Mitterrand is not  ruling out the plan to bury a new missile in the silos of the  plateau of Albion to replace the S-3D missiles currently there.  In fact, although he does not give the code name, the French  president is talking about the MS-5 strategic missile program,  which is shrouded in the greatest secrecy. This missile would  be intended to arm both so-called new generation submarines by  the year 2005 and the silos buried in upper Provence.    Since the early 1970's, the plateau of Albion has  accommodated 18 ground-to-ground missiles capable of carrying a  1-megaton nuclear payload over a distance of approximately 5,000  km. These missiles have since been modernized. In view of the  missiles' aptitude at thwarting -- or not thwarting -- hostile  defense forces, which have supposedly gained in efficiency in  the meantime, the missile base of the plateau of Albion could be  obsolete by the beginning of next century. Hence the current  debate aimed at determining the weapons system which might  succeed the one currently deployed on the plateau of Albion.    The debate is all about whether France can maintain three  different systems -- ground-to-ground missiles, sea-to-ground  missiles, and air-to-ground missiles, as is the case today -- or  whether it should only maintain two of these -- and, if so,  determining which system could be abandoned. The answers given  by the experts vary tremendously. Nothing has been decided as  yet, and the next military planning law, which will cover the  years 1995 to 2000, will no doubt judge the merits of the  different options.    Recently, General Vincent Lanata, chief of staff of the Air  Force whose forces serve the Albion plateau and whose aircraft  carry air-to-ground missiles, has expressed his wish to have a  more advanced airborne missile at his disposal.    Consequently, Mr. Mitterrand, who sets great store by the  political and strategic symbol represented by the plateau of  Albion, has just spoken for the first time about the possibility  of simultaneously deploying -- both in French submarines and in  the silos in Provence -- missiles which are based on the same  basic design but can be adapted to either launch mode. This is  the program dubbed MS-5, involving a missile with multiple  warheads and a range of 8,000 km.    If this approach were definitively retained, it would  presuppose that financial priority had already been given to the  M-5 missile project, the version intended for submarines.  However, what does one find? Launched in 1992, back when  Pierre Joxe was defense minister, the program has been slowed  down by the Balladur government in 1994 [as published], to the  great displeasure of the missile's constructor, the Aerospatiale  group, whose CEO, Louis Gallois, has unceasingly maintained that  the M-5 is of primary interest. The M-5 even figures among the  projects threatened with being staggered over an even longer  period -- along with the future transport plane, the antimissile  defense systems, certain equipment for use in space, and the  NH-90 logistical helicopter -- if the military planning law  allocates insufficient funds.</p>

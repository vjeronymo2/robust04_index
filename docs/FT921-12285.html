			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Racal reaffirms its forecast of Pounds 50m profit Racal Electronics yesterday reaffirmed its forecast that it would make pre-tax profits of not less than Pounds 50m for the year to March 31 1992. The statement, issued after a meeting of the full board, was in response to the publication of an internal memorandum suggesting that the profit forecast might not be met. The forecast was part of the group's successful defence against last year's hostile Pounds 750m bid from Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate. The statement said: 'On the bases and assumptions set out in the circular to Racal shareholders dated December 6 1991, and after excluding results of Vodaphone Group, operating profit will not be less than Pounds 100m and profit before tax will not be less than Pounds 50m.' Racal's internal memorandum warned that the profit forecast would be harder to meet because of unforeseen delays on several large contracts. Racal said the memorandum only referred to part of the radio division, where one contract had been delayed.</p>

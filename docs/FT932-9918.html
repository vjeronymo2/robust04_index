			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Yeltsin adopts a hard line with foes of reform: President ousts conservatives PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday began to deliver on promises to remove conservative barriers to his government's reform path, following his victory in last month's referendum. He sacked Mr Yuri Skokov, secretary of the powerful state security council, and Mr Georgy Khizha, deputy prime minister for the military-industrial complex - both avowed foes of radical reform At the same time, Mr Yeltsin told a meeting of leaders from Russia' regions they should form themselves into a constitutional assembly to adopt his draft constitution, by-passing the Russian parliament. Mr Yeltsin had earlier hinted at such a role for regional representatives, but this was his clearest statement of intent. He told the leaders, called to discuss his draft, that 'this gathering in future should be transformed into a Council of Federation which will subsequently become one of the chambers of the future parliament. That is why you, and not someone else, should work on the constitution and adopt it'. This suggests that Mr Yeltsin is prepared to see appointed representatives become a part of the upper house of the bicameral parliament foreshadowed in his draft - though the constitution says the Council of the Federation should be elected. In choosing to use the regional leaders as a legitimising forum for the new constitution, Mr Yeltsin is turning to a group of officials who have mixed views about his economic and political course, but who have shown over the past year that their support can be secured in return for concessions, especially in the sphere of tax privileges and retention of export earnings. However, this will add to the flow of power from the centre to the regions, often increasing bureaucratic delays and resulting in growing separatism in the autonomous republics. It will also mean that the long-delayed confrontation with parliament - which would be abolished in its present form once a constitution is deemed to be accepted - now appears unavoidable in the near future. However, Mr Yeltsin and the parliamentary leadership have over the past year made a series of increasingly strained compromises to avoid such an outcome and may - in pursuit of the presently non-existent 'national unity', be persuaded to do so again. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker of the Russian parliament and an outspoken opponent of Mr Yeltsin's political and economic policies, is due to speak today in parliament on the president's draft constitution. He is expected to reject it as tantamount to the declaration of a presidential dictatorship. Further changes in the cabinet and administration are forecast. Attention now focuses on the possibility of the return to the government of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister. This possibility was kept alive last night when Mr Gaidar told the Liberal daily newspaper, Izvestiya, that he would consider such an offer were it made. The replacement for Mr Skokov at the head of the security council - which deals with issues of foreign affairs and even of domestic economy as well as of security - was not named last night. However, there was speculation that Mr Sergei Stepashin, chairman of the parliamentary defence and security committee and himself of centrist views, would be offered the post. The Interfax agency said that Mr Stepashin refused to confirm or deny that he would receive such an offer. Much ado about lending, Page 19</p>

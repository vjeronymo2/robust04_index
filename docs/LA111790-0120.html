Art Torres said Friday that he may introduce legislation to hasten the  environmental review of plans to have trains haul garbage to the desert in San  Bernardino and Riverside counties.  </P> <P> Torres, chairman of the Senate Committee on Toxics and Public Safety  Management, said that if public officials, environmentalists, homeowners and  trash industry representatives can reach a consensus, he will fight to shorten  environmental studies.

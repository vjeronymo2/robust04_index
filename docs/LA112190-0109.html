			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOMEFED STOCK OFF 25% ON NEW LOAN CONCERNS;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: A SAGGING ECONOMY AND REAL ESTATE MARKET COULD LEAVE THE SAN  DIEGO-BASED S&amp;L WITH $1 BILLION IN PROBLEM ACCOUNTS BY YEAR-END.  </P> <P> Hard hit by troubled real estate loans, HomeFed Bank has told federal  regulators that if the economy fails to improve, its problem loans could  increase by $250 million in the fourth quarter to a total of about $1 billion  by year's end.  </P> <P> That news from the nation's fifth-largest savings and loan was viewed as  dramatic proof of California's weakening economy and its increasingly  lackluster real estate market.  </P> <P> It also offered further evidence that the state's struggling financial industry  could face even tougher times ahead, if HomeFed's assumption is correct that  there will be no immediate improvement in the economy.  </P> <P> HomeFed stock fell Tuesday by $1.875 or 25% to $5.50 after a leading Wall  Street analyst issued a "sell" report. Stock in HomeFed, which had been one of  the nation's strongest thrifts, has plummeted from a high of $33.25 in June.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, analysts cautioned that San Diego-based HomeFed could be hit with  further bad news soon if the federal Office of Thrift Supervision and the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. uncover more nonperforming loans in upcoming  inspections.  </P> <P> In his report, Jerome Gitt, a San Francisco-based analyst with Merrill Lynch  Global Securities Research, warned that HomeFed's "current reserve levels may  not be adequate in six months or a year" if more nonperforming loans are found  or  </P> <P> the economy does not improve. He offered the recommendation to sell the stock  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Campbell K. Chaney, a San Francisco-based analyst with Sutro &amp; Co, observed  that for HomeFed, "The big intangible right now is the examiners' visit.  Examiners could be more conservative (than HomeFed) when it comes to  determining nonperforming loans."  </P> <P> HomeFed President Robert Adelizzi declined to comment on the regulators'  upcoming, regularly scheduled December visits. "That would be speculation," he  said. "We're on top of our issues, we know our portfolio reasonably well."  </P> <P> If HomeFed's portfolio of nonperforming loans increases by $250 million, its  ratio of problem loans to total assets would increase to 5.3%, an alarmingly  high figure. As of Sept. 30, HomeFed's nonperforming loans totaled $749  million, or 3.92% of assets. In a 10-Q filing dated Nov. 13, HomeFed said it  expected problem loans to exceed $1 billion if economic conditions continue.  </P> <P> Adelizzi said the anticipated increase in problem loans could be blamed on  across-the-board problems with its single-family mortgage, apartment and  commercial real estate loan portfolio.  </P> <P> The $1-billion estimate in the SEC filing was "based on trends we're seeing in  the market and in our portfolio right now," he said.  </P> <P> Part of the increase in problem loans was due to the S&amp;L's formally  classifying as nonperforming a $70-million office building loan to La Jolla  developer Jack Naiman. The loan, HomeFed's single largest, is secured by a  first mortgage on Naiman Tech Center, a 635,000-square-foot office and research  park in San Diego's Sorrento Valley. HomeFed will "continue to negotiate" with  Naiman, Rowan said.  </P> <P> HomeFed, with $19.1 billion in assets and 215 branches, met each of the federal  government's three minimum capital adequacy tests on Sept. 30. It "intends to  meet" the capital requirements at year-end, spokeswoman Kaye Rowan said.  </P> <P> David J. Dunn, founder and general partner of La Jolla-based Idanta Partners,  which disclosed earlier this month that it had acquired 7.2% of HomeFed's  shares, said he was "not surprised" by market reaction Tuesday. He repeated his  previous statement that Idanta's investment in HomeFed was for the long term.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sharp Drop  </P> <P> Tuesday: $5.50, down $1.875  </P></p>

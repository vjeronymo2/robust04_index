			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Prices paid for wool at Australian auctions continue to move gradually upwards. The market indicator reached 467 this week, nearly 10pc above its recent low point. Wool auctioned in other countries is also meeting with good trade demand, and occasional mention of purchases by China, Russia, and Eastern Europe are encouraging. There is however no clear recovery from the textile recession which coincided with the wool crisis. In the UK activity is no worse but hopes of an all-round improving trend are certainly not being rapidly realised. Prices remain competitive for this reason and only just reflect raw wool's strength.</p>

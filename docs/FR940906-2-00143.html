Over the years, the clearinghouse has facilitated the development and dissemination of material for use in the training of rehabilitation personnel. Regulations for the Rehabilitation Training program in 34 CFR 385.42 state that a set of any training materials developed under the Rehabilitation Training program must be submitted to any information clearinghouse designated by the Secretary. The project funded under this priority would be designated to receive training materials developed by other projects during the project's duration. Users of the clearinghouse cover the range of rehabilitation providers, but most frequently include State vocational rehabilitation agency personnel, rehabilitation counselors, rehabilitation educators, community rehabilitation program personnel, and advocates for individuals with disabilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has identified a maximum possible project period of 60 months. The Secretary believes that at least 36 months will be necessary to meet the requirements of the priority. The Secretary will be assessing, during the third year of the project period, whether there is a need to provide funding beyond 36 months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Priority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The project must_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Demonstrate experience and capacity to provide for a national clearinghouse of rehabilitation training materials; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identify and gather rehabilitation information and training materials for use in preparing pre-service and in-service education and training for rehabilitation personnel; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Disseminate, in a cost-effective manner, rehabilitation information and state-of-the-art training materials and methods to rehabilitation personnel to assist them in achieving improved outcomes in vocational rehabilitation, supported employment, and independent living; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Provide linkages and policies for the exchange of information and referral of inquiries with other existing clearinghouses and information centers supported by the U.S. Department of Education, including the Educational Resources Information Center and the National Rehabilitation Information Center. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Selection Criteria: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In evaluating applications for grants under this competition, the Secretary uses the Education Department General Administrative Regulations selection criteria in 34 CFR 75.210. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations in 34 CFR 75.210 provide that the Secretary may award up to 100 points for the selection criteria, including a reserved 15 points.

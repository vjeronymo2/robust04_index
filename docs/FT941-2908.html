			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Observer: Hackneyed cab Fed up with paying too much for your car insurance? In that case buy yourself a pastel-coloured motor. Barry Hulbert, who runs Hill House Hammond, one of the UK's biggest chains of high street insurance shops, says owners of black or red vehicles may have to pay higher premiums because, statistically, they are more likely to make a claim. Is the implication that if all drivers of red and black cars change to lemon, they are suddenly going to have fewer accidents? Oh well, the insurance industry always prefers putting carts before horses.</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL'S PAY PROPOSAL  </P> <P> With so many problems facing so many people in our great city, our elected  leaders are consumed with personal pay increases. I am sure that these leaders  are well-qualified and, but for their great devotion to service, could secure  better paying jobs in the private sector.  </P> <P> However, if you will pardon my modesty, I feel equally qualified, equally  experienced, equally educated and equally ready to match the abilities of any  of the present servants -- and I would feel fortunate to be able to serve at  their present wages.  </P> <P> I am also sure that there are in our great community many thousands of greatly  qualified people who could render greater service to our people if our system  of election were more democratic.  </P> <P> DAVID ARONOFF  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA believes that ensuring safe train and other movements requires each Class I railroad, Class II railroad, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), and each railroad providing commuter service in a metropolitan or suburban area to continue filing its operating rules, timetables, and timetable special instructions with FRA. These railroads conduct extensive operations, all of which are governed by their operating rules. FRA's interest in reviewing these documents outweighs the burdens imposed on the railroads to continue filing these records. Therefore, FRA retains the existing filing requirements for these railroads.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to ensure that the rules FRA is reviewing are current, each railroad subject to this requirement must submit its operating rules, timetables, and timetable special instructions to FRA by December 21, 1994, and must submit each subsequent amendment to these operating rules, timetables, and timetable special instructions issued after November 21, 1994, to FRA within 30 days after it is issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, FRA believes that the regulations on the operational testing programs, operating rules instruction programs, operational test and inspection records ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> efficiency tests), and radio rules can be effectively enforced from the field. These records are better utilized by FRA's regional personnel to monitor a railroad's compliance with the regulatory requirements. The field staff are best situated to observe a railroad's operations and determine whether the operational testing programs, operating rules instruction programs, operational test and inspections records, and radio rules are accurate and current. Additionally, the field inspectors can examine the operational test and inspection results in evaluating an employee's performance of his or her duties in accordance with a railroad's rules and instructions. FRA therefore adopts the proposal requiring railroads to retain their programs of operational tests and inspections, programs of instruction on railroad operating rules, records of operational tests and inspections (including annual summaries on operational tests and inspections), and radio rules at the designated locations provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Whether the three-year record retention requirements proposed in the NPRM for operational testing programs and annual summaries of operational tests and inspections will enhance railroad safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPRM proposed requiring railroads to retain their operational testing programs under &sect;217.9 and annual summaries of operational tests and inspections under &sect;217.13(a)&hyph;(c) for three calendar years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA received comments supporting and opposing this proposal. The California Legislative Board of the UTU advocated record retention, but argued that this information should be retained for a minimum of five years. The BLE recommended that operational tests and inspections be retained for only six months to one year. Both the UTU and BLE stated that record retention would enable FRA to accurately assess a railroad's history of safe operations by examining this collected data. The unions believed that FRA could gain a wider perspective on a railroad's results of its operational tests and inspections and thereby target potential hazards in operating rules application, understanding, and compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The railroads generally disagreed with the unions. One railroad urged FRA to modify its proposed retention requirement from three years to one year. Likewise, the AAR and ASLRA concurred with this recommendation. Specifically, the ASLRA claimed that the proposed three-year record retention requirement was superfluous given the recordkeeping requirements already imposed on railroads under the Locomotive Engineer Qualification and Certification regulations (49 CFR Part 240).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA disputes the ASLRA's judgment that these proposed requirements are duplicative. Part 240 addresses only locomotive engineers (persons who operate locomotives), but to ensure the safe movement of railroad equipment, railroads also routinely test conductors, operators, dispatchers, and maintenance-of-way personnel. All of these employees are, at one time or another, placed in situations or conditions that require knowledge and execution of a railroad's operating rules. Therefore, FRA believes that maximizing safety requires each railroad to retain its program of operational tests and inspections for all employees covered by its operating rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (43): Stuff of dreams a decade ago - Telecommunications / In developed countries, the emphasis is on competition, efficiency and new networks OF THE WORLD'S larger industries, telecommunications is the fastest growing. Over the past decade its expansion has far outstripped GNP growth, and it is set to continue on the upward track for the foreseeable future. 'We are not sure whether improved telecommunications drives economic growth or vice versa', says Mr Mike Minges, a leading analyst at the lnternational Telecommunication Union in Geneva. 'But one thing is certain: no country can sustain growth without a modern telecommunications infrastructure.' The graph makes the point at a glance. No country with annual GDP of more than Dollars 7,000 per head has a 'teledensity' of less than 20 - that is, fewer than 20 exchange lines per 100 people. Virtually all the plus-Dollars 7,000 countries have a teledensity of more than 30. However, they remain exceptional. The dense grouping of countries in the bottom left corner highlights the reality that most of the world is poor, and most of the poor have no telecommunications. Most of the world has a GDP a head of less than Dollars 2,000 and fewer than five exchange lines per 100 people. Of the 133 countries covered by the ITU survey, 70 have a teledensity of less than 5. That means virtually the whole of Africa north of South Africa, most of Asia and much of central and Latin America. The contrast within some regions is striking. Hong Kong has a teledensity of 49 and Singapore 40; whereas the Philippines languishes at 1.5, Thailand at 2.7, Malaysia at 11. Even within the Europe Community, Portugal (at 32) and France (at 52) are poles apart. In terms of policies to enhance telecommunications, the world can be broadly divided into three camps: developed countries (with teledensities of 30-plus); emerging market countries (with teledensities of between about 10 and 30); and developing countries, with fewer than 10 lines per 100. In the developed countries, most people who want a phone can secure one at an affordable price. The emphasis is on competition, commercial efficiency, new networks (particularly for cellular mobile services) and the introduction of value-added products and services. For established users in these countries, the cost of 'fixed line' telephony is reducing sharply as infrastructure and operating costs tumble and competition forces prices down. For the developed world's business sector, advanced telecommunications offer options which were the stuff of dreams only a decade ago. In Scandinavia and the US, cellular mobile teledensity is already approaching 10. 'One-stop' telecoms packages are coming to the market for transnational customers, with AT&amp;T and BT leading the battle among the main operators to become truly global companies. Multimedia - the buzz-word for products spanning the telecoms/audio/computing/entertainment divides - is widening horizons further still. In the emerging market countries, the emphasis is on line growth and the provision of advanced services in main cities so as to keep and attract inward investors. Privatisation is coming to be seen as a key tool for both attracting cash and overseas expertise to carry out these tasks. Greece, for instance, last year auctioned two licences to build the country's first cellular mobile networks - granting them to consortia led by Stet of Italy and Vodafone of the UK for more than Dollars 150m apiece. It is currently looking for an overseas strategic partner to take a minority stake in the state telecommunications operator. Hungary is in a similar position and could become a pace-setter for eastern Europe. Of countries in the former eastern bloc, only Bulgaria and the Baltic states have teledensities of more than 20, with most of the region down at between 10 and 15. The World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have investment programmes for the region, but a main priority is to foster a legal and financial environment conducive to greater investment by overseas operators. In developing countries, fixed-line growth is the overriding concern. Again, however, western investment will play an increasingly important role through franchise contracts to build, operate and transfer (BOT) new networks. In Thailand, for instance, Japan's NTT has a stake in a private Thai telecoms company with a contract to build 1m lines in the provinces; while TelecomAsia, a consortium in which Nynex, the US regional operator, holds a 15 per cent stake, has a BOT contract to build 2m lines in Bangkok. 'The BOT model will be the modernisation path for developing countries across the region,' says Mr Andrew Harrington, Asia-Pacific telecoms analyst with Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong. China, with a teledensity of precisely 1, is the world's biggest boom market in prospect. China's Minister of Posts has proclaimed a target of 75m new exchange lines by the year 2000, equivalent to three times the BT network and more than a quadrupling of existing capacity. Western operators and equipment suppliers are wide-eyed at the prospect.</p>

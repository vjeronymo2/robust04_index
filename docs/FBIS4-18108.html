			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["C.G."-signed report: "Argument With Yang Xiao Over Human </F> Rights"]    [Text] Bonn, 28 Mar -- Differences over human rights were  confirmed during a meeting between Justice Minister  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger and Chinese Minister Yang Xiao in  Bonn. The Chinese minister responded to Minister  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger's calls that human rights be  observed by drawing a distinction between individual and  collective human rights. It is "only natural" that, "because of  differences related to the social order, economic development,  and cultural background," views about human rights should  differ. Yang Xiao said that human rights possess both a general  validity and a validity under special circumstances. "In the  Chinese view, human rights constitute a dialectic unity, and  collective human rights are a precondition for guaranteeing  individual human rights." Mrs. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger gave  Yang Xiao a list of 12 human rights activists who have been  imprisoned. Yang Xiao assumed that the list was the same one  that had been handed over by Chancellor Kohl during his visit to  Beijing in November 1993 and according to information provided  by the prison service, 11 of the 18 people [on Kohl's list] do  not exist, two are in prison, and the others have either been  freed or placed on probation. Others are receiving medical  treatment outside prison after bonds had been paid. Mrs.  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger insisted that the list had been  prepared on the basis of "concrete information."    Mrs. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger said that "a basic  consensus  on fundamental and human rights issues" is the essential basis  for cooperation between the two justice systems. China has  acceded to UN agreements and like all member states, it must  adhere to them. Even dialogue between states is a fixed element  in international law. That is why German reminders do not  constitute interference in China's internal affairs. Germany  respects regional and national differences and can also  understand the viewing of legal matters in collective terms.    Nevertheless, there is a generally applicable basic human  rights core. "I would welcome it if the Chinese Government gave  a clear indication that it would strengthen the political will  to achieve a real change in the human rights situation in  China." It is true that there are signs that the independence  of the courts is being enhanced and law enforcement functions  exercised by bodies not connected with the courts are being  reduced. However, reports provide grounds for concern. People  accused must have the opportunity to defend themselves.  International norms on eliminating torture and other inhumane  or humiliating forms of treatment must be adhered to.    Following talks at Bonn's Justice Ministry, there was  another  confrontation at the Petersberg. The bloody crushing of the  peaceful demonstration on the "Heavenly Peace Square" in Beijing  in 1989 and the wave of arrests and prison sentence have had a  very negative impact on relations, said Mrs.  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger at the dinner. "The basis, which  had developed over years, of exceptionally great trust and  intensive, successful cooperation between our countries was  endangered and open to serious questions." Now, "present  obstacles" must be freely discussed and eliminated. "Objections  about impermissible interference in internal affairs only  eliminate discussion and not the actual obstacles to fruitful  cooperation." It is not a question of patronizing. It is  possible that a liberal view of man involving guarantees for  individuality, independence, decisionmaking freedom, and  personal responsibility cannot be transferred to the Chinese  Constitution, which has a collective character.    More cooperation in the judicial sphere can only be achieved  "if the indissoluble link between economic and political  freedom, between closer political ties and progress in the field  of human rights is more apparent and adhered to."    Yang Xiao responded that states have the right, in  accordance  with their laws and within the framework of their legal order  "to combat all criminal acts, including counterrevolutionary  crimes." No one has the authority, not even the Chinese justice  minister, to interpret laws or change them at their discretion:  "The state has the right to use coercion within the framework  of its laws." However, "China is ready on the basis of equal  rights" to hold discussions with Germany about "differences of  opinion." China is working on developing its legal system as it  creates "a socialist free market economy." Beijing wants to use  the experiences of other countries in "developing a legal system  connected with a free market economy." The legal order is an  important instrument for safeguarding peace and promoting  development. Cooperation between the Chinese and German Justice  Ministries should be geared toward jointly combating  international crime, protecting investments, and safeguarding  "interests in the civilian field."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Haikou, May 31 (CNS) -- The Haikou Intermediate  People's Court began to try a case this morning in which the  former deputy secretary-general of the Hainan provincial  government Li Shanyou was charged with committing frame-up and  accepting bribes.    The defendant, a native of Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province, was  former deputy secretary-general of the provincial government,  deputy director of the Hainan Securities Supervision Commission  and deputy head of a leading team of the reform of the  shareholding practice. He was accused of collecting false  information on conduct of the former governor known by his  surname as Liu since 1992. He later incited a person to forge  evidence to frame the former governor. The fabrication was  finally uncovered, and Li was arrested in August last year on a  charge of frame-up. During the interrogation, Li admitted that  he had accepted shares and cash worth a total of RMB510,000  [renminbi] from three shareholding companies as bribes during  his tenure as the deputy director of the securities commission.  The Haikou People's Procuratorate lodged prosecution against  him on charges of frame-up and bribe taking with the  intermediate court on May 16.    During the public trial today Li confessed to all charges  against him, and a verdict will soon be passed on the defendant  by the court.</p>

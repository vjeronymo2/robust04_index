			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / G7 members consult about asking Gorbachev to summit SOVIET President Mikhail Gorbachev may attend the forthcoming economic summit of the world's seven leading industrial nations in London if consultations among them lead to a decision to invite him. The possibility of inviting Mr Gorbachev as an observer to the G7 summit, due to be held from July 15-17, was first mooted by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, at the previous summit of G7 leaders in Houston, Texas, last year. It was decided then to leave the question open until nearer the date. Mr Gorbachev's presence would give him the opportunity to try to persuade the participants - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada  -that he is going ahead with his economic reform programme, in spite of all the indications that it has foundered. The final communique after the Houston summit stated that the Soviet Union would stand a better chance of receiving western economic assistance if it introduced a genuine market economic system. Though it would be for Mr John Major, as prime minister of the host nation, to issue an invitation for July, he could do so only if all his partners agreed to such a step. No decision to this effect has yet been taken, British officials said yesterday. In Moscow Mr Vitaly Ignatenko, the president's spokesman, said Mr Gorbachev would consider going if he was invited. Moscow has made it clear that it is extremely anxious to persuade western businesses to invest in the Soviet Union and has been disappointed with the response, particularly from British companies. One of the main Soviet complaints has been that some western governments will not provide the financial guarantees which would give companies worried by Soviet the present climate of instability, in the Soviet Union, the confidence to do business there. The US in particular has been cool to increasing economic co-operation with the Soviet Union because the demands of the Baltic states for independence or greater autonomy have not been granted.</p>

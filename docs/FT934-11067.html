			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Boost for dollar and pound WELL received data suggest-ing a pick-up in manufacturing activity in the US gave a lift to the dollar yesterday. Dollar strength helped sterling, which also received an initial boost from comments on interest rates by the UK chancellor, writes Peter John. With many European financial markets closed for the All Saints' Day holiday, the US currency continued a rally that began on Friday and carried on during Tokyo trading. The dollar was firmer against the yen in Tokyo in spite of comments from Mr Fred Bergsten, a US economist visiting Japan, who said it needed to stay below Y110 to the yen in order to reduce Japan's large external trade surplus. In European trading, the dollar was helped by the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index for October, which reflects optimism over manufacturing activity. The index rose to 53.8 per cent, against an expectation of some 51.8 per cent and a previous figure of 49.7 per cent. The latest data on US construction also encouraged the market. Mr Jim' O Neill, economist with Swiss Bank who has had a very negative forecast on the dollar, changed his estimate for the US currency's floor against the D-Mark to DM1.6750 in the short term from DM1.56 previously. But he still believes it will be back to DM1.60 by the year-end. The dollar came very close to DM1.70 yesterday, its highest point since August. At that level many investors were taking their profit on the big rally of the past two weeks and moving funds into sterling and yen. There was also nervousness that the Bundesbank might be selling the US currency. At the close of European trading, the dollar reached Dollars 1.4810 against sterling, up from Dollars 1.4865 previously, but Y108.20 to the yen, down from Y108.40. It maintained its strength against a D-Mark weakened by the Bundesbank's recent interest rate cuts and closed at DM1.6935, up from Friday's DM1.6795. In New York the dollar ended at Y108.20 and DM1.6957 and the pound at Dollars 1.4820. Sterling also rose smartly against the D-Mark at the start of trading as Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, added his voice to attempts by the governor of the Bank of England on Friday to dampen speculation of an early rate reduction. The pound broke through DM2.50 for the first time since the end of August, and the index which shows sterling against a basket of leading currencies rose to 81.1 before closing marginally firmer at 80.9. Gains were pared at midday but then the pound picked up in the afternoon as investors switched out of the dollar. Sterling closed a pfennig up on the day at DM2.5075. A dealer said belief that sterling had broken through to a new chart-bound range could push it higher still. 'If it stays above DM2.50 for more than 24 hours, the technical boys will move and we could see it hit DM2.55.'</p>

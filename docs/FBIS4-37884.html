			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" to AL-MUHARRIR] </F>   [Text] Beirut/Amman--Is it possible for the mullahs to play  the role of the shah in some Gulf states and the Arabian  peninsula, or will such an influential role, if it occurs, lead  to nothing other than unrest in the region? Arab political  circles in some Arab countries began to discuss these questions  after they received secret diplomatic reports from Tehran that a  new plan was under way to rebuild Shiite organizations in Iraq,  Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain and to increase financial and  political support for extremist Islamic organizations in  Palestine and Lebanon.    The information AL-MUHARRIR has received indicates that  Tehran has allocated large amounts of money to cover the  activities of its satellite organizations.    Figures in this regard show that millions of dollars have  been allocated to rebuild and breathe a new life into Shiite  organizations in the Arabian Gulf region.    The main organizations and the amounts of money they will  receive are as follows:     -  The Islamic Front for the Liberation of Iraq, which will  receive $100,000 per month.    -  The Iraqi al-Da'wah Party, which will receive $150,000 per  month.    -  The Popular Front for the Liberation of the Arabian  Peninsula,  an anti-Saudi organization, which will receive $150,000 per  month.    -  The Islamic Movement for the Liberation of Bahrain, which  will  receive $70,000 per month.        It is worth mentioning that these four organizations have  offices in Tehran. Diplomatic reports say that by supporting  these organizations, Iran is seeking to stir up unrest in Gulf  countries to restore Iranian influence, which prevailed during  Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's reign and which diminished  gradually after the mullahs controlled the government and after  the end of the Iraq-Iran war.    Reports also say that pro-Iranian organizations carried out  bombing operations in Kuwait years before the entry of the Iraqi  forces in it. They add that Iran was responsible for some  bombing operations and shootouts that occurred in Kuwait after  the return of al-Sabah family to power.    The same diplomatic reports say that the Iranian leadership  has drawn up a new plan to support the Islamic Jihad Movement in  Palestine, led by Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, and to provide necessary  amounts of money to the movement to enable it to build bases in  the occupied territories.    Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command, presented al-Shaqaqi to  the Iranian officials. Since then, the latter has been  receiving $100,000 per month to cover the costs of his  organization in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan, in addition to other  amounts of money being paid to the occupied territories' branch  through special channels.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Ricardo drops 56% to Pounds 2.04m and finance director resigns RICARDO INTERNATIONAL, the engineering design group, yesterday reported a 56 per cent decline in full year pre-tax profits, and announced that Mr Matthew Thorne, finance director, had resigned 'to pursue his other interests.' Mr Thorne's departure, said to be 'amicable', follows the resignation in June of Mr Roger Smedley as chairman and chief executive, after pressure from non-executive directors. He was replaced by Mr Christopher Ross as chief executive and Sir Philip Foreman as chairman. The company, which also yesterday announced the appointment of Mr Cecil Foreman as a non-executive director, said the appointment of a new finance director would be announced in the near future. Pre-tax profits, struck after an Pounds 800,000 charge to cover restructuring costs - including Mr Smedley's compensation package, fell to Pounds 2.04m in the year to June 30. This compared with profits of Pounds 4.65m last time and came on turnover down from Pounds 63.5m to Pounds 57.6m. Operating profits fell from Pounds 5m to Pounds 2.47m, with three of the group's four operating divisions suffering losses. The only division to post 'a wholly satisfactory performance' was consulting engineers in the automotive sector, even though its turnover slipped marginally to Pounds 18.4m (Pounds 18.6m). Turnover in the aerospace division fell to Pounds 21.8m (Pounds 27.4m) although within the division the gas turbine group performed strongly. Technical communications turnover slipped to Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 6.2m), but the hitech division managed to increase turnover to Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 11.2m). Sir Philip described the results as 'disappointing,' but emphasised that the group's balance sheet remained strong with shareholders' funds of Pounds 22m and net borrowings of only Pounds 2.62m after capital expenditure of Pounds 2.6m. The group's overall investment in research and development was Pounds 1m, mainly focused in the automotive business. After a reduced tax charge of Pounds 885,000 (Pounds 1.53m) earnings per share came out at 3.6p (9.9p). An unchanged final dividend of 3.8p is recommended, maintaining the total for the year at 5.7p. Although the dividend is not fully covered by earnings, Sir Philip said it 'reflects the underlying strength of the group.' On prospects, Sir Philip said the new financial year would be very challenging. Nonetheless, the actions taken to redirect the activities of the company would result in a stronger, healthier enterprise.</p>

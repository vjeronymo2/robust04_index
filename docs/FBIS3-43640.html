Speaking after meeting Minister  of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha, Mr Azuma said Japan regarded  southern Africa as the most promising African region.    South Africa was a key state and it was therefore important  that the April 27 elections be a success, he said, and all  parties should participate. "In that respect Japan wishes to do  whatever it can to help so that can happen," Mr Azuma said.    Mr Botha said he was looking forward to a further  improvement  in relations with Japan.    Mr Azuma will also meet senior African National Congress  officials and representatives of the United Nations and other  international organisations during his visit to discuss roles to  be played by the international community in the elections. His  tour of southern African countries is the first follow-up step  to be taken after the Tokyo international conference on African  development last year.</p>

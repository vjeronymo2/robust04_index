			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GTE TO ACQUIRE CONTEL, FORMING A PHONE GIANT;  </P> <P> TELECOMMUNICATIONS: THE STOCK SWAP DEAL IS WORTH $6.3 BILLION. THE RESULT WILL  BE AMERICA'S LARGEST LOCAL PHONE COMPANY.  </P> <P> GTE Corp. and Contel Corp., two of the nation's largest telephone carriers,  said Thursday they tentatively agreed to merge and create a global  telecommunications giant with a presence in virtually every aspect of the  burgeoning industry.  </P> <P> The deal calls for Stamford, Conn.-based GTE, whose far-flung U.S. operations  include some local telephone service in Southern California, to acquire  Atlanta-based Contel through a stock swap valued at about $6.3 billion. The  proposed acquisition, one of the largest ever in the industry, extends a recent  spate of telecommunications takeovers that were previously confined mainly to  long-distance carriers.  </P> <P> If approved by stockholders as well as federal and numerous state regulators,  the new company would become the largest U.S.-based provider of local telephone  service -- with more than 17.7 million customers in 40 states and throughout  the world -- and the nation's second-largest cellular carrier.  </P> <P> The combined company, to be known as GTE and operated by its current managers,  also would have significant satellite, foreign, computer and government  contracting operations, in addition to a strong presence in the emerging market  for fiber-optic telecommunications service.  </P> <P> It is a "perfect combination of two great companies," GTE Chairman James L.  (Rocky) Johnson said of the deal that insiders say had been brewing for weeks.  "This alliance will both position the company strategically and enable us to  exploit more fully the many opportunities for growth."  </P> <P> "This is a play for the future," said Jack Grubman, a telecommunications  analyst with Paine Webber in New York. "Five years from now telephone lines  will carry far more information than they do now and telephone companies will  be far different. GTE is buying technology, not a utility."  </P> <P> GTE will issue 1.27 shares of its common stock in a tax-free exchange for each  Contel common share.  </P> <P> Contel's stock shot up on the news, gaining $7.125 per share Thursday to close  at $35.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. However, GTE's stock slipped $1.25  to close at $29.75, showing some concerns about the sizable merger price.  </P> <P> Although the deal would put the new GTE ahead of its regional Baby Bell  competitors, analysts speculated that the merger could provide additional  ammunition to ongoing efforts by the seven Baby Bells to loosen federal  regulatory and judicial constraints on their operations.  </P> <P> "This puts a whole new light on things, and it could make it easier for the  regional Bells to win approval to do friendly mergers with independent  communications companies," said Kenneth Leon, a telecommunications analyst at  Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York.  </P> <P> The new company would knock Bell Atlantic out as the country's largest local  service company. Further, the new company would surpass Pacific Telesis as the  nation's second-largest cellular telephone operator, with franchises to serve  areas with a potential of 50 million customers. Only McCaw Cellular, with 62  million potential customers, has a larger cellular business.  </P> <P> In recent months, GTE has been conducting an ambitious experiment in  fiber-optic telecommunications service in Cerritos. It has wired portions of  the city using combinations of fiber-optic and coaxial cable and digital and  analog switches. The project is designed to prepare for the day, long expected  by GTE executives, when telephone companies are allowed to compete with cable  TV franchisers in piping video into the home.  </P> <P> THE BIG ONES  </P> <P> The top 10 local telephone carriers by number of phone lines as of Dec. 31,  1989 (U.S. operations only).  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.99IN:2.33IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Number of  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> phone lines  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Revenue*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Company  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (millions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (billions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bell Atlantic  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 17.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $10.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bell South  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 16.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Ameritech  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 15.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nynex  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 14.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 11.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Pacific Telesis  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 14.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> US West  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> GTE Corp.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Southwestern Bell  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 11.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> United Telecom.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Contel  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> *Phone revenue only  </P> <P> Source: U.S. Telephone Assn.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Times  </P></p>

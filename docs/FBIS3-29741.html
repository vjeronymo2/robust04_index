			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, in a 19  February speech in Nagoya, touched on the issue of Japan's trade  surplus which has caused confrontation between Japan and the  United States. He said: "The government is not in a position  of being able to interfere in automakers' business in a  capitalist nation or a country in which market mechanism  functions well. And, there is no such law. If the automobile  and insurance industries come up with ideas to solve the issue,  it may be necessary for the government to support them in  implementing the ideas." Thus, he indicated that trade  imbalance should be corrected mainly through the private  sector's voluntary efforts.</p>

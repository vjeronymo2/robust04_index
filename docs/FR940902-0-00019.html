First, operators with urban buses in their fleet having model year 1984, 1985, or 1987 DDC 6V92TA engines must reduce average fleet PM emissions during calendar years 1995 and 1996. This is because the calculations for the TLF assume that engines of the 1984, 1985, and 1987 model years will be rebuilt in calendar years 1995 and 1996, and because the post-rebuild PM level for the DDC 6V92TA engines of the specified model years have a default level (0.30 g/bhp-hr) that is less that its pre-rebuild emissions level (0.50 g/bhp-hr). Therefore, for operators with urban buses in their fleet having model year 1984, 1985, or 1987 DDC 6V92TA engines, one or more of the above strategies must be used as necessary to demonstrate that its FLA is equal to or less than its TLF. (The calculations for the TLF assume that urban buses with engines of model year 1986 will not receive any rebuilds during calendar years 1995 or 1996. Therefore, for 1986 model year engines the post-rebuild level is equal to the pre-rebuild level for calendar years 1995 and 1996.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted in (2) above, for operators choosing Option 2 who have model 1984, 1985, or 1987 DDC 6V92TA urban buses in their fleet, use of the DDC upgrade kit is an available, but not required strategy to meet the fleet average reductions required under Option 2. DDC's upgrade kit will provide additional flexibility to fleets having the above-mentioned DDC engines without necessitating use of the other, perhaps less desirable, strategies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the table of 40 CFR 85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(A), the post-rebuild level is lower than the pre-rebuild level for the 1979 through 1987 6V92TA engines because there is a currently available upgrade kit that is supported by new engine certification data on file with EPA. At the time of the final rulemaking, EPA expected that DDC's Coach Upgrade kit would be certified by July 1, 1994 under the retrofit/rebuild program for less than the appropriate cost ceiling. While as of July 1, 1994, the Coach Upgrade kit had not been certified under the retrofit/rebuild program, EPA believes that it is reasonable to provide a lower post-rebuild emission level to any applicable engine equipped with this DDC upgrade kit because of the existence of new engine certification data which shows that engines virtually identical to the upgraded engines were certified by EPA to the lower emission level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA originally intended that the ``Post-rebuild level'' specified in the table of 40 CFR 85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(A) for the 1979 through 1987 model year 6V92TA engines to reflect the level attained when those engines are upgraded to their latest certified, mechanically-controlled configuration (1988 or 1989 model year configuration depending upon horsepower). After the final rule was published, it was discovered that the 1988 and 1989 model year 6V92TA engines were certified to 0.31 g/bhp-hr under the new engine certification program, and not 0.30 g/bhp-hr as shown in the table. Therefore, 0.31 g/bhp-hr is the level actually achieved by upgrading the 1979 through 1987 model year 6V92TA engines to the 1988 or 1989 configuration that is certified under EPA's new engine certification program. Because of the error in the final regulations, EPA will allow urban bus operators to claim a reduction down to the 0.30 g/bhp-hr level when these engines are upgraded to the appropriate 1988 or 1989 configuration using the DDC Coach Upgrade kit. This will allow urban bus operators to upgrade their engines as one method of complying with Option 2, as was EPA's original intention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

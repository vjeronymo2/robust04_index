			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAIL / TOURISM: YOKOHAMA'S TIRE DEALERS GET THEIR OWN SHOPPING  SPREE  </P> <P> Just when South Coast Plaza shop owners were recovering from a  company-sponsored spending spree by Isuzu dealers, along came some Yokohama  Tire dealers with their own incentive program.  </P> <P> Last Saturday, 10 Yokohama dealers hit the shopping mall armed with a special  credit card that allowed them to charge up to $10,000 in goods from  participating stores at South Coast Plaza, courtesy of Yokohama Tire Corp. in  Fullerton, the U.S. distribution arm of Yokohama Rubber Co. of Tokyo.  </P> <P> "This may seem like an early Christmas gift, but in reality it is to reward our  enthusiastic dealers for a job well done," said Jeff Carpenter, Yokohama  marketing manager  </P> <P> The credit cards were given to dealers who sold the most tires between Aug. 26  and Oct. 25. The bigger dealers were eligible to compete for the $10,000  shopping spree, while the smaller ones were allotted $5,000. The promotion  mirrors a similar promotion for top-selling Isuzu dealers recently at the Costa  Mesa shopping mall. The car dealers were granted two shopping days to spend  between $10,000 and $50,000 each.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Uzbek President Islam Karimov has issued a decree on  regulations of export and import operations in foreign currency.  The decree provides for an efficient control over currency  earnings and its utilization when exporting services and  commodities.    In accordance with the decree, Uzbek enterprises and  organizations cannot settle their accounts on export and import  with foreign partners through foreign banks.    The decree forbids legal entities to sell or pass over the  quotas on export of services and commodities to other  participants in the foreign economic activities. The Uzbek  Ministry of Justice has been proposed to establish juridical  responsibility of legal entities and individuals for violation  of the order imposed on export and import operations in foreign  currency.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Andryushkov, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, under </F> rubric "Exhibitions": "High Technologies: Costs Today, Profits  Tomorrow"]    [Text] The roar of aerospace turbines and of various  industrial motors of the 2nd Moscow International Exhibition  Dvigateli-94 is over. It showed (down to the pain of an exposed  nerve) to its participants and thousands of visitors interested  in the country's technical progress what a critical state of  development we are at today.    Around a hundred scientific production associations and  special design bureaus from the CIS and twenty leading engine  building firms from the far abroad presented their products in  the Forum pavilion of the exhibition complex on Krasnaya  Presnya. "The idea of assembling specialists in creating engines  for different applications in one exhibition is valuable," said  Russian Federation Government First Deputy Chairman Oleg  Soskovets, "in that for the first time it enables scientists and  designers, production engineers and industrial workers to become  mutually enriched by know-how and foremost technologies,  coordinate ways of mutually advantageous cooperation, and find  new partners and new spheres of the market for their products."    Time will tell how much the opportunities presented were  used. Nevertheless, it is already possible to tell about certain  results. The sensation of the exhibition was the cooperation  agreement of the Russian Aviadvigatel and Permskiye motory  joint-stock companies and the United Technologies/Pratt &amp;  Whitney corporation (USA). Just a few years ago engine builders  from Perm affirmed their authority in the industrial world by  certifying the powerful, reliable PS-90A aircraft engine.  Unfortunately, the state's economic troubles did not permit  realizing technological improvements in it and expanding the  operating horizons. But it is common knowledge that nature does  not tolerate emptiness. The Perm engine builders found a way out  of a critical situation: they concluded an agreement with Pratt  &amp; Whitney (USA) to create two joint companies for production  of  aircraft and industrial engines. A German firm, Motoren und  Turbinen (MTU) also is participating in the project. The goal is  to create a more advanced engine for Il-96, Tu-204 and Il-76  aircraft using the experience of Russian and foreign engineers.  The first model, PS-90P, was shown at the exhibition and drew  the specialists' attention. As Viktor Chuyko, president of the  Union of Aircraft Engine Building and a doctor of technical  sciences, said, all the best of what was being created by the  mind and hands of man was combined in it.    The Dvigateli-94 exhibition gladdened Russia's aviators with  one other event--the announcement of the creation of a trainer  aircraft for the Air Force. For long years pilots had been  learning to fly in imported L-29 and L-39 aircraft. As a pilot  who has mastered these aircraft, I confirm their insufficient  reliability because of the presence of one engine and dependence  of the air fleet on politics. The Special Design Bureau imeni  Mikoyan created a domestic MIG-AT multipurpose aircraft. And  again there was an example of survival under conditions of a  lack of money: cooperation with the French company SNECMA. Two  LARZAC 04Y3 jet engines (photo [photo not reproduced]) will be  placed on the aircraft. Of course, this alliance has its fine  points, but their solution is a matter for statesmen. I believe  they also should spend money to produce a domestic engine. For  example, specialists from Ufa are ready to set about making it.    The exposition of enterprises of the missile-space industry  and the motor vehicle, tractor, and ship engine makers was  interesting. The technical exhibition was able for the first  time to satisfy the interest of specialists in different areas.  In addition, one of the most important problems of mankind was  being solved at the exhibition: how to preserve living nature  under conditions of intensive development of high technologies  and in the long run not permit ourselves to perish under the  "umbrella" formed by exhaust gases.</p>

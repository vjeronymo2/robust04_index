			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Enichem loss deteriorates to L853.9bn ENICHEM, the Italian chemicals group owned by the ENI state holding company, has revealed a rise in losses to L853.9bn (Dollars 573.1m) at parent company level in the 10 months to end-October 1992. No comparable figures are available for the same period in 1991 as the 1992 figures have emerged in a special prospectus produced by EniChem for the planned merger of 10 subsidiaries into the parent company. The 1992 figure compares with a restated loss of L732bn for the parent company for all 1991. At group level, EniChem lost L721bn after minority interests in the first half of last year. Full-year figures are not due until May. Earlier this year, the company said it hoped to close 1992 with a group loss of less than L1,000bn. The new information suggests that may no longer be possible. The figures reveal marked deterioration in EniChem's financial performance during 1992. The prospectus implies weakness in demand and prices for the bulk chemicals which comprise most of EniChem's business. Pro forma figures for the first 10 months of 1992 show that EniChem's turnover amounted to L5,534bn at parent company level, against L6,786bn for the whole of 1991. The figures exclude results for the Montefibre synthetic fibres business and the EniChem Augusta detergents operation, both of which are listed on the stock market. Also excluded is EniChem's synthetic rubber business, and the fine chemicals. EniChem has suffered badly from the downturn in demand and lower prices for many chemicals products. The adverse market factors have combined with political difficulties in Italy in closing plants and trimming its labour force, leading to increasingly heavy losses. The group has endeavoured to alleviate matters by forming joint ventures with other producers in a number of areas. Last year, EniChem announced a strategic alliance with BP Chemicals of the UK in the styrene and polyethylene fields. It has predicted that the incorporation of the 10 subsidiaries into the parent company should realise savings of up to L200bn a year. Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto), Italy's biggest private sector bank, forecast a significant increase in profits for 1992. Official figures will not be available for some time. However, the bank reported a 21 per cent rise in customer deposits to L21,367bn and a similar-sized increase in loans to L18,856bn.</p>

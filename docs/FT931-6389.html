			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / When taxing questions need an answer: Peter Norman examines ways in which Lamont could bring some extra revenue to the Treasury - Spring Budget IF NEARLY 14 years of Conservative government have achieved anything, it is a reduction in the burden of direct taxation placed on the individual. But with Britain's public sector borrowing requirement widely forecast to reach Pounds 1bn a week in 1993-94 even the most sacred cows have to come under critical scrutiny. As Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, considers whether to start increasing taxes to curb the UK's growing budget deficits in his March 16 Budget, it is an odds-on bet that Treasury officials have been weighing the merits of raising more revenue through income tax or National Insurance contributions. There are political and economic constraints on precipitate action. The Tories owe their fourth term in office largely to their fierce opposition to Labour's manifesto plans for a sharp increase in direct taxes on middle-income families. There are tentative signs of recovery in Britain's industrial and retail sectors, but indices of consumer confidence have been slow to reflect any upturn. And there are widespread fears that a sharp increase in direct taxation could nip any revival of confidence in the bud. It is therefore unlikely that the government will embark on large-scale revenue raising through direct taxes in 1993-94. But it will be conscious of a need to close the budget gap in the years ahead and that eliminating or reducing some of the anomalies in the income tax and National Insurance systems could serve this goal. In the short term there are plenty of relatively minor changes that would bring increased revenue. The most obvious step would be to freeze the allowances and thresholds enjoyed by all Britain's 24.8m income tax payers. Under the provisions of statutory indexation these are due to go up by 2.6 per cent in 1993-94 unless parliament decides otherwise. The projected 2.6 per cent increase reflects the rate of retail price inflation in the year to last December. It already looks generous compared with January's 1.7 per cent inflation rate and expectations that retail price inflation will fall further this spring. Most taxpayers would not suffer a great loss if the personal allowance - the amount of income that all people can enjoy before income tax is levied - were held at the 1992-93 level of Pounds 3,445 instead of rising in line with indexation to Pounds 3,565 in 1993-94. A 20 per cent income taxpayer with a taxable income of up to Pounds 2,000 would forego 34 pence a week. A higher rate taxpayer paying 40 per cent on taxable income of more than Pounds 23,700 would 'lose' 69p a week if the personal allowance were frozen. He or she would forego a further Pounds 2.0l weekly if the upper 'basic rate limit' at which the 25 per cent basic rate of income tax gives way to the top 40 per cent rate were not indexed upwards to Pounds 24,400. Freezing all allowances would save the government Pounds 750m in the next tax year with three quarters of the saving coming from no change in the personal allowance. The main disadvantage of such a blanket freeze would be to inflict a real-income loss on very low paid workers who would be brought into the tax net on the strength of only modest wage increases. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested as an alternative that the chancellor might choose to freeze just the married couple's allowance and the basic rate limit. Such action would be in line with recent practice, but the yield would be comparatively small. Another option canvassed by the institute would be to restrict the value of the personal allowance to the basic tax rate rather than subtract it as at present from gross income to obtain taxable income. Such a change would be a blow to Britain's 1.7m higher-rate taxpayers, for whom the personal allowance is worth Pounds 1,378 a year compared with Pounds 861.25 for the basic-rate taxpayer. But the yield for the government would be large - about Pounds 1.3bn according to IFS estimates - nearly as much as the Pounds 1.6bn that would be raised by a 1 percentage point increase in the basic rate of tax to 26 per cent. Mr Lamont's direct tax options do not stop with income tax. Britain has a second tax on incomes in the form of National Insurance contributions. But the arguments for extracting more from this source are finely balanced. Increased NI contributions of some sort might be quite easy to sell to the electorate. NI contributions have long since ceased to finance a genuine fund to pay for such social services as old age pensions or unemployment, but they are generally perceived as serving that purpose. Mr Lamont could point to the greatly increased cost of social security for the unemployed to justify an increase in revenues from this source. On the other hand, any radical increase in the NI take would lay the chancellor open to a charge of misleading the electorate. During last year's campaign he focused the Conservatives' counter attack on the Labour party's plans to extend NI contributions to the full pay of middle and upper income earners. Increases in direct taxation are normally the preserve of the brave or the strong. Mr Lamont has proved surprisingly resilient through the crises of his chancellorship in the past six months, but his political position is weak. That fact and continuing uncertainty about the economy argue against radical changes in UK direct taxes to redress the budget deficit. But the chancellor has scope for action at the margin.</p>

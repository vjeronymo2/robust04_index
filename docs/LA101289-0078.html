			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOARD OPTS TO STAY NEUTRAL ON PUPIL SHIFT;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS: THE ARCADIA SCHOOL BOARD HAS DECIDED NOT TO TAKE A STAND ON WHETHER  SIERRA MADRE STUDENTS SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED FROM PASADENA UNIFIED TO ARCADIA.  </P> <P> Whether Sierra Madre students should be allowed to switch from the Pasadena  Unified School District to Arcadia Unified will get its first public hearing  tonight.  </P> <P> A final decision isn't expected until the fall of 1990, but at least one of the  players has already taken a stance, of sorts.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, the Arcadia school board voted to remain neutral, saying its  school district of 7,500 students could absorb the 632 Sierra Madre students  who now attend Pasadena public schools.  </P> <P> "This isn't to say that at some future time we might not move toward opposition  or support," said Arcadia board member Joann Steinmeier. "I don't think we have  enough information to say what the consequences would be."  </P> <P> One variable is how many Sierra Madre students who now attend private schools  might cross over into Arcadia public schools, if the redistricting drive is  successful. Those favoring breaking away say that, based on 1988 census  figures, there are 1,900 school-age children in Sierra Madre.  </P> <P> And, based on an informal parent poll, secession proponents estimated 1,200  children, counting current public school students and those who would switch  from private school, might move to the Arcadia system.  </P> <P> Arcadia officials say they are skeptical of that figure and need more  information before they decide whether they favor the switch.  </P> <P> The hearing, organized by the Los Angeles County Committee on School  Reorganization, is the result of a controversial proposal by a group of Sierra  Madre parents to secede from the 22,000-student Pasadena Unified School  District and annex Sierra Madre to Arcadia Unified.  </P> <P> Those parents, from mainly white and middle-class Sierra Madre, say they have  concerns about Pasadena schools, where class enrollment is now 90% minority  children and students score in the bottom third on standardized reading and  math tests.  </P> <P> But some members of an opposing parents' group called All Children Count have  accused the Sierra Madre group of racism and say parental fears are greatly  exaggerated.  </P> <P> Sierra Madre Parents for a Better Education, the group that sparked the  secession drive, denied the allegations of racism. Spokeswoman Susan Lavoe said  members of her group want what is best for their children. She cited concern  with eroding test scores in Pasadena schools and rising problems with gangs,  drugs and violence.  </P> <P> And the Pasadena school district, which with all others receives state funding  based on the number of students enrolled, is chafing at the possible loss. It  has authorized $25,000 for an attorney to stave off secession, which it says  would hurt existing school programs.  </P> <P> School officials say that, even if the secession drive is successful, there  will not be any changes until July, 1991.  </P> <P> After a second public hearing next Wednesday in Arcadia, the county board has  90 days to make a recommendation to the State Board of Education. The state  will probably take three or four months to rule. If the state finds in favor of  redistricting, the issue will then go before voters, with election boundaries  to be set by the state.  </P> <P> Marc Forgy, secretary to the Los Angeles County Committee on School District  Reorganization, said the county and state committees weigh concerns such as  whether the move would substantially alter community identity, promote ethnic  or racial discrimination or segregation, disrupt existing educational programs,  or increase state costs.  </P> <P> The state committee receives up to nine reorganization proposals each year, and  Forgy said the last three have been denied.  </P> <P> Tonight's hearing begins at 7 p.m. at Pasadena High School.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> The second hearing will take place at 7 p.m. at First Avenue Junior High School  in Arcadia. The county board will make a recommendation to the State Board of  Education, which will decide whether to allow an election.  </P></p>

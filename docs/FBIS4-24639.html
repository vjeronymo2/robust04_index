			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Ma Xiaochun (7456 2556 2504) and Jia Yong </F> (6328 3057)]    [Text] Beijing, 30 May (XINHUA) -- During an interview  with XINHUA on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the  promulgation of the "PRC Military Service Law," State Councillor  and Defense Minister Chi Haotian stressed that implementing the  military service law and building stronger defense and armed  forces have a close bearing on the state's economic development  and long-term peace and stability, and so it is a mission to be  accomplished by all party members and people of all  nationalities in the country jointly.    China's current military service law was adopted by the  Second Session of the Sixth National People's Congress on 31 May  1984. The law replaced compulsory military service, prescribed  in China's first military service law drawn up in the  mid-1950's, with a military service system which merges  compulsory and voluntary service and merges militia and reserve  forces, with compulsory service remaining the mainstay.    Chi Haotian reviewed the successes which party committees,  people's governments, enterprises, institutions, and social  quarters have achieved during the last decade in implementing  the military service law; in accomplishing assignments relevant  to military service, militia, and reserve services; in taking  special care of disabled servicemen and family members of  martyrs and servicemen; and in building stronger national  defense and armed forces under the leadership of the CPC Central  Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military  Commission. Chi Haotian said: The period from now to the end  of this century is crucial for the development of China's  socialist cause. While continuing to implement the military  service law, uphold the party's basic line without the least  wavering, and concentrate our efforts on expediting our economic  development under the new situation, we must continue to build  stronger national defense and armed forces and make constant  efforts to strengthen our defense to powerfully guarantee  security for reform, opening up, and economic development.    Specifying what needs to be done in implementing the  military  service law, Chi Haotian stressed: To implement the military  service law, we must exert great efforts in fostering patriotism  and selfless dedication so as to create an environment in which  the whole nation will care for and support national defense. He  pointed out: Following the founding of New China, patriotism --  which is one traditional ethic of the Chinese nation -- was  further manifested. Models such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Su Ning,  and Xu Honggang have come to the fore in the people's armed  forces; and many progressive personnel -- such as Rong Guanxiu  and Zhao Chenni, who are known as the mothers of people's  soldiers; and Zhuang Yinfang and Shao Linyuan, models of  supporting the military -- have also emerged from among the  people. The solidarity between the armed forces, the  government, and the people has become even stronger, and many  units have distinguished themselves in rendering mutual support  and in embarking in material and spiritual construction. Their  exemplary deeds have fully demonstrated the patriotic spirit and  selfless dedication of Chinese people of all nationalities. Chi  Haotian pointed out: This spirit and dedication are  specifically the spiritual support with which our country and  people survived despite repeated catastrophes and aggressions,  and they are the powerful force motivating us, the Chinese  people, to press forward to build a prosperious country. Now,  under the new situation, we cannot build a strong ideological  foundation for implementing the military service law or build  stronger defense and armed forces unless we make great efforts  to promote patriotism and the spirit of selfless dedication.    Chi Haotian pointed out: To implement the military  service law, we must strive to study and use Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's thinking about building a legal system and  demonstrate the role of the military service law in safeguarding  the construction of our defense and armed forces. Deng  Xiaoping's thinking about building a legal system with Chinese  characteristics is the theortical foundation for formulating the  military service law, and it is also the guide for implementing  the military service law. Thus, we must integrate the study of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking about building a legal system  with the study of the military service law, extensively educate  the people on the military service law, and propagate knowledge  about the military service law until each and every citizen  understands its basic points and understands that a stronger  defense and stronger armed forces are an important part of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and that  fulfulling military service and being concerned with and  supporting national defense exemplify patriotism and selfless  dedication.    In conclusion, Chi Haotian said: As always, party  committees, people's governments, enterprises, institutions, and  people in all social sectors must be concerned with defense,  support defense, promote defense education with perseverance,  strive to make the whole nation more defense-conscious, and  strive to make a success of affairs relevant to military service  and the militia and in taking special care of disabled  servicemen as well as families of martyrs and servicemen. The  vast number of young people should have a correct concept of  life and values, consider it their responsibility to safeguard  the motherland, voluntarily fulfil their military service, and  dedicate themselves to defense. All officers and men of the  People's Liberation Army and armed police forces should keep  firmly in mind that their objective is to serve the people  wholeheartedly. In accordance with the Central Military  Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin's general requirement that the  PLA must "be politically qualified and militarily toughened,  have a good work style, observe strict discipline, and be strong  in defending the country," we must intensify our efforts in  building the PLA into modern, regular, and revolutionary armed  forces which actively support the country's economic  construction and powerfully ensure the security needed for  reform, opening up, and economic development. The vast number  of militiamen and reservists must take the lead in participating  in socialist spiritual and material construction as prescribed  in the military service law. They should become the new force  to become affluent through hard work, the sentinel safeguarding  public security, and the powerful reserve forces backing the  people's armed forces.</p>

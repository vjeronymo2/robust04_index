			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Cleaning side behind fall at Sketchley - Shares gain 5p as company notes signs of improvement in the economy SKETCHLEY, the cleaning and textile rental company, yesterday confirmed that profits fell last year and said it has started a 'massive discounting campaign' to try to lift turnover at its 465 dry cleaning stores. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 6.02m to Pounds 3.11m in the year to April 2 due to recession. The fall, which included exceptional costs of Pounds 1.65m, was expected. Last month Sketchley warned that second half trading in its dry cleaning division had been poor. At the interim stage the company reported flat profits of Pounds 3.1m. Sketchley's shares gained 5p to 97p after Mr David Davies, chairman, noted signs of improvement in the economy. 'Any sustained recovery will be felt relatively speedily by our divisions,' he said. Turnover fell to Pounds 104m (Pounds 107m). Operating profits dropped sharply from Pounds 8.64m to Pounds 5.83m, mainly because the dry cleaning division turned from a trading profit of Pounds 1.76m to a loss of Pounds 198,000. The company said the division returned to profit last month. The discounting campaign, which meant price cuts of 30 per cent or more, had started well, according to Mr John Richardson, joint deputy chairman. The textile services division was helped by winning new contracts and made operating profits of Pounds 5.43m (Pounds 5.53m). Interest costs fell to Pounds 1.07m (Pounds 2.62m). The company continued to repay borrowings, which fell to Pounds 6.92m (Pounds 11.9m), and gearing dropped from 31 per cent to 18 per cent. The exceptional charge stemmed from a provision on an interest rate swap agreement which was entered into in 1989, before the present management took charge. Earnings fell from 7.8p to 4.9p, or 6.6p without the exceptional. The company is recommending a maintained final dividend of 2p to make an unchanged total of 3p. COMMENT Three years after saving Sketchley, Mr Richardson and his fellow deputy chairman, Mr Tony Bloom, show a new determination, and perhaps impatience, to get the business moving. Price cutting, set to continue to the year end, is a calculated risk which needs large volume increases or margins will suffer. Meanwhile the two men are still looking for acquisitions and said a Pounds 30m or upwards target would be suitable. Both are familiar with managing larger companies, and acquisitions are likely to stray from the textile services sector. The City, apparently, is supportive. Mr Richardson said his institutions are ready to back a large takeover, as long as it makes sense. Smaller shareholders will doubtless show similar circumspection, especially since it is likely to herald a rights issue. Profits this year of Pounds 6m put the shares on 14 times. Until the future is clearer, that rating is about right.</p>

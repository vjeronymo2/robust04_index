			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: New loader range from Fermec FERMEC Holdings, the Manchester-based construction equipment company, today launches a new range of backhoe loaders in a bid for second place in the European market, led by another UK company, JC Bamford Excavators. Fermec, better known by its MF Industrial brand name, was formed last October by a management buy-out from Varity Corporation's Massey Ferguson Group. The launch is the most important in the company's history. Mr Richard Robson, managing director, said the four new backhoes could have a dramatic impact on the company, which has projected sales of Pounds 55m this year. Fermec is currently the third biggest European producer of rigid backhoe loaders, behind JCB with about 45 per cent of the market and Case with 20 per cent. Mr Robson said MF Industrial's share of the 10,000 to 10,500 unit market had risen by 3 percentage points to between 12 and 13 per cent since the buy-out, and there was no reason why it could not rise to 20 per cent with the new range. The backhoes have taken four years and between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m to develop, and could ultimately double the size of the company.</p>

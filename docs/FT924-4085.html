			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / China threatens to scrap deal on Hong Kong THE ROW between Britain and China over democracy in Hong Kong deepened yesterday when Beijing hinted that it might revoke the 1984 Sino-British agreement on the colony's future. The warning is the latest move in the campaign by Beijing to persuade the UK to withdraw its proposals to extend the scope of democracy in Hong Kong. In the 1984 joint declaration, Beijing promised that the territory would be allowed to maintain its capitalist system for 50 years. The threat came after the Hong Kong stock market registered its largest one-day drop in share prices since June 1989, when the Tiananmen Square demonstration and the suppression of the Beijing democracy movement led to a fall of more than 20 per cent in the market. At the close yesterday, the Hang Seng index, the market's barometer, was 434.44 points, or 8 per cent, lower at 4,978.21. Since its peak three weeks ago, the index has fallen nearly 23 per cent. Selling was frantic, with turnover of HKDollars 5.3bn (Pounds 456m). A local investment banking group became the first casualty of the collapse of confidence when it was forced to withdraw its HKDollars 300m flotation. Other new issues appear likely to be postponed. The only outcome which would satisfy the business community would be for the governor, Mr Chris Patten, to drop his proposals immediately. But, even with the stock market down more than 1,000 points this week, there is little expectation this will happen. In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry said that the issue facing Britain was now 'whether the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the other agreements reached between the two sides are still needed'. The ministry added that the only way to solve the problem was for the 'British Hong Kong authorities to return to the agreements reached between China and Britain'. Last night the Hong Kong government said Britain had made clear it was 'prepared to hold discussions without preconditions' with China on matters relating to a smooth transition of sovereignty in 1997. It said it was committed to the full implementation of the joint declaration. The rapid deterioration in Sino-British relations has caused serious concern among the people of Hong Kong and their political leaders. Local legislators were critical of China's scare tactics and feared for the effect they were having on local morale. Further volatility in Hong Kong share prices appears inevitable. Already market conditions have undermined the new issues market, with South China Brokerage yesterday withdrawing its HKDollars 300m flotation due to be launched on Monday. Separately, the company has also become the first securities house in the current climate to invoke the force majeure clause in an underwriting agreement. The clause permits the withdrawal of an underwriting commitment in situations of material and unforeseeable change. South China had underwritten a HKDollars 72m covered warrant issue on China Light and Power shares; by last night, the shares were 22 per cent below the warrant's strike price.

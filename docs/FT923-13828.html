			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Romanian farmers wait to see how the land lies - A vast majority has not received titles to redistributed property MR DAN Claudio Tanasescu, the mayor of Mogosoaia, a small farming village on the outskirts of Bucharest, made the national media last month when he became the first mayor in the county to complete distribution of land ownership certificates. To the outsider this may not seem a great achievement but in Romania the farmers of Mogosoaia are among the lucky few. The Ministry of Agriculture says that more than 70 per cent of agricultural land in the country is now in private hands, but 18 months after the passing of a land law re-establishing inheritance rights, less than 120,000 of Romania's 5.1m new land owners have received titles to their property. Difficulties in implementing the land law and carving up more than 8m hectares of land surface are at the centre of the problems besetting private agriculture in Romania which was one of Europe's richest farming nations before communist rule. With state farming, which still dominates livestock, milk and egg production, showing a steady decline, Romania needs to boost private agriculture to offset food shortages and cut agricultural imports, which cost the country Dollars 243m in the first five months of this year. Without titles to their property, private farmers cannot raise capital using land as collateral. And without capital they have been unable to buy enough seed or fertiliser, let alone invest in the new machinery needed for the small plots of farmland that have taken over from large state co-operatives. The Ministry of Agriculture estimates that more than a fifth of last year's potential grain harvest was lost because of fertiliser shortages. The absence of full ownership rights has also restricted the buying and selling of property, leaving the country's private agricultural land in uneconomical units of up to 10 hectares, the maximum amount granted to re-instituted owners under the land law. With plantings for many key crops - in particular, barley, maize and sugar beet - well down on last year, prospects for the 1992 harvest seem gloomy. Anticipating further shortages, the government has already banned the export of most staple food items, while the Ministry of Agriculture estimates that the country will import 1.5m tonnes of grain this year. Some help is on the horizon. Last month month the World Bank announced a loan of Dollars 100m for credits to private farmers. The Romanian government has already set aside Dollars 26m to be lent to farmers at an interest rate of 15 per cent, less than a fifth of the base rate, while part of a 32m Ecu grant for agriculture from the European Community is being used to buy measuring equipment needed to speed up the division of land. However, many believe the key to revitalising agriculture in Romania lies in re-awakening the population's interest in the land. 'With their policy of industrialisation, the communists tried to destroy agriculture. Cities like Bucharest have more than doubled in the past two decades at the expense of rural areas, which are now severely under-populated,' says Mr Vasile Hreamata, an agriculture specialist at Codif, a local consultancy firm, partly owned by Charterhouse Bank, the UK-based merchant bank. 'Romanians have to be encouraged to move back to the countryside: agriculture is where our future lies.' Mr Hreamata believes there are already some positive signs. 'Up to 15 per cent of the residents of Bucharest spend their weekends and holidays working on land they have recently re-inherited, if it is within 100 km (60 miles) of the city,' he says. And with unemployment expected to double to more than 1m, about 12 per cent of the workforce, this year, he expects that many will find it profitable to move out of the cities permanently. Mogosoaia's Mr Tanasescu agrees. 'There is renewed interest in farming and initiative-taking,' he says, pointing to the speed with which local farmers formed groups to work the land while ownership disputes were resolved. Nearly 90 per cent of private land in the village is being farmed this year by the three new associations that have replaced the state co-operative. The mayor estimates that private farmers are twice as productive as the co-operative was. 'There is a big incentive - with Bucharest less than 20 km away, farmers can sell their produce in the markets very easily and profitably. People are beginning to realise this.' He believes productivity in the country will increase dramatically once other mayors follow his example. But returning the land to its rightful owners is a difficult and expensive task, and in villages larger than Mogosoaia, the process is likely to take much longer. It took the communists 12 years to collectivise Romania's farmland. With the country desperately short of funds, the country's rich farming potential may go unexploited for some time to come.</p>

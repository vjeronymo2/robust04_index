			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Doubts hit recovery in house sales CONDITIONS in the housing market remain extremely bleak in most parts of England and Wales, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. In its latest quarterly survey, covering the three months to July 31, the institution says a recovery in the housing market is being thwarted by a combination of factors, including employment uncertainty, gloomy economic news and the reality of negative equity. In some parts of the country, however  - including Portsmouth in Hampshire; Bath, Avon; Saffron Walden, Essex; Northampton; Cambridge; and Newbury, Berkshire  - there seems to have a been a short-term surge in activity caused by the prospect of the reintroduction of stamp duty. Exemption from the tax ends at midnight tonight. The exemption from stamp duty on house sales up to Pounds 250,000 has given the market in some parts of London a temporary boost, but the survey says that sellers continue to expect unrealistic prices while potential purchasers do not feel confident enough to enter the market. There also seem to be some stirrings in the housing market in parts of the Yorkshire area and Humberside. Conditions are rosiest in Grimsby, Humberside, and Telford, Shropshire. Conditions in the housing market in the south-east are said to be generally very quiet. The survey came as the Treasury estimated that up to 500,000 buyers had benefited from the suspension of stamp duty on most house purchases. The Treasury said it had never expected the effect of the eight-month moratorium on stamp duty to be 'dramatic'. The figure was well below government estimates in December last year when the exemption was announced. At that time the government said that at least 600,000 home buyers were expected to benefit.</p>

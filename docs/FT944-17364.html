			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sell-off prompts INA changes The Italian treasury last night carried out a management shake-up at INA, the Italian insurance group, in advance of the final phase of the sell-off the state's final 49 per cent tranche. Using its powers as majority shareholder, the treasury has appointed 10 of the 13 strong board as envisaged in INA's statutes prior to the sale in June of the government's 51 per cent stake for L4,900bn. Mr Lorenzo Pallesi, the chief executive who steered the privatisation road show, has been eased out in spite of having been confirmed in his post five months ago when the Berlusconi government took office. The treasury said the new board had been composed in consultation with INA's new shareholders. But not all the shareholders may be happy with the reshuffle as there is an unwritten rule that managements do not change during the course of privatisations. Two-thirds of the offering in June was bought by North American and British institutions.</p>

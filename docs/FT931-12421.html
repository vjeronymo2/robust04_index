			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Construction Contracts: Relieving traffic congestion at Ilkeston SHEPHARD HILL CIVIL ENGINEERING has been awarded five new orders totalling more than Pounds 6m. Pick of the bunch is the award of the Pounds 3.4m A6007 Ilkeston relief road to the company's Midland region based in Chesterfield. For Derbyshire County Council, Shephard Hill is to build 1.1km of dual carriageway, partly in cutting up to seven metres deep, with retaining walls, two footbridges and a pedestrian underpass. Shephard Hill is to renew its long association with British Coal Opencast which has engaged the company to carry out Pounds 1.25m of roadworks in connection with the Bleak House site near Cannock. Staffordshire County Council's design services department has designed the scheme and will supervise the diversion of the Hednesford and Ironstone roads as well as the construction of two underpasses. Network SouthEast has placed an order worth Pounds 1.2m with Shephard Hill's southern region to reconstruct and lengthen a railway bridge at Loampit Vale. This is necessary to accommodate the Lewisham town centre improvement which is also being undertaken by the company from its High Wycombe office. Other orders include coastal protection works at Caister (Pounds 169,000) and foundations for a substation (Pounds 103,000).</p>

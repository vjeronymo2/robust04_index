			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON;  </P> <P> NEW AMERICAN CUISINE COMES TO ORANGE COUNTY AT AN AFFORDABLE, POPULIST PRICE  </P> <P> The new American cuisine is somewhat of a sacred cow with self-styled foodies,  who gobble it up at such restaurants as Spago in West Hollywood, Trees in  Corona del Mar or Pasadena's Parkway Grill. But it is not so sacred to the  owner of the last establishment, restaurateur Greg Smith.  </P> <P> Two years ago, Smith did what many proponents of American cuisine have only  talked about: He made a populist movement out of it, opening a small, laughably  inexpensive cafe version of his restaurant on Pasadena's busy Lake Avenue.  </P> <P> He named his restaurant Crocodile Cafe, after the yuppie symbol found on the  Lacoste shirt, and even he could not have predicted the overwhelming response.  People crowded at the door at all hours, even 3 in the afternoon, to enjoy his  wood-fired designer pizzas, homemade pastas and meats grilled over smoking  woods.  </P> <P> Now the inevitable has happened. Smith has expanded the business. Crocodile  Cafe in the Brea Marketplace has the same menu and the same good food that made  the Pasadena restaurant take off like a Roman candle. Now the big question is,  will it play in Orange County? So far the answer appears to be yes.  </P> <P> Cold weather has kept the patio empty, but when a friend and I walk into the  cafe for our first meal there, a smiling hostess rushes to open the door for  us. Looking up, we see a giant, green vinyl crocodile hanging from a  multicolored parachute almost 20 feet up. Shades of Frank Gehry?  </P> <P> We sit on high-tech, black-vinyl chairs at a mock granite table and notice how  young the crowd is. Nearly everyone seems to be eating pizza and stealing  glances at the outrageous mural, a 30-foot seascape of a crocodile (what else)  water skiing.  </P> <P> Our senses are immediately aroused by the scents coming from the Spago-style  open kitchen, and as we open the menu, it looks suspiciously familiar. We begin  with a half Caesar salad, and a fabulously succulent Anaheim chile stuffed with  smoked Jack cheese in a tomatillo salsa. The salsa is a pale green, like the  crocodile.  </P> <P> My friend is not eating meat that evening, so he progresses to a vegetable  pizza, a complex affair with eggplant, green pepper, red onion, tomato,  caramelized garlic and fresh herbs. It looks as if Jackson Pollock has taken up  cooking, and it's one of the best pizzas we have ever tasted. I try the  marinated flank steak with cumin-spiked fresh vegetables, and find it as  delightfully oaky as a blue-ribbon Chardonnay. I finish it in world-record  time.  </P> <P> On a second visit I am joined by my wife, and a different smiling face springs  to the door to open it. (The first time we thought it was an accident.) We  begin with a misnamed, but entirely reasonable tortilla soup -- a gazpacho  textured vegetable puree with strips of tortilla on top. The waitress brings  two spoons without being asked.  </P> <P> When my wife tells the waitress she is in the mood for spicy pasta, the  waitress recommends fettuccine with grilled chicken, roasted Pasilla chile,  fresh corn, cilantro, and ancho-chile cream. We both agree it sounds like a bit  much, but when it arrives, we fight over it, and I catch my wife hoarding the  little bits of fresh corn stuck to the bottom of the dish. And I thought  marriage is supposed to be based on trust.  </P> <P> My dish is not as good -- an oak-grilled Coho salmon special on a bed of  raspberry-vinegared greens that have gotten a bit limp under the fish. And I do  not care for the potato pancakes I order on the side. They bear little  resemblance to the crisp, deli-style sort I'm used to.  </P> <P> Undaunted, we return for Sunday brunch. My wife has amazingly good fusilli  pasta with homemade sausage, tomatoes, and fresh herbs to start, while I munch  on a barbecued chicken pizza that is covered with plenty of sweet, pungent  sauce. Then she has a blue-corn tostada salad with black beans, served in a  bowl so enormous she can only manage about one fifth of it. I can eat only half  of my wonderful roast beef sandwich grilled with tomatoes, Jack cheese, arugula  and spiced mayonnaise. The waitress brings plastic boxes for the leftovers.  </P> <P> If the Crocodile Cafe misses the mark occasionally, it is probably in the  dessert section. Beignets, written up on the wordy menu as "a deep south  doughnut delight! Rolled in Maple sugar and served with a chocolate sauce for  dipping," come with brown sugar instead and are too well done. When I ask the  waitress where the maple sugar is, she replies "this is our maple sugar."  </P> <P> A densely rich, devilishly dark slice of chocolate cake looks great, but tastes  curiously stale. Far better are soft, chewy brownies and fresh berries with  cinnamon-vanilla whipped cream. Those I am happy to eat as often as my doctor  will permit me.  </P> <P> Smith is a devoted wine buff, so you can bet your Beamer that the wines he has  chosen are of good repute. Chardonnays including William Hill and Stratford,  and Cabernet Sauvignons including Fitch Mountain and Clos du Bois are all  available by the glass at precisely one-fourth of the reasonable bottle prices.  What else would you expect from a populist.  </P> <P> Crocodile Cafe is inexpensive to moderate, and without equal in its price  category. Soups and small plates are $1.95 to $5.80; salads are $2.95 to $6.75;  sandwiches are $5.25 and $5.95; pasta, pizza and calzone are $5.95 to $7.25;  large plates are $7.95 to $8.75.  </P> <P> CROCODILE CAFE  </P> <P> In the Brea Marketplace, 975 E. Birch St., Brea  </P> <P> (714) 529-2233  </P> <P> Open daily from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., until midnight on weekends  </P> <P> All major cards accepted  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 24 (CNA) -- A group of Latin American  ambassadors stationed in Taipei Tuesday [24 May] urged the  Republic of China [ROC] to encourage its businessmen to increase  investment in their countries.    The envoys made the call during a seminar on relations  between the ROC and Latin American countries sponsored by  Legislator Cheng Chien-jen of the ruling Kuomintang.    The ROC has shared long-term friendship with Central  American  countries. Many of the 29 countries with which it maintains  formal diplomatic ties are located in Central America. Due in  part to geographical distance, commercial exchanges between  Taiwan and the region, however, remain limited.    Paraguayan Ambassador Miguel Angel Solano-Lopez Casco said  he  regrets that many Taiwan companies, while ignoring his call for  investing in his country, have made large investments in  Mainland China and other countries or areas with which Taiwan  does not have diplomatic ties.    Paraguay is the only South American country that  diplomatically recognizes Taiwan. Lopez said Paraguay not only  hopes to promote political ties with the ROC but also wants to  strengthen bilateral trade and economic cooperation.    Taiwan businessmen's overseas investment activities do not  seem to comply with the ROC Government's diplomatic policy,  Lopez noted.    Speaking at the same occasion, Salvadoran Ambassador David  Ernesto Panama [name as received] said mutual interests are key  to maintaining longstanding diplomatic ties.    Panama said he appreciates all the assistance the ROC has  given his country over the past years. He pointed out that his  country has also suffered from its close ties with Taiwan,  saying that Mainland China has boycotted his country's  activities in the United Nations and secretly supported leftists  in El Salvador.    Panama said he is willing to play the role of "go-between"  to  help prospective Taiwan investors launch new ventures in his  country. "I also hope the ROC Government can actively encourage  local businessmen to invest in El Salvador," he added.    Ambassadors from other Central American countries, including  the Dominican Republic and Honduras, also attended the seminar.</p>

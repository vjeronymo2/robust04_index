			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / The knife comes out for a second time / A report on restructuring at United Technologies It is not every day that the chairman of one of the largest companies in the US announces that he is setting in motion 'a transformation that is more profound and more potent than any single event in the corporation's history'. Yet that was the message this week from Mr Robert Daniell, chairman of United Technologies, the Connecticut-based aerospace and building products group best known for its Pratt &amp; Whitney aero-engines, Sikorsky helicopters, Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioners. Mr Daniell was announcing plans for restructuring the business over the next two years, which will involve: the elimination of 13,900 jobs, about 7 per cent of the workforce; the closure or consolidation of more than 100 facilities around the world; improvements in product design, engineering and manufacturing processes; and a Dollars 1.28bn (Pounds 708m) charge against fourth-quarter earnings, pushing UTC to a net loss of Dollars 1.02bn in 1991. The goal is to improve UTC's financial performance, which has been hit by recession and a downturn in US defence spending, and boost its return on equity to 18 per cent by 1994, compared with about 15 per cent in 1990. Since the summer, the company has been signalling its intentions to cut costs yet Wall Street was surprised and impressed by the scale of this week's pruning, while a little sceptical over how easily UTC can achieve its aims. UTC faces tough markets for many of its main products over the next few years, and some analysts still need convincing that, in spite of a widely praised shake-up at the group over the past five years, its management is ruthless enough to achieve the necessary change. That is presumably why Mr Daniell went out of his way this week to assure Wall Street that 'United Technologies will be a very different company, leaner and tougher minded'. UTC has already improved on the bureaucratic, complacent business that Mr Daniell took over as chief executive in the mid-1980s. At that time, customers of Pratt &amp; Whitney, one of the world's big three aero-engine manufacturers and UTC's most important business, were so tired of poor service that they were deserting to US rival, General Electric. Mr Daniell set about the kind of cultural change many large US corporations are now attempting: pushing responsibility from the centre to smaller groups more responsive to customers, while cutting costs by staff reductions and improvements in manufacturing techniques and stock control. The changes had a dramatic effect. Pratt cut its manufacturing costs by 21 per cent between 1987 and 1991, while its improved service and new PW4000 engine for wide-bodied jets helped push its share of firm aero-engine market orders from 29 per cent in 1988 to 35 per cent in 1990. UTC's net income rose from Dollars 636m in 1985 to Dollars 751m in 1990, with Pratt accounting for 60 per cent of operating profits. However, the past year has seen UTC's financial performance reverse, with group operating profits dropping from Dollars 1.65bn in 1990 to Dollars 968m on virtually unchanged revenues of Dollars 21bn. The most serious drop is in its power division - essentially Pratt - where profits were halved from Dollars 1.01bn to Dollars 502m. Like rivals GE and Britain's Rolls-Royce, Pratt has been badly hit by the recession in the commercial airline business and the wave of consolidations and bankruptcies among US carriers. Sales of commercial spare parts, which aero-engine manufacturers rely on for a large part of their profits, have slumped, while competition for new orders is forcing manufacturers into give-away prices. Moreover, the end of the Cold War and the gradual reduction in the Pentagon's budget means that most US defence contractors face declining business. The Otis elevator and Carrier air-conditioning businesses have also been badly mauled by the severe downturn in the US building industry, while depression in the car industry has hit UTC's autoparts division. This much harsher environment has exposed UTC's reshaping over the past five years as not having gone far enough, fast enough. Pratt &amp; Whitney, for example, says its manufacturing costs are still 5 per cent higher than those of rival GE Aircraft Engines. At the same time, Pratt's market share of firm engine orders slipped back to 29 per cent last year. Mr Daniell's new restructuring is meant to solve these problems. All UTC businesses will be shedding staff and cutting production capacity, but the biggest changes will be at Pratt, which will cut its labour force by 5,000, or 11 per cent, and eliminate 30 per cent of its manufacturing space. Pratt aims to be the industry's low-cost producer by 1994 and the changes will also involve revamping its manufacturing processes and relations with suppliers. Unless the plan goes badly awry, Pratt's medium-term future should be reasonably bright, because of its model range, emphasis on international partnerships and the expected growth of world airline traffic in the second half of the 1990s. Otis and Carrier, the world leaders in their markets, would also benefit from a recovery in the US economy. Carrier, which has repeatedly disappointed Wall Street with poor earnings, may be about to benefit from a burst of capital spending which could boost its market share. It will probably take years to determine whether this week's package amounts to the 'profound' transformation promised by Mr Daniell, or is a more superficial recessionary remedy. But at the very least, the plan will give a much-needed boost to UTC's profits potential over the next few years.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNITED TECHNOLOGIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- REVENUE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dollars billion (year end Dec 31)       1988    1989    1990    1991*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Power                                   6.35    6.99    7.29    7.20 Flight systems                          3.70    3.78    4.03    4.00 Building systems                        6.51    7.24    7.99    8.01 Industrial products for the   automative and other industries       1.97    1.93    2.62    2.10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- OPERATING PROFIT (LOSS)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dollars million (year end Dec 31)       1988    1989    1990    1991*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Power                                  679.1   939.1  1009.9   502.0 Flight systems                         (36.9)   26.1    89.5    52.0 Building systems                       386.0   458.0   424.6   341.0 Industrial products for the   automative and other industries      214.8   155.9   150.0    64.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company report                               *Before charges  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

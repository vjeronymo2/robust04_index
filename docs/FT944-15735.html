			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Property group wins Pounds 251m for Australian interests Hammerson, the UK property group, yesterday clinched the sale of its Australian property interests for Pounds 251m (USDollars 396m), after a bidding race helped push the price to a substantial premium on recent valuations. The UK company, with an international portfolio valued at about Pounds 1.7bn, is now expected to launch an aggressive acquisition programme in continental Europe, particularly France. Hammerson has conditionally agreed a cash deal to sell six office buildings and one shopping centre to Australian Mutual Provident Society. The properties were revalued last year at Pounds 178.3m, against Pounds 211m in 1992. Mr Ron Spinney, chief executive, said bidding had been fierce for the Australian properties. 'There has been a considerable improvement in conditions in Australia over the last six months,' he said. The properties last year contributed income of ADollars 27m (Pounds 12.5m). Mr Spinney said that Hammerson decided to sell when it became apparent they would require further investment. Hammerson intends to use the proceeds over the next 15 months to increase its exposure to retail developments. The company will also seek to bolster its portfolios in the UK and continental Europe. After the deal, 55 per cent of Hammerson's portfolio will in the UK, 15 per cent in continental Europe and 30 per cent in North America. Hammerson is in advanced talks on potential property deals in France. Mr Spinney said that the group would seek opportunities in Germany in due course. Yesterday's deal was expected to enhance Hammerson's earnings per share. Even Hammerson's decision initially to leave the cash on deposit would add 1.9p to earnings, Mr Spinney said. The company's gearing - debt as a percentage of shareholders' funds - would fall from 63 per cent to 36 per cent after the deal. Last year the group raised Pounds 199m through a seven-for-15 rights issue at 285p to bolster a weak balance sheet. The shares closed on Friday at 330p. Mr Spinney said just two US significant properties remained to be sold.</p>

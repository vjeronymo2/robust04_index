			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Revamped Boustead incurs Pounds 49,000 loss BOUSTEAD, the industrial products and technical services group acquired last year by Jack Chia-MPH, the Singapore-based trading company, yesterday reported full year results which reflected tough trading conditions and the impact of a wide-ranging restructuring. After Jack Chia-MPH acquired its controling 74.77 per cent interest a new management team undertook restructuring aimed at streamlining the group's structure, improving its business focus, reducing gearing and lowering the cost base. Costs associated with the restructuring led to a Pounds 49,000 pre-tax loss in 1992 compared with a Pounds 886,000 profit. Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 78.1m (Pounds 76.5m). After a Pounds 975,000 (Pounds 1.64m) extraordinary charge to cover the closure of two Singapore businesses and costs of the change in control, and 'exceptionally high' tax charges of Pounds 1.09m (Pounds 480,000), losses per share were 1.6p, compared to earnings of 0.6p. However, the final dividend is held at a recommended 0.35p, maintaining the total for the year at 0.7p. In Singapore a number of businesses which did not fit the new strategy were sold or closed last year, reducing the number of businesses there from 31 to 11. In the UK, following business sales and mergers, the group is now focused on the manufacture of industrial products for European markets in two main business areas, automotive components and cleaning equipment. Since the year-end the group has sold another two businesses in Singapore and one in the UK for a total of Pounds 8.9m, bringing overall proceeds from disposals to Pounds 12.9m. These funds have mainly been used to strengthen the balance sheet. If all the disposals had been completed by the year-end the group would have had net cash of Pounds 2.9m and shareholders funds of Pounds 20.5m. The group is changing its financial year-end to March 31 to conform with Jack Chia-MPH's accounting year.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BET ends year Pounds 92m in black - Restructuring complete but difficult trading conditions persist BET, the business services group which over-expanded by acquisition during the 1980s, said its restructuring was complete, but warned that pressure on margins and difficult trading conditions persisted across much of the group. Mr John Clark, chief executive, said: 'We expect to see earnings improvement coming from better productivity rather than increased selling prices.' BET made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 92m in the year to April 2, compared with a loss of Pounds 9.8m in the previous year, which included Pounds 76m of exceptional costs. Restructuring costs of Pounds 42m were incurred this time, of which Pounds 34m had already been provided for. Turnover fell by 9 per cent to Pounds 1.97bn, in spite of a Pounds 61m favourable currency effect, mainly because of divestments. The group said a further 17 non-core businesses had been sold during the year, and the disposal programme was now complete. Mr Clark added: 'I said when appointed that it would take three years - and it has. We have gone from 160 disparate profit centres to a set of four focused businesses.' BET had net cash of Pounds 67m at the year-end, compared with debts of more than Pounds 1bn when Mr Clark and his new team arrived. The chief executive said his priority would be to invest in organic growth and 'bolt-on' acquisitions, although he would consider a bigger purchase 'if the right one came along'. The group said the speed of its success in improving performance would depend on efforts to improve productivity and marketing skills. Higher productivity would enable it to offset inflation and price pressure, while the marketing programme was aimed at developing value-added services in new areas. Operating profit from business services rose from Pounds 14.1m to Pounds 31.8m, although the previous figure was depressed by the Pounds 11.5m share of the Pounds 76m exceptional item allotted to the division. BET said the underlying 24 per cent growth in operating profits was helped by margin improvements in UK cleaning and security services and US personnel services. Distribution services turned in an operating profit of Pounds 30.8m, against Pounds 9.3m, or Pounds 20.8m minus Pounds 11.5m of exceptionals. Underlying growth of 48 per cent comprised rises of Pounds 5m from the US, Pounds 3m from Europe and Pounds 2m from Africa. Plant services increased operating profit to Pounds 18.8m (Pounds 15.8m), or Pounds 26.5m minus Pounds 10.7m of exceptionals. Lower margins led to the 29 per cent fall in underlying performance, in spite of a good showing in the US. Textile services' operating profits rose from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 35.4m, or Pounds 28.1m minus Pounds 22.5m of exceptionals. BET said improved margins from this business caused the 26 per cent increase in underlying profitability. Earnings per share of 6.9p compared with losses of 4p last time. A final dividend of 2.25p maintains the total at 3.25p. See Lex</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: The mutation of Mr Major Is it only three years since John Major shot through a hole in the ozone layer and fell to earth? It seems longer than three years. It seems like half a lifetime. He does not go away. He just keeps mutating. Digging himself in deeper. Singing a different tune. Softening or hardening the message as circumstance dictates. It used to look haphazard, but that was just a smokescreen. I think we have got a problem. I went to a dinner this week. The good, the great and the pasty. Tiaras and jewelled cuff-links. Servants scuttling and scraping. Everyone in their place. You could hardly call it classless. There was a peculiar, malevolent heartiness, and a single recurring joke. 'Did you hear the one about the single mother of twins who wrote to the council because she wanted a larger house with a swimming pool and a squash court?' The toastmaster cleared his throat. My lords, ladies and gentlemen, pray silence for the prime minister. And up stood John Major, talking about core values. Time to get back to basics. Family first and foremost. It only takes self-discipline. Britain once ruled the waves, and so she would again. Next day I visited a supermarket. Sainsbury's, as it happened. I could tell by the rudeness and queues. The price war was turning vicious. They were giving the stuff away. I recognised the patrons. I had seen them the night before: the good, the great and the pasty. Only their clothes were different. Their voices were the same. They were laughing just as loudly. 'Did you hear the one about the single mother of twins who wrote to the council because she wanted a larger house with a swimming pool and a squash court?' John Major, boatered and aproned, was serving at the meat counter. Business was very brisk. As the prime minister wrapped sausages and trimmed the fat from chops, he spoke about his determination to return to core values, rediscover the basics, family first and foremost, only takes self-discipline, Britain would rule again. That night I went to the theatre. They were all there in their seats: the good, the great, the pasty. The joke ran round and round. 'Did you hear the one about the single mother who wrote to the council . . . ?' John Major appeared at the interval, earning sustained applause for a moving evocation of a gentler, simpler age when families stayed together and just stuck to basics. Wove their own cloth, crushed their own grain, trampled their own wine and amused themselves at home with quizzes and simple games. Envy was unknown. Everyone in his place. You got ahead or you didn't, and were grateful in either case. Crime was barely heard of. Children could read and write. Britain was strong and healthy, and would be strong and healthy again. Core values and self-discipline. I noticed, at the theatre, that the good, the great and the pasty spoke and laughed loudly whenever they thought I was watching; but that when I looked away and they thought I wasn't noticing their eyes grew cold and mean and they glared at each other suspiciously. Yet their faces would light up as soon as the joke was repeated. 'Did you hear the one about the single mother of twins who wrote to the council . . . ?' Really extremely odd. More than a little frightening. When John Major first shot through a hole in the ozone layer and fell to earth, we were extremely happy to see him. Our gratitude knew no bounds. And then the accidents started. Many things went awry. He seemed dithery and cack-handed. Trouble just sought him out. So then the mutations started. He even won an election. But the accident rate increased. His days were strictly numbered. Or so it was supposed. But that was just a smokescreen. He was learning on the job. Mutating and transforming himself. Varying the pitch of the tune. Softening or hardening the message. John Major looks exactly the same today as he did three years ago. The hair, the teeth, the glasses, the fixed and famous smile. He really is agreeable. Only the message varies. But we have even got used to that. His resilience is astonishing. He just keeps bouncing back. It dawned on me this week that there is now no reason on earth why John Major shouldn't win the next election. I think we have got a problem.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa slips on Keys report Johannesburg was unsettled by early reports that Mr Derek Keys, the minister of finance, was to resign. Industrials slipped in late trade as golds held on to most of their earlier gains, writes Michael Morgan. In subsequent London trading on Seaq International, South African equities were marked sharply lower as the market awaited clarification of the reasons for Mr Keys' departure. Among mining issues, Anglo American was 4.6 per cent down, De Beers dropped 3.9 per cent and Vaal Reefs fell 3.1 per cent. Sappi, South Africa's biggest pulp and paper company, retreated 3.1 per cent. Last night, Mr Charles Kernot at Credit Lyonnais Laing in London said Mr Keys' confirmation that he was leaving for personal reasons would be less of a body blow for the market than if there had been policy differences. Much would now depend on who was named as his successor. In Johannesburg trading, the overall index finished 3 softer at 5,451, industrials lost 20 at 6,267 and golds showed an advance of 9 at 2,172. De Beers added 25 cents at R108, Anglos fell R2 to R228 and Vaal Reefs was R3 higher at R418. Sappi rose 25 cents to R46.25 following the chairman's bullish annual review.</p>

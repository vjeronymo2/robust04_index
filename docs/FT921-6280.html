			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Thomas Cook declines 68% to Pounds 8.9m PROFITS of Thomas Cook, the travel subsidiary of Midland Bank, fell 68 per cent to Pounds 8.9m pre-tax for the 1991 year. Turnover rose 6 per cent to Pounds 429.6m, writes Michael Skapinker. The results were a sharp contrast to those of other large tour operators - such as Airtours and Owners Abroad - which recently reported large profit increases. The operators gained increased market share following the collapse last year of Mr Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group. Thomas Cook, however, provided Pounds 2m in exceptional costs resulting from refunds and alternative holidays offered to ILG customers. The company was also badly affected by the Gulf war and the downturn in business travel. Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, said many companies had instructed travelling employees to book cheaper classes of airline tickets. Thomas Cook also suffered from corporate customers' financial difficulties. A further Pounds 8m exceptional provision was made against bad debts and travellers' cheque fraud. Mr Middleton said the company had continued to expand in continental Europe. It had invested in new businesses in the Netherlands and Belgium, expanded operations in Germany and opened its first office in Prague. He added that the company was interested in buying the 50 per cent stake in Thomas Cook Travel in the US that was owned by companies associated with the late Mr Robert Maxwell.</p>

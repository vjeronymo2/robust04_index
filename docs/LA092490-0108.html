			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARY COMPANIES FIND MUM'S THE WORD;  </P> <P> LITIGATION: BESET BY LAWSUITS, PUBLIC COMPANIES ARE INCREASINGLY CAREFUL OF  WHAT THEY SAY. MORE AND MORE, THEY SAY IS NOTHING.  </P> <P> After shareholders hit L.A. Gear with 24 class-action suits in June, lawyers  for the Southern California maker of trendy footwear and clothing ordered  executives to clam up.  </P> <P> L.A. Gear officials called off a planned dinner for securities analysts at a  July sporting goods show in Chicago, prompting one Sutro &amp; Co. stock  watcher to cancel his trip there.  </P> <P> "The company had always been very good about communicating, and then all of a  sudden they stopped talking," said Jonathan H. Ziegler, who analyzes retail  stocks for the San Francisco-based brokerage. "I didn't want to just see their  spring line."  </P> <P> The upshot was that Ziegler, who had been high on the company for years but had  issued a "hold" recommendation at $48 a share, began telling investment clients  that he could offer them no guidance on the stock whatsoever. Meanwhile, the  shares have sunk to $14.25.  </P> <P> With disappointed investors increasingly taking to the courts to complain about  what they see as fraud or deceit by management, more companies are finding  themselves in the position of L.A. Gear. To speak or not to speak about rosy  projections and new miracle products becomes the question. If companies want to  play it safe, mum should be the word.  </P> <P> That was the message to Ziegler and about 340 other executives and investment  professionals at a seminar held recently in Palo Alto by Morrison &amp;  Foerster, a San Francisco-based law firm.  </P> <P> Titled "Disclosures to Analysts and the Press: Avoiding Shareholder  Litigation," the session was an attempt to guide concerned companies through a  minefield of confusing and seemingly conflicting requirements about what they  should reveal, and when.  </P> <P> Companies looking for strict guidelines, however, were told that they were out  of luck. "There are no clear rules that you can look up," said Joseph A.  Grundfest, a former Securities and Exchange Commission official who now teaches  at Stanford University's law school. "A great deal boils down to common sense."  </P> <P> Grundfest added that companies choosing to maintain an open-door policy should  be careful to reveal material information to all analysts.  </P> <P> "Why would you want to disclose some information selectively to a particular  analyst . . . ahead of another?" he said, urging companies to avoid the  "inadvertent slip of the tongue" that can get them into trouble.  </P> <P> William D. Sherman, a Morrison &amp; Foerster attorney who spoke about the  scarcity of law on the subject, noted that companies have "absolutely no duty  to disclose material inside information" unless required by securities laws.  </P> <P> Yet confusion can reign, he said, when companies attempt to abide by stock  exchange guidelines. He cited a passage in the New York Stock Exchange manual  stating that "a listed company is expected to release quickly to the public any  news or information which might reasonably be expected to materially affect the  market for its securities." The document goes on: "But a corporation may be  excused from announcements when there is a valid reason for doing so."  </P> <P> The best way to avoid lawsuits is "to tell the truth," said William S. Lerach,  a San Diego attorney who has represented shareholders against companies in more  than 200 cases in the past 15 years.  </P> <P> "It's very simple," he added. "That's all the federal law says. Don't conceal  your problems. Don't fib."  </P> <P> Lerach is the lead counsel on the L.A. Gear suits, which were recently  consolidated into one complaint. He said companies should beware of hype. L.A.  Gear shareholders, for example, allege that officials falsified financial  statements and misrepresented the beneficial effect of a highly touted  promotional deal with entertainer Michael Jackson.  </P> <P> Kevin J. Ventrudo, L.A. Gear's chief financial officer, declined to comment.  </P> <P> Although companies often settle such shareholder suits, frequently for tens of  millions of dollars, L.A. Gear has "vowed to litigate to the bitter end,"  according to Lerach. (Law firms generally take these cases on a contingency  basis, receiving 20% to 30% of a settlement or jury award. Lerach noted that  plaintiffs in any given case may be represented by as many as seven law firms,  with the fee split among them.)  </P> <P> Lawyers' warnings aside, some companies still believe that openness is the best  policy.  </P> <P> "The more you tell about the company, and the quicker you tell it to the widest  possible audience, the less likely you are to run afoul of the traps artfully  scattered in the shifting sands of the securities laws," Marvin L. Krasnansky,  a spokesman for San Francisco-based McKesson Corp., told the seminar  participants. Krasnansky said the company, a distributor of pharmaceuticals and  bottled water, has developed a reputation for timely disclosure and has  benefited from extensive coverage by analysts.  </P> <P> Although participants went away with the overwhelming message that silence is  golden, it's unlikely that lawyers who represent shareholders will be running  out of business.  </P> <P> As Leonard D. Simon, a colleague of Lerach, told the audience: "Why should I be  here telling all you people how not to get into trouble? Because I'm sure you  won't be able to follow my advice."  </P></p>

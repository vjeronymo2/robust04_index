			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Baccalaureate offers more depth and flexibility Sir, With reference to your editorial, 'A-levels fail the test of time' (August 22), any unbiased observer must agree that specialising in three subjects at the age of 16 is detrimental to a student's development and, in the long run, to the nation's economy. However, the alternative you propose, five A-levels, with a 20 per cent lighter syllabus, is only a partial solution. Scientifically-inclined students would tend to take only maths and science subjects, while the others would tend to take only arts subjects and languages. This system would thus run the danger of producing a large number of what is known in German as 'Fachidioten'. Surely it would be preferable to introduce a system similar to that of the International Baccalaureate: students must sit six exams, English (in English-medium schools) and maths are compulsory as are one science subject, one arts subject (for example, history or economics), and one foreign language. The sixth subject may be chosen from any of these groups. In addition, students may, if they wish, take a seventh or even an eighth subject, and a class in epistemology and an 'extended essay' are also compulsory. This system has the merit of striking a good balance between a broadly-based and an in-depth education while at the same time allowing a good deal of flexibility.

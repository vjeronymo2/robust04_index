			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] Deputy Julio  Castillo, a member of the congressional Permanent Finance  Commission, has said it would be a serious mistake for the  government to continue subsidizing intervened banks. He said the  financial assistance granted thus far is equivalent to  approximately half of the next national budget.    According to Castillo, the financial assistance granted thus  far to banks experiencing problems of liquidity had unleashed  the inflation process, which is the usual consequence of  releasing inorganic funds into a weakened economy such as  Venezuela's. Castillo said his party will ask the executive  branch to step up the process of reopening the intervened banks  so they can pay their depositors.</p>

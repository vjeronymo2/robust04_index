The Russians asked  the Serbs to withdraw their artillery from around Sarajevo; the  Serbs fulfilled the Russians' wish, while pretending at the same  time not to have accepted the NATO ultimatum; the UN  representative declared that the warring factions had fulfilled  all the requirements and the strategists in Aviano called off  the bombing flights. In the meantime, the Russians, in "blue  helmets," arrived in Grbavica, defused the time bomb, and left  NATO "swimming in an empty pool," thus asserting in grand style  their return not only to the Balkans, but also to the  international scene.    Moscow celebrated this action as its great diplomatic  victory. Yeltsin's headquarters made it known that not a single  shot had been fired, not a single life had been threatened, and  not a single kopeck had been spent. Russia had regained its  historical role in the Balkans and had showed the scope of its  influence in Europe and in the world.    Surprised and to some extent offended, the Americans  officially thanked the Russians for their skilled action.  However, there prevailed the view in the United States that  Russia had suddenly changed the Sarajevo scenario on its own.  It was claimed that Russia had sent its UN troops to Sarajevo  without informing the United States, that it had reached an  agreement with the Bosnian Serbs in order to satisfy its  nationalists, that it had helped the Serbs to preserve their  honor, thus presenting the United States with an accomplished  fact.    All other opinions and assessments lie between these two  standpoints. One hears the view that Russia has not only saved  the honor of the Serbs but also that of the Americans and NATO,  and even its own, since, for a long time, it has given in to the  West over the Yugoslav crisis. According to the opinion of  some, they had offered their support to the Serbs, while,  according to others, they had forced them to accept the  ultimatum by using persuasion instead of threats.    In Pale, where Russian soldiers were welcomed with bread and  salt, the Moscow move was interpreted as a guarantee that the  Serbian population around Sarajevo would be protected and that  there would not be a change in the strategic balance on the  battlefields after the heavy weapons have been withdrawn.  Russia had also brought the necessary balance into the peace  process and had reestablished the confidence of the Bosnian  Serbs in the UN and the international community in general. The  view was also expressed that future relations between Russia and  the United States might be defined in Bosnia.    There is no doubt that Russia succeeded in reducing the  pressure that had built up all over the world as the deadline  for the ultimatum drew near. Russia opposed the ultimatum and  announced a great diplomatic initiative aimed at securing  permanent peace in Bosnia. Taking into account that Russia has  not formulated its own concept for resolving the Bosnian crisis  since the outbreak of the civil war two years ago and that it  has only followed the proposals of the Geneva peace conference  and the UN Security Council, the announcement of a diplomatic  initiative is already a sign that Russia is ready to participate  actively in the peace process in former Yugoslavia. It is  immaterial whether this more active role on the part of Russia  is a consequence of internal pressure or stems from the view  that ultimatums must not become a normal solution to complex  international problems.    The initial reactions indicate that Russia has showed that  it  has the status of a super power again, at least in the Balkans.  In addition, it is stated that Russia has always been powerful  when it has been a force in the Balkans.    The Russians have shown the West, primarily the Americans,  that they will not accept the status of an unequal or simply  obedient partner and that their cooperative attitude has perhaps  been interpreted in the wrong way. They does not want their  good relations with the West, primarily with the United States,  to deteriorate, but they indicate that disagreements could serve  as a warning to both countries that the balance in international  relations must be reestablished, especially between "influential  partners," as this is euphemistically expressed by Russian  diplomacy.    It seems that the new Russian initiative, which was  announced  by Kozyrev, and which was probably discussed during the meeting  in Bonn, is a part of Yeltsin's proposal to discuss the future  of Bosnia at a summit involving the "big five": the United  States, Great Britain, France, Germany, and Russia. Most of  these countries are permanent members of the UN Security  Council; China's place was offered to Germany as the most  influential country in the European Union.    At the same time, Russia has announced that the European or  the U.S. peace proposals for Bosnia are not the only ones that  exist. Russia, for example, does not think that "the Sarajevo  model" can be applied easily to other towns, which seems to be a  broadly accepted attitude in the West. Not only because they  oppose a series of ultimatums, but also for practical reasons:  The additional massing of UN peacekeeping forces is very  expensive.    Regardless of how the return of the Russians to the Balkans  might be assessed, it is true that they have taken away the war  toy from NATO strategists and obliged international diplomacy to  reconsider all options, except for the bombing one. It can  hardly be imagined that bombs could fall on Serbian positions  around Sarajevo if Russian "blue helmets" are stationed there.  Decisions about possible new ultimatums will also not be passed  that easily.    It is not clear what will happen on the diplomatic scene.  Will the UN, which has so far been dominated by the United  States, realize that its reputation has been enhanced with the  help of the Russians, as UN officials claim? What is the role  of the Geneva peace conference in the context of the Russian  proposal to hold a "big five" summit, given that Owen and  Stoltenberg did not participate in the Bonn meeting?    The Russian action and their return to the Balkans will be  discussed for a long time, but a difference will be made between  tactics and strategy, once the surprise and euphoria have  subsided.    Two very important components -- the economic and the  military -- are still missing for a real return of Russian  influence to this part of the Balkans. The scope of the first  cannot be established on account of the transformation process  in Russia, on the one hand, and the blockade of Yugoslavia, on  the other. The military component, if "blue helmets" are  excluded, is simply inconceivable. This means that, apart from  romanticism and tradition, there is only diplomatic and  political influence: The Russians have a dialogue with the  Serbs based on mutual trust, which no other international power  has. The United States and most Western countries are ignoring  Serbia as a necessary element in the search for a solution to  the Bosnian and Yugoslav crisis in general.    The most important question now is to what extent will  Russia, with permission from the West, develop into a strong  diplomatic mediator, that is to say, into an influential power.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Big Seat plant opens SEAT, Volkswagen's Spanish subsidiary, yesterday officially opened a Pta244bn (Pounds 1.4bn) manufacturing plant with a capacity of 1,500 units a day, writes Tom Burns in Madrid. Mr Clive Griffiths, the plant manager and a former executive of Nissan's plant in Sunderland, England, believes the factory at Martorell, near Barcelona, could be the last large car plant to be built in western Europe. It is the key element in Seat's 10-year, Pta800bn capital-spending plan. Full production will begin later this year making a bigger version of the Ibiza model to be unveiled at May's Barcelona motor show. Seat sales fell 43 per cent last month. Short-time working is in force at its plants in Barcelona and Pamplona with the aim of reducing stocks from 113,000 units at the end of last year to 82,000. Citroen Hispania, Spanish subsidiary of the French car group, is investing Pta30bn in its plant in Vigo, north-west Spain, to produce a new model in 1996.</p>

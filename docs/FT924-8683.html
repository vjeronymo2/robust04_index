			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Burning ambition to succeed / A look at a company that has adopted advanced manufacturing methods to take on the world The world is full of frustrated or redundant senior managers looking for the opportunity which will launch them in their own business. Most would prefer a market niche where, in the early stages at least, they can build a company without treading on the toes of larger, well-established players. In late 1988 John Crathorne fitted the bill of the frustrated manager. However, Stoves, the company he now heads, does not, at first sight, match up to the specification of an ideal business. For Stoves, the revamped cooker manufacturing arm of Yale &amp; Valor, is fighting for a place in a market dominated by multinationals. The kitchen appliance market is the almost exclusive preserve of global companies such as Sweden's Electrolux, Whirlpool of the US, Bosch Siemens in Germany and the Italian Merloni group (formerly Indesit). These large companies have been developing global product ranges which currently dominate many national markets. Smaller companies with a narrower focus have either sold up or gone bust. Belling, a long-established UK manufacturer of electric cookers, recently folded though the business was subsequently acquired by Dimplex, a manufacturer of electric appliances. So how does Stoves, with projected 1992-93 sales of less than Pounds 35m and a workforce of just 570 people hope to prosper, let along survive? Crathorne, a former executive chairman of Thorn EMI's major domestic appliance division, believes the large multinationals' perceived strengths are in fact their weakness. Stoves, in contrast, concentrates on cookers, modifying their design to meet the different cooking habits of each country. It has also adopted production control techniques more commonly found only in far larger companies. 'You can have a global dishwasher, fridge or vacuum cleaner but cookers must reflect national cooking methods,' he says. 'UK housewives do more baking and want even browning. The French want a different heat balance. We may not know as much about white goods in general as Electrolux but we know more about cookers.' The original idea for an upmarket, British-made consumer durable came from Sean O'Connor, then a director of Lowe, an advertising agency, and now deputy chairman of Stoves. But it was Crathorne who narrowed the search down to cookers and who assembled a management team composed of senior managers from other large white goods manufacturers. When Yale &amp; Valor put its cookers division up for sale Crathorne won the backing of buy-out financiers Candover for a Pounds 12m management buy-in. In 1989, Crathorne's team took a 30 per cent stake in the business, which is based at Prescot on the edge of Liverpool. 'It was a shell-shocked site, desperately under-invested,' says Crathorne. 'The employees had long since stopped trusting the management.' One of the first steps of the new management was to move from a line assembly system to one based on small groups or 'cells' of workers responsible for the complete assembly. The idea was to make the job more interesting and to give the workers responsibility for quality control. Under the old system 70 per cent of cookers coming off the line had defects. This figure is now down to just over 10 per cent. At the same time Stoves moved towards a system of just-in-time delivery and supply. It developed closer links with its suppliers and reduced their number from 250 to just 50. Under the old system Stoves had 16 suppliers of steel and carried Pounds 1m worth of stock. It now has one supplier and carries Pounds 40,000 of stock. It also began a switch from what Jeff Kane, manufacturing director and the sole member of the old Yale &amp; Valor team to join the new management, calls 'hard tooling' to the use of computer numerically controlled (CNC) tools. Formerly the company would make cooker chassis using heavy presses and welding methods. Design changes took months to implement and were very costly as new dies were made. It now uses CNC equipment to bend, cut and punch the metal struts which make up the cooker frames and water pressure to shape the sheet metal which forms the cooker ovens or 'cavities'. In the year before the buy-in the company introduced four new models. In the three years since it has launched more than 200. Installing the new production equipment took longer than expected but it now gives the company far greater flexibility in developing new products. Introducing a new cooker design using old tooling could take two years and cost Pounds 100,000 but the company can now design a new cooker in just five weeks at a cost of Pounds 2,000, says Kane. Stoves protects its products and processes by registering patents at the rate of one a month but believes that part of its defences depend on its manufacturing methods. A competitor could copy a design in six months but unless it had similar manufacturing processes it would have difficulty replicating the exact design, says Ben Gostelow, engineering director and a former design director at Electrolux. This work on changing production methods has gone hand in hand with a marketing campaign involving Pounds 400,000 in market research. The company has long been a big supplier to British Gas showrooms and to the caravan sector but Stoves has been working hard at developing new markets. Stoves continues to supply its Valor range to the lower end of the market but it is pushing its more expensive Stoves range. Brand loyalty is practically non-existent in the cooker market, says Guy Weaver, marketing director, so the market place is wide open to the new entrant. Crathorne's team has taken the company from a Pounds 4m loss before the buy-in to its first projected profit of more than Pounds 1m this year, despite a 30 per cent contraction in the UK cooker market. It expects to increase pre-tax profits to around Pounds 5m on turnover of Pounds 50m in two years' time, without any increase in the size of its workforce. So far so good. But can the company maintain this rate of improvement? As long as Stoves remains a small player it will probably be left alone but further growth may prompt a sterner response from the bigger companies. While it has no immediate plans to increase the size of its workforce it may find that further growth increases the need for control of its independent 'cell' structure. And can it maintain the productivity improvements achieved once the novelty has worn off? An even more fundamental problem is that of the ownership of the company. The management is working to a five-year timetable to turn the company round after which time financial backers and the managers themselves may want to realise at least part of their investment. The danger is that Stoves would then be bought up by a larger competitor with the risk of losing the characteristics which have made it successful.</p>

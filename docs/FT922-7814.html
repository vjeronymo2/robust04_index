			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Business urged to act on Emu opt-out clause BUSINESS must take the lead in persuading the British government to sacrifice its opt-out clause on European monetary union, Mr Brian Garraway, deputy chairman of BAT Industries, said yesterday. He told a joint FT-Lovell White Durrant conference on the impact of EC law and policy that, following the Conservative election victory, the government had the opportunity to assert leadership on European monetary union. Business would benefit from monetary union through the disappearance of exchange rate variations between member states, and through the cost savings and efficiency benefits of not having to deal in separate currencies once a single currency was adopted, he said. However, achieving the prize of monetary union was not just a matter of setting up a central banking system and meeting criteria for economic convergence. The transition would involve direct and indirect costs and upheaval. 'Governments face a massive job in getting the essential support among the public and business for a reform which is vital to the well-being and development of European industry,' Mr Garraway said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Live video report by Alexadre Garcia from Brasilia] </F>   [Text] President Itamar Franco has just announced that  Sinval Guazelli is the new agriculture minister. Guazelli, a  member of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], is a  former deputy and former governor of Rio Grande do Sul under  Jose Sarney [1985-90]. He currently holds the post of director  of general credit at the Bank of Brazil.    President Franco also appointed Senator Elcio Alvares,  PFL-ES  [Liberal Front Party-Espirito Santo] as minister of industry,  commerce, and tourism. Senator Alvares was previously the  governor of Espirito Santo.    President Franco has to yet appoint the minister of mines,  energy, and metallurgy. Senator Beni Vera, PSDB-CE [Christian  Social Democracy Party-Ceara] is a likely candidate, although  this afternoon he denied having been offered the portfolio.    President Franco further announced that (Djalma Moraes) -- a  former chairman of Minas Gerais Telecommunications Company --  will continue to be acting communications minister.    Franco made it clear that the choice of the two new  ministers  is not due to the political parties to which they belong; it is  his personal choice.</p>

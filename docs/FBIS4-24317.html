			<p>BFN     [Text] The French ambassador to Uganda, Mr. (Francois  Descoyet), has held a press conference at the French Embassy in  Kampala to clarify on a number of issues concerning his  country's presence in Rwanda. Mr. (Descoyet) categorically  stated that French operations in Rwanda are strictly  humanitarian, and have nothing to do with military or political  interference in Rwanda's affairs. He told the press that  France's operations in Rwanda are a fulfillment of a United  Nations Security Council resolution, passed on 22nd June, which  warrants those operations.    Mr. (Descoyet) reiterated his country's stand on Rwanda's  affairs, that it is the rule of the United Nations and Africa to  mediate between the warring parties, not France. He  categorically refuted press reports that France has interests in  Rwanda and is taking sides, emphasizing that theirs is purely to  safeguard the innocent threatened civilians by war, which work  it is doing very well.    He also refuted allegations that his country trained the  Rwandese Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy  and Development, MRND, militia] who are accused of constant  violation of human rights in Rwanda. He said France has a  written cooperation with Rwanda like it is doing with other  African countries, but when incidents of violation of human  rights continued, this cooperation was reduced to nothing. He  refuted allegations that his country has been aiding the Rwanda  interim government.</p>

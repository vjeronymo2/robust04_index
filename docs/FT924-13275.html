			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Etam continues its recovery with Pounds 1.2m ETAM, the fashion retailer in which a South African concern has acquired a 34 per cent stake, built on last year's turnround in first-half profits to make Pounds 1.2m pre-tax. The improvement, from Pounds 35,000, followed a 7 per cent turnover increase to Pounds 105.8m (Pounds 98.5m) in the 28 weeks to August 15. The interim dividend is being raised 10 per cent to 1.65p. Etam caters for women and girls from five upwards in its eponymous stores, Snob and Tammy Girl. Less than 4 per cent of sales come from men's wear. The group traded from 238 (239) stores and reduced its floorspace by nearly 1 per cent. Mr Keith Miles, finance director, said sales had improved across the women's wear ranges. Men's wear continued to lose money, and a boys' wear range had been brought in to complement Tammy Girl. Its share of the women's wear market had improved from 1.4 per cent in 1986 to 3 per cent. Cost control had continued to be a priority. While like-for-like sales were ahead since the half-way stage, consumer confidence had 'totally disappeared in the three weeks since black Wednesday,' Mr Miles said. A cut in net interest payments to Pounds 25,000 (Pounds 412,000) was partly offset by increased charges of Pounds 461,000 (Pounds 128,000) for withdrawing from loss-making shops. After capital spending of Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 1.2m), borrowings stood at Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 8.1m) and were expected to be eliminated by the year-end. After a high tax charge (is largely mitigated over the full year), earnings per share stood at 0.52p (losses of 0.59p). COMMENT Etam, like Next, is well established on the recovery trail and this has been fully reflected in the share price, which has soared above Oceana Investment Corporation's 185p-a-share bid. The progress has been partly the product of hard graft on costs and partly of the comparative resilience of the women's wear market - so why bother with the Boyz 2 range? There is room to continue marginal improvement - last year it was little more than 6 per cent at the pre-interest level - but the task may become more difficult. Cost pressures remain and a wage increase in the second half will make the staff line look less flattering. Meanwhile sales at the 'Sharon' and 'Debbie' end of the market might well be affected by rising unemployment, even if it is among the menfolk. A full-year pre-tax profit forecast of Pounds 14.5m gives a prospective p/e of 17 to 18 on yesterday's close of 243p. This looks fully priced. It remains worth holding for genuine recovery, and Oceana's interest limits the downside.</p>

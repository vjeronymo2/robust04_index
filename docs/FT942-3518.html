			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Thai oil refiner seeks stock exchange listing Thailand's largest refiner, Thai Oil, plans to seek a listing on the stock exchange of Thailand early next year. It wants to float 25 per cent of its equity capital, write William Barnes and Reuter in Bangkok. The company, which is partly state-owned, will soon become a public limited company, after a six-year wait for government approval. Its new status will be a first step towards a stock exchange listing. If the 74m shares were sold at the expected price of Bt40, the float would raise some Bt3bn (Dollars 119m), which would be used to reduce debt and expand refinery operations. Thai Oil had net profits of Bt361m in the year ended September 30 1993. Assets at May 31 this year were Bt47.7bn, while liabilities were Bt38bn. The National Energy Policy Committee agreed in May that the state-owned Petroleum Authority of Thailand could retain its 49 per cent stake in Thai Oil if it persuaded its partners to reduce their holdings; without their co-operation, the state group would see its share diluted to 37 per cent.</p>

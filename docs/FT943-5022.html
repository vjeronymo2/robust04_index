			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Savoy's Shepard spoke only for himself Mr Giles Shepard, managing director of the Savoy hotel group, yesterday took personal responsibility for a weekend statement criticising a director for allegedly leaking confidential information. He said the statement had not been authorised by the company's board. The statement followed reports on Sunday that Mr Shepard had sent some Savoy directors a document outlining the case for the group's continued independence from the Forte group. Forte owns 68 per cent of Savoy's shares but only 42 per cent of the vote. The statement, published in the FT, said: 'The board of the Savoy group is dismayed that one non-executive director, for his own reasons, has decided to discuss confidential papers with the press.' The statement was seen as a reference to Sir Michael Richardson, who on Friday announced his retirement as chairman of Smith New Court, the securities house. Sir Michael denies leaking the report. Sir Anthony Tuke, Savoy chairman, said the board had made no such statement. He said he accepted Sir Michael's assurances that he had not leaked Mr Shepard's document. Sir Anthony added: 'The important error, and it's not the FT's fault, is that it made it appear that the board of directors had taken a view on this. They would have read this with surprise. They had no meeting.' Asked whether it was unusual for Mr Shepard, a board member, to criticise another director in this way, Sir Anthony said: 'I think it's extraordinary.' When he was asked it he had spoken to Mr Shepard about it, he said: 'We see each other every day. There's no change in that.' Mr Shepard made no comment beyond saying that Sunday's statement should be attributed to him rather than to the board. The attempt to resolve the 13-year dispute between Forte and the Savoy senior management is expected to continue at a Savoy board meeting on September 13. Sir Anthony, when asked whether the meeting would reach a conclusion on the dispute, said: 'If I have anything to do with it, it will.' Sir Anthony, who is 74, is keen to retire. The Forte and Savoy sides have, however, been unable to agree on a replacement. Mr Rocco Forte, Forte chairman, has been attempting to persuade shareholding trusts controlled by the Wontner family to back plans to merge the Savoy's hotels - which include the Savoy, the Connaught and Claridge's - with Forte's luxury establishments. Sir Hugh Wontner was president of Savoy until his death in 1992. Opponents of the merger are believed to argue that it would give Forte control of the group without making any offer to the remaining shareholders.</p>

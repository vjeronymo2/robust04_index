			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> VON BULOW CASE: HEARTS OF DARKNESS  </P> <P> "Claus von Bulow stinks!" a furious young law student explodes, near the  opening of the seductively entertaining "Reversal of Fortune" (throughout San  Diego County.) "He's obviously guilty of something pretty despicable, and if we  free him, we become partners in his crime."  </P> <P> Audiences for whom the name Von Bulow and his still-comatose wife, Sunny, have  any meaning at all may go into the film agreeing completely. Only a few other  men, Donald Trump perhaps or Idi Amin, have courted bad press with such  singular avidity. During Von Bulow's appeal -- to reverse his previous  conviction on charges of assault with intent to murder his wife by injections  of insulin -- he and his current girlfriend posed smirkingly for Helmut Newton  in biker's leathers: the aristocrat as sadomasochistic stud.  </P> <P> As his defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz clarifies succinctly for the movie's Von  Bulow, "You got one thing in your favor . . . everybody hates you."  </P> <P> All this is background to why the brilliant "Reversal of Fortune" becomes such  a complete reversal of expectation. Screenwriter Nicholas Kazan, director  Barbet Schroeder ("Barfly") and, especially, Jeremy Irons -- in a glittering  performance as the divinely decadent Dane -- have chosen to treat this social  death spiral as a tragicomedy of manners. It's an inspired tone.  </P> <P> By the film's end, Von Bulow may still be emotionally inaccessible, but the  heart of the poisonous darkness in which he and Sunny co-existed has been laid  bare. In the process Von Bulow, self-mocking but -- crucially -- self-knowing,  has gone from a character of reptilian fascination to one it's even possible to  be moved by, an emotion he would undoubtedly loathe.  </P> <P> "Reversal of Fortune" has three points of view and two playing teams, each  jaw-droppingly exotic to the other. On the one side, Von Bulow and the  unimaginable richness and peculiarity of life at Clarendon Court, his wife's  Newport "cottage."  </P> <P> Captaining the lively home team is Alan Dershowitz (Ron Silver), Harvard Law  School's scrappy, high-profile civil libertarian and defender of tricky cases  from Death Row inmates to Patricia Hearst and Harry Reems. The flamboyant  "Dersh's" reasons for taking Von Bulow's case are part of the film's complex  underpinnings.  </P> <P> As he meets Dershowitz, Von Bulow's inadvertently hilarious non sequitur about  his deep respect for the intelligence and the integrity of the Jewish people  raises the question that the case may also be the ultimate personal test for  the lawyer himself. The joke between Dersh and his son Elon about defending  Hitler is hardly in there by accident.  </P> <P> The film's third, quite objective viewpoint is presented by Sunny herself, the  icily splendid Glenn Close, narrating from her comatose state. From her  floating nether world Sunny can muse about her beautiful life with Claus before  the notoriety as evenhandedly as she can catalogue her own medical  eccentricities: her consumption of Valium, Seconal, aspirin, alcohol,  cigarettes, sweets, even the 24 laxatives she'd taken daily since she was 16.  </P> <P> If such detached observations recall the opening of "Sunset Boulevard," spoken  by its dead hero face-down in a swimming pool, it's not surprising. "Reversal  of Fortune" is the most deeply sophisticated American-made film since Billy  Wilder or Ernst Lubitsch were in the business of shaking up our screens. Its  sophistication comes from what it accepts as a given: the Von Bulows' design  for living, domestic arrangements that might have seemed decadent to the  Hapsburgs.  </P> <P> This unflappability about such things come from three sources: From the deeply  European sensibilities of director Schroeder -- who not coincidentally once  made a juicy documentary about Idi Amin; from Irons, who has more than once  drawn the soul of some very odd ducks indeed, as in "Dead Ringers," and from  the inordinately talented Kazan.  </P> <P> As a writer, Kazan seems drawn to lives somewhat off the norm: his previous  screenplays were "Patty Hearst," written originally as a comedy, and "At Close  Range," about a pair of sons and their alluring, sociopathic father.  </P> <P> Dershowitz creates a defense team, a cross-section of his most brilliant  students and colleagues, who strain against a deadline to annihilate every  point of the prosecution's case. The vague love interest between Dershowitz and  a lawyer ex-love (Annabella Sciorra) is awful, but this legal detective work  gives the film its lively motor.  </P> <P> The performances of Close and Silver are flawless, but it is Irons' portrait  that remains behind, an enigmatic after-image. Ashen-gray and whippet thin in  his all-black costumes, his hair meticulously thinned, Irons is never unaware  that there is a comic as well as a tragic view of these haute goings-on. As  befits their arrangement, Von Bulow is an endlessly accommodating consort: when  his wife chooses to sleep in near-freezing temperatures, he simply wears a knit  watchcap to bed; Irons wears his with the air of an elegant terrorist.  </P> <P> Irons' achievement is to suggest that there is steel as well as rot; that Von  Bulow's tragedy was to be kept like a turtlenecked lapdog, whether or not he  had fought to get the job. His Von Bulow, first with the street's sick jokes on  himself, is a man on intimate terms with his own very dark soul -- even though  he himself may flaunt it, it is nonetheless very, very real.  </P> <P> Under Schroeder's direction the film may be morally ambiguous, but its  performances and observations are absolutely on-target, from its most subtle  gradations of art direction or costuming to Christine Baranski's hilarious turn  as Von Bulow's "angel" girlfriend. "Reversal of Fortune" (rated R for no  discernible reason) is a delectable tour through facets of the lives of the  rich and famous that Robin Leach wouldn't touch with a forked stick.  </P></p>

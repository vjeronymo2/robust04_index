			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Futures exchanges open year with record month After a record year for futures business in 1993, some of the world's leading futures exchanges had a record month in January. Volume at the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's busiest exchange, jumped 40 per cent in January, to 16.8m futures and options contracts, after setting a world volume record of 178m contracts in 1993. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it traded 14.2m futures and options contracts in January, a 21 per cent increase over last January. However, for the first time it included turnover linked to options expirations, options exercises, deliveries, and other off-floor activities. Without the new accounting methods, CME volume was 13.3m contracts, a 13.5 per cent gain. The London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange, the world's third-largest futures exchange, traded a record 12.6m contracts in January.</p>

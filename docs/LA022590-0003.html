			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CAMPAIGN FOR GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> WILL DIANNE FEINSTEIN PLAY IN PACOIMA?;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO'S EX-MAYOR FINALLY VENTURES SOUTH -- AND INTO THE DOWN-AND-DIRTY  WORLD OF BIG-TIME POLITICS  </P> <P> DIANNE FEINSTEIN'S Tudor house in the gated cul-de-sac of Presidio Terrace is  right out of a European storybook with its rolled eaves and soaring gables, its  tiny windows in odd places. Built in 1910 and purchased by Feinstein six years  ago, it is paneled with finely grained oak, and from the formal parlors on the  ground floor to the canopied beds and cheerful reading room above-stairs, every  part of the house has her touch. Ancient Tibetan scrolls, some purchased during  her treks in the Himalayas, adorn the walls. Upstairs, the Webster of London  clock over the fireplace emits a measured, stately tick. Fresh tulips burst out  of a crystal vase on a massive mahogany desk.  </P> <P> Housekeeper Shirley Gilbertson attends Feinstein as though she were her  daughter. Cookies and pots of coffee and tea are trundled up and placed on  lacquered trays. Lying around the reading room are lavishly illustrated tomes  about the world, as well as the book Feinstein is currently reading, Antonia  Fraser's "The Warrior Queens." There are photographs of Feinstein with Queen  Elizabeth, Bishop Desmond Tutu, the Pope. And there are personal notes from  such frequent house guests as Sir Edmund Hillary, the first Anglo to climb Mt.  Everest.  </P> <P> This is Dianne Feinstein's world, one so removed from the rest of California as  not to be in the same state. But into this secure, sophisticated environment,  the uncertain and often grubby business of big-time politics now intrudes.  Feinstein, who dominated San Francisco's life as mayor from 1978 to 1988, is  running for governor of California, the first woman ever seriously to seek the  job.  </P> <P> She is learning that this cannot be done from her refuge on a hill in San  Francisco, that it means living for much of the time out of a rented condo in  vast, rude Los Angeles, a city she has visited rarely during the past decade  and has never liked. It means pressing the flesh at a thousand little  get-togethers from San Diego to Fresno, a process she does like once she gets  over the hurdle of shaking that first hand. And it means trying to convince  campaign donors that she, not Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, would be a more  formidable Democratic opponent in the fall for the presumptive Republican  nominee, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson. This last part is the hardest because Feinstein  hates asking for money and especially hates doing so in Southern California,  where Van de Kamp built a network of donors during all those years she was  sticking close to her cozy City by the Bay.  </P> <P> "I probably misjudged one thing," Feinstein says. "Southern California, among  the political insiders, is a much more closed community than I thought it was.  It is not as easy to break into as I thought it was. There is a certain liberal  chic down here connected to Hollywood that is daunting. So it's been a much  more lonely situation than I had expected."  </P> <P> For months she has badly trailed Van de Kamp and Wilson in the polls, but the  most recent California Poll shows that she has pulled even with both, largely  because of a strategic $600,000 TV buy. Although the race will continue to be  volatile, Feinstein's gain impressed political insiders, who point out that she  squandered most of the past two years when she should have been laying the  groundwork for the campaign. "We underestimated how hard this was going to be,"  admits Feinstein's husband, Richard C. Blum, a wealthy investment banker.  </P> <P> Like the men she is up against, Feinstein hasn't articulated a cohesive vision  of the state's future or been associated with any compelling political idea.  Moreover, the professionals gossip privately that she is politically inept,  that she doesn't have a clue about how to run statewide and won't buckle down  and do the tough slogging that goes with campaigning.  </P> <P> Still, there is a quality about this pragmatic, efficient, experienced  middle-of-the-road Democrat that keeps the pundits from writing her off. They  all talk with a little awe about the special attraction of this 56-year-old  woman: "You get her up there on that tube, and whoa, you've got something,"  says Washington media consultant Ray Strother. "Most politicians come on and  you hit the zapper. But Dianne talks, you watch."  </P> <P> Simply stated, the television camera, that cold arbiter of modern political  campaigns, likes Dianne Feinstein, to borrow the description used in Hollywood  to explain star power. Van de Kamp and Wilson must battle the perception that  they are two boring white guys trying to bury each other with policy papers;  Feinstein, in contrast, has an arresting television presence not unlike that of  Ronald Reagan or Gary Hart or Jesse Jackson. She uses it to the hilt and was  the first candidate to broadcast commercials, boasting of her mayoralty and her  toughness in backing the death penalty.  </P> <P> And there is something else that keeps Feinstein in the game, something more  that keeps driving her out onto the hustings when she would rather hibernate  with her books. Her years as mayor showed that she is an able administrator who  brought together competing groups, improved city services and started tackling  the city's AIDS crisis. She has a passion for public policy, one that she got  from the lively dinner-table discussions of her childhood in the elegant  mansion across the street from where she now lives.  </P> <P> Feinstein is a self-confident, slightly shy woman who is almost 6 feet tall in  high-heeled shoes -- an arresting presence in expensive, boldly colored  conservative suits. She is fairly good at small talk and has a quick, bawdy  laugh. But this is sometimes undercut by an aloof -- even regal -- bearing that  may have to do with the manners she was taught as a child. "Goody Two-Shoes,"  some have called her. There is clearly an "executive" style about her : She  once shared her rules for getting ahead with a business magazine (put in more  time than anybody else; be a team player; thank those who help you; never cry).  She clearly sees herself as more cut out to be queen than one of the courtiers.  She likes to argue, to bore in and say things like, "Now why is that? Tell me.  Help me understand it." One is convinced she is giving you undivided attention.  </P> <P> She is public spirited, she is marketable, she is interesting, a swatch of red  in the drab world of modern politics. Yet there are fundamental doubts among  her friends and foes: Can Feinstein leave San Francisco behind her and make her  pitch across the stupendously varied landscape of this state? Does she have the  steel to go out, day after day, and really chase after the job of governor? She  became mayor, after all, by a tragic fluke. But no one will inherit or have  thrust upon them the top job in California.  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN'S POLITICAL career was reborn just as it was withering away. As a  member of the city's Board of Supervisors, she had run for mayor twice, losing  badly both times. Crushed by the second defeat, Feinstein announced that she  would not run for mayor again. And by November, 1978, depressed over the death  of her second husband from cancer, she wanted out of politics altogether.  </P> <P> But within hours of informally telling reporters she was getting out,  everything was turned upside down by an assassin's bullets. Mayor George  Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, a leader in the city's large gay community,  were shot down in City Hall by a disgruntled former supervisor, Dan White. As  board president, Feinstein automatically became acting mayor. She rose to the  challenge with strength and grace.  </P> <P> "You have to understand what an awful time it was then to appreciate what  Dianne did," says Airport Commissioner Mo Bernstein, a longtime city power  broker, who is often critical of Feinstein. "The gays were up in arms because  of Harvey's killing. We'd just had the Jonestown massacre (in which 900 members  of the Rev. Jim Jones' People's Temple, most from the Bay Area, died in a mass  suicide). The city was in shock. And I don't think you'll find many people who  won't agree that Dianne did a great job of pulling us together."  </P> <P> Feinstein was a reassuring presence in the days after the assassinations. She  spoke soothingly but firmly on television. She retained most of Moscone's  staff. She reassured gays by appointing another gay man to Milk's seat. "Mrs.  Feinstein provided a voice for the city's sorrow and its aspirations. She was  poised. She was eloquent. She was restrained. And she was reassuring and  strong," the Chronicle editorialized.  </P> <P> In the next 18 months, her leadership style became familiar to San Franciscans.  She expressed her views with verve. She worked long days. Moscone had been a  casual leader, but under Feinstein, the staff was told that coming to work in  blue jeans was not acceptable. She immersed herself in the issues of the city,  although questions since have been raised about her budgetary acumen. Although  she had widespread support in the influential gay community, she avoided being  tied too closely to interest groups. She was not averse to seeking compromise.  </P> <P> As her daughter, Katherine, 32, puts it: "My mother is very tough and at the  same time very compassionate, very caring. What I admire about her most is that  she thinks things through for herself."  </P> <P> But others detected a shortage of political savvy. Some officials complained of  a tendency she had to become ensnared in minutiae. "Dianne could never  delegate," Bernstein says. "She had to have her hands on everything in City  Hall."  </P> <P> And she was well aware that she was navigating in a man's world. As she puts  it: "I think being a woman politician is a special problem. You have to know  what you are talking about because the press will always challenge what you say  in a way they do not challenge a male politician. I drive my staff crazy, I  want every fact checked, every fact sourced."  </P> <P> Feinstein says that she had no plans to run for mayor in 1979 but did so  "because, as a lame duck, I couldn't hold the city together." She needed help,  though. Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, the shrewdest politician in San  Francisco, had to take over her campaign after she failed to escape a runoff.  Their alliance went back to Feinstein's strong support for the civil-rights  movement in the 1960s and to the common ground they share as outsiders -- a  Jewish woman, a black man -- in a world dominated by white men. To help  Feinstein, Brown brought in political operatives who knew how to reach key  people in the powerful neighborhood groups, and they put hundreds of volunteers  on the street. It was classic machine politics, something Feinstein had no  grasp of, according to Brown. The result was election to the mayor's job at  long last.  </P> <P> As Feinstein began developing her own agenda and revealing more of her  executive style, it became clear that she was neither interested in nor skilled  at backroom politics -- or in the grass-roots work of electoral politics. It is  a trait that goes to the heart of her slow-starting gubernatorial campaign.  "Dianne," Bernstein says, "doesn't know any more about politics than a mouse  running across this floor."  </P> <P> Brown agrees, although he puts a positive spin on it; after all, he is  supporting Feinstein this year, as he has supported her political career since  it began. "Yeah, . . . Dianne is almost unsuited to politics," he says. "She's  too candid, too direct, too incapable of game-playing. But I think that's why  she'd make a good governor.  </P> <P> "She genuinely cares about issues; she's almost a social worker in that regard,  a Florence Nightingale. I mean, she once got out of her car and gave some bum  in the Tenderloin mouth-to-mouth resuscitation." (Actually, it was an elderly  man who had collapsed on the street.) "Ain't no way that Willie Brown or most  of these other politicians are going to do something like that," he says. "No  way."  </P> <P> Feinstein moved cautiously through her first term, finding support among her  friends on the Board of Supervisors for several significant accomplishments,  including putting more police on the street and improving garbage pickup and  public transportation. But almost without warning, a fringe group called the  White Panthers, angry because Feinstein supported strict controls on handguns,  forced a special recall election. Once again, Brown waded in to help her, and  Feinstein also hired a crafty local consultant named Clint Reilly. She turned  back the recall decisively, thus discouraging serious opposition in the regular  election of 1983.  </P> <P> In her second term (by law she could not run for a third), she overhauled the  city's waste-treatment system and lobbied for federal money to help rebuild the  fabled cable-car system after many residents had sadly concluded that the cars  would be lost forever. And in perhaps the most contentious battle, she helped  draw up the "Downtown Plan," a growth compromise that gave high-rise developers  some of what they wanted but restricted the proliferation of skyscrapers that  had changed the once-quaint city. Some of the city's most powerful people, such  as the developer and Democratic Party financial angel Walter Shorenstein (who  no longer speaks to her), wanted to build and build and build as the city made  a halting bid to become a major financial center. The developers were opposed  by the neighborhood groups that have surprising power in a city where land is  so precious that the dead are buried elsewhere because there is no room for  cemeteries.  </P> <P> Feinstein spent four years crafting the compromise, which limited the tallest  new buildings to a four-block area and set other restrictions. But to get the  plan past the supervisors, she had to allow some high-rise projects already on  the drawing boards to go through. The neighborhood groups never forgave her and  eventually got tougher restrictions through a ballot measure.  </P> <P> Feinstein also confronted the AIDS crisis, pushing city bureaucrats --  unsuccessfully at first -- to close the bathhouses where many experts thought  the disease was being spread and lobbying for more federal aid to the city's  AIDS treatment programs.  </P> <P> Some gays think Feinstein is too "goody-goody," according to James Haas, a  prominent gay political activist in the city, who said, "I honestly think she  couldn't care less what we do in bed. It's just that she wants everybody in bed  by 11 p.m." But many were furious with Feinstein on one major issue in the  mid-1980s -- when she vetoed a "domestic partners law," which would have  granted city benefits to live-in companions of city employees.  </P> <P> She is proud of her relationship with the gay community, saying: "I was the  first major candidate in the city to go to a gay event. It was when I ran for  supervisor in 1969; I think they were surprised I accepted. Later, I was the  first supervisor to hire openly gay staff people. In 1970, I sponsored the  first amendment to the city's anti-discrimination ordinance to provide that you  shall not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation."  </P> <P> Feinstein was generally well regarded when she left office in 1988 -- shortly  before she stepped down, 66% of the city's voters said she had done a good or  excellent job. But that was before her successor, Art Agnos, looked at the  books and realized that the budget she'd left behind had a deficit of $180  million.  </P> <P> The city's chief financial adviser, Sam Yockey, says Feinstein created the  deficit by using a mid-1980s surplus for day-to-day expenses. Feinstein says  the deficit was caused by factors beyond her control, among them shrinking  federal aid, a new local law increasing benefits for some city employees and a  repeal of a utility users' tax. But Van de Kamp is expected to hammer Feinstein  on the deficit.  </P> <P> "The other thing about Dianne," Yockey says, "is that she gets these pet  peeves. She'd come to budget hearings and intimidate the hell out of people.  She'd focus on the micro stuff, like how much was being spent by various  departments on training and travel. But there was no macro vision."  </P> <P> Speaker Brown, too, mentions Feinstein's tendency to drift, her lack of  discipline. "Dianne's talent is not rooted in creativity. You have to call her  attention to the issue and make a case and even offer a solution. Once she  focuses," he says, pausing. "Once she focuses, the results are probably  unmatched."  </P> <P> Feinstein, who once said her long-range goal is to become "the first female  chief executive of this country," was seriously considered for the national  Democratic ticket in 1984 and gained important national exposure. Her husband  worked quietly to position his wife to be chosen for the job by presidential  nominee Walter F. Mondale. Mondale publicly named several leading contenders he  was considering, including Feinstein, who gained added attention as the host of  the party's convention. But the spot ultimately went to New York Congresswoman  Geraldine A. Ferraro, who was being pushed by party insiders such as  then-Speaker of the House Tip O'Neil.  </P> <P> There are other explanations for Mondale's decision. "Dick (Blum) asked me in  late '83 if I thought Fritz would win the nomination, and I assured him he  would," says Mickey Kantor, a well-connected L.A. lawyer who is supporting Van  de Kamp. "Dick asked if I thought Fritz might consider picking Dianne as his  running mate, and I said he might, but what she should do is endorse him right  away and then let us put her on the campaign trail for us. She endorsed Fritz  and I set up a speaking schedule for her," Kantor continues, "but she never  left San Francisco, never did anything for us down here or anywhere else."  </P> <P> In Kantor's mind, as in others' before, Feinstein was either lazy or unwilling  to venture beyond her secure world in San Francisco.  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN WAS reared in a comfortable, well-connected family, but her childhood  also had its pain. Her Polish Jewish grandfather had immigrated to San  Francisco early in this century. Her father, Leon Goldman, became a noted  surgeon and a beloved professor at UC San Francisco Medical School. He married  Betty Rosenburg, the daughter of Russian Christians who fled St. Petersburg in  1917, and settled in Eureka before moving south. Leon and Betty, who are now  dead, had three daughters; Dianne is the eldest.  </P> <P> When Dianne was a young girl, her father's brother Morrie came to live with the  family, and it was from Leon's and Morrie's nightly arguments that Feinstein  first got her taste for politics. Leon Goldman was a Republican, a believer in  self-reliance, suspicious of unions. Uncle Morrie was more of an urban  populist, a clothing manufacturer with little education but plenty of smarts.  He walked all over the city -- often with Dianne at his side -- delighting in  the swank hotels off Union Square no more than the scruffier establishments of  the Tenderloin.  </P> <P> There is a bit of both men in Dianne Feinstein. She flies first class, likes  such Republican concepts as "management by objective" and has no apologies for  her wealth. Asked if it hinders her ability to connect with voters, she says :  "I would like for everybody to have what I have. I know that's impossible, but  there is one thing government can provide and that is opportunity."  </P> <P> On the other hand, she also likes to drink beer and watch pro football. And she  has taken under her wing a black youth, Anthony Bell, who grew up far from her  life of privilege. Anthony, whom she met when she began going to the city's  poor Hunter's Point section, often visits her and calls seeking advice about  schoolwork and jobs. His picture is on the mantel of her rented condo in  Century City.  </P> <P> As a girl, Feinstein was horse crazy, getting up before dawn every day to go to  the stables down in the San Francisco flats. It was one way to get her mind off  a difficult relationship with her mother, who had a brain disorder that was not  discovered until the CAT scanner was invented. According to Feinstein, Betty  Goldman's mood swings were terrifying. "My mother was difficult," she says.  "There were things I don't want to go into -- alcoholism, suicide attempts. We  didn't know that a part of her brain that governs reason just wasn't  operating." Once, after a row, Betty locked her daughter out of the house for  the night even though Dianne had to take her college boards the next day.  Dianne spent the night in the family car.  </P> <P> Feinstein says that although her mother's illness made things rough at times,  she does not think she had an unhappy childhood. Her father and her uncle doted  on the young tomboy. "It was not always easy with my mother, but she was still  a good mother. She took good care of me and my sisters. I think I can say I was  happy growing up."  </P> <P> She was educated in public schools until she was ready for high school, when  her mother insisted that she attend Convent of the Sacred Heart, a favorite of  wealthy San Franciscans. Since even wealthy Jews in those days were rarely  admitted to the top social circles in the city, Betty Goldman's choice was an  attempt to help her daughter crack those circles. To please her father,  Feinstein also went to Jewish religious school.  </P> <P> "I was the first Jew at Sacred Heart," she says. "And it turned out to be a  pretty good recipe. In Judaism, you believe in a code of morality and ethics to  live as the one God would have you live. In Catholicism, it is more a  day-to-day code, and I eventually found a lot of solace in the Catholic  Church." (She does not attend services of either faith regularly but says she  draws strength from both; when her second husband died, she went to church to  light a candle.)  </P> <P> Feinstein says the nuns at Sacred Heart spotted a lack of discipline in her  that they tried to cure, without much success. In college at Stanford, she  played golf and partied too much. "I was not a distinguished student. I took a  course called Western Civilization and I really applied myself in the first  quarter and got an A-plus. So they put me in independent study, a big fat  mistake," she recalls. "I went and played, didn't study at all." She planned to  study medicine but got a D in genetics and switched to history and political  science. "I got an A-plus in American Political Thought and realized this was  my aptitude."  </P> <P> The good-looking young woman earned some extra money modeling, showing off furs  on a local TV show her uncle started. She was elected student body vice  president at college and thought about how to buck the unbroken tradition of  male presidents. She claims that she conducted her own informal poll and found  out that the men "would rather elect a duck or a pig than a woman."  </P> <P> After graduating, she returned to San Francisco to take a Coro Fellowship,  which allowed her to spend a year studying the district attorney's office.  There she met Jack Berman, a prosecutor 11 years her senior. Within months,  they eloped -- to Los Angeles, because no rabbi in San Francisco would dare  marry Leon Goldman's daughter in secret to an older man. The couple had a  daughter, Katherine, who today is an attorney on leave to work in her mother's  campaign. She is Feinstein's only child.  </P> <P> The marriage to Jack Berman, now a Superior Court judge, foundered when  Katherine was a baby. "He was brilliant, worldly," Feinstein says. "But he  wanted to keep me barefoot and pregnant. I could not be that kind of wife."  They divorced in 1959.  </P> <P> On her own with a small child, Feinstein got an appointment in the early 1960s  to a state board that handles prison terms and parole requests for women. One  night at a party in San Francisco, a nice man stooped to shake little  Katherine's hand. He was Bertram Feinstein, a top neurosurgeon and a man 20  years older than Dianne. They began dating and soon were married -- this time  with her father's blessing. Bert Feinstein put Dianne back into the kind of  secure world in which she had grown up.  </P> <P> "Bert was like a father figure to Dianne," says Henry Berman, a family friend  who is now Feinstein's campaign treasurer. "He was a doctor, and doctors are  busy seven days a week. That was great because Dianne was never cut out to be a  housewife." She didn't have to wait to cook dinner at an appointed hour. "She  can't even boil water. So she created a life for herself in politics."  </P> <P> In 1969 she announced for the Board of Supervisors. A number of powerful men,  including former Mayor Elmer Robinson, tried to discourage her because there  was a woman on the board and they thought that one was enough. Feinstein not  only ran but, relying heavily on television ads, received the most votes. As  the top vote-getter, she automatically became president of the board, the first  woman in that job. Duane Garrett, a San Francisco lawyer who is Feinstein's  campaign chairman, recalls that as a supervisor, "she was a League of Women  Voters politician," concerned about good government issues and obscure  neighborhood disputes. But Feinstein was more ambitious than Garrett and others  had expected. In 1971, she challenged one of the city's most powerful men,  Mayor Joseph Alioto. He trounced her.  </P> <P> Feinstein met Dick Blum while heading a board of economic advisers for the  city. They began dating in 1978, after his divorce and after Bert Feinstein's  death. Blum and Feinstein were married in a City Hall service in January, 1980.  Blum, 54, is a tall, aggressive man who led the first American climbing party  to approach Mt. Everest from the Chinese side. His father once sold underwear  in San Francisco, but today Dick Blum sells an investment banking service that  has made him and some of his clients very rich.  </P> <P> He won't say how rich, but last year Richard C. Blum &amp; Associates  participated in the leveraged buyout of Northwest Airlines by putting in $100  million, or 11% of the deal. The firm's other clients include Firemen's Fund  Insurance and BankAmerica. The company's annual return has averaged 37% in the  past five years, of which he gets a fee of 1 1/2% of the money managed plus 15%  of the profits. The couple is worth many millions -- how many millions may  become clearer when she releases their tax returns in the coming months.  </P> <P> Blum has been Feinstein's closest adviser in her campaign for governor. It was  he who persuaded her to hire Clint Reilly as campaign consultant even though  she detested Reilly. And it was Blum who told her it was "good riddance" after  Reilly quit in a noisy huff a year later.  </P> <P> CLINT REILLY, a political battler who sounds like Jack Nicholson, is one of the  few consultants in America who ever fired a candidate; usually it's the other  way around. Last August, after months of bickering, Reilly left, charging that  Feinstein lacked "the fire in the belly" to make the run for governor. Over  dinner at Postrio, Reilly is still seething months later. He brings stacks of  documents to show "that Dianne's candidacy is a hoax." Whenever Reilly says  "Dianne," the whole restaurant seems to lean his way as in the famous E. F.  Hutton commercial.  </P> <P> Reilly offers a memo from Feinstein telling him he could not spend money on  telephone calls while she was hospitalized for a hysterectomy last summer.  "Dianne wanted me to do everything for free while she spent most of her time in  her big house on the hill. She would never do the work you've got to do to  raise money for a race like this. She's lazy."  </P> <P> Sometimes Feinstein also takes odd positions for a Democrat with statewide  ambitions. For example, she sided with insurance companies during the 1988  battle-royal over auto insurance reform in California. She backed the  industry's proposition because it called for tort reform and spurned the  grass-roots Proposition 103, which won, because it was supposed to lower rates  in Los Angeles while raising them elsewhere. Van de Kamp's campaign likes to  point out that some of her husband's top clients are insurance companies.  </P> <P> More recently, Feinstein told the San Mateo Chamber of Commerce that what  California needs is an Office of Economic Development. But California already  has one. It is called the Commission for Economic Development.  </P> <P> William Carrick, Reilly's replacement, shrugs at the mistakes and Reilly's  charges. "Ah, 35 people in the state of California care about the inside  baseball of politics," says Carrick, a folksy South Carolinian who has been  asked to turn the campaign around. "When the voters begin to pay attention to  this thing, Dianne is going to be ready. She wants to learn, she got some bad  advice in the past, she got kicked around (by Reilly) and she was told she  didn't know what she was doing.  </P> <P> "Listen, she is a natural leader; she is one of the best natural political  talents I have ever been associated with," says Carrick, who ran the  presidential campaign of Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) in 1988. Carrick and  partner Hank Morris spent $450,000 in Los Angeles alone airing Feinstein's  first TV ad.  </P> <P> The ad apparently had an impact: In the latest California Poll, taken earlier  this month, Feinstein moved slightly ahead of Van de Kamp, by four points,  after having trailed him last October by 18 points.  </P> <P> Still, Feinstein acknowledges that she misjudged the difficulty of raising  money and getting becoming known in Southern California, but says it has  nothing to do with laziness. "There is a big advantage, for one thing, in  running for governor from another office, as John and Pete are doing. It's  having a platform, which is naturally covered by the press. The argument that I  should have gotten down here and gotten going sooner is correct, but I couldn't  do it, largely for health reasons," she says, referring to the operation she  had last in August. (One of her top advisers privately disputes this  explanation, saying she Feinstein did little politically even before then  because she assumed that Republican Gov. George Deukmejian would run for a  third term.) "I also think I have to maintain a Northern California base; the  majority of my funds come from the north, and you can't just leave it  entirely."  </P> <P> Her opponents foresee problems -- and opportunities -- in trying to knock her  out of the race. Having to run against a woman candidate presents special  problems, says Wilson campaign manager George Gorton. "The voters expect the  male candidate to be a gentleman and the female to be a lady. But you have to  point out the flaws in your opponent and we will do it. I think if we faced  Feinstein, we'd go after the budget deficit she left the city of San  Francisco."  </P> <P> "For someone running in a Democratic primary, Feinstein is just wrong on too  many issues," Van de Kamp campaign manager Richie Ross argues. "She vetoed  comparable worth when she was mayor, she supported the insurance industry in  the prop battle in '88, she took a walk (by not actively campaigning for the  anti-toxics) Proposition 65 four years ago. If I can keep the campaign on  substance, we'll be fine. I don't want it to be all glitz and star-quality  stuff because that is the way she has always tried to run."  </P> <P> Feinstein's people are concentrating on raising the funds they will need to  take advantage of her mediagenic personality and in getting across her message,  such as it is, that she is a tough leader in tune with the average voter and  not beholden to special interests.  </P> <P> She formally announced her candidacy this month, promising an activist,  accessible administration she said would contrast with the past seven years  under Deukmejian. Her priorities would include a comprehensive mental health  plan that would remove some of the homeless from the streets; guaranteed health  insurance for all working Californians and early education for all 4-year-olds.  Feinstein suggests that bonds might be one way to finance such programs without  raising taxes.  </P> <P> In a tranquil setting over lunch in Beverly Hills, she explains, as all  candidates must at some point, why she is seeking this job. "I'm a native  Californian, I've lived here all my life and I see what is happening. The state  is drifting. Growth is increasing, crime is increasing, the livability of the  state for most people is decreasing," she says. "I also believe that I think  like most Californians, that I want what most Californians want.  </P> <P> "My vision for the state is very simple: It should be a state where your kids  can get a good public education; you should be able to walk to your home or  your car or your business and use your parks without living in fear. It should  be a state where you can breathe clean air and drink pure water. It should be a  state of opportunity."  </P> <P> She gives an example of how she would approach being governor : Mindful of the  Medfly furor building in vote-rich Los Angeles County, she cites Deukmejian's  relative quiet on the the current infestation. "What the governor ought to do  is have a fireside chat with the California public in prime time and explain  the realities. We cannot ignore the Medfly or our agriculture will be badly  hurt. Obviously people are upset about the spraying, especially in parts of Los  Angeles, and they should not be ignored. But it takes a special touch with  people; you have to let them know you do care about what is upsetting them."  </P> <P> Feinstein is strong in Northern California, but Carrick knows that the  challenge is to duplicate that strength in Southern California, where a  majority of the state's voters live and where Van de Kamp, a lifelong resident  of Los Angeles County, has a huge advantage.  </P> <P> That's why the campaign spent nearly half a million dollars airing its first TV  commercial in the Los Angeles media market. With crime being a major issue  among voters in this market, Feinstein took a swipe at Van de Kamp by pointing  out that she is for capital punishment while he is not. But if Feinstein is to  win the Democratic nomination, political experts believe she'll have to spend  at least another $2 million airing ads in Southern California. Blum has loaned  the Feinstein campaign $1.3 million, and another $1 million has been raised  from other sources. "Dianne's biggest fund-raising event was breakfast with her  husband," Ross says sarcastically.  </P> <P> Feinstein also has begun a direct-mail campaign that is pulling in more money  than she had expected. One such mailing features the photos of Feinstein,  Ronald Reagan and Clint Eastwood on the envelope. It is supposed to stress  Feinstein's toughness. "It would make my day," Feinstein says in the letter,  "to say a resounding 'NO' to those who would dictate to the rest of us on  issues like birth control and abortion. . . . It's about time we drew the line  on offshore oil drilling and toxic waste . . . and also about time in this  state to get back to the good old-fashioned American ideal that government  works for us."  </P> <P> Nowhere does she mention that she is a Democrat, an acknowledgment that she has  always done almost as well with independents and Republicans as she has with  Democrats. "Dianne is trying to go beyond the traditional constituency-based  Democratic campaign," Carrick says. The problem: Independents and Republicans  can't vote in the Democratic primary. But Feinstein can rightly claim that if  the Democrats want to scare Wilson in November, she may be their best chance.  Wilson aide Gorton frankly fears her: "Feinstein is more meteoric, more  mediagenic, more able to break out of any box you try to put her in than Van de  Kamp."  </P> <P> Los Angeles political consultant Michael Berman, who is neutral in the race,  says, "Dianne has the perfect profile for a Democrat. She is a conservative who  looks like a liberal." He explains that because she is a woman from San  Francisco, Feinstein has a liberal image that should help her in the primary.  But once in the general election she could move right by stressing her support  for the death penalty, a reduction in crime in San Francisco while she was  mayor and her studied lack of interest in the Democratic Party's liberal  interest groups.  </P> <P> Few people know California's demographics like Berman, who drew up California's  election districts after the 1980 census. In his mind, a major "swing area" in  the governor's race will be the rapidly growing San Joaquin Valley. It is a  more conservative area than San Francisco and Los Angeles, and Republican  candidates usually thrive there in statewide races. Berman says Feinstein's  conservative side could be marketed in the Valley well enough to undercut  Wilson. "No Democrat," Berman says, "can win statewide without getting within  10 points of the Republican (candidate) in the Valley. I think Dianne could do  it."  </P> <P> In the meantime, as time grows shorter, she is honing her message. "The  politics of the past is the interest groups: Are you pro business, are you pro  labor, whatever? The politics of the future, which I represent, is the politics  of the individual and of the family," she says.  </P> <P> And her spirits appear to be good as she gets ready for more of the handshaking  and money soliciting and repeated interrogations that are required of anyone  who wants to govern California. One day recently, as she was waiting to tape a  cable television show in Los Angeles, she chatted with a woman reporter,  lightly poking at the men in the room. "Do I look OK?" she asks the reporter.  "You know, men will never tell you your blouse is unbuttoned. But it's funny  about men, they always tell each other when their fly is unzipped."  </P> <P> The doubts that she would even stay in the race have now disappeared. At last,  she has assembled a top-flight campaign team. Perhaps most important, this  former empress of San Francisco has finally found her way to Southern  California. And now this woman whose whole life has been lived in and shaped by  that glittering city will begin testing her strength and her wits on a far  bigger turf. Oddly enough, she is confident about that, too. She believes  voters will come to see that she's not a conventional Bay Area liberal. She  says, with some justification: "My thinking is more in sync with mainstream  California than it is with mainstream San Francisco."  </P></p>

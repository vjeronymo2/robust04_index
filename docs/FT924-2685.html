			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Scotland (1): Determined difference - Scotland's increase in prosperity was achieved without the boom-and-bust of the south of England, but recession has now caught up with the economy. As the European summit opens in Edinburgh, James Buxton reports IF THE heads of government and their acolytes, sitting down at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh this morning for the European summit, feel that their environment is unfamiliar, that is as it should be. They are in the United Kingdom but they are not in England; for the first time ever, an international summit of this kind is being held in Scotland. Scotland, as the Queen remarked in last summer's television programme about her, is different. Its people have different accents, habits and attitudes; and they have some of their own specifically Scottish institutions. It has its own legal system and judiciary. Its education system is different from that of England and Wales, and Scotland also has its own, presbyterian, church. Much of the business of government in Scotland is handled by the Scottish Office in Edinburgh, which in the past 10 years has taken on more responsibility from Whitehall. Visitors from the continent will find it one of the more pro-EC parts of the UK. Compared with people in the south east of England, more Scots either believe the Maastricht treaty is a good thing in itself or accept that it needs to go ahead to ensure that the benefits of the single market do not evaporate. The idea of European nationality does not worry a people who already have a kind of dual nationality, being both Scottish and British. When Mr John Major, the prime minister, told a surprised Scottish Conservative party conference in 1991 that this European Council would be held in Edinburgh, he said he wanted to counter the sense of alienation which he believed outlying parts of Britain felt towards government from Westminster. He also wanted to demonstrate the meaning of the union of the United Kingdom, under which England and Scotland submerged their sovereignties in 1707 and merged their parliaments while retaining their separate identities. (That is one reason why Scotland does not, as one might have expected of a European region, have its own parliament or assembly). Through the Edinburgh summit, Mr Major hoped, Scotland would participate in the enactment of British foreign policy. In 1991 the sense of alienation to which Mr Major referred was particularly strong. Most Scots were fed up with rule by the Conservative party - less than a quarter of them had voted for it in the 1987 general election. Their economy had done less well than England's, and they had been alienated by the policies and personality of Mr Major's predecessor, now Lady Thatcher. Opinion polls showed that 80 per cent of Scots wanted constitutional change: some 45 per cent said they wanted a separate Scottish parliament; and 35 per cent wanted complete independence. Last January the proportion of those saying they preferred independence surged briefly to 50 per cent. In Scotland the 1992 general election was partly a battle over those different prescriptions for Scotland's future, with Labour and the Liberal Democrats offering a Scottish parliament, the Scottish National party touting independence and the Conservatives upholding the status quo. Yet it was Mr Major and the Tories, rather than Labour and the Liberals, who made the Scottish parliament an election issue - by warning of its dangers and urging voters across Britain to reject it. Labour, by contrast, kept quiet about the details of its constitutional plans, apparently for fear of worrying English and even some Scottish voters. The election ended in defeat for the backers of constitutional change. Not only did Labour lose the election nationally but both Labour and the Liberal Democrats, proponents of a devolved Scottish parliament, saw their shares of the Scottish vote fall. The SNP increased its vote by seven points but that did not give it the breakthrough it expected: it lost two seats. Only the Scottish Tories, who almost everyone - including many of their own number - had expected to be almost wiped out, were able to claim any sort of victory; they stood alone in both increasing their vote (marginally) and winning seats (two). The general election outcome did not show that demand for constitutional change in Scotland was dead - though some Tories have since ventured the thought that Scotland might be entering a 'post-devolution era.' Rather it demonstrated, like other devolution campaigns for over a century, that not enough Scots want constitutional change badly enough to give it such a high priority that they will sink their differences to get it. It was a reminder that there is residual support in Scotland for unionism. Since the election, Labour and the Liberal Democrats have played down talk of constitutional change. But a little group of protestors who, immediately after the election, started a vigil outside the building where a Scottish parliament would meet are still there. They say they will remain until a Scottish parliament is convened. The constitutional issue will be raised outside the Holyrood summit, with Labour and the SNP fielding speakers to the Scotland Demands Democracy demonstration on Saturday. Mr Major will be asked to explain why, if the concept of subsidiarity should be applied to the UK, it cannot be applied to a nation within it. Since April Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish Secretary, has been showing a more conciliatory approach to running Scotland. Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, his minister of state, said in July that if the union is not to lose support the government must choose policies which are not only good for Scotland but acceptable to most Scots. Thus, whereas in England and Wales the government is legislating to encourage many more schools to leave local authority control, nothing similar is proposed for Scotland. But the government's attempt to be gentler with the Scots will be tested by its handling of two big planned reforms - reshaping local government from a two-tier into a single tier system, and bringing the private sector into the water and sewerage industry. The very suggestion of privatising Scottish water has provoked strong opposition from almost everyone, including many Tories, so the government is touting (among other options) a complex franchising arrangement. The reform of local government, removing the regional councils, will enable Scotland's four cities, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, to become single tier authorities. But their powers will fall well short of those of the so-called city-states on the continent, because in the past few years local government has lost functions and had its financial autonomy curtailed. The current mood in Scotland is dour, as the economy stagnates in a recession which, though less severe than that south of the border, still has plenty of victims. But though Scots are accomplished practitioners of 'girning' (grumbling), plenty of things in their country have improved enormously in the past decade. Scotland achieved a big increase in prosperity in the latter part of the 1980s, without the boom and the bust of the south of England. It shows in the great improvement to life in Glasgow, which used to be a city few people in Britain visited unless they had to. The quality of life in Scotland's uncrowded other cities and towns and in its countryside is an asset which will become more precious as the British economy begins to grow again. Yet, unlike in other parts of Britain, the Scottish population is in gentle decline; it dropped fractionally below the psychologically important 5m mark in the 1991 census. Somehow the decline seems to mirror the lack of dynamism in the Scottish economy. A recent study by Scottish Enterprise, the economic development body, revealed that Scotland has a lower rate of new company formation than other parts of Britain, especially the south-east, not to mention Germany and parts of the US. Alarmingly, some leading Scots, when interviewed, said they did not believe the creation of new companies was particularly important - some even thought that it was undesirable because it harmed existing ones by causing extra competition. Many of the more enterprising Scots have moved - as they have been doing for centuries - to England, where a number of them run big companies and institutions. Scots also occupy five places in the cabinet - and Scotland also provides the leader of the opposition, Mr John Smith, and several of his shadow cabinet. That could be seen as a success both for the union and for Scots' determination. But it also shows that in centralised Britain the big opportunities lie in London. Any step to redressing that imbalance would be good.</p>

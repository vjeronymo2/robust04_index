			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Gangsters bag top gun in Thailand's 'bird nest war' A sharp increase in the price of edible bird's nests prompted a leading exporter of the 'caviar of the east' to employ a crackshot hired gun who reportedly killed 14 bird's nest thieves over the past three years. The gunslinger was himself shot dead as he was leaving a restaurant a week ago, according to police in Phattalung, southern Thailand. Mr Tid Musigachinda had been hired by the Laemthong Birds Nest Company to guard a cave on Koh Si Koh Ha Island where swiftlets build some of the world's most valuable edible nests. Conservationists blame the region's economic boom for driving nest hunters to extremes to satisfy mainly Chinese eaters of what was once an exotic delicacy for the few. Traffic International, run by the World Wide Fund for Nature and the World Conservation Union, reported earlier this year that Hong Kong is easily the biggest importer of bird's nests, buying 17m swiftlet nests in 1992, the most recent year for which statistics are available. In the five years to 1992, the wholesale price of swiftlet nests nearly trebled to HKDollars 3,586 (Pounds 296) per kilogram; it is said that 1kg of the finest nests can fetch up to HKDollars 30,000. Mr Tid was due to stand trial for shooting 14 suspect nest robbers, but district officials in Phattalung claimed his death makes it much harder to tackle the bird's nest gangs in Southern Thailand. 'He was the only witness. He was the only one who really knew what was going on,' said Mr Somphon Nunoon, a provincial councillor. There were rumours that Bt50,000 (Pounds 1,280) had been offered to anyone who killed the 40-year-old security guard. Even legal pickers find it difficult to harvest the nests which are built mainly in limestone caves in Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia. The small cup-shaped nests harden like cement after the birds make them from salivary secretions, but they are eaten in soup or with bamboo pith as a rare delicacy and a health tonic. Traffic International blamed a steep decline in the swiftlet population on the almost continuous harvesting of nests in many areas, which destroys eggs and chicks. According to the fund's Mr David Melville, the birds were caught in a vicious circle: 'Higher prices will lead to yet more intense harvesting and reduced breeding productivity, leading to higher prices.' Swiftlet nests would be a sustainable resource only if harvesting took place before eggs were laid, followed by a closed season of 130 days to allow the birds to rebuild nests and rear their young. But Mr Kluem Poolsung, deputy president of Phattalung provincial council, said: 'Too many people want to make too much money out of too few nests. Tid's murder will not be the last killing.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Petrovac, 23 Jun (TANJUG) -- Radio Velkaton of  Velika Kladusa denied this morning's REUTER report that members  of the Muslim army's Fifth Corps, loyal to Alija Izetbegovic,  "deeply penetrated" the territory controlled by Fikret Abdic and  that Abdic's "days are numbered."    The radio said forces of the National Defense of the  Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia [APZB] are firmly in  control of all separation lines in the Cazin Krajina.    This afternoon members of the Fifth Corps continued their  ferocious attacks on civilian targets and positions held by APZB  forces, Radio Velkaton said.    According to the same source, heavy fighting is under way in  the area of Pecigrad and the strategically important point  Pivka. One member of the APZB army was killed in the fighting,  while another three were wounded.    Radio Velkaton claims that Izetbegovic's artillery units  pounded the areas of Porcici, Veljkovici, and Liskovac,  inflicting considerable material damage.</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> INVENTORIES CLIMB AS SALES PLUNGE  </P> <P> Business inventories rose 0.5% in February while sales plunged 0.9% in their  steepest decline in more than two years, the government said today.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and backlots climbed  to a seasonally adjusted $763.6 billion in February following a 0.8% increase  in January.  </P> <P> Business sales, meanwhile, dropped to a seasonally adjusted $507.3 billion in  February after rising 1.1% during the previous month. February's decline was  the first dip since sales fell 0.2% in November, 1987, the month after the  stock market crash, and marked the steepest drop since a 3% decline in January,  1987.  </P> <P> If increases in inventories are not accompanied by rising sales, analysts worry  that the result could be production cutbacks that hold down economic growth.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELP STUDENTS PAY FOR TRIP  </P> <P> Talolo and Joann Lepale, 16-year-old twins, students attending Bassett High  School in La Puente, were selected as two of the 2,000 nationwide delegates to  the Student Ambassador program (Times, March 4).  </P> <P> Their 30-day tour of East Berlin, Poland, Holland, Russia, England is just  another step towards peace and understanding in this ever shrinking world.  </P> <P> These twins are fine examples of future potential community leaders. They are  required to raise $8,000 between them, for air fare and housing, all within the  next month or so!  </P> <P> The citizens of our San Gabriel Valley are encouraged to support such positive  and constructive youth programs. All financial contributions to the twins are  an investment in the future of this nation.  </P> <P> Please mail donations to: Robert F. Nero (principal), Bassett High School, 755  N. Ardilla Ave., La Puente, Calif. 91746.  </P> <P> The American Legion has long been a supporter of such worthwhile youth  projects. The administrators at Bassett are to be commended for producing such  fine representatives!  </P> <P> TOM GOLDEN  </P> <P> Assistant Adjutant  </P> <P> American Legion Post 397  </P> <P> Monterey Park  </P></p>

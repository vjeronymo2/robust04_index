			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Dilemma of divided loyalties - Tim Burt on the key to the outcome of GKN's bid for Westland Two institutional investors holding the key to the outcome of GKN's Pounds 497m hostile bid for Westland are about to be barraged by lobbying from the two sides. M&amp;G and Schroders are not relishing the prospect. As the largest institutional shareholders in both companies, they are in the uncomfortable situation of being asked to play King Solomon with Westland's future. Their dilemma will be underlined by forceful lobbying by Mr Alan Jones, Westland chairman, who claims his company's best interests lie in independence; and by Sir David Lees, his GKN counterpart, who is seeking an enlarged defence business. With 12 per cent of Westland and 5.5 per cent of GKN, M&amp;G admits it could make a case for supporting either side. The sentiment is similar at Schroders, which has 13.5 per cent of the helicopter company and 4.4 per cent of the engineering group. But to the chagrin of Sir David, they have so far leant towards the Yeovil-based helicopter maker. Their task has been made easier by GKN's 290p a share offer, launched seven weeks ago at a 5 per cent discount to the market price. The move prompted a sharp rise in Westland's shares to 333p, but they fell back after GKN vigorously attacked Westland's prospects. They closed yesterday at 326p. Before even entering into any arguments about prospective helicopter orders or synergies with GKN's armoured vehicles business, the institutions simply point to the price and say it is inadequate. Mr Richard Hughes, director of investment management at M&amp;G, says: 'The shares are trading well above 290p. We will make our decision on the offer as Westland shareholders, irrespective of our commitment to GKN.' Such comments - echoed at Schroders - raise the hackles of GKN executives, who complain that the institutions must start looking at the takeover as their shareholders too. For them, Westland would not only immediately quadruple the turnover of its defence business to more than Pounds 500m a year, but would transform the tax profile of the whole group. The helicopter group's UK profits would enable GKN to recoup a large chunk of Advance Corporation Tax, which it has been forced to write off in the past because of its high proportion of overseas earnings. By increasing UK sales to 40 per cent of turnover, Westland would bring GKN's total tax rate closer to the 33 per cent average from 38.7 per cent last year, when it wrote off Pounds 7.9m of unrecoverable ACT. While admitting Westland would 'impact favourably' on GKN's overall tax rate, the Midlands-based group argues that such a marriage would also be blessed by logistical and marketing advantages, especially in lucrative export markets. It has also held out the prospect of financial support to bolster Westland's balance sheet, which it suggests may not be strong enough to sustain strong demand for civil variants of the EH101 helicopter - should that materialise. Defence industry analysts are not convinced. They see GKN's motives as purely fiscal. 'If Westland is so attractive, then GKN will have to dig deeper into its pockets and find a little more,' said one analyst. Several analysts also suggest that the offer price reflects GKN's expertise in extracting a good deal from United Technologies, which agreed to sell its 18.7 per cent Westland holding for Pounds 75m at 290p a share. However, with 45 per cent of Westland under its belt, GKN appears wedded to 290p. Sir David claims the price already includes a premium to Westland's underlying value and is a fair price in the face of uncertain future prospects. Helicopter orders may be picking up, he says, but they are not as rosy as Westland claims. Describing Westland's sales estimates as over-optimistic, Sir David warns: 'Westland does not and cannot project when profits will support the current share price.' He points out that Westland's prospects would have to grow remarkably from the one delivery scheduled this year to meet in 2000 its estimated 39 deliveries of which 12 are already on order and 27 as yet prospects. Mr Jones claims the market has already given GKN the thumbs down. He denies suggestions that Westland's shares have been boosted by bid speculation and its success last year in extracting a Pounds 385m damages award, still under appeal, from the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation. 'The offers were made below the market price and include no premium for our potential, for control or for the tax advantages to GKN,' he says. Having sparred for several weeks, the two chairmen are now putting the final touches to their institutional presentations. Westland is likely to promise M&amp;G and Schroders sizeable earnings growth if they stick with the company as its production expands. GKN will argue that Westland would fare even better as part of a larger group, and that the institutions would benefit from its upside potential anyway as shareholders in GKN. Keen to win City support for its argument, the engineering group has also pointed to a report published last week by UBS, the securities house. Taking a forecast of orders 28 per cent higher than Westland's own, it produced a best case scenario for the year 2002 that gave Westland's shares a present value of 306p on a cashflow basis and 275p on an earnings basis. The same report, however, argues: 'Westland's strong product range, cost base, and order book is producing rapidly accelerating earnings and dividend growth. The tax benefits available to GKN make Westland worth up to 400p per share, rather than the 290p it has offered.' Faced with increasingly hostile arguments, the institutions are sitting tight and waiting for the combatants to fire the next salvo. That is expected next Monday, the deadline for Westland to release new information relevant to the bid. It is expected to make a buoyant trading forecast, pointing to profits of at least Pounds 36m (Pounds 30.5m) this year despite continuing uncertainties in the defence and aerospace market. Despite Sir David's protestations that GKN has made a fair offer, the institutions sense that the tax incentive will be enough to persuade him to up his bid - albeit marginally. 'Buying a growing company at a depressed point in the market, which also comes with tax advantages, is a very attractive option,' says one institutional investor. Warning GKN that there is little prospect of it accepting the current bid, another institution warns: 'GKN and Westland are going to have to live together whether the bid stands or falls. Sir David knows the game, and he knows we won't accept this offer.' See Lex</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Foreign Affairs: Dear Mr President . . . An open letter from a citizen of the world to the winner of yesterday's US election Sir, You presumably know who you are, and by the time you receive this letter the world will at least know your name. But as I write, millions of Americans are still putting their cross against that name - although millions of others are not. On past form, those who stay away from the polling booths altogether will outnumber your supporters. I have a suggestion for next time. Let the votes of those Americans who do not care enough to use them be given to foreigners, like me, who would dearly love to. All over the world there are people who believe their lives will be affected by decisions that you take in the course of the next four years. No doubt many of those people exaggerate US influence, but they are not wholly wrong. True, the US no longer dominates the world economy in the overwhelming way it did for a decade or so after 1945. But it is the uncontested world champion in military power, more than ever now that the Soviet Union has scratched from the competition. Whether the US has really begun a long-term process of overall decline is debatable. The answer may depend partly on you. But for the present in any case, and for the foreseeable future, the US enjoys a combination of economic and military strength which no other country even begins to rival. Moreover it is still the main inspiration of popular culture throughout the world, and the country where most non-Americans would like to live if they left their own. All that has given you, the American ruling elite, an instinctive self-confidence about projecting your power overseas, politically as well as militarily; and it has given us, the rest of the world, an instinctive deference towards your leadership even when we resent your power or disagree profoundly with your judgment. We may argue bitterly against your policies, but we still tend to find ourselves arguing for a different American policy. The idea that we could just ignore you and do our own thing hardly even occurs to us. What do I, as a citizen of the world, hope for from you as leader of the only superpower? First of all, I hope that America, if it is declining, is not going to decline too fast; and that obsession with that possibility will not make it turn its back on the rest of us or - even worse - blame us and lash out against us when it finds its own problems too intractable. The danger of that is clearly greatest in the field of economics and world trade. We all know the reflex: if you are losing market share, it must be because your competitors are playing dirty. So instead of trying to improve your own performance, you concentrate on devising rules to hobble the competition. Recent US governments have been quite good, by international standards, at resisting that reflex. But the pressures are strong. To a European, Americans often seem obsessed with the 'Japanese threat'. Obviously there are great dangers for the world if the US gets into a trade war with Japan, but also if it tries to solve the problem by bilateral deals, regulating both markets at the expense of third parties. I hope you will tackle that notorious budget deficit, as you have promised to do. That means you will have to have the courage to tell the American people that whatever you rashly said during the campaign about not increasing taxes on this or that category of the population cannot be interpreted as ruling out effective action to deal with this great national incubus. Start with a gasoline tax of at least a dollar a gallon. To us foreigners, the gas-guzzling habits of Americans appear scandalous on both economic and environmental grounds. Tell your countrymen they have to limit their energy consumption both to avoid an embarrassing dependence on Arab sheikhs and to improve their grandchildren's chances of inheriting a habitable planet. Do not be swayed by sob stories from those (mid-western farmers, for example) who say their way of life depends on cheap gasoline; but if any do convince you, give them the money in cash. Do not repeat the mistake the EC is trying so painfully to undo in its agricultural policy, of allowing an entire market to be distorted by the special needs of one social category. And don't be afraid to cash the 'peace dividend'. America will have no difficulty in remaining the world's leading military power with a much smaller financial outlay than was required to compete with the Soviet Union in a nuclear arms race while maintaining over 300,000 troops on a war footing in Germany. Of course there will be plenty of special pleaders urging you to keep bases open or not to cancel weapons systems. But if you really want to spend taxpayers' money on keeping people in work, there are many more efficient ways to do it than by paying them to produce machines which are at best useless, at worse appallingly destructive. Nor should anyone deceive you into thinking you are making the world safer by manufacturing weapons for export. Preventing the spread of weapons, both conventional and those 'of mass destruction', should be at the top of your priorities. In the post-cold war era your contribution to world security cannot be measured by the number of soldiers you keep posted abroad. It will be measured, in part, by the tasks you let them undertake. There is no longer a hostile power block, and therefore no front line to man against it. One interest the US shares with the rest of us is to prevent that situation ever rising again. So please make every effort to help those who are trying to turn Russia into a civilised power, integrated into the world economy; and encourage China to continue opening up; don't drive it back into autarky and xenophobia. Even simple objectives such as the defence of one state's sovereignty against another's aggression (as in Kuwait) may in future be the exception rather than the rule. Security has become a matter of defending people against each other - in places where sovereignty and borders are contested as much by the locals as by outsiders, such as the former Yugoslavia; or where the state has virtually disappeared, as in several African countries. Where possible, things should be prevented from getting that far, through timely diplomacy. Sometimes a show of force at an early stage may avert the need to use force at a later one. Of course the US does not want to be a lonely world policeman. These are tasks for multilateral structures, and above all for the United Nations - an engine largely of American invention, whose usefulness the US has lately rediscovered. But recent experience has shown that multilateral structures can work with US leadership (the Gulf), not without it (Yugoslavia). Americans must be prepared to do their bit, and pay their whack. Compared with the cost of the cold war, multilateral police operations will be cheap. Some of that peace dividend should be spent on them. Oh, and one last thing. You have an excellent ambassador in London. Since he is a career diplomat - the first ever appointed to that office - there is no need to replace him, whichever side has won the election. Let him stay.</p>

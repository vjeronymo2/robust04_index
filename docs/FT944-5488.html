			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Importance of 'positivity' in confronting cancer Sir, As someone recently diagnosed as having terminal cancer, I am pleased that the articles on cancer by Clive Cookson (Technology: 'Closing in on a serial killer', November 29 - first in series) will deal with diet, food supplements and alternative remedies - with some sympathy, I hope, since they are often (as in my case) ignored by conventional medicine as unproven or cranky. Since being written off by the National Health Service, I have met many people who, by various combinations of radically altered diet, radically altered life-style and personal determination, appear to have fought off 'the crab'. For how long, of course, who can say? Perhaps I shall find out. But some doctors attest to the fact that those who attain that hard-to-define but all-important 'positivity' last longer. That should be part of the scientific evidence - and 'positivity', unlike certain drugs, has no nasty side-effects. Rex Winsbury, Flat 3, 45 Montpelier Grove, London NW5 2XG</p>

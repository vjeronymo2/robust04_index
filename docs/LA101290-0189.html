			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 3 TENN. VOLS ACCUSED IN SEXUAL ATTACK;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: COACH JOHNNY MAJORS SUSPENDS THE PLAYERS AFTER A STUDENT ALLEGES THEY  ASSAULTED HER IN THE ATHLETIC DORMITORY.  </P> <P> Three players on the No. 5 Tennessee football team were suspended indefinitely  today after allegations they sexually assaulted a female student in the  athletic dormitory.  </P> <P> Coach Johnny Majors identified the three players as starting defensive end Kacy  Rodgers, reserve linebacker Dewayne Dotson and reserve running back Keith  Jeter.  </P> <P> Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Phil Scheurer said the complaint was filed  this morning alleging that the sexual assault took place sometime between 10:30  p.m. Thursday and 2 a.m. today.  </P> <P> "In order to ensure due process and protect the rights of both the complainant  and the accused, details of the incident are not being released," Scheurer  said.  </P> <P> "There is, however, considerable disagreement among the students about what  actually occurred," he added.  </P> <P> Scheurer said no criminal charges have been lodged. He said the woman has made  a statement to campus police, as have the three players.  </P> <P> Majors said he was embarrassed but was not suspending the players based on any  judgment of their guilt or innocence.  </P> <P> They were suspended, he said, because of the seriousness of the allegations and  "because there was a clear violation of team rules."  </P> <P> The rule violated involves visitation hours by females in the dormitory.  Visitation is allowed but not on Thursday nights.  </P> <P> University President Lamar Alexander said the university "deeply regrets this."  </P> <P> "We want the students and the state to know we take this very seriously," he  said. "The second point, and this is very important, is that the students  disagree considerably about what happened."  </P> <P> Tennessee plays No. 9 Florida on Saturday.  </P> <P> This is the latest in a string of off-field incidents involving Volunteer  football players this fall.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, four players -- starting cornerbacks Jeremy Lincoln and Floyd  Miley and second-stringers defensive end Chris Mims and offensive guard Bernard  Dafney -- allegedly confronted a fellow student who was in an argument with  Lincoln's girlfriend. Mims allegedly broke the student's jaw, but no charges  were filed.  </P></p>

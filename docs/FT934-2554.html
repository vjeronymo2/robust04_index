			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Coalition looks likely to govern Andorra Andorra, the tiny principality wedged on the mountainous Franco-Spanish border, emerged yesterday from its first constitution-based election after more than 700 years of feudalism but found little changed, Reuter reports from Andorra la Vella. Though Sunday's poll produced no outright winner, the outgoing head of government, Mr Oscar Ribas Reig, was confident the Pyrenean state could pursue reform with a coalition. Eighty-five per cent of the population of 60,000 is foreign and was ineligible to vote under the new constitution. Mr Ribas's centre-right Agrupament Nacional Democratic won the largest share of the vote. It gained 26.4 per cent of valid votes in a turnout of 81 per cent, giving it eight seats in the 28-member Consell General de les Valls, Andorra's parliament. Unio Lliberal with 22 per cent, and Nova Democracia with 19.1 per cent gained five each. Coalicio Nacional Andorrana (17.2) and Iniciativa Democratica Nacional (15.3) shared the rest with independents. Mr Ribas, who had 17 supporters in the outgoing Consell, did not view the situation as a vote of no confidence in his government, comparing Andorra now to Spain in the transition when more than 20 parties contested the first election after General Franco's death in the mid-1970s. Andorra is seeking to win international acceptance and modernise its anachronistic institutions. It joined the United Nations in August and has applied for membership of the Council of Europe. Key issues facing the new government include a deepening economic crisis. Mr Ribas said the budget deficit this year will reach Pta15.4bn (Pounds 75.5m) but so far no one has suggested introducing direct taxation as a remedy.</p>

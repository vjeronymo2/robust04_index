			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Excerpt] The Rwandan rebels have scored an impressive  victory in their battle with government forces for the control  of the capital, Kigali. This morning, a major Army stronghold  at Kanombe, east of the airport, fell to the rebels, and the  strategically important airport was, itself, also captured.  According to the rebels, this is all part of an offensive  started last month directed at preventing the slaughtering of  civilians by government militias. On a satellite phone to rebel  headquarters in Kigali, Raggi Omar asked RPF [Rwandan Patriotic  Front] military spokesman, Emmanuel Ndahiro how they captured  the airport.    [Begin recording] [Ndahiro] Yes, last night there was heavy  fighting, and the troops were in contact this time. That had  been preceded by heavy shelling the previous day, and they  eventually managed to unhand the resistance of the enemy and  captured the airport and the barracks that is just next to the  runway, a Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for  Democracy and Development militias] military base which has been  the most powerful around in the country made up of the elite.  So, we are in control of the airport, and we took charge of  that barracks, yes.    [Omar] This is Kanombe Camp, which is where the Rwandan  Government Army forces are?    [Ndahiro] Yes, that is the military barracks I am talking  about. We took control of it and we are in charge. We were in  that barracks. We managed to push the government forces really  far so we are in total control of the barracks and the airport.    [Omar] Why has the RPF decided to move militarily on Kigali  Airport at this specific juncture?    [Ndahiro] There has not been anything new, if I may inform  you. You must have heard that all along we had been fighting  around the airport. There has been a very strong government  position around the airport and that military barracks. We had  requested that the airport become a neutral point, and the UN  could not manage to make it a neutral point. They allowed the  government forces to stay around and near the airport, which did  not make it a neutral point. We suggested that us too should be  around the airport so that it is manned by all the parties in  the conflict. The government forces denied that, I mean, they  refused, and the UN forces could not enforce it, so in the end  they were there at their own [word indistinct]. There were  certainly hindering in so far as the situation demanded in  neutrality. The United Nations from the very beginning lacked  the backbone to stand and oppose the government forces from  killing the people they were killing so we could not leave it  into their hands alone.    [Omar] Will the RPF afford the United Nations full  cooperation in having access to the airport and in getting aid  and humanitarian flights into Kigali Airport?    [Ndahiro] Yes, we shall offer full cooperation with the  United Nations in its endeavor to support the remaining few  people with humanitarian assistance.    [Omar] Will you also afford them also full assistance in  deploying their new 5,500 peacekeepers which they envisage doing  in the next week or so?    [Ndahiro] Of course, that brings back the question that we  tried to advise whoever was responsible for taking that decision  on numbers, particularly. We said the number was too large for  this mission and we are still critical about it, but we feel  2,500 men are perhaps not necessary at the airport. We can go  into discussions about numbers that are necessary and are up to  the job that we think they will be doing at the airport, yes.    [Omar] So you are saying that 5,500 new UN peacekeepers is  too much. They only really need 2,500 to do the job in your  eyes?    [Ndahiro] Yes, that is what we see in so far as the  so-called  humanitarian that has come to the...[pauses] Yes, we feel that  force is capable of delivering.    [Omar] So now that RPF has control of the airport will you  just allow the UN to bring 2,500 in and then say: Well, that is  all we think that you will need and we will not allow you to  bring in the remaining 3,000.    [Ndahiro] I told you we were very flexible. We are very  flexible; we are ready to discuss with the people that are  concerned. The resolution to have 5,500 men was taken with no  regard to our suggestions. We are more on the ground and we  feel better equipped to advise on what is best here.

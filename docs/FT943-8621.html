			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG gold mine back in operation The Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea, one of the largest in the world outside of South Africa and an important source of revenue for the PNG government, resumed full production at the weekend. Operations were halted on August 2 by an explosion at an explosives facility near the mine which killed 11 people. On Saturday Sir John Kaputin, PNG's Minister of Mining and Petroleum, gave approval for full production after recommissioning processes last week confirmed that the mine and plant were operating safely. Placer Pacific, the project manager, says it will take several months to repair the damage to the mine. Porgera produces nearly 1.5m troy ounces of gold annually and, apart from collecting royalties, the government has a 25 per cent stake.</p>

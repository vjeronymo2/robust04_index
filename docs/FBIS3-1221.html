W. de  Klerk on Wednesday [23 March] said the potential for violence in  the Ciskei could not be ruled out. "We have a large crowd at  one of the stadiums demanding Brig (Oupa) Gqozo's presence.  Brig Gqozo said he is not going. There is a volatile situation  there but we have taken steps to defuse the situation if this  volatility erupts. We are on the scene and are absolutely  willing and able to protect South Africa's interests and, of  course, the interests of the Ciskei," he said at a press  conference in the border town of Queenstown.    At least 20 South African Defence Force armoured vehicles  were parked on the outskirts of the town as Mr de Klerk spoke.</p>

Introduction </H5>   The world's deepest drop shaft facility for microgravity  experiments, using a former coal mine shaft, was constructed at  Kamisunagawa, Hokkaido, Japan, in 1991. This drop shaft has a  free fall depth of 490 m and a total depth of 710 m. Unlike  similar facilities in the U.S. and Europe, which have vacuum  shafts, an atmospheric shaft has been chosen for this facility  in view of the exceptional depth of the shaft. The rocket-shaped  capsule (1.8 m in diameter, 8 m in length, 5.7 tons in maximum  weight) falls through the drop shaft and produces microgravity  of approximately 1 x 10[.sup]-5[/] G for 10 seconds. A double  capsule arrangement has been adopted. Microgravity condition is  produced by floating the inner capsule in which the experimental  devices are loaded, in the vacuum space of the outer capsule  while falling. Two vertical steel rails are installed opposite  each other in the drop shaft, and the outer capsule falls  between the rails controlled by magnetic guidance system. The  atmospheric drag exerted on the outer capsule is counteracted by  a compressed air jet thruster. The motion of the inner capsule  (except that in the direction of gravitation) is controlled by  electromagnetic bearings just after being released. In this  paper, we present an outline of this system.  <H5>  2. Basic Specifications and System Concept </H5>   On development, basic specifications were settled as  follows:    1. Microgravity time: over 10 seconds    2. Microgravity level: less than 1.0 x 10[.sup]-4[/] G    3. Deceleration at braking: less than 10 G    4. Maximum payload weight: approximately 1,000 kg    5. Real-time data transmission device between falling  capsule  and control room including color image.    The adopted system concepts to realize these required  specifications are as follows:    (1) Unlike similar facilities in the U.S. and Europe, which  have vacuum shafts, an atmospheric shaft has been adopted, in  view of the exceptional depth of the shaft, and in due  consideration of the simplicity of braking, recovering, and  maintaining the capsule.    (2) Atmospheric drag while falling is compensated for by a  compressed air jet thruster.    (3) A double capsule arrangement is adopted. The inner  capsule in which the experimental devices are loaded, floats in  the vacuum space of the outer capsule while falling and produces  microgravity condition.    (4) Two vertical steel rails are installed opposite each  other in the drop shaft and the outer capsule falls between  rails controlled by magnetic guidance system.    (5) The free fall of 490 m results in Corioli's force  displacing the inner capsule horizontally by 175mm relative to  the outer capsule, which falls vertically guided by the rails.  Then the inner capsule is released from the offset position by  90mm westward and lands at a position offset by 85mm eastward,  relative to the center axis of the outer capsule.    (6) After a free fall of 10 seconds, the capsule plunges  into  the closed tube and is gently decelerated by compressing air  inside the tube.    (7) Recovery of the capsule is done by operating the  capsule-recovering equipment from the control room.    (8) An optical communication system between the falling  capsule and the bottom of the shaft is installed.    A schematic cross-section of this facility is shown in  Figure  2.  <H5>  3. Structural Design of the Capsule </H5>   Figure 1 shows the outside view of the capsule.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-37A>      Figure 1. General View of Capsule </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-38A>      Figure 2. System Concept </FIG>     The capsule is composed of three modules as illustrated in  Figure 3. The total length is 8,375mm, the diameter is 1,800mm,  and the maximum weight is 5.7 tons including the experimental  devices.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-38B>      Figure 3. Structure of Capsule Module </FIG>     The capsule is a welded aluminum alloy structure. The main  structural part of each module is a stiffened shell 7mm in  thickness. As the capsule plunges into the braking zone, it is  exposed to an aerodynamical force that is too large to be  controlled completely by magnetic guidance system. Touchdown  bearings (called skids) are provided at the joint part of the  modules to prevent the guide magnets from touching the rails.    Experiments to determine the shape of the capsule were  carried out using a wind tunnel. Tens of models of different  shapes were tested. The models were 1/10 scale of the real  capsule. Aerodynamic forces acting on the models were measured.  The influence of the shape of added parts, such as guide magnet,  on air resistance force was examined. The influence of  structures installed in the drop shaft on air drag was also  studied. The shape of the outer capsule and the capacity of the  compressed air jet thruster to counteract air drag while falling  were determined from these experimental data.    The space between the inner and outer capsules is evacuated  to prevent acoustic vibration being transmitted to the inner  capsule. The inner and outer capsules are connected by fine  optical cables to transmit the signal while falling.  <H5>  4. Release of Inner and Outer Capsule and Microgravity </H5> Performance    Figure 4 shows the capsule in the condition ready for  release, but still suspended at the top of the shaft. The outer  capsule is locked to the shaft top by a hydraulic clamp, with  the inner capsule suspended by an electromagnetic clamp to the  top of the evacuated interior payload module. Releasing of the  inner and outer capsules follows the time sequence indicated in  Figure 5. By decreasing the coil current of the electromagnet  suspending the inner capsule, the inner capsule begins to fall.  When the force retained by magnetic clamp lowers to 85 percent  of the inner capsule weight, an answer signal indicating ``inner  capsule released'' is transmitted. Some 35 msec later, the outer  capsule release command is generated, and the outer capsule is  actually released about 20 msec later.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-39A>      Figure 4. Schematic Diagram of Capsule </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-39B>      Figure 5. Time Sequence of Inner and Outer Capsule </FIG>      Upon release, the outer capsule is magnetically guided in  its  fall between a pair of steel rails laid along the drop shaft.  The inner capsule must fall freely in the vacuum space  surrounding it without coming into mechanical contact with the  outer capsule structure. For this purpose, its movement is  restricted by magnetic bearings to five degrees of freedom  except downward translation, for 0.4 second just after release.  As the inner capsule is released about 55 msec before the outer  capsule is released, the inner capsule displaces downward to  dislodge itself from the narrow gap between the magnetic  bearings about one second after release. The vertical distance  between the two capsules is detected by an optical sensor  mounted on the outer capsule. The thruster jets are then  controlled by a feedback loop using the signal from the sensor,  to maintain the inner capsule within the prescribed range of  distance: between the lower edge of the magnetic bearings and  the bottom of the shock absorber.    After a free fall of 10 seconds, the capsule plunges into  the  deceleration zone. At this time, the inner capsule is still  floating. To minimize the impact of landing on the bottom shock  absorber, the distance between the inner and outer capsules is  controlled so that when entering the braking zone, the inner  capsule is as close as possible to the bottom shock absorber.  <H5>  5. Magnetic Guidance System of Outer Capsule </H5>   A pair of vertical steel rails (144mm x 160mm in cross  section) is installed diametrically opposing each other in the  drop shaft. The attraction-type electromagnetic levitation  method was chosen. Six pairs of electromagnets are provided on  the outer capsule, each pair saddling a guide rail as shown in  Figure 6. Their attractive forces are individually controlled  for stiffness and damping by controllers mounted on the capsule.  Other components provided near each magnet are an eddy current  displacement meter to detect the gap between the magnet and  rail, and an accelerometer to measure the absolute acceleration  in the horizontal direction. The magnetic force of each magnet  is 3,000 N max. in Y-direction and 1,500 N max. in Z-direction.  The rail-to-magnet gap is 8mm, and the rail-to-skid gap is set  to 2.5 to 3mm for each side.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-39C>      Figure 6. Layout of Guide Magnet </FIG>     The motion of the capsule is controlled in five axes (i.e.,  except that in the direction of gravity pull) by six pairs of  electromagnets. Because two pairs are in the Y-direction and  four are in the Z-direction, control of the Z-axis can become  excessive. For this reason, we have adopted the co-operative  control method for the Z-axis: only three motions, translation,  inclination, and rotation about the Z-axis, are picked up in  input signals, and are subjected to positive control.    The input signals for control are the gap between the magnet  and the rail, and absolute acceleration in horizontal direction,  from which absolute velocity, relative velocity, and relative  displacement (relative to the rail) are fed back for control.  Optimization of each control gain was done by trial and error in  more than 10 drop tests. The block diagram of the magnetic  guidance system is illustrated in Figure 7.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-40A>      Figure 7. Block Diagram of Magnetic Guidance System </FIG>     The outer capsule falling data in Y-direction as seen at the  guide magnet are presented in Figure 8. It shows that in the  free fall zone, the outer capsule is satisfactorily guided by  the magnetic guidance system and falls without touching the  rails. But as the capsule plunges into the braking zone, it is  exposed to large aerodynamic forces and the skids of the capsule  touch the rails many times while falling.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-40B>      Figure 8. Outer Capsule Falling Data </FIG>   <H5>  6. Motion Control of the Inner Capsule Just After Released </H5>   To maintain the microgravity environment created in the  inner  capsule on its free fall, it is necessary that the inner capsule  does not touch the outer capsule. The gap between the two  capsules is 75mm on each side, and as such contact can occur  when the inner capsule is released with a certain initial  velocity, the initial velocity in the horizontal direction must  be reduced to less than 7.5mm/s.    To reduce this initial velocity, the motion of the inner  capsule (except that in the direction of gravitation) is  controlled for 0.4 second just after release. To perform this  control, five sets of magnetic bearings are mounted on the outer  capsule; two sets against the top portion of the inner capsule  and three sets against its bottom portion.    The activation sequence of the magnetic bearings is as  follows: First, the inner capsule is held by the inner capsule  holding clamp (top magnet), which in turn is supported with a  rod by the outer capsule. Then the lower three pairs of magnets  are turned on to bring the capsule into an equilibrium position  determined by the tension of the top magnet's support rod and  the combined control force of the three sets of magnets. Because  activation of the upper two pairs of magnets at this moment will  bring about an excess degree of freedom of two for the force  acting on the capsule, the control point may not be stabilized  properly. To forestall this problem, the target control point  (i.e., the zero-in point) that was originally set for the upper  bearings is cancelled first, and is reset to the status quo  position. As a consequence, when the upper pairs are activated,  the inner capsule does not move from this target position. Then,  highly stable control of the five sets of magnetic bearings  becomes possible after the inner capsule is released from the  top magnet. We call this process the auto presetting.    Since the time expended in motion control is that much time  lost for the microgravity experimentation, the control time must  be as short as possible. Although this time can be reduced,  theoretically at least, by raising the control gain, but in  reality the gain cannot be raised indefinitely, because all the  control is done from the outer capsule, such an act will  inevitably couple the motion of the inner capsule to that of the  outer capsule. The control gain and the control duration time  are optimized by conducting simulation analysis for the motion  of both capsules, and are duly improved conducting drop tests.  <H5>  7. Compressed Air Jet Thruster System </H5>   The thruster device is mounted on the thruster module as  shown in Figure 3. Three compressed air reservoirs of 20 MPa are  installed. There are three compressed air lines, in each line,  air is led through a pressure control valve that ensures the  prescribed service pressure, and then branches into three  thruster valves, each feeding a pair of nozzles, each pair being  mounted diametrically across the outer capsule axis and  numbering 18 in all. The nine thruster valves control the jets  issuing from the relevant nozzles in the ON/OFF mode: the  combination of valves 0 to 9 ensures control in nine steps of  aggregate thrust force. For these valves, a compact lightweight  type was selected after thorough testing to ascertain its  capability to control a large flow of compressed air with a  sufficiently rapid response. The service pressure is 4.7 MPa and  the maximum available thrust force is 7.15 KN.    The thruster control system flow is illustrated in Figure 9.  The vertical distance between the inner and outer capsule is  detected by infrared sensor. The transmitted signal is converted  from analog to digital form after passing a low-pass filter,  then processed in the PID algorithm to derive the thruster valve  manipulating variable. The output from controller is converted  into driving signals for the nine thruster valves, to regulate  these valves in ON/OFF mode through valve drivers. To eliminate  accidental actuation by noise as well as hunting repetition, the  controller software is provided with a hysteresis lag of 0.06 V  between OFF and ON signals.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-41A>      Figure 9. Block Diagram of Gas Jet Thruster System </FIG>     Thruster system operating data are presented in Figure 10.  The inner capsule, having been released about 55 msec earlier  than the outer capsule, is dislodged from the narrow gap between  the magnetic bearings in about 1 second; when it reaches the  prescribed control position, the thruster valves are actuated to  accelerate the outer capsule. In this case, seven thruster  valves are actuated. Then, the thrusters are shut down once, and  as the capsule continues to fall, the increasing atmospheric  drag exerted by the accelerating downward capsule velocity is  counteracted by successive re-actuation of the thruster valve.  The foregoing progress of the vertical distance between the  inner and the outer capsule is timed so that, when the inner  capsule attains a position 20-60mm above the shock absorber, the  capsule enters the braking zone.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-42A>      Figure 10. Thruster System Operating Data </FIG>   <H5>  8. Braking and Recovery of the Capsule </H5>   The capsule 1.8 m in diameter falls through the free fall  zone 4.8 m in diameter for 10 seconds. Then the capsule plunges  into the braking tube 1.9 m in diameter and 200 m in length with  a velocity of 98 m/sec. Because the bottom of the braking tube  is closed, and the gap between the capsule and braking tube is  very narrow, air inside the braking tube is compressed and  decelerates the capsule. Fourteen sets of mechanical braking  shoes are installed at the bottom of the braking tube. Once the  capsule comes to this section, braking shoes catch the capsule  mechanically and the capsule is stopped.    Confirming that the capsule is held by the mechanical brake,  the capsule recovering equipment is sent down from the top of  the shaft on a wire rope and the capsule is recovered on the  ground some tens of minutes after being released.    If, by any chance, the mechanical brake should malfunction,  the capsule plunges into the emergency stopping zone filled with  a cushioning material and is stopped without serious damage.    This braking system was developed by Mitsui Engineering and  Shipbuilding Co., Ltd.  <H5>  9. Laser Communication </H5>   An optical communication system is installed. In this  system,  laser light is transmitted through the air between the capsule  and the bottom of the shaft. The results of experiments in the  falling capsule are observed in real-time by this optical  transmitter. The command data can be also transmitted in  real-time from the control room to the capsule by this system.  This communication system was developed by Toshiba Corporation.  <H5>  10. Performance </H5>   The falling tests at the site prove that the required  specifications are fully met as follows:    Microgravity time: 10.0-10.2 sec.    Microgravity level: approximately 10[.sup]-5[/] G    Deceleration at braking: about 8.3 G    Figures 11 and 12 show the acceleration of the inner capsule  measured during falling test.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-42B>      Figure 11.

Development of this facility was carried out under a  contract  research program on the orders of the New Energy and Industrial  Technology Development Organization (NEDO).

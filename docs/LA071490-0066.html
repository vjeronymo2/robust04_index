			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PORTER RANCH PLAN SPECIFICATIONS WILL DELAY THE BULLDOZERS;  </P> <P> TIMETABLES: A NUMBER OF UNRESOLVED ISSUES WILL PROBABLY DELAY THE GRADING OF  CHATSWORTH HILLSIDES FOR ANOTHER YEAR.  </P> <P> Although the City Council has approved the massive Porter Ranch development  project, it will be another year before the tracks of bulldozers grind up the  last footprints of hikers over 1,300 acres of the Chatsworth hills.  </P> <P> The city and the Porter Ranch Development Co. must settle several issues before  the foundation for the first house or shopping center can be laid in the area  north of the Simi Valley Freeway. The only part of the project on which  construction may start sooner is on a fire station and support roads for it at  the southern end of the site.  </P> <P> But make no mistake, the scrub-covered hills are about to change forever. And  not just the brush will disappear under a bulldozer's tracks. In some cases, so  will the hills.  </P> <P> Although the developer has promised not to alter the area's hilly topography,  the hills that remain after the project is completed in 20 years will not even  be the same hills that are there now, according to a city official.  </P> <P> The developer will use a new process known as "land-form grading," a spokesman  said, in which "you just kind of reshape things to make it so a street can fit  there."  </P> <P> Jim Bolger, 62, a hiker from Woodland Hills, treks through the area as many as  four times a week. He said he will continue to do so once construction on the  project begins, but it won't be the same.  </P> <P> "It will sort of spoil the area," he said.  </P> <P> Despite vocal protests by area homeowners during the permit process, the City  Council voted 14 to 0 Tuesday to allow development to proceed after the area's  councilman, Hal Bernson, announced his support.  </P> <P> By approving the company's basic land-use plan, the City Council cleared the  way to transform undeveloped hills north of the Simi Valley Freeway in  Chatsworth into a vast complex that would provide housing for up to 11,000  people and jobs for up to 21,000.  </P> <P> The land-use plan approved by the council stipulates only the type of  development -- residential, commercial or recreational -- that may occur in  various parts of the project area. It does not specify which parts of the  project would be developed first or where individual structures would be built.  </P> <P> The developer must receive city approval of more detailed construction maps  before construction can begin. City officials said that process is likely to  take at least 18 months and could take up to six years.  </P> <P> To build the fire station and supporting roads, a requirement of the Los  Angeles City Fire Department, the developer will extend Winnetka Avenue north  of the Simi Valley Freeway, Corbin Avenue north across the freeway and west to  the new segment of Winnetka Avenue, and Rinaldi Street west to Corbin Avenue,  said Porter Ranch Development Co. spokes  </P> <P> man Paul Clarke. The new fire station will be at Winnetka and Corbin avenues,  he said.  </P> <P> Building on the commercial and residential portions of Porter Ranch cannot  begin until the city approves more detailed plans for the 24 sections, or  tracts, into which the developer has divided the 1,300 acres, said Nancy  Scrivner, an associate with the city Planning Department.  </P> <P> The developer determines the order in which it presents the tracts, and may  submit the tract maps individually or in groups.  </P> <P> Clarke indicated that after the developer builds the fire station and  supporting roads, it will extend Mason Avenue north and Rinaldi Street west  until the two roads meet. At that intersection, he said, a neighborhood mall  will be built containing a grocery store, a pharmacy and a dry-cleaner.  </P> <P> When the developer builds the shopping mall, he said, it will "probably put  some houses in as well." Construction will proceed throughout the entire 20  years of planned development on a tract-by-tract basis, Clarke said.  </P> <P> Although the developer may submit the tract maps in any order, the city must  approve each map before construction can begin. The city normally takes between  six and eight months to rule on a tract plan, said Ron Maben, a city planner.  The city's response, Maben said, usually is a "yes with conditions" -- a  tentative approval that requires the developer to take certain additional  actions before starting to build.  </P> <P> Typical requirements include larger sewage systems and wider roads, Scrivner  said.  </P> <P> After the city approves the tract plan, the developer has six years to meet the  conditions required by the city. But most developers fulfill their obligations  within months, Maben said. So the average time between submitting a tract map  and starting construction ranges from 18 months to two years.  </P> <P> Porter Ranch Development Co. has not decided which tracts it will seek to  develop after it finishes the fire station and the area around the residential  mall, Clarke said. The company will attempt to sell houses before they are  built, he said, so it will consider buyers' demands in deciding which tracts to  submit for city approval first.  </P> <P> Because of the size of the proposed Porter Ranch project, the city and the  developer will attempt to negotiate an extra accord, called a development  agreement, before the developer submits the first tract map for city approval.  Under a typical development agreement, city officials said, the city might  allow the developer to build more residential units than normally allowed in  exchange for a promise to include other items, such as affordable housing.  </P> <P> Clarke said lawyers from the city and his company will begin to negotiate a  development agreement this week. Although he said he hopes an accord will be  signed, he said his company could decide to submit a tract map for city  approval before a development agreement is reached.  </P> <P> The optional development agreement, Scrivner said, simply "reduces problems  down the road."  </P> <P> Clarke said that even when all the agreements have been signed and all the  tracts have been developed, the land on Porter Ranch will resemble its current  topographic form. "There's nothing that in any way, shape or form will be in  any way what you refer to as massive," he said.  </P> <P> Scrivner disagreed. The land in general will remain as hilly as before, she  said, but "the topography won't be the same." She said Porter Ranch after  development will have "a sort of natural-looking landscape, but it won't look  like it is now."  </P> <P> In addition to the 1,300 acres the City Council approved, the developer has  large property holdings next to that parcel. The company already has received  conditional city approval for development of two tracts northeast of the  1,300-acre project, city civil engineer Glenn Hirano said.  </P></p>

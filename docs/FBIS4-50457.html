			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Christine Chan] </F>   [Text] China's lumbering state sector is switching from  relying on loans from supra-nationals and direct foreign  investment to sourcing funds from global equity markets. The  remarks, made in Hong Kong yesterday by Liu Hongru, chief of the  China Securities Regulatory Commission, come as the moribund  enterprises face the worse credit squeeze in years. There are  concerns that the enterprises, considered the backbone of the  economy, will be the biggest obstacle to the country's economic  reform programmes.    Mr Liu said that issuing shares directly to foreign  investors  by enterprises was a more flexible way of sourcing funds and  could supplement loan financing. "This will allow foreigners to  take a longer view on our economy and help enterprises transform  their operation mechanism," he told a seminar on raising capital  in the United States for mainland and Hong Kong enterprises.    The US has been designated as the second capital market for  raising funds by Chinese state-owned enterprises after Hong  Kong. Mr Liu said the commission would not relax its standards  to allow fast listings on US exchanges. He said there were five  Chinese enterprises among the second batch of companies  short-listed for listings in the US. "The enterprises will be  listed only when (they are) up to scratch. We aim for quality  rather than speed," Mr Liu said.    The five companies are China Eastern Airlines China Southern  Airlines, Shandong Huaneng Electricity, Huaneng International  Power Development and Tianjin Steel Pipe. "It is imperative to  select some enterprises for direct listing in the US because it  is the world's biggest capital market, which has the highest  liquidity and provides the best protection for shareholders," he  said.    Mr Liu said the five companies were now doing listing  preparation work. "Some have named underwriters, accountants  and lawyers, while some have completed assets and capital  verification," he said. The enterprises had been channelling  funds from international organisations such as the World Bank,  and from direct foreign investment, including joint ventures.  However, Mr Liu said: "Under the current situation, it is not  sufficient just to rely on these various foreign investments."  He was speaking in the context of an economy in which  substantial capital was needed in fundamental industries such as  energy, transportation and infrastructure.    "The domestic capital market cannot meet the country's  massive demand for funds," he said, explaining the need to raise  foreign capital through different channels.    The experiment of listing state-owned enterprises abroad had  proved a success, he said, with $11 billion being raised for the  first batch for listings in Hong Kong. "On the basis of the  results of these experimental listings, it can be concluded that  the responses of the global securities markets and international  investors have been overwhelmingly good," Mr Liu said.</p>

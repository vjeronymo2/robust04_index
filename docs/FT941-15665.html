			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / District auditor's report: Main points Westminster city council had been guilty of 'gerrymandering' to give the ruling party an unfair electoral advantage. The council kept flats empty so that whole blocks could be sold to owner-occupiers, preventing their use to house the homeless. The council spent public funds to prepare papers for discussing the promotion of the majority party's electoral advantage. The sale of homes cost the council Pounds 21.25m, including Pounds 2m for housing homeless families in temporary accommodation. Ten councillors and officials - including Dame Shirley Porter, then council leader - should be required to reimburse the council. Six councillors - including Dame Shirley - should be disqualified from being councillors.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: 3i 3i's flotation in July was launched in less than ideal market conditions. But since then the shares have outperformed the FT-SE 100 Index by 16 per cent. Europe's largest investor in unquoted companies is now priced at net asset value, compared with a 13.5 per cent discount when floated. With one exception, it is the highest rated investment trust on the London market. So far, the stock's performance is justified. 3i is unusually conservative when valuing its assets and making provisions for businesses that might go under. That means that when divesting equity stakes, the sums it receives are on average considerably higher than book value. Such capital gains might have been undermined by the current disenchantment with flotations, but trade sales are more than compensating. The shares have also been buoyed by its businesses' growth prospects. Small companies are expected by some to post earnings growth three times that of Footsie stocks next year and twice as great in 1996. In the long term, the group's development is underpinned by its ambition to repeat its UK success elsewhere in Europe. 3i has forged ahead with plans to set up a fund management scheme for several continental markets. Concerns remain, however. The recovery may already have been anticipated in the price. Moreover, a shadow is likely to be cast over the stock by fears that the banks, which still control 50 per cent of 3i's equity, will be tempted to sell their remaining stake when they can next June.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Winterthur to inject Pounds 6m into UK offshoot WINTERTHUR, the Swiss insurer, is poised to inject a further Pounds 6m into its rapidly growing UK motor insurance subsidiary, Churchill Insurance. The money is needed to support further expansion by the company whose premium income is expected to Pounds 135m in 1993, compared with Pounds 75m in 1992, according to Mr Martin Long, managing director. Churchill is one of a number of direct motor insurers which sell insurance via a combination of intensive mass media marketing and telephone sales, bypassing the insurance broker, the industry's traditional intermediary. Direct Line, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, pioneered these sales techniques and is now the biggest direct motor insurer. Zurich Insurance, Winterthur's biggest Swiss rival, announced on Monday that it is interested in acquiring part of the business of Municipal Mutual, the stricken local authority-owned company. Mr Long said Churchill has sold a total of 430,000 policies since its launch in June 1989. He expects to sell 200,000 policies this year and further 300,000 new policies in 1993, lifting Churchill's share of the private motor insurance market from 2 1/2 per cent to 4 per cent. Mr Long also says that the company has been trading profitably since April this year, reducing its likely pre-tax losses to Pounds 2m compared with Pounds 6m in 1991. He said the losses reflected expensive start-up costs. At a time when most of its competitors are sharply ra-tionalising their operations, Churchill is also recruiting staff. Some 150 new staff will join the company in the final quarter of 1992 and a further 120 next year. Churchill currently employs some 500 people. Churchill has also rented a further 15,000 sq ft of office space at its Bromley headquarters.</p>

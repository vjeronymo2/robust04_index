			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Eastern Electricity opposes coal plan EASTERN Electricity has come out against suggestions made this week by other regional electricity companies that liberalisation of the industry should be postponed to allow coal purchases to be increased. The Ipswich-based company's stance is the first opposition to emerge from the industry to a plan many are backing as a relatively easy way of keeping 10 to 15 British Coal pits open. In its submission to the Department of Trade and Industry's energy review, Eastern has joined other regional companies in calling for increased competition for the two generators. However Dr James Smith, Eastern chairman, said yesterday that his company could not support calls for the government to delay the planned reduction of the so-called franchise market through which regional companies have a monopoly to provide electricity to all but the largest customers in their own areas. The government intends to phase out the franchise market in stages from 1994 so that by 1998 even households could choose from which regional company to buy their supplies. This week regional companies including Southern told MPs that delaying these plans would enable them to buy more electricity generated from coal on long-term contracts because they would be more certain of the size of their markets. Dr Smith said yesterday that it was illogical for regional companies to argue for more competition to be introduced for generators but not for themselves. He said that 'providing the price was right' more coal could be used for electricity generation than has been tentatively agreed between British Coal and the generators.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A NEW ATTITUDE;  </P> <P> EX-PUPPETEER OF SEX PISTOLS ABANDONS SPOOFS FOR POLITENESS ON LECTURE CIRCUIT  </P> <P> Malcolm McLaren, the art-school expellee who exacted revenge on the world by  unleashing the Sex Pistols, came to Cal State Fullerton Thursday to warn of the  newest youth craze threatening suburbia: "The return of etiquette."  </P> <P> "In the past, I might've been somewhat against it," reflected McLaren, whose  London leather goods boutique -- Sex, it was called -- was a spawning ground  for the Buzzcocks and Boy George as well as the Pistols in the 1970s. "But  nowadays, I rather like the reservation of it. Etiquette is so romantic," he  mused.  </P> <P> Now 44, the one-time puppeteer of spoof-musicians Adam Ant and Bow Wow Wow  sounded more like Prof. Henry Higgins than Svengali. Fortunes were made, sure,  but McLaren, an intellectual as well as a fop, saw his orchestration of  no-talent vulgarians into rock stardom as an amusing social experiment.  </P> <P> "The concept was to be good by claiming to be bad," he said of the Sex Pistols.  "By not playing, by not turning up at gigs, we made a movement out of it. It  was mind-blowing."  </P> <P> Propelled by driving, barely intelligible anthems like "Anarchy in the U.K.,"  the Pistols released a platinum record before disintegrating with the  heroin-overdose death of the group's bassist, alleged murderer Sid Vicious.  </P> <P> "It was wonderful to see the aristocrats of the rock industry terrified at this  audacious and ridiculous concept," McLaren said, recalling the self-mutilating  band's onstage razor-blade antics.  </P> <P> Like the other celebrated poseur of his era, Ronald Reagan, the McLaren who  once shaped a generation through style now finds a receptive audience on the  lecture circuit.  </P> <P> Taking the university lectern in his striped Oxford shirt and V-neck sweater,  McLaren told the assembled students that when he was their age, "the thought of  a career seemed absolutely vulgar."  </P> <P> Possessing no talent as a writer, musician or visual artist, however, McLaren  realized that only one profession seemed open to him: "Plunder. I asked myself,  could I enter the world of plunder like the great masters?"  </P> <P> He found inspiration in the world of English literature. "Like Fagan, I decided  to get a lot of little boys to do my stealing for me."  </P> <P> With the demise of the Pistols -- and the fading popularity of their look --  McLaren turned in the early 1980s to the next fad in fashion/music: New Wave.  </P> <P> Viewing New Wave more as "a new hair style" than a musical trend, McLaren  repackaged punker Adam Ant as an 18th-Century pirate, and assembled Bow Wow  Wow, a synthesizer dance band distinguished by its singer, a bald, half-Burmese  13-year-old girl named Anabella.  </P> <P> By 1982, the admitedly non-musical McLaren was releasing records under his own  name, and scored a hit of sorts with the square-dance novelty tune "Buffalo  Gals," from his "Duck Rock" album. Not a composer or a lyricist, McLaren calls  himself a "director" of music.  </P> <P> He recalled his early creations somewhat uncharitably, describing John Lydon,  nee Johnny Rotten, as "a New Wave Neil Diamond," and the ex-dandy Adam Ant as a  pathetic failure "who should've stuck with being a pirate."  </P> <P> At the Fullerton lecture, however, students seemed more interested in McLaren's  philosophy than his colorful past.  </P> <P> In seemingly random answers to the students' serious questions about the state  of Western culture, McLaren gave cryptic clues to a Weltanschauung that  embraces everything from rubber marital aids to Puccini operas.  </P> <P> Asked to assess the lessons of the 1980s, he announced, "Girls are more  interesting than boys.  </P> <P> "They understand the word nuance. They aren't afraid to use the word pretty. I  mean, girls aren't afraid to go into a room and say, 'Isn't this a pretty  room,' " he stressed.  </P> <P> McLaren praised the invention of the fax machine, asserting that it will lead  to a triumph of the written word over its old enemy, the telephone  conversation.  </P> <P> He offered reassuring words to Americans fearful that the United States has  lost its place in the world economy: "All those Orientals on the other side of  the Pacific are desperate consumers of Marilyn Monroe, rock 'n' roll and  Coca-Cola," he said.  </P> <P> But mainly, he professed the virtues, nay the ubiquity, of posing as a  principle of human behavior.  </P> <P> "From the girl back in the '50s who stuffs tissues in her bra to show that she  has a bigger bust than other girls at the prom, to the lad with electric-shock  hair in black leather who whips himself with chains to show he's not part of  the money pit called London -- they're all brilliant poseurs," he said.  </P> <P> "Posing is the repackaging of the form, whether you use it for a lofty  intellectual pursuit or you use it just to get down and boogie," he said,  adding disconnectedly, "and the form is that basic instinct of the beat."  </P> <P> McLaren, who now lives in Hollywood, told The Times he is hard at work trying  to repackage his own form.  </P> <P> He has a film project, called "Waltz Darling," which depicts his hero, Oscar  Wilde, discovering rap music on a trip to Africa in 1880.  </P> <P> And, perhaps inevitably, he revealed a budding alliance with the corporate  incarnation of posing, the Walt Disney Co.  </P> <P> The wholesomeness-based entertainment conglomerate had invited the ex-Sex  Pistols' manager to Orange County to discuss the reformation of "The Mickey  Mouse Club" under his guidance, McLaren said.  </P> <P> "You know Hollywood," he said. "They desire to stay in touch with the taste of  the people."  </P></p>

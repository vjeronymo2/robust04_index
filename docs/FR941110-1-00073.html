			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA received anecdotal information that very few incineration facilities in the United States are now accepting bulk quantities of CFCs for destruction and as a result the price being charged is extremely high. The Agency does not want the maintenance costs at incineration facilities to impede the overall availability of destruction for controlled substances, especially as controlled substances are taken from existing use systems. If destruction is limited and expensive, the release of controlled substances to the atmosphere may be an unfortunately attractive option. Offering credits for destruction provides an economic incentive to persons who have controlled substances but would like to dispose of them. The credits have economic value which could offset the high costs of destruction. If persons gain a benefit from destroying a controlled substance, they will be more likely to destroy the controlled substance than release it to the atmosphere. The overall goal of providing the incentives for destruction is to prevent the release of ozone- depleting substances to the atmosphere.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that the proposed system for granting destruction credits will have an overall environmental benefit. Without an incentive to increase the current rate of destruction the Agency presumes there will be greater release of controlled substances to the atmosphere as equipment that contains the phased out substances is taken out of commission. Today's proposal is to grant destruction credits equal to the quantity of controlled substance destroyed minus an offset of 15 percent. Although the credits can be used to produce or import controlled substances, the amount produced or imported will be less than the amount destroyed due to the offset. The credits also provide an incentive to destroy ozone-depleting substances that otherwise might be emitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In making today's proposal the Agency considered other ways of encouraging destruction. EPA considered a voluntary system for encouraging destruction of controlled substances. The voluntary system would not grant credits but simply try to persuade companies to destroy ozone-depleting substances with publicity and public relations assistance. For instance, the Agency could develop a list of companies actively destroying controlled substances as ``friends of the ozone'' in a national publicity campaign. EPA believes, however, that a system of credits would provide greater incentive to increase current rates of destruction and there would be less chance of controlled substances being released to the atmosphere.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another option considered by EPA was to grant destruction credits equal to the amount of controlled substance destroyed. Under an option of giving 1:1 credits for kilograms, a person who destroys 100 kilograms of CFC&hyph;12 would be given a calculated level of 100 kilograms of destruction credits which could be used to produce or import 100 kilograms of new CFC&hyph;12. Although the incentive would be great to destroy unneeded stocks of controlled substances without an offset, EPA believes the environmental benefits of the actual destruction would be balanced by the subsequent production or importation of an equal amount of additional controlled substance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing today's proposal, EPA considered offsetting the number of credits to be granted by one percent from the actual quantity destroyed. A one percent offset is used throughout the current regulation in calculating allowances authorized in various transfers; both between Groups of controlled substances (inter-pollutant trades) and between companies (inter-company trades). The offset was developed to address Section 607 of the CAA which requires that trades result in less overall production or consumption than would have occurred absent the trade. The one percent offset was proposed in the September 30, 1991 rule, as an amount large enough to provide a net environmental benefit but without discouraging the trading that might be necessary to meet market demand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In today's proposal, EPA recommends a 15 percent offset. The 15 percent offset is proposed to ensure that environmental benefits result from the proposed incentive system granting additional production or importation to encourage destruction and prevent the release of controlled substances. The 15 percent offset proposed today is based on an estimate of the amount of controlled substances that could possibly be destroyed given the capacity of U.S. approved technologies. Estimates of destruction capacity for controlled substances in the United States for 1992 are 15 percent of annual production. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  Therefore, the greatest environmental benefit that can be obtained in the U.S. from destruction is 15 percent of annual U.S. production. The 15 percent offset means a person who destroys a quantity of controlled substance after the phaseout (January 1, 1996) may request credits equal to 85 percent of the quantity destroyed. The 85 percent is the portion of annual United States production of controlled substances for intended emissive uses that cannot be destroyed due to the limits of estimated domestic destruction capacity. To control and reduce the damage caused by corrosive by-products from the destruction of controlled substances, operators of incineration units usually incorporate a small percentage of halogenated substances in each batch. The offset would encourage owners of approved destruction technologies to maximize their capacity for incorporating controlled substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> United States capacity for destruction of halogenated compounds at commercial and public hazardous waste incineration facilities is 63,600 metric tons per year.

Transformation credits would be granted to a person who transforms controlled substances originally produced or imported for intended emissive uses. EPA is seeking comment on a system that would grant transformation credits as a parallel system to the system for destruction credits described above. In other words, transformation credits would be granted for a quantity of controlled substance transformed originally produced or imported for intended emissive uses, minus the 15 percent offset.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

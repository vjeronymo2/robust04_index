			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Books: Armistice turned into nightmare WAR IN ITALY 1943-1945: A BRUTALSTORY by Richard Lamb John Murray Pounds 19.99, 336 pges ALL TOO infrequently a military history is published that, conforming to the highest standards of scholarship, comprehensively rewrites a known passage of warfare. Richard Lamb's War in Italy is unquestionably such a book. There is nothing that compares with it in English, and very little in Italian. National pride and national embarrassment have inhibited due scrupulousness in the latter language. There are any number of partisan memoirs, but these address only one strand in the story. And, as the author argues, the partisan war was itself a blemished enterprise. Lamb takes as his starting point the September 8 armistice. With its army beaten in Africa and the Allies poised to launch an invasion of its mainland, Italy had already experienced disaster as a consequence of Mussolini's rule and his alliance with Hitler. But the armistice turned disaster into nightmare. Following Field Marshal Messe's surrender at Tunis on May 7 1943, King Victor Emmanuel III ordered Mussolini's arrest on July 25, replacing him with Badoglio, another Field-Marshal. Badoglio then sued, as best he could, for peace with the British and Americans. The Allies, distrusting yesterday's enemy, insisted on unconditional surrender as the necessary precondition to any pact against the Germans. Tragically, no proper plans were made to use surviving native forces to expel German divisions from Italy. Kesselring was given breathing space, which he used adroitly to secure Rome and make the Reich's southern flank as difficult to overcome as possible. This was an enormous setback for Field Marshal Alexander, but it was an even greater setback for the Italian nation. After 40 days in power Badolglio had to vacate the capital. He, the King and a skeleton government removed to Brindisi. Amid the confusion Mussolini was allowed to escape. With German connivance, a new republic was established at Salo in the North, plunging Italy into civil war. One of several myths Richard Lamb debunks is the timidity of the Italian soldier. Many Italians would happily have died for their country. The problem was in knowing against whom they should die. Soon there were two armies of occupation - the Allies' as well as the Germans. It was the political failures of 1943 that corroded the vigour and integrity of Italian arms. Paradoxically Italy as a nation might have fared better had she stuck by Germany, for at least she would not then have had to suffer German reprisals at what Hitler considered a savage betrayal. Those reprisals too often took the form of the vilest atrocities. The Ardeatine Cave massacre is infamous. Less publicised were the quantitively greater massacres of Italian troops in the Adriatic and in the Aegean. In the eastern waters of the Mediterranean the Reich's garrisons were manned by mixed German and Italian forces. When - following the armistice and Badoglio's instructions to resist only when fire was offered - some Italian units did not immediately surrender to their former allies, the German line was simple: slaughter them. Italy also suffered at the hands of the Allies, whose bombing raids against the German-occupied zone regularly caused havoc among the civilian population. But there was mischief too of the Italians' own making. The partisans, operating against the German military, were not a united front. On the one hand were the patriotic Green Flames, on the other the communist Garibaldi brigades. At the final collapse in 1945 both groups took what little law there was into their own hands. Alleged former fascists were indiscriminately murdered, while some Garibaldi elements abetted Tito's bloody attempts to wrest control of the north-east. Concurrently General de Gaulle, with scant regard for either Allied or Italian wishes, tried to annex part of Piedmont. In a ploy that was as scurrilous as it is shocking, ballot papers attached to ration cards were distributed amongst the local populace in a bid to get them to vote for French suzerainity. And so on. In short, a devastating tapestry of misfortune interwoven with duplicity. What lessons can be learned? The first and overwhelming is the most familiar: human nastiness. The second is: beware making war with one's ideological friends. The third: beware even more of abandoning them half-way through. Richard Lamb restitches every thread. One of many ghosts he lays is the alleged quiescence of Pope Pius XII. More than anyone Pius grasped the futility of protest against the Nazis. Instead he wisely kept his head below the parapet, in which position he clandestinely succoured not only many ethnic Italians, but not a few Jews as well. The strength of War in Italy is its familiarity with many hitherto unexploited sources, and its judiciousness in handling them. That said, it should be pointed out that Lamb's survey is not a popular account of events. Each chapter is a study of a particular aspect of his subject. But no-one with a serious interest either in Italy's War or contemporary Italian society can afford to ignore it.</p>

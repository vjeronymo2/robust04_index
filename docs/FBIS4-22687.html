			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the State Duma </F> Committee on Security, recorded by Olga Timofeyeva: "Power Has  Been Corrupted From Bottom to Top"]    [Text] The main threat to Russia's national security is  undoubtedly domestic in nature, although it is manifested  through external influence as well. Of course, I do not mean  direct military aggression.    The most important task today is to preserve the country's  unity, so that the Russian state will not become a "patchwork  quilt." It is also necessary to provide for Russia's sovereign  right to dispose of its own wealth: minerals, strategic raw  material, gold reserves, precious metals, and so forth. We must  not allow our country to become some kind of colonial appendage.  If foreign investors and foreign firms are able to penetrate  deeply into our economy and financial system, Russia will lose  its sovereignty and national independence, and without military  aggression.    Many people today think that Russia is surrounded only by  well-wishers. This is a profoundly erroneous position.  Unfortunately, we have opened wide not only our doors but also  Russia's borders for penetration of everyone and anyone and we  have removed all restrictions on access to what was previously  closed. We have foreigners as advisers to the president and  government, advisers in the economic structures and financial  system. Foreigners already have their hands on our property and  have made their way to our property and have made their way to  our natural resources. In think this is an uncontrolled  process--a far from normal phenomenon. But if we begin to  rectify the situation, I do not rule out the possibility of  strong pressure on Russia from the states of the West. In other  words, we have many friends as long as we allow them to operate  without restriction in the country. But as soon as we raise the  question of restricting their freedom of activity, their  attitude toward us changes.    I am in favor of national accord, and on this plane I am  prepared for any interaction with the government and  presidential structures. But under the condition that they will  take into account at least the interests of the majority of the  population, the main social strata. Because when the hungry, the  unclothed, and the unshod continue to be poor and on an ever  larger scale and the well-off and the rich increasingly rob the  poor and down and out with ever greater frenzy, no national  reconciliation can be achieved. For the sake of universal peace  and harmony, the course of the so-called economic reforms must  be changed.    No less crucial is the problem of fighting crime and  corruption. I think that with the present course of the reforms,  if it is possible to stop their growth at all it is only for the  time being. Because the social basis of this phenomenon will not  be eliminated. In the section of Yeltsin's message devoted to  crime I was struck by the frequent use of expressions like  "needed," "necessary," and "must," meaning the government, the  Duma, and the Federal Assembly as a whole. But who has been  keeping the president from fighting crime up to this point?  After all, he is the one responsible for the government;  according to the Constitution he is the one who guarantees  observance of the rights and freedoms of the citizens and is  responsible for protecting their interests. And he, the  president, is the end point of the power structures. So what has  Yeltsin done to fight crime during his reign besides issue empty  declarations which we hear in every one of his speeches?    Our problem is that the laws are not being obeyed, and not  least of all--by the president himself. Moreover, the current  authorities are corrupt from bottom to top and they are never  going to fight against themselves. Now the post of procurator  general has been filled by Ilyushenko--a member of the infamous  "interdepartmental commission." It is difficult to imagine a  greater tragedy for the procuracy or greater harm to law and  order in Russia. During the past three years the procuracy has  lived through three procurator generals and, unfortunately, each  has been worse than his predecessor in terms of professional  qualities and persistence in defending the law. Knowing the  procuracy system and many of its workers well, I can state that  Ilyushenko will not be taken seriously either by the apparatus  or by the workers in the localities. And this will have a  negative effect on the state of procuratorial oversight and the  organization of the fight against crime.    As before, the current authorities will limit themselves to  exposing only individual cases of corruption and wage the battle  against it in insignificant forms. The foundation, the essence  of this phenomenon that is tearing society apart will remain  untouched. As before, corruption in the higher echelons of power  will be beyond the reach of anyone who would expose it, and that  is the saddest part. Honest procuracy investigators and judges  will perform their professional and civil duties in fear of  losing their positions, their jobs. There are plenty of examples  of punishment of principled, "obstinate" workers of law  enforcement organs.    But still, even under the current unfavorable conditions, a  fight against crime can and should be waged. The first contacts  between deputies who are members of the committee on security  and law enforcement organs inspire a certain amount of hope. We  have already concluded an agreement with the Ministry of  Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation concerning joint  development of legislative acts aimed at stepping up this  battle. The Ministry of Internal Affairs has assigned a group of  its own specialists--scholars and experts. We are also arranging  similar contacts with the Ministry of Justice and the Procuracy.  We have held work meetings with representatives of the Security  Council. We have a certain understanding and we can work  together.    Still, in my view, serious progress in this area will be  possible only with certain changes in the leadership of the  Ministry of Internal Affairs and the discharge from the law  enforcement system workers in all of its areas who compromise  themselves. It would not be a bad idea for such a "purge" to  simultaneously affect government structures, administration  chiefs, and presidential representatives in the localities.  People must be recruited not according to the principle of  personal loyalty to the leaders but according to the principle  of professionalism in combination with steadfastness, honesty,  and devotion to the people. It would be desirable to take all  these urgent measures in concert with effective law making,  improvement of the moral situation in society, and, undoubtedly,  improvement of the well-being of the people.    The first work sessions of our committee revealed a certain  uniformity of views among its members and a similarity in the  assessments of the situation and the security of Russia. We have  declared a need to adopt a law on corruption. We are preparing  for hearings in the State Duma of a draft law on protection of  judges, procurators, and workers of other law enforcement  organs. We have announced a law on protection of victims and  witnesses. We are working on a draft law that would regulate the  extraction, production, transportation, and sale of strategic  materials, precious metals, and gold.    In my view, the political amnesty declared by the State Duma  was an important state toward national accord. The question of  restoration of justice with respect to the people arrested and  taken to court for the events of 19-21 August 1991, and 1 May,  21 September-4 October 1994 was raised by the opposition long  ago, and above all by the Communist Party. This was a point in  their election platform and a kind of mandate from the voters.    An awareness of the fact that the investigation of these  cases that has been started and their examination in court will  not reveal the objective truth and hence will not be fair has  gradually come to many of the deputies. They have also  understood that Russian society cannot be constantly in a state  of civil war, we must get out of this situation somehow, because  confrontation threatens us with graver consequences. Therefore  an attempt has been made to find at least certain areas of  mutual understanding among various factions in the Duma, and we  have adopted a memorandum on accord. Amnesty is the first step  toward building bridges among various groups in parliament and  thus in our society.</p>

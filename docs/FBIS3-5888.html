He is the first Diet member to be arrested in a widening  scandal involving the construction industry.    The arrest of the former senior member of the main  opposition  Liberal Democratic Party came after the House of Representatives  agreed earlier in the day to lift his parliamentary immunity.    Legislators cannot be arrested while the Diet is in session  unless parliament gives its approval.    Nakamura surrendered himself to the Tokyo District  Prosecutors office.</p>

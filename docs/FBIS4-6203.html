			<p>BFN     [Text] At 1930 yesterday, His Excellency [H.E.] Khamtai  Siphandon, prime minister of the Lao People's Democratic  Republic [LPDR], and his wife arranged a dinner at the National  Assembly Hall in Vientiane capital in honor of H.E. Dr. Mahathir  bin Mohamed, prime minister of Malaysia, his wife, and the  high-level Malaysian delegation, which is currently on an  official, friendly visit to the LPDR. Attending the banquet on  the Lao side were H.E. Phao Bounnaphon, minister attached to the  Prime Minister's Office; H.E. Somsavat Lengsavat, minister of  foreign affairs; H.E. Osakan Thammatheva, minister of  information and culture; and H.E.

During the banquet, which proceeded in an atmosphere of  friendship and mutual understanding between Laos and Malaysia,  H.E. Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon delivered a speech  welcoming the visit to Laos by the high-level delegation of the  Malaysian Government. He said: [Begin Khamtai Siphandon  recording] We are very pleased to welcome your excellency and  wife in the land of the LPDR at a time when our Lao nation is  celebrating the traditional new year. First of all, I would  like to wholeheartedly salute and welcome the first official,  friendly visit to the LPDR by H.E. Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir  bin Mohamed and his wife. We highly value this visit by your  excellency, a visit which has brought to the Lao people profound  friendship and intimate affection from the Malaysian people.  This visit is considered a very significant event in the  history of the good relations and cooperation between our two  countries.    Your respected Excellency the Prime Minister, I had an  opportunity to lead a delegation of the LPDR to visit your  beautiful country [words indistinct]. Though time has passed,  the impression of the visit still remains in our memories. We  are elated to note that the relations and cooperation between  our two countries, as close friends, have been fruitfully  developed in many fields, thus bringing about concrete benefits  for our two peoples. We are convinced that with the results of  the talks between our two delegations, as well as with the visit  by your excellency on this occasion, the relations and  cooperation between our two countries in various spheres, both  in the state and private sectors, will be further and ever more  vigorously expanded. The LPDR is elated at the great success  won by Malaysia in the economic field, and highly appraises the  ever increasing role of Malaysia in the region as well as its  significant contribution to solving various international  problems.    I would like to take this occasion to wish the Malaysian  people glorious and ever greater success on the path of the  farsighted policy of your excellency's government.    Your Excellency, distinguished guests, at present, we are  concentrating all the potentials of the country and trying to  gain assistance and cooperation from foreign countries on  exploiting our natural resources, which are regarded as our main  strength -- the agro-forestry branch, which is related to the  processing industry, hydroelectric power, and the mining  industry, being one example. Simultaneously, we have striven to  build and expand the infrastructure while developing human  resources with a view to increasing the average rate of economic  growth of the nation for the period from now to the year 2000  [words indistinct]. To achieve the said goal, the LPDR will  continue to promote and expand domestic potentials, securely  maintain political and social stability, and promote the  building of a market-oriented economy. At the same time, the  LPDR will broaden relations and cooperation with various  countries, first and foremost with neighboring countries. We  hope that more businessmen from Malaysia and other friendly  countries will invest in our Lao country to contribute toward  freeing the Lao people from a state of underdevelopment and  bringing about peace, (?stability), friendship, and cooperation  in this region.    On this auspicious occasion, I would like to convey to His  Majesty the Paramount Ruler of Malaysia my best wishes for his  happiness and long life. I wish H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan,  president of the LPDR, good health. I wish H.E. Mahathir bin  Mohamed and his wife good health. I wish all the distinguished  guests here good health. May the friendship and cooperation  between Laos and Malaysia be increasingly strengthened and  fruitfully developed! [end recording]    Afterwards, H.E. Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamed, prime minister of  Mlaysia, delivered a speech of reply. He said: We are very  pleased to visit Laos amid the the Lao people's traditional new  year festival celebrations. On this traditional new year  occasion, we wish H.E. Khamtai Siphandon and wife, together with  the government and people of Laos, great success and good  health. We are touched by the friendly welcome accorded us by  the Lao people. Though our visit is short, it will be forever  engraved on our hearts.    On the occasion of your excellency's visit to our country in  December 1992, we had an opportunity to exchange views on many  issues. In fact, our friendly relations have been promoted and  developed since then. Our friendship has also been increasingly  consolidated and promoted to the extent that we believe it  should noe be expanded in the area of cooperation. For this  reason, I have accepted the invitation of your excellency and  the Lao Government to pay the official visit to Laos.    Your excellency, though this is my first visit to Laos, it  is  considered a very significant event as it is the first visit by  the Malaysian prime minister to this country. Our delegation  comprises senior ministers, high-ranking officials, and  personages from our business circles. I hope that these  personages will gain a better understand of the Lao situation so  that mutual understanding between our two nations can be  promoted. We witnessed the signing of an agreement between the  two central banks on the payment issue, an agreement which is  considered an important document serving as a basis for the  promotion and expansion of the friendly relations and the  exchange of goods and trade between our two countries. Our  Malaysian companies and businessmen, being confident in the fine  line and policy of the Lao Government, intend to invest and run  businesses in Laos. We -- Malaysia and Laos -- have the same  intention of promoting and expanding relations and cooperation  with each other. As for Malaysia, we stick firmly to the policy  of promoting and expanding south-south cooperation. We maintain  that the building of a prosperous and civilized Laos will result  in building a prosperous and developed Southeast Asia region,  and that with a developed Southeast Asia, stability can be  maintained in the region. Our two countries maintain similar  tasks and responsibilities, namely, the promotion and  establishment of peace and stability. We have agreed with each  other that it is necessary for us to continue to positively  carry out our roles and responsibilities in order to [words  indistinct] and turn the entire region into a prosperous region  so as to guarantee the achievement of stability.    I would like to toast the good health, prosperity, and  happiness of H.E. Khamtai Siphandon and his wife; the good  health of H.E. the President of the LPDR; and the success of the  Lao people.</p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN TASTE MAKERS  </P> <P> Help! It's the '90s already and I counted 37 guys and four gals in "The  Eighties Taste Makers" (Dec. 24). Where are the women? Where are the women? Who  do our young girls aspire to be like? Whom can they look to for inspiration?  </P> <P> We'll have to wait (I guess) until the turn of the century to see perhaps  Sherry Lansing represented under the show-biz executives or Beth Henley or  Susan Seidelman under directors and writers or even Oprah Winfrey under  television or Sally Jesse Raphael under radio or TV.  </P> <P> NANCY PLUM, KLAC, Burbank  </P></p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Great expectations The London equity market's surge to new highs seems a knee-jerk response to renewed hopes of lower German interest rates and the rebound on Wall Street. Yet investors may be a touch too optimistic about the course of UK monetary policy. If one assumes that the chancellor is trying to rebuild his credibility, then his recent statements preclude an interest rate cut for some time. The Bank of England's clear hints that rates are low enough have boxed Mr Lamont in further. So any cut in Germany may not be followed in the UK. That would force sterling higher, weakening export prospects. Besides, the timing of German rate cuts is finely balanced. To distance itself from last weekend's G7 meeting, the Bundesbank may not cut rates this morning. Waiting until the next council meeting on the March 18 would leave the cut uncomfortably close to the French elections. Nor is it certain that any cut would be rapidly followed by others, given the uncertain German inflation outlook. Meanwhile, the British results season is proving no better than the rather poor advance expectations, and demands for rights issue money are likely to continue. While the Budget may not produce an interest rate cut, some fiscal tightening seems likely, with rumblings of more aggressive tax increases to come. The chancellor may try to surprise - and for once please - the markets with a PSBR total substantially lower than general expectations. That is thin support for an equity market facing a sluggish and patchy economic recovery.</p>

Shumeyko also told the deputies that the prime minister's  report on the formation of the budget for the current year is  being postponed.    Viktor Chernomyrdin may decide to amend some points in his  report in light of the president's address, the chairman of the  upper chamber explained. The majority of the deputies, however,  failed to support this idea, and insisted that Viktor  Chernomyrdin should speak this very week. According to the  decision adopted, the head of government must brief the deputies  on the cabinet's plans for the financial, taxation, budget,  agrarian, and industrial spheres.</p>

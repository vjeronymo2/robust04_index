			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 16 Jun (TANJUG) -- Iraq and Yugoslavia  today expressed their commitment -- during the hardships  currently faced by both countries -- to finding mutually useful  solutions for problems in their current cooperation and its  development, when the conditions for it are ripe.    This is a brief summary of the talks held in Baghdad this  afternoon between Milorad Unkovic, minister of the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia for economic relations with foreign  countries and Iraqi Trade Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih. This  meeting opened a several-day-long session of a joint  Yugoslav-Iraqi committee for economic and technical development.    The aim of the session is to review the cooperation so far  and establish the total outstanding claims of Yugoslav companies  in Iraq.    In addition to the federal Yugoslav minister, the talks are  being attended by FRY Deputy Foreign Minister Radoslav Bulajic,  and Jovan Kostic, the charge d'affaires of the FRY Embassy in  Baghdad, as well as a group of directors of large Yugoslav  companies whose firms have carried out work in Iraq.    The Yugoslav delegation is expected to hold talks with  senior  Iraqi economic and state leaders over the next few days.</p>

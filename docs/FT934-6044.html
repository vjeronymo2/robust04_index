			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Chloride recovers to Pounds 1.32m Chloride Group, the battery manufacturer which is transforming itself into an electronics group, returned to the black in the six months to end-September. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.32m, compared with a previous loss of Pounds 2.73m. Earnings per share were 0.1p (losses 1.6p), insufficient to resume the dividend, the company said. Mr Keith Hodgkinson, chief executive, yesterday described the result as 'a major step forward' for the group, which is going into the second half with a stronger order book than last year. The strategy would continue to be disposal of the batteries businesses in order to invest in the core electronics businesses. Total turnover rose by 14 per cent, from Pounds 45.4m to Pounds 51.8m. Discontinued operations accounted for Pounds 2.7m in both halves. The electronics division moved into the black with operating profits of Pounds 508,000 compared with a loss of Pounds 2.27m previously. Turnover climbed from Pounds 34.1m to Pounds 38.3m. The electronics products fall into three areas - uninterruptible power supplies for com-puters, emergency lighting, and power conversion. Mr Hodgkinson said sales of uninterruptible power supplies were 7 per cent ahead in the half. A new sales office in Thailand had doubled the order rate in south-east Asia. The power conversion operation in Rochester in the US had returned to profits, while losses had been reduced at the El Paso operation in Texas. The group sold two battery businesses in Kenya and one in Botswana during the first half. The sales of further businesses in central Africa and Egypt are being negotiated. Operating profits from the battery businesses were Pounds 1.16m (Pounds 604,000) on turnover of Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 8.6m).</p>

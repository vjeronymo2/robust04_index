			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 7 (XINHUA) -- The China National  Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) has worked out a new strategy  to build itself into an international conglomerate in the near  future.    A CNOOC official today revealed that under the new strategy  the corporation is to develop itself into an international  conglomerate with multinational oil companies as its backbone,  within a time span of five years.    The future conglomerate will also embrace a series of  solely-funded subordinates with limited responsibility and a  number of share-holding companies, he said.    This marks a big step for CNOOC, the only state firm in  charge of China's offshore oil and gas exploration and  development, to rid itself of the drawbacks of the planned  economy and get used to the fledgling market economy.    The official said CNOOC will continue to expand co-operation  with the outside world and seek more domestic investment in the  exploration and development of offshore oil and gas.    Meanwhile, he said, the corporation will speed up the  expansion of its overseas business and activities, adjust its  industrial structure and incorporate upstream and downstream  operations.    Multiplying the trades and the sources of investment will  surely speed up as well as upgrade the development of the  corporation, he asserted.    Founded in 1982, CNOOC has, over the past 13 years,  attracted  about 3.8 billion U.S. dollars in foreign investment and signed  94 contracts with 55 companies from 15 countries.    By the end of last year, the corporation, together with  foreign partners, had proved 1.2 billion tons of oil in place  and developed and built 11 oil and gas fields.    It is expected to produce 12 million tons of crude oil and  four billion cu m [cubic meters] of natural gas in 1997,  according to the estimation of experts.    However, CNOOC, which now has 12 subordinates, believes that  bank loans being the only source of investment has caused a  chronic short supply of exploration funding.    It also blamed the static industrial structure for the  corporation's incompetency in dealing with possible risks.    In addition, the changes in China's macro-economic climate,  with the reform of the systems of taxation, foreign exchange and  investment in particular, have weaned the company from most of  the state's preferential treatment it used to enjoy.    Wan Yan, president of CNOOC, said: "We must find a good way  out to complete the transition from the planned economic system  to the market economic system so that we are able to achieve new  and even greater developments, from a new starting point."</p>

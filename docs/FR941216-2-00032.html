			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One Federal agency representative commented that, contrary to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee's finding in its notice announcing the proposed addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placing the paints on the Procurement List would result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional reporting by the Federal Government. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee's finding, as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied to additional reporting requirements on small entities, not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the Federal Government. This same commenter challenged the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee's statement in its proposal notice that there are no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the JWOD Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objectives in connection with the tree marking paints. Since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter suggested no such alternatives and did not explain his  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusion, the Committee has no basis on which to determine that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some other alternative exists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of changes in the nonprofit agency's supply approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following the comment period, representatives of the three commenting paint firms and their trade association appeared before several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee members and staff prior to the preparation of a decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> package. At that meeting, they identified potential obstacles to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplying the nonprofit agency with paints or concentrates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Problems cited included liability risks for the paint firms since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they could not control the nonprofit agency's treatment of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paints during the packaging and distribution process, the complex  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nature of the paints, and the possibility that the approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed might result in flawed paints because they would have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be handled by a second entity prior to reaching the customer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One paint company representative questioned the ability of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonprofit agency to schedule shipments from the paint companies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the customer in a way that was consistent with the paints'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shelf-life requirements. Another representative expressed doubt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that her firm could compete with a paint or concentrate supplier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located in the same town as the nonprofit agency. All requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional time to explore the problems and opportunities associated with supplying the paints or concentrates to the nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee recognizes that the approach to be used by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonprofit agency differs from that currently being employed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paint companies, but is not persuaded by the evidence presented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the obstacles cited by the paint companies and their association are insurmountable. The Committee notes that working out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability responsibilities with suppliers is a normal business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process and that at least two of the four firms identified as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential suppliers of the paints or concentrates have not raised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the liability issue as a concern. Moreover, the nonprofit agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has indicated that the application of routine testing procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would identify responsibility for any problems with the paints,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thus eliminating the paint manufacturers' concerns that they would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be held liable for mistakes made by others. The Committee believes that these same testing procedures will assure that the products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received by Government customers meet Federal specifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to potential shelf-life problems, the Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that the nonprofit agency's record with other products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with shelf-lives, including paints and a first aid kit containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several medical items, demonstrates that the agency's quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control expertise is sufficient to prevent the shipment of paints  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without adequate shelf-lives. The Committee does not believe the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objection of one paint company to competing with a supplier in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonprofit agency's city is a sufficent reason for rejecting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed addition to the Procurement List. Location advantages and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disadvantages are present in all open market competition, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors often outweigh disadvantages associated with transportation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs. In this respect, the Committee notes that although the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other two firms have similar location disadvantages, neither has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raised this as an obstacle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the end of the appearance, the Committee gave the paint companies and trade association an opportunity to submit written versions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of their presentations, which they decided against doing. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Government agency which buys the paints needs to procure them  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately. In the absence of evidence that the Committee's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed approach would cause insurmountable problems in producing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the paint, the Committee has decided that no further delay in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adding the paints to the Procurement List is acceptable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW AND USEFUL: A FULL-SIZE BICYCLE THAT CAN BE FOLDED  </P> <P> Dissatisfied with conventional bicycles that are too cumbersome to transport  and folding bicycles that are too small, Harry Montague, a Washington, D.C.,  architect and cyclist, developed a first -- a full-size, all-terrain bicycle  that can be folded in half in seconds without tools.  </P> <P> His Montague BiFrame made its American and Canadian debut earlier this summer  and is available nationwide at more than 250 BiFrame dealers. It costs about  $500 and has an optional $125 water-resistant Cordura carrying or storage case.  When folded, the bike measures 3-by-3-by-1 1/4-feet.  </P> <P> "The BiFrame is a bicycle that folds, not a folding bicycle," said Montague's  son David, vice president of Montague Corp. "We designed a full-size bicycle  and then added a folding feature that doesn't alter the bike's appearance or  performance."  </P> <P> To fold the BiFrame, cyclists simply remove the front wheel, unlatch two  quick-release levers on the seat tube and swing the front half of the bike  around. The BiFrame weighs 29 pounds, comes in two frame sizes, 18 1/2 inches  and 20 1/2 inches, and has 18-speed index shifting and 26-inch wheels. It is  available in bright red or royal blue.  </P> <P> Although an all-terrain bicycle, the BiFrame is "an urban bike," David Montague  says, because it is easy to carry into an office and easy to store in an  apartment, condominium or dormitory. "And it's also easier to protect. There's  no need to lock it in a stairwell or to a parking meter."  </P> <P> Among Southern California shops selling the BiFrames are Bicycle Shack in  Studio City, Budget Bike in Los Angeles, Coates Schwinn in Pomona, Circle Cycle  in Torrance, Smith Cycle &amp; Key in Lomita, Newport Heights in Newport Beach,  Ocean Schwinn in Huntington Beach, Huntington Valley Schwinn in Fountain Valley  and Schwinn Plus in Tustin.  </P> <P> To find a store in your area that carries the BiFrame, contact Montague Corp.,  P.O. Box 1118, Cambridge, Mass. 02238; phone, (617) 491-7200.  </P> <P> Sun Shield for Babies  </P> <P> Parents concerned about their babies getting that hot summer sun in their faces  may be interested in Flap Hats, infant headgear specially designed to help  protect babies from sun and wind.  </P> <P> Laurie Lipson Snyder of Venice designed the little hat for her son, Cody,  because she got "frustrated looking for a hat that had all the elements to  really protect my fair-skinned baby from the sun." Her hat has an elongated  bill to keep bright sun out of a child's eyes and a "camel flap" in the back to  shade baby's neck and ears.  </P> <P> "It's perfect for the beach, backpacking, camping or anywhere under the sun,"  Snyder said. Flap Hats, fully lined in cotton, come in various colors and in  small (newborns-15 pounds), medium (13-22 pounds) and large (21-36 pounds).  They're available for $7.95, or in flannel or fleece for $9.95 or $10.95  respectively.  </P> <P> Flap Hats can be bought at Cousin's Children's Stores in Thousand Oaks, Culver  City, Sherman Oaks and Mission Hills; My New Friends in Santa Monica;  Kendrick's for Children in Torrance; Juvenile Shops in Los Angeles and Sherman  Oaks; Safe Baby in Studio City; Fred Segal Melrose in Los Angeles; and Sid's  Baby Furniture in Westchester. Or contact Flap Happy, 2322 Walnut Ave., Venice,  Calif. 90291. From Southern California call (213) 391-1316; outside this area,  call (800) 234-3527. LYNN SIMROSS  </P></p>

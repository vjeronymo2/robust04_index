They must coordinate their plans with, and operate under the direction of, each HUD Field Office within whose jurisdictions they are operating. When so directed by a Field Office, they will coordinate their activities instead through a lead TA provider or other organization designated by the Field Office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If selected as the lead TA provider in any Field Office jurisdiction, the awardee must coordinate the activities of other TA providers selected under this NOFA under the direction of the HUD Field Office.

TA providers are encouraged to make program grantees and TA recipients aware of the existence of the new section 3 regulations and their responsibilities under these regulations. Since section 3 applies to many of the program areas for which TA services are being provided, TA providers should encourage TA recipients to facilitate the employment of, and award of contracts to, low- and very low-income persons. Section 3 applies to housing construction, housing rehabilitation and other public construction activities. The new section 3 regulations issued under 24 CFR part 135 are expected to be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on or about June 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

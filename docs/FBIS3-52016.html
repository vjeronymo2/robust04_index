			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Budget Cuts Total $12 Billion"] </F>   [Text] The new version of the 1994 budget, announced  yesterday following a reformulation of the bill sent to Congress  in August, will result in federal spending cuts of $12 billion  compared to expenditures in 1993 and of $22 billion in  comparison with the original budget bill for 1994. The National  Treasury's revenues and expenditures will total $88.8 billion.  Raul Jungman, executive secretary of the Ministry of Planning,  points out that the bill will become effective only if approved  by Congress. "The congressmen share responsibility for  stabilizing the economy, and it will be up to them to say  whether we will have a balanced budget with no deficit." The  total budget, including debt rollovers, comes to $280 billion.    The tough budget bill says that the government will spend  only what it collects in 1994 and that public debt instruments  will be issued only to roll over the domestic and foreign  floating debt that already exists. According to economist Edmar  Bacha, special adviser to Minister of Finance Fernando Henrique  Cardoso, that budget balance is the foundation stone for  adoption of the second and third stages of the economic  stabilization program. Those stages call for adopting the URV  [Real Value Unit] and subsequently making it a strong currency.  "We are freeing ourselves of the need to use inflation and  corruption to balance the budget. We are exchanging those  instruments for negotiation, which is the only alternative we  have left, since the other choice would be dictatorship."    Surrealism--Bacha explained that in previous years, the  Executive Branch would send Congress an "unrealistic" budget and  get back a "surrealistic" law. Since it was impossible to  execute the expenditures called for in that law, the  administration would guarantee those expenditures, wait for  inflation to erode values, and make the money available. The  result of that game has been the increase in inflation.    In its budget revision, the government is working with real  interest rates of 15 percent for 1994, since there will be no  more indebtedness. That will help reduce debt service, which  should decline from $8.7 billion in 1993 to $7.7 billion in  1994. "That drop is feasible, since we will no longer have a  deficit of $22 billion to finance," says Bacha.  <H5>  Effort </H5>   However, the Legislative and Judicial Branches are not  making  the same effort as the Executive Branch to cut spending. The  Chamber of Deputies, the Senate, and the National Accounting  Office will receive about $305 million for investment and  operations in 1993 [as published]--51 percent more than their  probable actual spending level in 1993 (expenditures included in  the original 1993 budget or in supplemental budgets passed  during the year). The courts will receive $699.6 million, or 42  percent more than the $470 million they received in 1993. For  its part, the Executive Branch will receive $43.1 billion, or 17  percent less than the $52.1 billion received in 1993.    A number of ministries have been given special treatment,  however, examples being the military ministries (EMFA [Armed  Forces General Staff], Army, Navy, and Air), which will receive  $2.2 billion for operations and investment. That is an increase  of 48 percent over 1993 and the result of tough negotiating with  the economic area.  <H5>  Administration Expects To Collect $84 Billion </H5>   The administration expects to achieve record collections of  $84.6 billion in taxes, compulsory contributions, and fees in  1994. Those revenues, the largest in the country's history, will  consist of the following:    Import tax (II): This tax is imposed on Brazilian imports  and  will bring in $2.12 billion, or 0.47 percent of gross domestic  product (GDP), in 1994.    Industrialized products tax (IPI): The administration  expects  this tax to yield $10.94 billion, or 2.41 percent of GDP.    Income tax (on individuals and corporations): This is the  federal tax that brings in the most money. The administration  expects it to provide $17.54 billion, or 3.87 percent of GDP, in  1994.    Financial operations tax (IOF): Estimated IOF receipts for  1994 total $3.7 billion, or 0.82 percent of GDP.    Provisional tax on financial operations (IPMF): Collection  of  this tax will begin next Monday, with an expected yield in 1994  of $4.8 billion, or 1.06 percent of GDP. Some congressmen  believe that the administration is underestimating revenues from  this tax.    Social investment contribution (Cofins): Now that the  Federal  Supreme Court has ruled that the collection of Cofins is  constitutional, the administration expects it to yield $8.06  billion, or 1.78 percent of GDP. The administration has not  included in these revenues the money deposited in a Cofins  account with the courts by businessmen.    PIS [Social Integration Program]/Pasep [Government Employees  Welfare Fund] contribution: The administration expects to  collect $5.22 billion in PIS/Pasep contributions in 1994. That  is the equivalent of 1.1 percent of GDP.    Social contribution based on net profit: Revenues from this  contribution are expected to total $3.74 billion, or 0.83  percent of GDP.    Employers' and employees' social security contribution: Here  the administration estimates that revenues will total $20.6  billion, or 4.55 percent of GDP.    Government employees' social security contribution:  Government employees are expected to contribute $2.05 billion,  or 0.45 percent of GDP, in 1994.    Other (including supplemental port fees, military pensions,  contributions to the training wage, amounts due from the freight  supplement and modernization of the merchant marine, and so on):  Revenues from these taxes are estimated at $4.03 billion, or  0.89 percent of GDP.    Other revenues (including the contribution based on lottery  revenues): The administration expects to obtain $1.5 billion, or  0.35 percent of GDP, from this type of collection.  <H5>  Bill Predicts 4-Percent Rise in GDP </H5>   The administration is expecting GDP to be about 4 percent  higher in 1994 than in 1993. "Studies conducted by the  administration, backed by indications relative to the basic  parameters for projecting national accounts, suggest the  advisability of adopting a forecast to the effect that GDP in  1994 will increase by about 4 percent compared to 1993," the  administration has announced in a message sent to Congress with  the budget for 1994.    The message sent by President Itamar Franco regarding the  General Budget of the Union supports the economic team's  position that it is necessary "to restore normal operating  conditions in the Brazilian state so that it will be possible to  stabilize the economy and guarantee social justice." And for  that very reason, it says that the administration and various  segments of society must be prepared to carry out the difficult  task "of balancing the national accounts." "To do that,  decisions by the National Congress are essentially and  fundamentally necessary in order to provide the Executive Branch  with the tools making it possible to overcome the difficult  situation we find ourselves in today."    Wages--The administration also expects to spend 681 billion  cruzeiros, or 5.3 percent of GDP, on personnel expenditures and  charges (including both active and retired personnel). Those  projections, contained in the message sent to Congress along  with the budget bill for 1994, were made, the administration  says, in accordance with the prime rule that the government's  basic payroll in 1994 cannot exceed the 1993 payroll.    On the basis of its analysis of the current economic  situation and the macroeconomic scenario for 1994, the  administration announces in its budget bill that "the main  problem in the Brazilian economy continues to be inflation,  which, while not threatening to begin any rapid upward movement,  has been exhibiting remarkable resistance to a decline."    Prices--According to the administration, "the predominant  diagnosis of Brazilian inflation points to the fiscal crisis as  reflected in individual defensive postures by those responsible  for price formation, whose practices are affected basically by  their perceptions of the state's fiscal difficulties."    And it adds: "In that context, stabilization of the economy  presupposes implementation of a prior agreement aimed at  reversing people's expectations and establishment of the basic  preconditions for the desired economic stabilization." The  administration says in connection with its budget bill for 1994  that "as 1993 comes to a close, the Brazilian economy has been  continuing the recovery begun in September 1992."  <H5>  Ministries Most Affected </H5>   The Federal Government's budget for 1994 will include cuts  of  up to $12 billion compared to what was spent in 1993. About $8.7  billion of that will come out of the operating and investment  budgets of the ministries. Those most affected will be the  Ministries of Social Welfare and Regional Integration, whose  budgets will be cut by nearly 70 percent, and the Ministries of  Agriculture, Health, Education, and Mines and Energy, which have  lost an average of 40 percent of what they had in 1993.    The Ministry of Navy plans to spend nearly 300 percent more  than it did this year. The Judicial and Legislative Branches and  the Strategic Affairs Secretariat expect to spend 50 percent  more. The budget still has to be debated in Congress by the  congressmen, who are expected to submit amendments affecting the  amounts proposed by the Executive Branch.    The above figures are part of the Budget of the Union for  1994--one of the pillars of the Ministry of Finance's economic  adjustment program--and they were announced yesterday by Raul  Jungmann, executive secretary of the Ministry of Planning; Edmar  Bacha, special adviser to the Ministry of Finance; and Luis  Carlos Nerosky, secretary of federal budgets.    Deficit: The cuts announced today, added to the expected  increase in revenues, mean that the administration is  eliminating the $22 billion deficit included in the first budget  bill, which was sent to Congress in August.    A comparison of the funds allocated to the ministries in the  budget submitted in August with those in the final version  announced yesterday shows that the reductions are impressive:  nearly $20 billion. In fact, that figure represents the  difference between what the ministries wanted to spend and what  the economic team actually authorized.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff and Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] The Cabinet today agreed to accept the so-called  Greek compromise in the storm over European voting powers -- as  yet another crisis erupted for the Prime Minister.    John Major is making a Commons statement this afternoon amid  fierce denials by the Brussels-based European Commission that  Britain has been given guarantees about social policy  legislation as "sweeteners" for backing the votes plan.    This is expected to set the Commons ablaze with claims by  Tory Euro-sceptics that the Government has been duped by a  Commission which one backbencher branded today as "totally  untrustworthy."    The Cabinet reached agreement after a two-hour session this  morning -- the last meeting before the Easter holidays.    Employment Secretary David Hunt earlier indicated that  assurances emanating from Brussels overnight cleared the way for  Ministers to accept the compromise in a bid to end the storm.    But the claims by Mr Hunt -- and later confirmation by  Downing Street of "oral" guarantees -- were met with surprise  and puzzlement in Brussels.    [Ministers emerged from the Cabinet meeting smiling but  tight-lipped.    [The Prime Minister, celebrating his 51st birthday today,  will set out the Government's stance to the Commons, including  details of the guarantees said to have been received overnight.    [However, Euro-sceptics are already denouncing the  compromise  as a climbdown. Their disappointment is expected to turn to  fury when they hear that Brussels is denying any assurances were  given.    [It was effectively on the basis of these "assurances" that  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd recommended with confidence the  package he brought back from the European Union foreign  ministers' meeting in Greece over the weekend.    [The Commission was surprised by British claims that it had  given assurances of no more "back door" social policy under the  guise of health and safety.    [A spokesman said the talks between Britain, Commission  president Jacques Delors and Social Affairs Commissioner Padraig  Flynn had done nothing more than "remind" Ministers of the  situation.    [This is expected to fuel Euro-critics' suspicions that  Britain has been the victim of a sell-out.]</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A PIGLET TALE RECALLED  </P> <P> "This Little Piggy Can Come to Your House" by David Larsen (June 1) brought  back memories of more than half a century.  </P> <P> We had just finished building a house -- much with our own hands. It was north  of Foothill in Arcadia and we had two daughters, two horses, two dogs and two  cats.  </P> <P> My littlest daughter became very ill. Then one day a farmer friend brought her  a tiny runt piglet. It was like a miracle -- she was soon out and teaching it  tricks.  </P> <P> "Rusty" -- his coat was a rusty brown -- was soon housebroken, slept on her bed  and was as clean as could be and very quick to learn. He even met the school  bus every day.  </P> <P> Rusty grew slowly at first, but finally developed into a 500-pound porker and  we had to get rid of him.  </P> <P> CARL C. BRADFORD  </P> <P> Arcadia  </P></p>

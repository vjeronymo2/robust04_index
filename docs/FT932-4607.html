			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (18): The engine heats up - The Asia Pacific THE OFFICE of Mr Donald Schmidt, acting director for the Asia Pacific of the US Federal Aviation Administration looks out over the runways of Changi airport in Singapore. 'The growth of aviation in this part of the world is incredible,' he says. 'I've been here since 1988 and just by looking out the window, watching the increase in flights, I can tell how fast aviation is moving in this region. It's like an engine heating up.' The statistics support Mr Schmidt. There has been double-digit growth in airline traffic across the Asia Pacific in each of the past 20 years. The International Air Transport Association forecasts that passenger numbers in the region will double between now and the year 2000. The region will then account for nearly 40 per cent of worldwide passenger traffic and by 2010 that figure will be more than 50 per cent. Iata predicts that passenger traffic in south-east Asia will grow by more than 9 per cent in each of the next three years, compared to annual growth forecasts of 3.9 per cent in Europe and 5 per cent in North America. As passenger numbers have grown, so the whole focus of the aviation industry has shifted. By the year 2005 Boeing predicts that the Asia Pacific will surpass the US as the largest market for aircraft deliveries. Countries buying aircraft have been demanding more technology transfer and a greater share of aerospace manufacturing. The need for these 'offset' arrangements means aircraft manufacturers are basing increasing amounts of their component manufacturing in the region, both on the civil and military sides of the industry. But this is not the only factor behind the growth of the Asia Pacific aerospace industry: in many cases, particularly related to aircraft maintenance, the Asia Pacific is a better financial proposition. Last year United Airlines of the US purchased seven 747 200s from Qantas, the Australian carrier. United had the aircraft modified and serviced in Singapore rather than back in the US. 'Singapore has the facilities, a very competitive cost structure and a good reputation for doing the work on time,' says Mr Terry Waldo, United manager in Singapore. Some manufacturers have sought to form strategic alliances - such as the recent joint venture to manufacture regional jets announced between British Aerospace and the aerospace industry in Taiwan. Almost every country in the region has some form of aerospace industry: Airrod in Malaysia carries out work on US military aircraft and a growing number of other maintenance tasks. There is talk of possible technical collaboration between Malaysia and McDonnell Douglas. IPTN in Indonesia has, in a little over 10 years, reached a stage when it is now in the process of manufacturing its own turboprop jet, the N250. Meanwhile Singapore has built itself up into a regional maintenance centre. The industry grew, from the mid-1970s, out of the repair and maintenance of military aircraft. The facilities provided by Changi airport, consistently voted as the world's best, have encouraged local and foreign aerospace enterprises to develop. Nearly 50 companies in Singapore carry out a wide variety of maintenance, from complete 'nose jobs' on 747s to maintenance of some US air force fighter engines. While the bulk of Singapore's aerospace industry is concerned with repair and overhaul, various manufacturing processes are also being undertaken, from a Singapore-French-Chinese venture to design and manufacture a new light helicopter, to the building of cabin service carts. Dr Otis Chen is managing director of Turbine Overhaul Services, a joint venture between state-owned Singapore Technologies and United Technologies/Pratt &amp; Whitney. TOS employs 300 people repairing and upgrading aircraft jet engine turbine blades and vanes. 'This industry is a truly global one,' says Dr Chen. 'We're like a garage, with components coming in from anywhere in the world. It's evolving fast and you have to constantly upgrade to accommodate new technologies. 'At our end of the business we don't feel the draught from the troubles of the airline industry. We're working at full pitch and contemplating expanding. People are still flying, engines still have to be overhauled.' Tax incentives to high tech industries make Singapore attractive. The government provides a wide range of back-up services. But even in a region which is experiencing flyaway growth, the aerospace industry is highly competitive. Singapore has to work hard to maintain its position against other fast-developing regional centres where labour costs are often considerably lower. There are problems of labour shortages and an insufficient supply of highly trained engineers. China, viewed as an potential vast aerospace market, is a distance from Singapore. Significantly, Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering recently announced plans to move certain heavy overhaul facilities to China, both to tap into a low-cost labour market and to develop its China business. 'The aerospace industry in this region is on a very steep growth curve,' says Mr Schmidt of the FAA. 'If Asia Pacific governments can standardise their aerospace regulations and co-ordinate their traffic control systems, it will keep on expanding. There is enormous potential out here.'</p>

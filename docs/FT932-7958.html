			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / UN considers deploying Bosnia border monitors THE United Nations Security Council is considering a proposal to deploy some 500 international military observers at dozens of checkpoints on the Yugoslav-Bosnian border to monitor Belgrade's compliance with its promise to halt arms supplies to Bosnia. The resolution, sponsored by Russia and EC members Britain, France and Spain, is also expected to win US backing, albeit unenthusiastic. The US rift with the Europeans on Balkan policy remains acute. The secretary general's staff are already making contingency arrangements for deploying the observers at some 50 checkpoints, although the plan will have to be presented first to the Council. Their main task would be to ensure that President Slobodan Milosevic fulfils his promise to put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen peace plan by cutting off vital supplies. Mr Milosevic has called for a similar international observer team on the Bosnian-Croatian border to halt arms shipments to the Bosnian Croats. The resolution asks for recommendations by the secretary general on this question. Two other resolutions dealing with the Balkan crisis are also being considered. One, to establish formally an 11-member international war crimes tribunal, has run into juridical problems. These were still being ironed out last night. The other is a proposal that would have Russian troops join the mainly western European international force in Bosnia under a plan that would add about 3,000 soldiers to that operation. Laura Silber adds from Belgrade: Fresh clashes erupted yesterday in northern and central Bosnia, in spite of pledges of peace by Serb and Croat leaders. At least two people were killed and nine wounded in sniper and mortar attacks on Sarajevo, reported Bosnian radio. Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency, said Grbavica, the Serb-held district of Sarajevo, came under a heavy mortar attack for the second straight day.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, as every Monday, pickets stood outside the  Russian naval headquarters building in Tallinn. Member of the  Swedish Riksdag, Peter Luksep, speaking from the picket line,  said that the presence of Russian troops in Estonia is not an  issue for Estonia and Russia alone. The presence of Russian  troops in Estonia concerns democracy in Europe as a whole.    Reet Tobre, chairwoman of the Petserimaa Association, said  in  her speech that during the last few weeks Russian border guards  have detained several Estonians who were visiting their  relatives in the Russian side. They were accused of violating  the regulations on the Estonian-Russian line of control.    Tunne Kelame said that the Estonian National Independence  Party faction in the Riigikogu has presented the Riigikogu with  a draft law on restoring Petserimaa district to Estonia..    Every Monday pickets stand outside the Russian naval  headquarters building demanding an unconditional withdrawal of  the Russian Army from Estonia by 31 August. The pickets are  organized by the Estonian National Independence Party.</p>

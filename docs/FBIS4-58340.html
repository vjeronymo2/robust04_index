			<p>BFN     [Text] Mashad, Khorasan Prov., May 1, IRNA -- Some 300,000  Afghan refugees residing in Iran will return home this year  under a program worked out by a commission consisting of  representatives of Iran, Afghanistan and the U.N. High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).    According to the director general in charge of foreign  nationals and immigration affairs at the Interior Ministry Ahmad  Husseini, the repatriation of the refugees is to start from June  22.    Husseini recently visited the Afghan province of Harat along  with other members of the commission to inspect the status of  Afghan refugees who have returned home.    He told reporters here Saturday that the outcome of a plan  concerning the repatriation of 850,000 refugees last year and  their integration into Afghan society was satisfactory.    He emphasized that the Afghan refugees who have returned  home  have played a key role in the reconstruction of their country  mainly due to their theoretical and practical skills.    In response to the request of the Islamic Government of  Afghanistan, Iran has issued six month long residence permits  for some 540,000 refugees who are living in Iran without having  identification cards, Husseini added.    He stressed that during his stay in Harat he announced the  Interior Ministry's readiness to set up camps inside Afghan  territory for accomodation of refugees in emergency cases.</p>

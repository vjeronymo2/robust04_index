Protection Force in the former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR),  Yasushi Akashi, said in Sarajevo on Monday following his meeting  with the president of the Bosnian Serb republic, Radovan  Karadzic, he was "very satisfied with the constructiveness the  Serb side manifested during the talks."    Akashi said he had been assured by Karadzic that  humanitarian  convoys will travel safely and freely through the territory  controlled by the Serbs.    "We highly value the good cooperation with U.N.  representatives," Karadzic said after the talks and added that  the Serb side had informed Akashi about its "willingness to  place Sarajevo under a U.N. protectorate under certain  conditions," those being that peace be restored immediately.    Karadzic underscored the readiness of the Serb side to  cooperate with U.N. representatives in order for Sarajevo  airport and its vicinity to be used for humanitarian purposes.    The readiness to place Sarajevo under a U.N. protectorate  was  recently expressed by representatives of the Bosnian Serb  republic during talks with the two co-chairmen of the  international conference on the former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen and  Thorvald Stoltenberg, in Belgrade.    Humanitarian convoys have for some time now been  unhinderedly  crossing the territory controlled by Bosnian Serbs and the Serb  side has handed over Sarajevo airport to UNPROFOR to make  possible unhindered humanitarian flights for the former Yugoslav  republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina ravaged by civil war.</p>

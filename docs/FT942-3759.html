			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Amstrad enters direct PC sales with Pounds 60m purchase Amstrad, the UK-based consumer electronics group run by Mr Alan Sugar, has agreed to pay around Pounds 60m (Dollars 91m) in cash to acquire Viglen, a private company which builds and sells personal computers directly to its customers. The deal marks a change in direction for Amstrad which has seen its own PC sales and profits tumble in the face of growing competition. Mr Sugar, Amstrad's chairman and founder, said the acquisition would add 'an exciting new dimension' to the group's businesses. Amstrad's shares closed up 1/4p at 31 3/4p. Viglen ranks about third in the UK direct PC sales arena with about 7 per cent of a market which last year accounted for about one third of all PC sales. The group posted pre-tax profits before directors' emoluments and exceptional items of Pounds 9m in the year to March 31, from Pounds 7.9m, on turnover of Pounds 72m, up 33 per cent. Mr Sugar said gross margins at Viglen were around 25 per cent. Amstrad is acquiring assets worth Pounds 13.6m. Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to Amstrad shareholder approval, the group will pay Pounds 30m in cash initially and a further Pounds 30m over the next three years subject to Viglen's profitability. If Viglen's profits exceed Pounds 27m over the first three years the vendors  -five members of Viglen's management team - will receive a share of the additional profits. Amstrad will finance the acquisition using part of its cash reserves. Mr Sugar said Viglen will continue to operate as 'an autonomous unit' within his group and will maintain its management structure, selling methods, products and customer service. The senior management team is being 'locked in' with new contracts for a minimum of 42 months. Mr Sugar said the Viglen acquisition would provide a new source of profits and growth for the group and the price represented a price/earnings multiple of 10. 'The acquisition provides Amstrad with the opportunity to purchase a fast-growing business which both complements and strengthen's Amstrad's existing business,' he said. Mr Sugar originally ap-proached Viglen in October and shareholders had been persuaded that a sale to Amstrad was a better alternative to a flotation. Mr Sugar said the sale would enable Viglen to expand its production facilities and accelerate order delivery schedules. Details, Page 31; Lex, Page 24</p>

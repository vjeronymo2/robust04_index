			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Japanese Bonds: Yields reach six-year low after investors switch out of shares THE CONFUSION surrounding the listing of East Japan Railway and the consequent fall in Japanese shares were good news for bond traders, as the No 145 10-year benchmark yield fell to a six-year low of 3.44 per cent last week supported by investors opting for bonds rather than stocks. Pessimism on the Japanese economy was also fuelled by the failure of Muramoto Construction, the largest bankruptcy in post-war history, and a spate of weak corporate earnings reports. The rally in Japanese government bonds is likely to receive further support in the near term from bleak corporate interim results and a further deterioration in confidence among stock-market investors. The Bank of Japan is expected to allow short-term interest rates to remain low to support share prices but profit-taking by investors looking to cover losses on stock holdings may hamper a sharp rise in bond prices. About 240 companies are scheduled to release half-year results this week, including leading steel companies and video game makers. The results are likely to confirm the bleak outlook on corporate profits. Ms Tomoko Fujii, an economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo believes such factors will support the bond market and expects the benchmark yield to fall a further 10 basis points in the near term. Meanwhile, this week's negotiations over political reform between Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, and opposition parties will be crucial to the passing of the reform bill in parliament. A large income tax cut is expected, aimed at helping to pull the Japanese economy out of recession. However, until the opposition parties and the government can come to an agreement over the political reform bill, Mr Hosokawa will not be able to make a decision over further fiscal stimulus. Economists point out that a tax cut of more than Y5,000bn will help the economy recover and may prompt profit-taking by bond traders. Mr Geoffrey Barker of Baring Securities in Tokyo is urging investors to take profits because he believes that factors such as the strong yen and the surge in the US Treasury market, which have supported the recent rally, are likely to disappear in the near future.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Personal View: How to mend the labour market With unemployment in the UK nearing 3m it is time for a fundamental re-think of policy. For we now know that high unemployment is not a temporary problem. It is a permanent scar on Britain's present economic structures. Since 1986 the number of people out of work has averaged 2.4m. Inflation now is the same as in 1986, so this means that, as things are, the government cannot control inflation with fewer then 2.4m unemployed. That is the horrible truth that needs addressing. First, a policy is needed which will prevent long-term unemployment (of more than one year). On most evidence long-term unemployment does nothing to prevent inflationary wage pressures, so it is a total waste. The long-term unemployed cease to be part of the effective supply of labour since they become of no interest to employers. This imposes a huge cost on taxpayers and companies, as well as on the unemployed themselves. Unemployment now costs the economy roughly Pounds 60bn, of which Pounds 24bn is borne by taxpayers, Pounds 12bn by lost profits and Pounds 24bn by the unemployed. Long-term unemployment accounts for about a third of the total. To prevent long-term unemployment requires adopting an 'active labour market policy' of the kind recommended by the OECD and practised in Sweden, even by its new Conservative government. The principle is that, if people want to work, they should be helped to be employable. And no one should be left to rot in idleness for more than a year with no offer of useful work. An active labour market policy for Britain would have the following elements: Job Centres would provide for each unemployed person a personal placement officer, who would ensure that every client received training or a job offer within a year. Training would be of better quality than at present (Sweden spends the same on an unemployed trainee as on a university student). If a person gets no offer of regular work within a year, he or she must be offered temporary work. This should be with a regular employer and be paid at the standard hourly rate for the job. A low-quality 'workfare' scheme, where workers get benefit 'plus', would be a real mistake. Workers need the self-respect which goes with a normal job paid at the normal rate. If funds are stretched, the job could in the last resort be part-time. There is little point keeping people off the unemployment register if they are doing nothing useful. Poor-quality schemes are unlikely to be justified. What is done now should be part of a long-term plan, constructing a system which will prevent long-term unemployment. Details of such a plan have been outlined in a pamphlet by John Philpott and myself*. International evidence suggests that such a system could reduce Britain's unemployment permanently by about 0.75m. In due course it would pay for itself through lower benefits and higher tax receipts. A complete system could not be fully in place much before 2000. But now is the time to start. The proposed 250,000 temporary jobs should be a step on the way. Second, a rethink on youth training is needed. At least two-thirds of British workers have no professional or vocational qualification - compared with only a quarter in Germany. No wonder so many find it difficult to get jobs. If Britain follows the German example it should: finance all vocational education and training from collective sources (taxes or levies); require that all young people in employment are employed as trainees, with at least one day a week off-the-job training. Improving the quality of labour will do much to reduce inflationary pressures. But, point three, Britain must also improve its anarchic system of wage determination. As soon as there is a recovery, wage settlements will rise again, as they did after 1986. The country will be into the same old cycle. Business, in its own interest, should deal with this problem by contriving a more co-ordinated approach to wage determination, analogous to Germany's. But this will not happen without government encouragement. In this connection everyone in Britain should be watching Germany, to see how it handles infinitely greater problems than Britain has ever had to face. You can be sure that western Germany will control its inflation with fewer than 3m unemployed. So should Britain.

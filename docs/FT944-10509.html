			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Deutsche Bank's motley crew - A different kind of corporate advertising by Germany's biggest bank Put together a theologian, a car company executive, a trade unionist, a former government minister and a couple of professors and what do you have? A motley collection, some would say, but for Deutsche Bank they have a common link. To Germany's largest bank, this is a group of people who can help polish its image after a year of hard knocks. From Sunday, it will run a series of heavyweight advertisements in German newspapers where these individuals' views on work and society in an uncertain future will be comprehensively presented. The bank will scarcely be mentioned, although its name and line-in-a-box logo will be printed at the foot of the articles. Why is the bank doing this? Clearly, an image-burnishing campaign would not go amiss at the end of a year in which it has featured uncomfortably in the spotlight. First, its role as shareholder and creditor of Metallgesellschaft, which made heavy losses on US oil futures trading, was highlighted. Then came Jurgen Schneider's collapsing property empire, to which the bank was a significant lender, followed by his disappearance. Banks in general have been criticised for being too inattentive to customers' needs. But the current campaign, masterminded by Abels &amp; Grey, a self-styled corporate mission agency in Dusseldorf, is not like the usual burst of promotions. The latest run of advertisements has more to do with broad social and philosophical issues, although the agency does plan an image campaign along more usual lines next month. Such a concept-oriented approach in advertising is novel. Horizont, the German marketing weekly, says the campaign 'breaks through the accepted boundaries of institutional communication'. Its theme is Work of the Future  -the Future of Work; the articles are somewhat daunting two-page reprints of speeches on the subject by Hans Kung, a controversial Catholic theologian, Heinz Riesenhuber, former research minister, Wolfgang Reitzle, BMW's development director, Walter Riester, deputy head of the IG Metall trade union, and two professors from Constance and Bonn. The speeches were given at a conference of the Alfred Herrhausen Society, formed in memory of the bank's former chairman, killed by terrorists five years ago. This week the bank has run 60-second television commercials foreshadowing the campaign against a background of job uncertainty. According to Horizont; 'No large German company, and certainly none of the big banks, has dealt with such social themes in a way that is so public and so removed from its own business'. It calls the bank's action 'courageous' but says it also carries a high risk, especially since each article would be prefaced by the words: 'Deutsche Bank - we support the future.' This would be a yardstick by which the bank would be measured. Deutsche Bank accepts this risk. 'We are under the gaze of the public,' writes Hilmar Kopper, the chairman, in Forum, its house magazine. 'As one of the leading corporations in Germany, we are quite obviously involved in many social activities which go beyond the purely commercial.' By this, he means the bank's responsibilities as an employer and member of the community, supporting environmental research and helping the disabled. It is this 'other side' that the bank wants to bring more into the open. Kopper says Deutsche Bank's 'traditional reticence' about the wider aspect of its activities had led to 'a certain one-sidedness' in the public's view. In future, it would provide more information about how it fulfilled its social responsibilities. Horizont hopes more companies will follow suit. No doubt, they will await the response to Deutsche Bank's campaign first.</p>

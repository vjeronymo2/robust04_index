			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Late bet placed on the big numbers game: The likely winners and losers from the proposal for a national lottery THE surprise about yesterday's proposal from the government to launch a national lottery is that it has not come sooner. Britons gamble about Pounds 240 each a year, more per head than most other nations. But the UK is the only country in Europe without a lottery - even Albania has succumbed to the temptation of big prizes for a small outlay. The principle of lottery financing in the UK is not new, but the last lottery ended in 1826 following allegations of fraud and malpractice and the growth of illegal betting. Lotteries in other countries have gone from strength to strength. The biggest spenders are Americans, where 90m punters splash out Pounds 12bn a year, with a staggering Pounds 5.5bn returned in prize money. Most states have a lottery, with California and Florida running the biggest. Some states have found that the initial enthusiasm wears off, however, and ticket sales can start to fall. The biggest national lottery in Europe is in Spain, where customers spend Pounds 3.4bn each year on tickets - Pounds 64 per head of population. The Christmas payout - known as El Gordo, the fat one  - has reached Pounds 115m and is a national event. In Britain the government believes that a single national lottery, which could be launched in 1994, should raise about Pounds 1bn a year for sports, the arts, heritage and charities. A third of money from ticket sales would probably go to these causes, and 15 per cent would be deducted for administration, including advertising and promotion. The remainder would go in taxes and prizes of up to Pounds 1m. What remains unclear is who the winners from the introduction of a lottery will be - apart from the direct beneficiaries  - and who will stand to lose most. The uncertainty stems from differing views on whether lottery stake money would be syphoned from other forms of gambling, or whether it would be additional cash staked on the long-odds chance of winning a fortune. The most obvious losers, and the most vocal opponents of a national lottery, are football pools promoters, which fear their businesses will be damaged beyond repair with big job losses, particularly in Liverpool. Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters employ more than 6,500 and a further 70,000 as part-time collectors. The companies' anxieties stem from the fact that the French national lottery, for example, is run by 400 people. Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, said yesterday there was no evidence that the pools would be badly affected, but if they were 'there are measures we could take to change existing controls'. He also suggested that pools promoters form a consortium to bid for the franchise to run the lottery, a course which could also be followed by bookmakers or versely affected. Last year the pools promoters headed off the threat of a national lottery in a secret deal with the Treasury, the department most opposed to a lottery because of the potential loss of other gambling taxes. In return for a 2.5 per cent reduction in pools betting tax, the companies agreed to contribute Pounds 40m a year to the Foundation for Sport and Art, which makes grants to more than 100 sports bodies and arts organisations. Objections from opponents have been overwhelmed by the perceived political attractions of a lottery, and by the prospect of continental European lottery tickets - at present illegal  - flooding into the UK with the introduction of the single market next year. Other big losers could be promoters of charity lotteries - there were 855 in 1990-91, generating nearly Pounds 15m - and the government intends to consult charities before framing legislation. The Arts Council said it was delighted that the lottery had been given the go-ahead, and the Sports Council said it was 'tremendous news' for sport. There is certain to be criticism of the proposal from church leaders and others on the moral implications. Research from every country with a national lottery - most recently the Republic of Ireland - shows that poorer sections of the community stake a higher share of disposable income than the better-off.  ----------------------------------------    GOVERNMENT TAX TAKE FROM GAMBLING  ---------------------------------------- 1990-91            (m pounds) Bookmaking           479.0 Football pools       303.9 Casinos               57.4 Gaming machines       98.7 Bingo                 67.4 Total              1,006.4  ---------------------------------------- Source: Inland Revenue  ----------------------------------------</p>

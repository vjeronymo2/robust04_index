			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gay Bekhor, 'Amira Hess, and news agencies] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Dr. Zakariya al-Agha, head of  Fatah in the Gaza Strip, expressed his sorrow yesterday over the  attack in 'Afula. "We regret the death of every innocent  person, be he a Jew, a Christian, or a Muslim. We hope such  deeds will stop as soon as the peace process succeeds."    [HA'ARETZ] Do you not consider it an attempt on the part of  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] to sabotage the peace  process? Hamas has claimed responsibility for the attack.    [Al-Agha] We heard about it on Israel Radio, but I do not  know exactly who perpetrated the deed or is responsible for it.  After all, it was also reported that the Islamic Jihad claimed  responsibility for it. Anybody can claim responsibility.    [HA'ARETZ] Was it not a message to Fatah by the opponents of  the agreement with Israel?    [Al-Agha] Our objections and denunciations notwithstanding,  the attack came in the wake of the Hebron massacre and was to be  expected. When people start feeling a change in the field,  there will be no such deeds.    [HA'ARETZ] But this will have no effect on people who object  to such actions.    [Al-Agha] Any such attack, be it in Hebron or in 'Afula, is  meant to harm the peace process. There are opponents on both  sides. Support for the agreement will grow, however, and the  opponents will be pushed to the sidelines when results are  evident.    Attorney Furayh Abu-Middayn, formerly a member of the  Palestinian delegation to the Madrid and Washington talks, also  does not consider the attack a direct message against Fatah and  the path it has chosen. "It was to be expected. The Hebron  massacre was a turning point, and the attack yesterday was an  act of revenge. Reports that thousands of Israelis consider  Barukh Goldstein a hero increased the pain."    The negotiating process, Abu-Middayn said, has brought the  Palestinians prolonged humiliation and has led them to the  realization that it is not a fair agreement. "This is the time  for talks about a permanent arrangement based on UN Resolutions  242 and 338, which recognize the national rights of the  Palestinians, if they want to prevent what happened in 'Afula  and what will happen tomorrow elsewhere."    Abu-Middayn added that the Americans and the French were  driven out of Lebanon in the same way. "Admittedly, the attack  did not take place in the occupied territories, but Israel  should expect the unexpectable," he said.    [Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR in Hebrew on 7 April carries a  report  by Pe'erli Shahar on page 4, adding that Jad Ishaq, the PLO  representative to the multilateral talks on the environment  currently being held in The Hague, last night "expressed his  regret over the terrorist incident in 'Afula and the loss of  human life in tragic events in the region."]</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Elections boost lira The Italian lira moved safely above last week's lows in European trading yesterday, as markets reacted well to the news that left wing alliances won control of Italy's main cities in the second round of voting in local elections, writes Emma Tucker. For most of the day the currency was steady at L991.60 against the D-Mark, closing moderately firmer at L989.8 compared with Friday's L995.3. Last week the lira dropped as low as L1,000 to the D-Mark, but foreign exchange dealers said the local election results, which suggested that Italy's political extremists had been held in check, had allowed the currency to regain some strength. In a letter to the Italian Treasury yesterday, the International Monetary Fund said the lira could recoup some of its recent depreciation once the political situation becomes clearer. 'The decline of the lira since September 1992 has clearly gone beyond that deemed appropriate by the authorities,' the IMF said in its letter. It added that Italy's progress towards European Monetary Union should 'take place mostly through a nominal appreciation of the lira from the current lows . . . rather than through an inflation differential'. Italian government bond futures also took heart from the election results, which were widely interpreted as a signal of greater political stability. The December contract ended almost 1 1/2 points up. Still basking in the wake of Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget, the pound ended only mildly down from Friday's close, although early trading saw it push briefly through the DM2.5600 level. Many analysts said sterling was unlikely to be able to move much higher than this as the market is looking for another reduction in UK interest rates, and the higher the pound goes, the sooner the cut is likely to come. Mr Jonathan Hoffman at Credit Suisse First Boston said the markets believed a further cut could come within the next two weeks. 'The RPI figures next week could be the trigger,' he added. 'I think that people sense that if the pound becomes too strong the government will cut rates sooner rather than later.' Mr Tony Norfield of ABN Amro Bank believes the pound will have hit DM2.5700 by the end of the week. The pound closed in London at DM2.5575, down  3/4 pfennig from last week's finish. On the UK money markets, the three-month interbank rate eased slightly as dealers continued to look for further UK monetary relaxation. On the offered side, it dipped to 5 1/4 per cent from Friday's 5 5/16 per cent. Mr Norfield said that although people were adopting the view that interest rates would soon come down, the market has yet to fully reflect the extent of the expected reductions. 'Short sterling has been quite buoyant and I think people will soon start buying contracts for the middle of 1994,' he said. The short sterling March contract moved as high as 94.98 in fairly busy trading to discount base rates of just above 5 per cent by the beginning of the spring. It closed at roughly 94.96, marginally ahead of the opening. The Bank of England removed a Pounds 1.15bn shortage easily, offering no late assistance. German call money rates were little changed from Friday and market liquidity remained ample as banks waited for this week's repo funds, allocated tomorrow, before building reserves. Call money changed hands at 6.23 per cent, but the rate is expected to drop to 6 per cent either tomorrow or on Thursday, after the repo funds have been allocated. The Bundesbank announced after its council meeting last Thursday that the next five two-week repo tenders would be at a fixed rate of 6 per cent after last week's 6.25 per cent pact. The Bank of Portugal cut its regular money market intervention rates by  1/8 percentage point to 10.125 per cent for draining liquidity and 11.125 per cent for injecting funds at the start of a new seven-day accounting period for commercial bank cash reserves. The central bank emergency lending rate for Es100bn of one-day funds to resident banks was at an unchanged 12 per cent. Last week it mopped up liquidity at 10.00 per cent and injected funds at 11.5 per cent in mid-period interventions at which rates are normally less favourable for commercial banks. The dollar was weaker against the D-Mark in late European trading, although it recovered from a fall through the closely watched DM1.7050 level. Price swings were exaggerated by thin volumes of trading, and many dealers believe the currency will be range-bound this week, which contains relatively little US economic news. The focus for the currency will be producer price and consumer price inflation figures due on Thursday and Friday respectively. The dollar ended in London at DM1.7060, compared with a four-month high reached on Friday - after encouraging jobless data - of DM1.7295 and the close on Friday of DM1.7205. In New York yesterday it finished at DM1.7013. Once again the French franc nudged its former exchange rate mechanism floor of FFr3.4305 per D-Mark, buoyed by the prospect of a deal on Gatt. It closed in London at FFr3.434, up marginally from Friday's close of FFr3.437.</p>

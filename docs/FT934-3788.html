			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (4): Over-sophistication can be a headache - Commercial buildings The shiny new building was quiet and cold. 'I'll get some tea to warm you up,' said the chief executive. That was cold too. He could not raise the heating: 'Sorry. The computer controls all that.' The remote brain also kept lights blazing on the deserted floor because scanners detected us sitting in the corner. The electricity bill must have been frightening. Ten minutes later - probably around the time the lights automatically winked out - in a cosy basement office sipping hot tea before a pulsating fan heater, the building services manager quoted a figure resembling the debt of a small South American nation. He also listed the reasons. The air-conditioning was too powerful and the lighting controls too inflexible. He had secretly turned down the heating and wanted to do something more radical but could not convince the board. These two executives - happy to talk if guaranteed anonymity - reveal deep-seated problems now coming under serious attack. Firstly, it is not just old and draughty premises that have swollen the total energy bill for buildings to more than Pounds 20bn a year. Perhaps more disturbing, there is plenty of expertise to cut these costs by as much as half but the message often does not reach decision-makers. A generation of new office blocks were seriously over-specified in the rush to cater for new technology, particularly in central London. Air-conditioning constitutes as much as a fifth of running costs, so it must run efficiently. Yet designers created systems with as much as five times the capacity required, according to Mr Peter Hill of the Building Research Energy Conservation Support Unit (Brecsu). 'So often in the past, true heat gain from office equipment has not been calculated,' he says in a study presented to CLIMA 2000, the international energy and environment convention held in London this month. A study of computers, printers and copiers found some create as little as a tenth of the energy output rated by manufacturers. And that is when they are switched on. More than 10 per cent of engineers, for instance, never touch a terminal and a third are only intermittent users, so calculating heat per head of staff can be wildly inaccurate. Lower building specifications are now being proposed but with so little development taking place, progress is hard to assess. Change could be enforced from above within a couple of years as consultation drafts for the next round of building regulations show heavy bias against air-conditioning. This caused a small earthquake in the property industry, however, leading to a second round of talks. Critics insist that some occupiers demand air-conditioning, particularly among the fumes and pollution of cities like London, and without them, certain buildings would not be viable investments because the rents would be too low. 'The overriding problem is educating developers and occupiers,' says Mr David Lush, president of the Chartered Institution of Building Service Engineers. He believes energy-saving will not become a major force until tenants routinely ask how much a building costs to run. At the moment that does not happen, according to Mr Peter Mantle of property consultants Jones Lang Wootton. They bundle this up with overall occupation costs. A standard for measuring efficiency posted as a label on each building would nudge potential tenants in the right direction, says Mr Lush. The CIBSE is now working out a system for inclusion in the regulations, although this might not be effective until the end of the decade. Meanwhile, the Building Research Establishment is making the running, claiming to have covered around a quarter of new office buildings since 1990 with its Environmental Assessment Method (Breeam). This goes beyond energy-efficiency, including factors such as pollution and recycled materials and was extended to cover new industrial units this month. It could attack the fundamental problem that construction and the production and transport of materials consumes almost as much energy as a building will use in its lifetime. Doxford International business park on Tyneside was the first scheme awarded the more stringent Breeam certificate earlier this year and is 90 per cent let within six months of completion. Mr Trevor Silver of Akeler Holdings, the developer, says that while high ratings might not clinch deals, with so much space on the market they block them. Investors also realise that 'greenness' will have a significant impact on property values by the end of the decade, so they must prepare the way now. Legal &amp; General, one of the country's top landlords, has been operating along these lines for the last couple of years. Existing buildings provide the biggest challenge. Anthony Beattie of Jones Lang Wootton, one of the specialists making Breeam inspections, says many companies have put such considerations on the back-burner during the recession but tenants are gradually pressing landlords to identify energy-saving improvements. 'Meanwhile, a vast amount of second-hand space is virtually unlettable unless refurbished,' says Mr Beattie. 'That would be the ideal time to raise energy-efficiency. In fact, it will probably be essential.' Some large owner-occupiers are already taking stock. Mr David Hatch, adviser to the BBC, gave a commitment at this year's relaunch of Breeam that all the corporation's major buildings would be assessed. London Transport has made a similar pledge. This will not demand the sort of wizardry often put forward for futuristic new energy-saving buildings, however. 'The technology has been there all the time,' says Mr Ted Nicklin. His firm of architects and engineers, Ryder Nicklin, transformed the Vickers tank plant in Newcastle more than 10 years ago, installing draught-proofing, integrated energy controls and low-energy lighting. It cost Pounds 6m but cut bills to Pounds 70,000 a year, a tenth of their former level. 'The company was ahead of its time,' he says. 'We could talk the same language. Many boards seem proud to boast ignorance about such matters.' Not for much longer, according to Mr Bil Musannif of Brecsu. Working on behalf of the government's Energy Efficiency Office, his team has persuaded 1,500 top companies to commit themselves to re-education, so energy matters are incorporated in board decisions. Meanwhile, technicians are being given language lessons. 'Businesses often have experts who know what should be done but they cannot talk to their own managers. Boards talk strategy, not widgets. We are teaching them to communicate.' One essential tool is an energy management guide published this year, which acts as a combined dictionary to the vocabulary of company organisation, and a guidebook to management structures. Perhaps my managing director should sit down with his own expert for some joint reading. Then perhaps he will at least be able to get a hot cup of tea.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Scientists enter race to find gravitational waves: British Association for the Advancement of Science SCIENTISTS around the world are competing to be first to measure nature's most elusive radiation - gravitational waves - and so validate some of Einstein's last predictions. The competition has already brought some industrial spin-offs. A new physical principle called 'squeezing light' has been discovered by Glasgow researchers and is now used to reduce background noise in communication systems. Gravitational waves are ripples in the gravitational field around stars. They travel at the speed of light. Since gravity is a weak force the tiny disturbances caused by the ripples are hard to detect. Indirect experimental evidence indicates that gravitational waves do exist, as Einstein predicted in 1916. Direct experimental evidence is more difficult to acquire. Two forms of detector are being developed to measure gravitational waves. Bar detectors - 2 metre cylinders of pure aluminium cooled to almost absolute zero - oscillate naturally along their length. This effect should be enhanced when the cylinders are hit by gravitational waves. Professor David Schutz, of Cardiff University's physics department, said: 'The coldest object in the universe is sitting in a physics lab in Rome. All physicists need now is an event with sufficient energy, such as a supernova  -the calamitous death of a large star - to produce the waves.' The second approach, in a joint British-German project, is the development of giant interferometer detectors which do not need supernovae to produce results. Interferometry is the measurement of small changes in length using very pure light. The detector's design involves simultaneously bouncing laser light off two pairs of perfect mirrors, suspended at right angles to one another, and looking for differences in the time taken for the light to reflect back. If a gravitational wave hits, the mirrors will move slightly apart and the return time will change. The distance between the mirrors is 3km to 4km and the mirror movement is a million million millionth of a metre. The whole interferometer is kept in a vacuum to isolate it from background noise.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cajnice, 19 April (TANJUG) -- Positions of the army  of the republic of Srpska on the left bank of the Drina river  have since early this morning been exposed to fierce artillery  fire coming from Muslim forces in the center of Gorazde, the  command of the Herzegovina corps announced this evening. The  attacks intensified after NATO aircraft had begun overflying  Serb positions between Gorazde and Cajnice this afternoon. This  encouraged Muslim forces to attempt to carry out infantry  onslaughts in several places along the separation line.    The command of the Herzegovina corps said that for their  attacks, Muslim forces have been using facilities in which  representatives of international humanitarian organizations and  the UN are accommodated. Fire from anti-aircraft guns and  machine-guns has been opened from the hospital building,  schools, and other institutions.    The command of the Herzegovina corps today resolutely denied  reports broadcast by Sarajevo media that the Serb army used  chemical weapons, stressing that this has been done by Muslim  forces which have a factory for the production of the banned  chemicals in Gorazde. Despite the fierce attacks, the Serb  forces today managed to preserve their front lines, the command  said.</p>

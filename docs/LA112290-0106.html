			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> EARTHWATCH;  </P> <P> TEA TREE OIL;  </P> <P> A LITTLE DAB OF THIS NATURAL UNGUENT WILL CLEANSE, SOOTHE AND MEDICATE INSECT  STINGS, MINOR SCRAPES, PIMPLES AND SUNBURNS.  </P> <P> Thanksgiving. A time for family matters. I had in mind sharing a family secret.  Not about dinners, though -- my penchant for "less is more" would be out of  place on this day.  </P> <P> My secret is a first-aid item used by everyone in our family. It's something  with a lot of medicinal uses that is made from a natural material and doesn't  sting, stink or stain.  </P> <P> I'm talking about tea tree oil. But it's evidently not much of a secret lately  because in researching the background of this natural antiseptic I found that  Thrifty, Sav-On, Longs, etc. now sell an array of products that contain it. And  the health food stores where my wife's been buying 100% pure tea tree oil for  years have experienced a surge in sales lately.  </P> <P> Tea tree oil. What an odd name. A botanist, Joseph Banks, named it when he  reported on Pacific Coast health matters during the famous voyages of Capt.  Cook. The coast in question was on the other side of the Pacific basin,  Australia. The original inhabitants, he noted, brewed medicinal teas and  steamed out medicinal oils from the leaves of certain tea trees.  </P> <P> And they still do. The European settlers picked up on practices down under as  we took up certain Indian herbalists' practices hereabouts. In Australia,  eucalyptus leaves became the most popular source of medicinal oil.  </P> <P> "Everybody there has used them for 150 years," Brenda Bonner, a Pacoima natural  oils broker, said. "But Americans don't like the smell. We've taken a fancy to  one particular 'tea tree,"' Melaleuca, Bonner said. "And a two-ounce bottle  lasts two years."  </P> <P> Indeed it does. Purchased in generic form, 100% pure (Aussie) government  inspected, it's something our family uses instead of everything -- instead of  iodine, isopropyl alcohol, sunburn oil or commercial zit fighters. Tea tree oil  has also become an important ingredient in a wide range of American-made health  care products as manufacturers, especially in California, move away from  petroleum-based (and sometimes irritating) chemicals.  </P> <P> Because it's a natural germicide, fungicide and mild analgesic, tea tree oil is  useful in lip balm, mouthwash, toothpaste, soap and deodorants. It's also  widely available in a medicinal (anti-dandruff) shampoo made by Freeman  Cosmetics here in Southern California.  </P> <P> But call around to find a store that carries it in its 100% pure generic form.  Buy one for the medicine cabinet and one for mommy's purse. The quaint  directions on one of our bottles read: "Dab on to cuts, insect bites, minor  burns, pimples. Sprinkle on handkerchief or add drops to hot water and inhale  for nasal congestion. Use sparingly." This time of year, with the cold season  upon us, we also use it for chapped noses and lips.  </P> <P> This might sound like some New England auntie lecturing the young during a lull  in the dinner table conversation. Well, I'll accept the role for now. From an  environmental standpoint I'm also comfortable because the manufacturing process  involved is nature friendly. The tea tree leaves are trimmed, not unlike what  we do with rosebushes for their benefit. And, unlike petroleum, this is a  renewable resource.  </P> <P> The leaves are steamed in a process rather like what we do with vegetables for  dinner. Except it's the steam that's collected, in something like an  old-fashioned bootlegger's still. When the water condenses, the oil is skimmed  off the top.  </P> <P> The folks who bring tea leaf oil to America retest it for purity to see if the  Australian government labeling is accurate. Desert Essence, a manufacturer in  Topanga, has noted no discrepancies. Then, in determining various applications  -- for instance, for sunburn or pimples -- they test it on themselves, not  animals. (This takes cruelty-free manufacturing principles to the max.)  </P> <P> So now you know about our little family secret. Gatherings at Thanksgiving can  produce the odd cut, scrape, sting or singe. Having a few ounces of tea tree  oil on hand during this and other holidays should take care of things.  </P> <P> </P> <P> * WHAT AND WHERE  </P> <P> Generic tea tree oil can be found in health food stores, including the  following in Ventura County:  </P> <P> * Kayser's Nutrition Centers, Buenaventura Plaza in Ventura, 642-2145, and La  Cumbre Plaza in Santa Barbara, 682-3747.  </P> <P> * Lassen's Health Foods, 4013 E. Main St., Ventura, 644-6990, 3471 Saviers  Road, Oxnard, 486-8266 and 2207 Pickwick Drive, Camarillo, 492-3287.  </P></p>

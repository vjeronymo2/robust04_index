			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / World Trade News: China-Gatt talks to resume today Negotiations on China's application to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade resume today, but trade diplomats said yesterday they expected little progress during the four-day meeting. The latest stand-off between the US and China over human rights made a breakthrough unlikely. With the US continuing to threaten non-renewal of China's most-favoured-nation status because of lack of progress on human rights issues, US trade officials in Geneva were in no position to offer China the prospect of early Gatt membership, officials said. The tense relationship between Washington and Beijing has repeatedly dogged China's Gatt membership talks, which began in 1987. They came to a halt after Beijing's suppression of student demonstrations in 1989, and have since limped along in half-hearted fashion. However, China is now extremely anxious to speed up the talks with the aim of joining Gatt by the end of the year, enabling it to become a founding member of the new World Trade Organisation which will succeed Gatt in 1995. This aim is backed in principle by most Gatt members, including the European Union, and supported by Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, who wants the WTO to have near-universal membership. Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, has said trade and human rights should be dealt with separately. However, the EU and others want China to join with special conditions reflecting its partial transformation to a market economy, such as safeguards against surges in exports.</p>

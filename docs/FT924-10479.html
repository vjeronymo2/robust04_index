			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bristol-Myers to reduce workforce by 2,280 BRISTOL-Myers Squibb, the world's third biggest pharmaceuticals company, yesterday said it was cutting its work-force by about 6 per cent, or 2,280 people, in yet another move to improve its position in an increasingly competitive industry. In a letter to employees, Mr Wayne Davidson, president, said: 'Health care cost-containment issues, rebates and restrictions on our ability to market our products are increasingly affecting the business worldwide. These trends are expected to continue and, therefore, they need to be addressed on a sound and sustainable basis.' Bristol-Myers is also responding to the increasing pressures of price increase curbs and generic competition which are starting to change the face of the pharmaceuticals industry. Earlier this week, the company announced the sale of its Drackett household products business for Dollars 1.15bn in cash as Bristol moved to concentrate on its core pharmaceuticals business. The company's results have been disappointing this year, with profits growth of only 5 per cent in the first nine months compared with its usual 15 per cent growth rate. According to Mr Viren Mehta, partner at Mehta and Isaly in New York, 'all of the prudent managers in the industry are recognising that the largest market in the world is not as profitable as it once was. Even companies that are highly successful have wage freezes, travel and hiring controls and a greater focus on research. Because of the additional problems that Bristol has faced and the impact on its share price, management has been motivated to be more visible with some of the cost controls they are implementing.' On Wall Street, shares in Bristol-Myers added Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 67 1/4 . The stock has traded as high as Dollars 90 1/8 this year.</p>

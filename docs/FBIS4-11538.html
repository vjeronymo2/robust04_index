			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Casado: "A Distorted Reality"] </F>   [Text] Latin American governments have failed in a new  joint attempt to have the EU make a commitment to expand trade  between Latin America and Europe and to guarantee a growing  inflow of European investments in Latin America.    This failure became clear at the conclusion of the fourth  meeting of European and Latin American foreign ministers held  this week in Sao Paulo.    This may have been a test for the new world economic order  outlined two weeks ago in Marrakech, Morocco -- after eight  years of negotiations -- through a new global agreement on  tariffs and the creation of a powerful institution called the  World Trade Organization.    Latin American diplomats came out of the Sao Paulo meeting  less optimistic than before.    It became clear to them, for instance, that trade between  the  EU and Latin America is bound to become increasingly dependent  on each government's interpretation of the GATT agreements.    It has resulted in greater uncertainty about the future of  Latin American trade with Europe, which is its main trading  partner after the United States. European imports of Latin  American products have dropped nearly 40 percent since 1965 as  protectionism continues to progress.    Under Brazil's guidance, Latin American governments found  out  at the Sao Paulo meeting that the only thing they could do was  lodge another protest against the growing social, environmental,  and labor conditions some European countries are beginning to  impose on purchases of Latin American products.    The rich countries are in fact reaffirming their  protectionist pressures, which are decisively contributing to  undoing the optimistic scenario (for the poor) that was built  around the new GATT agreement.    In theory, the new GATT agreement is supposed to increase  world trade by $270 billion annually from 1995 to 2005 and bring  substantial benefits to Latin American countries, especially to  Brazil. Reality is, however, distorting these expectations.    Another hope was lost this week in Sao Paulo; that is, it  would not be feasible in the short term for Latin American  governments to exact commitments and broad guarantees from  Europe that the inflow of investments in the region will  increase.    The idea of making Latin America gradually become a priority  on the agenda of EU public investment policies was stimulated by  the inflow of capital registered last year, when one-third of  Europe's overall investments was made in the region.    The Latin American diplomatic offensive in Sao Paulo was  designed to obtain "major commitments" from the Europeans that  they would increase their investments in the region in the short  term and thus prevent the growing interest of investors in and  the inflow of capital toward Africa, Asia, and East Europe. The  Latin Americans have lost once again. They have made no major  achievements.    It is a crucial question to determine which direction the  expansion of capitalism will take in the next few decades within  the framework of a globalized economy.    Asia remains a priority. Despite its tribal conflicts,  Africa continues to be attractive because it remains highly  profitable. It is not by mere coincidence that 90 South African  companies are trading their stocks in London's stock exchange,  23 of them are trading in Paris, 16 of them are trading in  Brussels, 12 in Frankfurt, and nine in Switzerland.    East Europe is the area where the second stage of the EU's  integration will take place.    This does not mean that things will continue to be as they  are now.    It will be incumbent upon the skill of the Latin American  governments to bring about changes in their relations with the  EU. They have a promising market and can count on Europe's  competitor -- the United States -- which is a potential ally in  trade disputes with the European bloc.    This poses a challenge to the political ability of foreign  ministries such as that of Brazil.</p>

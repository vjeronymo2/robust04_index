			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Arts: Design for Living - Theatre Some of Noel Coward's comedies succeed because they very shrewdly tell the truth, but others are merely enchanting lies. About such matters as bad manners, the dangers of charm, and offstage theatricality Coward knew plenty: witness the spot-on brilliance of Hay Fever and Present Laughter. About such matters as sustained sexual passion and responsibilities within adult relationships he knew far less: witness such delicious fibs as Private Lives. Design for Living is a pretty fib about something Coward did not understand at all: bisexuality. But people have been lying about bisexuality for decades, and Coward's charming games with it are only seriously marred by his terror of calling a spade a spade and by his final pretence that a sexual threesome can be a good permanent arrangement. Sean Mathias's new production is, however, happy to fill in, in 1994, what Coward left out in 1933, and to tear away some of what Coward needed to add. His staging is sometimes much more than delicious, and to that extent it is on the verge of being the most important production of a Coward play London has seen in many years. Design for Living is, you will recall, about the erotic triangle of Gilda, Otto, and Leo. Mathias's most audacious stroke is to tear it away from its original 1930s setting. This, at first, strips off that bright-young-thing polish that makes most Coward plays sound like make-believe. Mathias is strong on the sex between the three central characters, and thrillingly reveals the two elements of sexual passion about which Coward knew most: owning up to sexual attraction and sexual jealousy. He makes these gripping to us - much of the time - because he has the actors speak the dialogue - much of the time - with all the speed and attack that Coward's lines call for, and because - much of the time - they eliminate the airily glamorous artifice that is usually an adjunct of Coward's style. The production begins with Gilda (Rachel Weisz) opening the fridge and soothing her inflamed body after a night of impassioned sex. Everything  - the way her body radiates sexual excitement through its gorgeous and thin little shift, the sultry muzak in the air, the scatter cushions on the floor  -plunges the play straightaway into the world we know. And the modern effect is thrilling throughout the first act, even though this is the play's least amusing. Thereafter, however, the production occasionally loses its nerve. Even Stephen Brimson Lewis's vivid designs stop being so 'now' and becomes more ambivalent. Rachel Weisz, the least experienced of the three players, gives far the most revelatory performance. No Cowardly world-weariness here. The way she plays Act One, as if still high on last night, is marvellous. She is all reckless self-discovery, and she embodies the dilemma of the modern woman: how to have it all? She wants sex and intimacy and independence; she is sexual and sophisticated but without a jot of calculation; she is endlessly spontaneous. There is a bubble of doll's-house hysteria beneath everything she does that makes her much the most interesting character in the play. Clive Owen's Otto is even more radically conceived: no kind of upper-class accent whatever here. This does not always work; the words 'my dearest dear' do not come naturally from his lips. In general, however, he goes for Otto's honesty. And his blend of roughness and tenderness make his bisexuality persuasive; we can even believe, sometimes at least, that he wants Gilda to realise herself as a woman and not just as his lover. Paul Rhys, as Leo, starts with terrific freshness, and, like Weisz, he has the kind of good looks that make sense (sexually speaking) of the story. But, alas, he soon opts for the customarily artificial way of playing Coward: the more-clipped-than-thou vowels, the pretty-boy tricks of the eyes, the cultivated aloof facade. The artificial way of playing Coward can, of course, be wonderfully funny. When Rhys says 'You've been to Chuquicamata, I suppose?', he is uproarious. But by this point the play has retreated into never-never-land. We may believe that Gilda can tumble back into bed with her old boyfriends, but not that this Gilda should want to stay there. The play's final scene is, eventually, one big lie. Donmar Warehouse, London WC2</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Net halved at Thomson-CSF THOMSON-CSF, the French state-controlled defence electronics group, yesterday announced a halving in net profits for the first six months of the year. It warned that full-year profits would be below those achieved in 1992. The company blamed the decline in net profits, which fell to FFr455m (Dollars 79.8m) from FFr848m in the first half of 1992, on its stake in loss-making Credit Lyonnais, and on restructuring costs. Its 22 per cent holding in the French bank represented a negative contribution of FFr225m, while restructuring charges amounted to FFr110m. Operating profits, however, remained fairly steady at FFr918m, compared with FFr935m last time. Sales fell by 5.6 per cent in the first half of the year, to FFr13.94bn. The company said turnover for the full year was expected to decline by about 5 per cent. Operating income is forecast to remain stable for the year at about FFr2.07bn. The fall in net income for 1993 will depend on the contribution from its financial affiliates, and upon the amount of restructuring charges, the group said. The decline in sales in the first half was the result of the ending of the billing period for two large overseas contracts with the US and Saudi Arabia. International sales fell by 11 per cent, while domestic turnover showed a 2 per cent rise. Thomson-CSF is on the list of 21 publicly-owned groups which the French government wants to privatise. Industry analysts in Paris, however, say the sale of the state's stake in the group was complicated by the structure of Thomson. In particular, most analysts believe it would be difficult to sell Thomson-TCE, the loss-making consumer electronics group which, along with Thomson-CSF, comprises the group.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / EU banks warned of Emu costs Top European retail banks would have to spend up to Ecu225m (Pounds 177m) each to adapt technology and operations for a single European currency, according to the Ecu Banking Association. The organisation's 90 members include most large banks in Europe. In a report published yesterday, it warned that banks in countries not taking part in the European Monetary Union will face extra costs and competitive burdens. However, its own research estimates large banks in Emu countries may have to spend Ecu100m-Ecu150m each to adapt, and costs could be 50 per cent higher if domestic currencies stay in parallel for a transition period. A working paper says 'such raw figures could of course provoke an unnecessarily alarmist reaction' if published. Association leaders said yesterday they wanted to emphasise the opportunities of Emu, due to start by 1999. Mr Walter Damm, chairman of the EBA committee on Emu, said banks in countries like the UK and Denmark, with opt-out clauses from monetary union, could face disadvantages because they would lack an Ecu funding base and would operate in parallel currencies.

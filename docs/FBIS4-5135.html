			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia hopes to get the support of other G-15  [Group of 15] and South countries to oppose a wage-trade link  proposal with a view to setting the minimum global wage  standards at the upcoming General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade, GATT, meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco. Foreign Minister  Datuk Abdullah Haji Ahmad Badawi said he was hopeful that the  G-15 and South countries could meet prior to the 15 April GATT  meeting to establish a common stand against the proposal by the  U.S. and France. The Uruguay round trade accord is to be signed  by 120 countries at the meeting next week. The U.S. and France  were proposing that a wage-trade link be discussed at the  meeting, setting in motion a debate on the proposed minimum  global wage standards. Datuk Abdullah was speaking to reporters  after meeting China's vice minister for foreign affairs, Tang  Jianxuan, at Wisma Putera [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] in Kuala  Lumpur. The four-man delegation arrived on Tuesday for a  three-day visit to Kuala Lumpur and Melaka.    Reiterating that linking workers' rights with trade was  unjustified, he hoped the G-15 along with other South countries  would be united in opposing the link. The G-15 needed to  discuss and coordinate support from all countries of the South,  adding that the proposal would have a serious impact on the  economies of the developing countries.</p>

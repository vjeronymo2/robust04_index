			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEPPERDINE HUNTS CONFERENCE CROWN;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: THE WAVES, RED HOT OVER THE LAST FEW GAMES, WILL FACE ST.  MARY'S IN THE WEST COAST CONFERENCE OPENER.  </P> <P> When Pepperdine's basketball team was struggling midway through the season,  Coach Tom Asbury said that the West Coast Conference tournament was good  because it gives every team a chance for redemption.  </P> <P> The Waves, who came in second in the conference to nationally ranked Loyola  Marymount, don't need to redeem themselves any longer.  </P> <P> Pepperdine has won three straight games and nine of its last 11, including an  upset victory over nationally ranked WCC champion Loyola Marymount. The Waves  finished the regular season at 16-11 overall and 10-4 in conference play.  </P> <P> Each of the teams that Pepperdine will or may face in the first two rounds of  the WCC tournament has a great need for vindication, however, and each has  nothing to lose.  </P> <P> Pepperdine will meet St. Mary's (7-19, 4-10) in the first round at 6 p.m.  Saturday at Loyola's Gersten Pavilion. If the Waves win, they will play the  winner of Saturday night's first-round game between the University of San  Francisco (8-19, 4-10) and the University of San Diego (14-12 as the week  began, 9-5) in a semifinal game at 7 p.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> St. Mary's, USF and San Diego have each lost twice to Pepperdine in conference  play this season, and each has something to prove against the Waves.  </P> <P> Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said that it is difficult to beat a team three  times in one season and that his players can't afford to take its first- or  second-round opponents lightly.  </P> <P> "It's tough playing anybody three times, especially anybody that you have  beaten," Asbury said. "That's not always a good situation, but it's better than  putting your bags away. "Anything can happen in a tournament. I don't think our  guys can look past anybody."  </P> <P> He remembers when the sneaker was on the other foot.  </P> <P> In 1987 Pepperdine finished seventh in the conference but upset both  second-place Gonzaga and regular-season champion USD in the first two rounds of  the tournament. The Waves lost in the tournament final to Santa Clara, which  finished fifth in the WCC in the regular season.  </P> <P> Pepperdine ended 1987 with only a 12-18 overall record, but it also finished  with a bang-bang in the tournament before losing the championship game.  </P> <P> Underdog teams in conference tournaments, Asbury said, are "like 0-0 and as  loose as they can be -- and they can be dangerous."  </P> <P> St. Mary's doesn't appear dangerous.  </P> <P> Coach Paul Landreaux's Gaels have lost eight of their last nine games, have  used 13 different starting line-ups this season and have played only four games  with a full roster because of injuries and illnesses.  </P> <P> St. Mary's will probably be without its leading scorer, senior forward James  Dailey, who has missed the last seven games with a back injury.  </P> <P> One starter, senior guard-forward Terry Burns, missed 14 games because of a  ruptured disc in his back. Burns has returned, but he is still not considered  completely healthy.  </P> <P> Eric Bamberger, a 6-10 sophomore center, has returned to the starting lineup  after missing four games because of mononucleosis.  </P> <P> Landreaux expects to use two of three freshmen at the forward positions. John  Levitt, a 6-foot-5 native of Juneau, Alaska, will start at one forward spot,  and either 6-7 Ted Bull or 6-7 Demetreus Robbins at the other.  </P> <P> The other starter will be senior point guard Mike Vontoure, the team's  second-leading scorer after Dailey, who was averaging 12.6 points a game.  Vontoure is averaging 12.4 points and Bamberger is at 12.3.  </P> <P> The Gaels have been deeply wounded, but remember that old saw about wounded  animals being the most dangerous of all.  </P> <P> Vontoure is a good shooter from three-point range, and Levitt isn't bad.  Through 23 games, Levitt was leading all conference freshmen in scoring with an  average of 8.3 points.  </P> <P> In his first game since his illness, Bamberger scored 23 points and had 11  rebounds in last week's 83-80 upset over Portland in overtime. In last  Saturday's 75-62 loss to Gonzaga, Bamberger scored 18 points, all in the first  half, before he tired and ran into foul trouble.  </P> <P> Landreaux, the former El Camino College head coach and UCLA assistant, said  that the Gaels "are a lot better team with Bamberger in the middle than with  (6-8 freshman) Danny White."  </P> <P> He also saw a ray of hope in the tournament's final seedings. "We might match  up a little bit better against Pepperdine than against San Diego," he said.  </P> <P> Upsets are always possible, but the Waves have been playing very well lately  and appear to be much too strong for St. Mary's.  </P> <P> Wave senior forward Dexter Howard, used mostly to provide spark off the bench  this season, has been almost unstoppable as a starter in the last six games. In  that stretch, he has averaged 26 points, including a career-high 35 points in  the 131-123 upset of Loyola. He leads the Waves with a 17.6-point average.  </P> <P> The other Wave starters have also been scoring in double figures and have also  played well lately.  </P> <P> Senior forward Tom Lewis and senior guard Craig Davis are each averaging about  14.5 points a game, sophomore center Geoff Lear is averaging 13.7 points and a  team-high 8.9 rebounds and senior guard Shann Ferch is averaging 10.8 points.  Davis leads the team with a 47.2% average on three-point shots, and Ferch is  shooting 44.1% on triples.  </P> <P> The Waves may also have too much firepower for San Diego, if the Toreros get  past USF.  </P> <P> San Diego was trailing Pepperdine, 57-43, at halftime last Saturday, a half in  which the Waves made 10 of 13 three-pointers (76.9%) and shot 61.3% from the  field.  </P> <P> But the Toreros, led by the inside scoring of forward John Jerome and the  outside scoring of guard Pat Holbert, didn't quit, cutting the lead to three  points three times in the second half.  </P> <P> Holbert finished with a team-high 27 points and Jerome added 23 points, but the  Waves won, 102-89.  </P> <P> A rematch between Pepperdine and USD in the tournament would probably be much  closer.  </P> <P> If form holds, Pepperdine and Loyola will meet in the title game, but could the  Waves play with as much emotion on the Lions' home court as they did when they  beat the Lions at Firestone Fieldhouse?  </P> <P> Asbury thinks so. He said that he wishes that the tournament championship game  could be played "other than on their floor." But he added:  </P> <P> "I think the emotion is something we can recapture, especially when the NCAA  tournament is at the end of the tunnel. There is certainly a lot at stake,  certainly enough for us to get emotional."  </P> <P> If Loyola should run to form and beat the Waves in the final, Asbury said he  thinks his team still would merit consideration for the National Invitation  Tournament. Pepperdine has gone to the NIT for the last two years.  </P> <P> "If we lost in the (tournament) final, we would be 18-12, and last year (after  the conference tournament) we were 19-12," he said. "I'd say we would have to  be looked at pretty closely (by the NIT), especially finishing as strongly as  we did."  </P></p>

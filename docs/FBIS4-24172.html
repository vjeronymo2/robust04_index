			<p>BFN     [Text] Despite the growing hostility of the militiamen,  French paratroopers have entered Gisenyi unopposed. It is out  of the question to yield to pressure from the militiamen,  General Germanos, deputy chief of staff of the French Armed  Forces, says.    [Begin Germanos recording] A certain number of militiamen  are  currently manning roadblocks on the roads along which our units  are driving with the aim of reassuring the population. Faced  with the very resolute stand adopted by our soldiers, who  confronted the militiamen, and following a very stern warning  from our men, the militiamen cleared roadblocks and pulled back.  What we want, and we said so very firmly, is to prevent them  from opposing in any way the action aimed at ending the killings  and at controlling the situation. We will not accept that.

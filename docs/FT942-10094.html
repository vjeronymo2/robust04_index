			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Dead money' costs of EU translation Sir, Mr Hilary Chapman (Letters, May 7/8) did not give you details of the high cost of interpretation and translation in the European Union. The Swiss Professor Claude Piron, an interpreter and translator, said in a lecture given in Esperanto in 1993 to an international audience: 'The European Community makes use of the services of 2,500 translators and 570 permanent interpreters, plus 2,500 interpreters on temporary contracts. In 1989 it spent on language services Ecu1.4bn - Pounds 1.2bn; I am not mistaken, it does in fact concern a milliard: 1,200 million pounds (both items of information - number of language functionaries and costs - are from Mario von Baratta and Jan Ulrich Clauss, Internationale Organisationen, Frankfurt am Rhein: Fischer, 1991).' He went on to say: 'In 1992, transferring documents between Brussels and Strasbourg for the European Parliament cost 3 milliard Belgian francs (Pounds 50m). This sum does not include the documents which pass through Luxembourg to be translated and reprinted there. Twice a month the firm of Danzas transports 80 metric tonnes of archives in nine languages. 'If one of the chests is lost, which happens from time to time, the parliamentary session is interrupted until it has been recovered, so that every language group may have at its disposal the texts in its own language (Laurent Fontaine, Le Cout de la Bougeotte, L'Instant, October 24-30 1992). These sums may be termed 'dead money' in that they produce nothing of value. DS Lord, lecturer in Esperanto, School of Modern Languages, University of Liverpool, PO Box 147, Liverpool, L69 3BX</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Arts: Death in Venice Britten's last opera is taking its place in the British repertory - and about time too. The Glyndebourne Touring Opera production two years ago, a forceful reminder of the opera's remarkable qualities, was the turning-point. Early this year came Covent Garden's much-praised staging. Now, as the final production of the last Summer Festival in the 'old' Glyndebourne, which is soon to vanish, comes this revival. The conductor, Graeme Jenkins, is the same, so are producer and designer, Stephen Lawless and Tobias Hoheisel. The impact remains vital but is slightly different. The London Sinfonietta played for GTO: the Festival orchestra is the London Philharmonic. The GTO performance impressed not only by the brilliance in Britten's score but by a haunting quality. The LPO's accomplished playing does not so much haunt as hit. The nightmare scene and other episodes have an aggressiveness more usual in Janacek than in Britten. The words none the less come across almost unscathed. There is new choreography by Ian Spink, and a new Tadzio. Daniel Squire's features are more Greek-archaic than classical. He moves hieratically-cool, distant, hardly human. The ending is finely managed. This Tadzio is a little too mature - taller than Aschenbach. Likewise his companions, more beach-boys than children of well-heeled summer visitors. I doubt if the Games of Apollo  -a kind of baroque divertissement in aspic - will ever fully succeed, but Spink comes nearer success than most. Robert Tear repeats his compelling portrait of the tormented writer Aschenbach, delivering the rapid recitatives which are an essential part of this drama with masterly clarity. Alan Opie impresses as the suavely forbidding hotel manager. His other incarnations of the mysterious 'Traveller' are admirably sung but less sharply in focus. The smaller parts are well done, notably the English clerk of Peter Snipp, and the hotel porter of Christopher Ventris. The promotion of Apollo (Michael Chance) from off-stage counter-tenor to towering, hooting, on-stage deity in a white silk suit, with some facial resemblance to both Aschenbach and his familiar, is surely a mistake. The alter ego aspect is overdone - the Traveller's near-parody of Aschenbach's appearance and manner confuses more than it illuminates. There is still too little suggestion of either the crumbling sea-city with its oriental undertones or of the wide, horizontal sweep of the Lido. No doubt if asked, Britten would have maintained that the opera was not about Venice and the Lido but about people in Venice and on the Lido. Yet references to place and milieu are so specific that Hoheisel's lonely chandelier and two or three gondola-poles don't suffice.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Bit more pain for future gain: New Zealand's economic reformsare starting to bear fruit When Jim Bolger, New Zealand's prime minister, meets Paul Keating, his Australian counterpart, this week, they are likely to discuss closer economic ties between the two countries. But Mr Bolger might be tempted to offer his neighbour a few tips about how to turn a highly protected welfare state into a deregulated market economy. Last week, Mr Bill Birch, New Zealand's finance minister, presented a budget which showed a NZDollars 527m (Pounds 203m) fiscal surplus for the 12 months to the end of June, the first by New Zealand for almost 20 years. The figure surpassed the government's forecast a year ago, and its predictions now suggest rising surpluses for the next three years. The first use for them, said Mr Birch, was the repayment of foreign debt, which accounts for about 38 per cent of total net public debt. Contrast that with Australia. There, as in New Zealand, recovery has come more quickly than expected, and the economy is growing at a similar rate - close to 5 per cent a year. So, like New Zealand, Australia has had the benefit of higher than expected tax receipts, giving the government fiscal leeway. But in his May budget, Mr Ralph Willis, Australian treasurer, announced a ADollars 11.7bn (Pounds 5.5bn) deficit for 1994-95 (2.5 per cent of gross domestic product), after ADollars 2.4bn of asset sales. Much of the 'growth dividend' would be used to fund a jobs programme, costing ADollars 6.5bn over four years. It will be the late 1990s, according to official estimates, before Australia moves into surplus. The comparison is only relevant because the two countries started from similar positions a decade ago. Both had economies which were protected behind high tariff walls; both labour markets were regulated and depended on centralised awards; and industrial sectors such as telecommunications were dominated by public sector monopolies. The greater speed of New Zealand's reform process has already won international praise. But there is no secret about the way in which the budget surplus has been achieved - and no hiding the price. During the past 10 years, unemployment has soared as former government activities were privatised in the interests of efficiency, and the new profit-minded owners pared away unnecessary services. New Zealand's jobless rate peaked at more than 11 per cent in early 1992, and currently stands at about 9 per cent. Union power has been broken with the Employment Contracts Act, and wage levels have fallen in real terms over the past decade. Schools and hospitals have been reformed, welfare spending, including unemployment benefits, has been slashed as the government has sought to lower its costs. All this has led to substantial savings in government spending. Now that recovery is under way, a virtuous circle is also taking effect, augmenting the gains. The improving economy is leading to a sharp increase in tax receipts as people rejoin the workforce. Lower wage bills are boosting company profits, with the result that these are rising, again lifting tax receipts. In deciding how to use New Zealand's hard-won rewards, the economic reformers, centred mainly in the Treasury, have coined one central word: responsibility. Mr Birch said it would not be responsible to yield to the demands of the three opposition parties which want more of the money used to help the under-privileged - or, as they term it, a 'social dividend' in return for the years of pain. So Mr Birch has promised only minor increases in financial support for the low-paid, the disabled and to schools. It is easy to understand why Mr Bolger is being tough. The size of the public debt, which stood at 39.6 per cent of GDP last month or NZDollars 35bn, is a nagging reminder that New Zealand's economic health is still less than robust. Its external debt remains the main concern of the international financial community. It was the main reason, for example, cited by New York-based ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's, for not upgrading New Zealand's debt ratings earlier this year. Tackling the debt problem would put New Zealand near the top of the OECD league table, rather than near the bottom, as at present. As if to emphasise the debt problem, the budget was prepared under the terms of a new fiscal responsibility bill, which came into force on July 1, the day after the budget. An important requirement of the legislation is a steady reduction in net public debt. The government has set a target of reducing net public debt to between 20 and 30 per cent of GDP by the year ending June 1997. Mr Birch offset the tough budget by offering the prospect of NZDollars 1.6bn in tax cuts in 1996-97. That would equal an extra NZDollars 980 in the pocket of every wage and salary earner in that fiscal year. The budget has been received well by the business community, both inside and outside New Zealand - in marked contrast to Australia, where the government's looser fiscal stance has prompted a furious public debate. Mr Douglas Myers, the chief executive of Lion Nathan, the biggest brewer in Australia and New Zealand, said the budget would stimulate private sector growth, while Mr Roger Kerr, head of the Roundtable, the influential big business pressure group, said the budget gave New Zealand the best prospect for years. The New Zealand government must overcome several problems, however, to succeed with its debt reduction strategy. First, as a trade-dependent economy with a population of only 4m, it is counting on a continuation of the improvement in the world economy. Second, it must also negotiate the fluid domestic political situation. Mr Bolger's government narrowly retained power in the general election last November, and the next election will almost certainly be held under a system of proportional representation rather than first-past-the-post. This is likely to lead to some form of coalition government. Mr Birch may be showing political astuteness, however. Polls conducted by the Roundtable claim that 80 per cent of New Zealanders are prepared to accept some pain for ultimate gain. Minimal social spending might be acceptable if there is financial reward in the form of tax cuts down the road. Mr Birch may be successfully wooing the 'middle ground' and isolating the main opposition Labour party. But voters proved impatient for change at the last election, and there are hints that the next election may be little more than 12 months away. The extent of the electorate's appetite for change may determine whether Mr Bolger is still in the prime ministerial chair, offering more tips to his Australian counterpart.</p>

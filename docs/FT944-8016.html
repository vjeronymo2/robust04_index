			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Arts: New link for the Bankside Tate The Tate Gallery yesterday announced the six architects selected as finalists in the competition to design the proposed Tate Gallery of Modern Art on London's Bankside. They are David Chipperfield (UK); Herzog &amp; de Meuron (Switzerland); Office for Metropolitan Architecture (Netherlands); Rafael Moneo (Spain); Renzo Piano (Italy); and Tadao Ando (Japan). The winner will be announced in February. The Tate will be applying to the National Lottery financed Millennium Fund for much of the Pounds 80m needed to convert the disused power station into the nation's leading museum of modern art. The gallery space available of at least 120,000 square feet is larger than the current Tate at Millbank: this will continue as the Gallery of British Art. The FT has offered to organise a competition for the design of a footbridge linking the new Tate with St Paul's, which is immediately opposite across the Thames.</p>

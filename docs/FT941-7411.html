			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Moslem-Croat ceasefire raises hope: West seeks to move quickly on Bosnia confederation plan despite pitfalls US, United Nations and European Union officials want to forge ahead with the peace process as Bosnian Croat and Bosnian Moslem armies today begin withdrawing artillery and other weaponry from central Bosnia. If the ceasefire holds, officials will help both sides negotiate a confederation aimed at ending the war in one part of Bosnia. The proposed confederation envisages the Bosnian Croat and Bosnian government incorporating territory westwards and northwards of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. The status of Serb-held territories in eastern Bosnia is being left to separate negotiations. One of the strengths of the proposed plan gives Croatia and the Bosnian government a (face-saving) reason for ending their conflict in one part of the republic. At the same time, the US will be able to support the plan - and the Bosnian government - providing a pretext for Washington not to commit ground troops once a peace settlement is signed. 'If both sides agree to the confederation, the peace settlement could be more benign and require fewer peacekeepers,' one western diplomat said. However, another diplomat disagreed: 'Any ceasefire and peace will require tens of thousands of peacekeepers.' However, the western diplomat agreed that the plan would entail transfers of population. 'Each side hates the other so much. I cannot envisage Moslems and Croats living side by side, for instance, in Mostar, in the near future.' The idea of a confederation has re-emerged for several reasons. First, Croatia longs for peace, even though President Franjo Tudjman still harks after his Greater Croatia. The threat of sanctions against Zagreb by the US and some EU countries has also played a role. Second, Mr Haris Silajdzic, the prime minister of Bosnia, believes the confederation could give the Moslems access to the sea, and viability as a state. Third, the plan could be sold to the Clinton administration because, theoretically, it is seen as preserving some of the territorial integrity of Bosnia and has not been forced on the Moslems. The pitfalls are many. These include the transfer of populations and the need for troops on the ground. Above all, it depends on how the plan is perceived by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, who after all, holds the key to peace in Bosnia. French defence minister Francois Leotard yesterday expressed impatience that UN forces had not moved quicker to reopen Tuzla airport for relief supplies to northern Bosnia, writes David Buchan in Paris. The UN plan has been to start sending air traffic specialists on March 7 to the Moslem-held airport, which has been closed for nearly two years by surrounding Serb forces, so that relief flights can begin by March 18. This timetable now appears to have slipped.</p>

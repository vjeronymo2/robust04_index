			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Clinton's Claims"] </F>   [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton's State of the Union  address on Wednesday is predictably a list of claims for success  at home, and non-failures abroad. Success at home was key for  his presidency for, he virtually decimated George Bush on the  promise of change. President Bush had realized rather late the  depth of craving among his people for change, and did initiate  certain moves for an economic recovery. Mr. Clinton had reaped  the benefits of those measures, being in a position today to  claim that during his year in office budget deficit has been  slashed down heavily. A U.S. government release on the occasion  makes particular mention of the President's success in smoothly  getting on with Congress for legislative purposes, and refers to  legislation ranging from Family and Medical Leave Act and Health  Care Reform to the Brady Bill that seeks to control the  proliferation of handguns among citizens. No doubt Mr. Clinton  has not made empty claims on his domestic agenda, and the  inevitable approval rating after his first year in the White  House is bound to show that it has jumped up appreciably since  it dipped to a precarious 38 percent soon after his assumption  of office.    But how has Mr. Clinton fared in foreign policy? The  advantage he enjoyed over Mr. Bush, who had neglected the home  front, could not have seen him through in the conduct of the  United States as the world's only super power. The way his  foreign policymakers messed up things in Somalia and Haiti and  considerably lowered U.S. prestige in Bosnia could not but claim  Defence Secretary Les Aspin. If Secretary of State Warren  Christopher is still around, it is not for lack of suggestions  for his removal, but because Mr. Clinton hopes the  newly-inducted second in command, Mr. Strobe Talbott, would make  up for lost ground through his expert handling of Russia. But  Yeltsin's Russia at the feet of the U.S. cannot possibly add  many more feathers to America's foreign policy crown.    Mr. Clinton may rely more on subjects specially dear to his  heart, such as human rights. However, it is noticeable that an  Asian voice has been increasingly asserting itself against  Western definitions of human rights. After China, India and  Malaysia, it is now Singapore which has rejected the West's  concept of what constitutes human rights. As others feel the  pinch they will speak out, and the rejection will extend to  Western positions other than human rights, to equitable trade  relations, transfer of technology, and non-proliferation of  nuclear capability. The trouble with the Clinton Administration  is that its idea of restructuring the world in the international  order is largely confined to what happens in the West and its  poor cousins in central and eastern Europe. For the rest, the  medicine must remain the same as during the cold war -- the  nuclear non-proliferation treaty, missiles technology control  regime, trade restrictions, and human rights.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Oilfield gets go-ahead: Liverpool Bay development to create thousands of construction jobs THE government yesterday gave the go-ahead for the commercial development of the Liverpool Bay oil and gas field in a move which will create several thousand construction jobs in north Wales and Merseyside and secure several thousand others in the fabrication industry which builds the offshore production rigs. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said 1,100 jobs would be created by the construction of a pipeline receiving terminal at the Point of Ayr, north Wales, while another 1,000 workers would be needed to build PowerGen's gas-fired Connah's Quay power station, also in north Wales. It will consume as much as 300m cu ft of gas a day from the Douglas, Hamilton and Hamilton North fields which make up the project. Approval means that the first oil from the Irish Sea should begin to flow in November 1995. Peak oil production is expected to be about 70,000 barrels a day, with total reserves estimated at 150m to 200m barrels. The first gas will be produced in December 1995. The contract to supply gas to PowerGen starts in mid-1996. Hamilton Oil, a subsidiary of Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian steel, minerals and energy group, will operate the fields, with Lasmo and Monument Resources as partners. Plans for a fourth field - Lenox - are under way, with total development costs for the four fields and the gas terminal estimated at more than Pounds 1bn. Mr Ed Blair, president of Hamilton, said the developers would give preference to local companies in selecting contractors. Unemployment rates are high in the region, with coastal towns near the development, such as Bootle, having rates as high as 36 per cent in some electoral wards. The area is unlikely, however, to benefit from the fabrication contracts, as the bulk of the industry is located in Scotland and the north-east of England. But Mr Eggar said yesterday that even small companies could develop an 'offshore culture' which could lead to export opportunities as well as to contracts to supply the Liverpool Bay project. He said exploration activity in the Irish Sea was set to intensify, although Mr Blair said the area was unlikely to have North Sea potential.</p>

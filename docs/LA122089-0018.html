			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE MEDFLY SPRAYING  </P> <P> Here's one more taxpayer protesting the malathion spraying over our private  property -- without our permission -- to benefit a handful of growers when it  might well be harmful to our health!  </P> <P> Over the years we've enjoyed fresh fruit from our tangelo, orange, lemon and  grapefruit trees, knowing that they were not tainted with insecticides which  permeate commercial produce in the markets!  </P> <P> Now, after the recent overnight spraying in our area, we're apprehensive that  lingering residue from this stuff might get on our hands and clothes while  working in the yard. A performance like this might be acceptable in Eastern  Europe, but certainly isn't here.  </P> <P> W.A. STEPHERSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

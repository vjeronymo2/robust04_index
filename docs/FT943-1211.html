			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / UK relief plan goes for gold British chancellors of the exchequer have become infrequent participants in the yearly conferences of Commonwealth finance ministers that precede the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. But when they do make the effort, they usually have an initiative tucked away in their briefcases. That was the case when Mr John Major, as chancellor, launched the 'Trinidad Terms' for easing the burden of government-to-government debt owed by the poorest developing countries at the 1990 Commonwealth conference in Port of Spain, Trinidad. It will be the case when Mr Kenneth Clarke, who flies today to this year's Commonwealth meeting in Malta, discloses plans to help a small group of heavily indebted countries unable to benefit from the Trinidad Terms because their debts are owed to institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. The UK initiative is carefully structured in an attempt to gain the necessary 85 per cent support of the IMF membership. It owes a great deal to ideas put forward by Oxfam, the UK-based charity, of which his wife, Gillian, is an enthusiastic supporter. Mr Clarke will propose that the IMF sell part of its holding of 103.4m fine ounces of gold and invest the proceeds. The income from the investment (which would be retained by the IMF in its reserves) would be used to subsidise the interest payments and ease the repayment schedules of the developing countries that are burdened with excessive borrowings from the Fund. The countries named by Mr Clarke are Uganda, Honduras, Mozambique, Burundi, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Guyana and Laos. Other possible beneficiaries include Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Nicaragua and Tanzania. The British plan envisages that the debts owed by these countries to the IMF should be serviced and paid on terms similar to those granted to developing countries through the IMF's enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF), a soft loan facility that has extended finance on concessional terms to 22 countries reforming their economies in line with IMF programmes. With ESAF, debtor countries pay only 0.5 per cent interest on their borrowings, with repayment in 10 years with a 5 1/2 year grace period. The chancellor will propose a longer term concessional window of perhaps 20 years for the countries in difficulty with their multilateral debts. This would ease their burden greatly. A recent Oxfam report calculated that debt repayments to multilateral creditors such as the IMF by 19 severely indebted, low income countries account for 30 per cent of their debt service payments. Payments to the IMF, the report said, had outstripped the provision of new finance by some Dollars 2bn since the mid-1980s. The UK proposal is designed to overcome many taboos that have so far prevented the provision of debt relief to borrowers from the IMF. The chancellor will not be calling for the write-off or rescheduling of multilateral debt. He will also stress his proposals should only apply to countries that have followed a sustained programme of economic reform under the IMF. Because the scheme would be financed by IMF gold sales, it would not be a burden on IMF member countries' budgets. Nonetheless, the idea of the IMF selling some of its gold is controversial. The UK does not expect immediate acceptance of the scheme, believing it could take about two years to win the necessary support. Gold sales, if they adversely affected the price on world markets, would hurt two leading producers - Russia and South Africa - which Britain is also very keen to help. But the Treasury believes that the IMF would need to sell less than 10 per cent of its gold to finance the plan. Such sales, worth about Dollars 4bn at current market prices, would be spread over several years. It is unclear how much support the UK plan will command. The Group of Seven leading industrial nations began to discuss such matters at their July summit in Naples. In their communique, they issued a call 'to explore ways to mobilise more effectively the existing resources of the international financial institutions to respond to the special needs of the. . . poorest most indebted countries.' However, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor's predecessor, and US administrations at various times in recent years have drafted plans for IMF gold sales only to see them go nowhere. The IMF sold some of its gold in 1976 when the proceeds were used to set up a trust fund for developing countries that was the precursor of ESAF. But the present IMF management has been hostile to further gold sales for fear that they would weaken the Fund's creditworthiness. Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, once described the IMF's gold as 'the jewel of the family'. Earlier this month, an IMF official, on a visit to London to prepare for next week's IMF annual meeting in Madrid, said that IMF gold sales 'were not an issue'.</p>

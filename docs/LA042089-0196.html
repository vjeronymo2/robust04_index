			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ST. FRANCIS GRADUATE ADDS GLITTER TO IRISH DIAMOND  </P> <P> Ed Lund is surrounded by tradition at Notre Dame where there are almost as many  legends as trees.  </P> <P> Notre Dame is Knute Rockne, the Four Horsemen and Win One for the Gipper.  </P> <P> Notre Dame is Frank Leahy, Ara Parseghian and Lou Holtz.  </P> <P> Notre Dame is national championships -- football championships.  </P> <P> Notre Dame, therefore, is not the place baseball players reared in Southern  California continue their careers. At least it wasn't when Lund graduated from  St. Francis High in 1986 and took off for South Bend, Ind.  </P> <P> You want Notre Dame baseball tradition? The Fighting Irish made it to the NCAA  tournament five years in a row from 1956-60. End of story.  </P> <P> Lund, however, has been part of a transformation that is allowing Notre Dame  baseball players to not only bask beneath the Golden Dome but also in the Top  30.  </P> <P> Lund, a 6-2, 200-pound catcher from Pasadena, is batting .280 with three home  runs and 24 runs batted in for the Fighting Irish, who are ranked 27th in the  poll produced by Collegiate Baseball magazine.  </P> <P> Suddenly, the student who said he visited Notre Dame when he was a junior in  high school because "I grew up in a Catholic family and was always hearing  about Notre Dame" is getting the education he always wanted and attention from  professional baseball scouts that he yearned for almost as much.  </P> <P> "If you were to tell me when I was a freshman that I would be at this point, I  would have never believed you," Lund said. "It's been a big turnaround."  </P> <P> Most of the credit for the revitalization of the program has gone to Coach Pat  Murphy, 30, a lifelong Fighting Irish fanatic.  </P> <P> Murphy took the job last year after two successful seasons at Claremont  College, where he led his team to its first Southern California Intercollegiate  Athletic Conference title in 11 years, and coaching the national team from the  Netherlands to the European championship in 1987.  </P> <P> "His energy has no bounds," USC Coach Mike Gillespie said of Murphy.  </P> <P> Last season, with a nucleus of players that went 15-29 during Lund's freshman  season, the Fighting Irish finished 39-22.  </P> <P> "In our first team meeting, he (Murphy) was very intense, very straightforward  and very honest about the way the program was going to be run and how things  were going to be done his way," Lund said. "You could tell right away that he  didn't want to be our buddy or our friend. He wanted to be our coach to help us  win and become better baseball players."  </P> <P> An All-Del Rey League outfielder at St. Francis, where he batted .360 in his  senior year, Lund has blossomed as a catcher -- a position he was unable to  play in high school because of the presence of teammate Sam Vranjes, now the  starting catcher for USC.  </P> <P> Lund and Vranjes may meet when the Fighting Irish and Trojans clash in a  two-game series scheduled for next fall in South Bend -- a few days before the  schools' football teams play.  </P> <P> Murphy arranged a similar series with Miami last fall.  </P> <P> Notre Dame swept the series and beat the 14th-ranked Hurricanes again in March  during a spring trip to Florida. The Irish have also defeated 10th-ranked Texas  this season.  </P> <P> "It's nice to see some recognition and it's nice to see the hard work paying  off," said Lund, who is majoring in finance. "But we can't dwell on that  because we have a long way to go."  </P></p>

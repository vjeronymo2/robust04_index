			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / International Company News: Finmeccanica plan to merge units welcomed INVESTORS have welcomed the plan by Finmeccanica, the holding company controlling most of Italy's state-owned aerospace and engineering activities, to merge its listed subsidiaries into a single quoted group. The combined unit would bring together under Finmeccanica, which gained a stock market listing in October, its Alenia aerospace business and Elsag-Bailey precision engineering arm. Brokers compare the agglomeration, to be approved by shareholders' meetings in February, with international engineering conglomerates. Finmeccanica said the merged unit will be Italy's second biggest quoted engineering group behind Fiat, with a market capitalisation of about L2,100bn (Dollars 1.4bn). Net earnings should be 'at least' on a par with the L186.8bn made in 1991 before the exceptional repayment of L719bn in aid and interest to IRI, the state holding company which controls Finmeccanica. Should all minorities approve the share swap, IRI's stake in Finmeccanica's ordinary shares will drop to 86.6 per cent from 96.4 per cent in what could be the first stage in a bigger dilution of the Italian government's stake given under its privatisation plans. Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, recently forecast capital increases for Finmeccanica and Stet, IRI's telecommunications holding company. The state could eventually hold less than 50 per cent of the shares in a recapitalised Finmeccanica, he indicated. The timing may partly depend on the financial state of IRI. The transaction which gave Finmeccanica a stock market listing via the reverse takeover of its quoted Sifa subsidiary, was to have been the prelude to a multi-stage capital increase. Finmeccanica would have raised L1,700bn via a cash injection from IRI, bank credits and convertible bonds for private investors. However, IRI's financial difficulties and the poor state of the bourse forced it to shelve immediate cash-raising plans.</p>

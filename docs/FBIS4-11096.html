			<p>BFN     [Text] Haitian President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide  has warned the United States that he cannot prevent a flood of  Haitian refugees from landing on U.S. coasts if democracy is not  restored in his country. Furthermore, Father Aristide, who was  speaking in front of the World Affairs Council [previous three  words in English] in San Francisco on 18 April, reproached the  Clinton government for giving the impression of withdrawing in  the face of armed bands supported by the Haitian military. In  the face of some hooligans, the most powerful country in the  world cannot pretend that they are stronger than they, he  asserted, pointing up until now he had urged his partisans to  remain in Haiti to work for democracy instead of trying to reach  the coasts of Florida.    Aristide pointed out that henceforth it would be cynical to  maintain this recommendation in light of U.S. inaction. The  Clinton administration said last week that it would continue to  follow the democratic path while seeking a solution, but that it  did not exclude other options. The day before, the president of  the Appropriations Committee of the House of Representatives  requested U.S. military intervention to put an end to the  military regime in Haiti.</p>

He expressed his hope of  reaching a security protocol before 'Id al-Fitr to offer good  news to the Palestinian people inside and outside the occupied  territories. In a statement after the Palestinian-Israeli  Security Committee, he said that issues relating to the side  roads in the Gaza Strip were discussed. The two sides also  discussed operating joint patrols in the security belt of the  settlements and on roads in the Gaza Strip. They agreed to call  these patrols "Help Patrols" [Dawriyat Najdah].    'Asfur said: We have also reached an agreement on defining  the security belt of the settlements and the security belt in  the Palestinian areas in accordance with the Cairo agreement.  He noted that particular points will be discussed next week.  Regarding security in Jericho, he said this issue has not been  broached. He stressed that this round was generally positive,  noting that understanding was reached on numerous issues. He  said the negotiations are proceeding positively. The  Palestinian delegation has left Taba for Cairo, where the  Security Committee is scheduled to meet for the next round.    Head of the Israeli delegation Amnon Shahaq said at the end  of this round of talks that the negotiations proceeded  positively, noting that this progress does not mean there are no  problems. He pointed out that we have completed discussion of  the part relating to security cooperation and coordination. He  said the two sides have not yet settled the size of the  Palestinian police force. He noted that both sides discussed  security arrangements in Gaza and Jericho and the issue of  Palestinian detainees but refused to give details. Shahaq said  the Civilian Affairs Committee settled many issues relating to  the transfer of power and will discuss the remaining issues next  week.    The issues of antiquities, water, and city planning have  been  adjourned until next week along with the issue of  communications, notably the Palestinian radio and television,  which will be discussed at the next round.    Shahaq stressed that the next round of talks will be held in  Cairo and the round after that in Taba, noting that it is  difficult to say when these rounds will end. He noted that  substantial issues on which no agreement has been reached are  still under discussion. He said these issues relate to the  authorities and powers of the two sides. He voiced his hope  that an agreement will be reached to implement Palestinian  self-rule.</p>

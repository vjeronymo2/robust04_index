			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / A prosaic end to property prodigy: Why the receivers have moved into Mountleigh Mountleigh, the property company which went into receivership yesterday, was perhaps the most audacious, unpredictable and controversial of all the property traders to emerge in the 1980s property boom. In just a few years, it was transformed from a small wool manufacturer into a go-go property company, so highly rated by the stock market that it felt able to make a Pounds 2bn bid for Storehouse, the retailing group, in 1987. It continued in the same vein under new management, with extravagant but unrealised promises of a Pounds 1bn acquisition. Its taste for controversy eventually won it a public reprimand from the stock exchange. Its ambitions were reflected in the illustrious cast of businessmen and institutions that it attracted: Mr Tony Clegg, a blunt Lancastrian with a sharp eye for a deal, Mr Nelson Peltz and Mr Peter May, two US entrepreneurs who made a fortune from junk bonds and leveraged buy-outs, the Gordon Getty Trust, the Pritzker family and Sir Ian MacGregor, the trouble-shooter brought in by Mrs Thatcher to confront the mining industry. But for all Mountleigh's aspirations, it was finally brought down by the most prosaic of problems: it was overgeared and could not find buyers for the property it needed to sell. In particular, it can blame its demise on its inability to sell the Merry Hill shopping centre in the Black Country. Earlier this year, Mountleigh thought that it might be able to ride the storm. It agreed the sale of the Merry Hill Centre to Hammerson, the UK property company, and the O'Connor Group, a US pension fund adviser. The deal would have brought in Pounds 125m, which although less than the property's Pounds 160m book value, would have allowed the company meet its coming obligations. But the deal fell through at the end of last month. In part it was because of the likelihood that the shopping centre was built on contaminated land, a risk that had been heightened by the possibility that the government would bring in a register of contaminated land. That left Mountleigh without the funds it needed to meet vital payments due in May and June. Last week, it failed to meet the interest payment due on Pounds 47m of Swiss franc bonds; tomorrow it was due to redeem Pounds 40m of Swiss bonds; and in June, it was required to redeem another Pounds 35m tranche. Compared with its bank and bond debts of some Pounds 550m, the company had property assets of Pounds 775m at the time of its last balance sheet, in April 1991. Apart from Pounds 34m written off at its interim results, the receivers - Mr Tim Hayward and Mr Stephen James of accountants KPMG Peat Marwick - do not expect further sizeable write-downs. Much though depends on how long they have to make the disposals. If they are forced to make fire sales in a depressed market, they could have difficulty covering the company's debts. Mountleigh's assets are a mixture of properties in the UK, including the Camberley shopping centre, and a 50 per cent share of the Criterion in London's Piccadilly as well as Galerias, the second largest retailer in Spain. Although the company has pumped money into Galerias, in the last interim results the store group made a Pounds 1.9m loss. With hindsight, it is clear by the late 1980s that a company trying to manage a struggling business in Spain as well as an assortment of projects in the UK, was heading for trouble. But the company set off in search of even greater ambitions, in the hands of some entrepreneurs who had little experience of the property market. In late 1989, Mr Nelson Peltz and Mr Peter May, two US investors, had alighted on Mountleigh as a suitable vehicle for a huge - but totally unspecified - acquisition in Europe. Shareholders felt dismayed when Mr Clegg delivered control of the company to Mr Peltz and Mr May, without insisting that they mount a full-scale bid. Mr Clegg sold his 22.5 per cent stake in the company for Pounds 70m, at 200p per share, a 40 per cent premium to the market. The institutions had a sense of deja vu 18 months later when Mr Peltz and Mr May sold half their 22 per cent stake to the Gordon Getty Family Trust. At 100p per share, the price was half the original cost of the shares, but substantially more than the company's share price of 81p. Shareholders' anger that only the directors had been able to sell above the market price heightened six weeks later when Mountleigh announced a Pounds 96m rights issue as a condition for refinancing the company. The stock exchange was provoked into issuing a public censure saying the directors had breached its model code of conduct by dealing within the two-month closed period while in possession of price-sensitive information. The concerns of investors were also whipped up by the unusual rights issue underwriting structure. The publication of Mountleigh's annual report shortly afterwards, which showed that the management had nearly doubled their salaries, did nothing to placate investors. The institutions' faith in Mountleigh's ability to recover was dwindling by the month. When in October, the chairman and three joint managing directors of Mountleigh resigned, just before its annual meeting, its share price at around 15p barely stirred. But even though the company was clearly down, it was not yet out. Sir Ian MacGregor moved from deputy chairman to chairman. In April this year, the company strengthened its management by bringing in Mr Steven Gerard, a senior executive of Citibank, as chief executive to thrash out a restructuring plan. But the hope of keeping the company afloat died on Saturday when Mountleigh's banks turned down the company's proposals to ask its bondholders for a breathing space while it put together restructuring proposals. They felt able to pull the rug because they did not believe that confidence in the property market would be severely damaged - in a market inured to appalling news, confidence could get no worse.</p>

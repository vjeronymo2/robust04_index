			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WONG, AN AST FOUNDER, CUTS LINKS TO FIRM  </P> <P> Albert C. Wong, one of three founders of AST Research Inc., cut his last  management ties to the personal computer maker when he resigned Thursday from  AST's board of directors.  </P> <P> An AST spokesman said Wong's letter of resignation gave no reason for his  departure. In an interview, Wong said he feels "comfortable" leaving the AST  board. "The company appears to be doing fine now," he said. "And I don't need  to be there."  </P> <P> Wong, who last November quit his job as AST's co-chairman and chief technology  officer, has acknowledged that his business relationship with fellow  co-founders Thomas C.K. Yuen and Safi U. Qureshey had grown strained during the  past couple years -- a period of rapid growth for the Irvine firm.  </P> <P> After resigning his daily duties at AST, Wong remained as a company director  and retained a 16% ownership stake in the publicly held firm. He founded a real  estate development company, DMK Development Corp., in Laguna Hills.  </P> <P> Wong's departure leaves AST with one vacant position on its five-member board.  Joel Don, an AST spokesman, said the company has not decided on a replacement.  DAVID OLMOS  </P></p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Arts: Edinburgh Festival Theatre After decades of delay and dispute, Edinburgh is at last about to celebrate the opening of a theatre worthy of the city and its festival. The old Empire Theatre, built in 1928 and formerly used as a bingo hall, has undergone a major re-building. As the new Edinburgh Festival Theatre, it will seat around 1,850 and is said to have the largest and best-equipped stage in Britain, able to receive productions from any company in the world. The opening performance, on Saturday, will be Scottish Opera's 'Tristan und Isolde'.</p>

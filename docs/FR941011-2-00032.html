			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Only Washington State has indicated a strong interest in a buyout program and currently has a limited entry program that meets the program requirements. Therefore, Washington State will function as the sole administrative intermediary. However, if another state or tribal government entity has in place an appropriate limited-entry system and wants to participate in the buyout program, NMFS will consider allowing buyouts of limited entry permits issued under appropriate limited entry permit programs other than Washington State's. Washington State, in consultation with NMFS, shall design a permit buyout program that is consistent with state and Federal management and grant regulations, including a ``permit offer'' application that allows assessment of the uninsured, and otherwise uncompensated, loss of the applicant, any receipt of benefits by the applicant from all other assistance programs associated with this disaster, and the gross income of the applicant in 1993 (or, if married, the combined gross income of both spouses). The administrative costs charged by Washington State shall be kept at a minimum; such costs should not exceed 7.5 percent of the total funds distributed for this program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Offers to sell gillnet or troll permits from commercial fishermen who participate under limited entry systems of qualified government entities will be solicited by the State of Washington. (Qualified government entities are those governments that administer limited-entry commercial salmon fisheries and can ensure that permits bought out will not be replaced.) These commercial fishermen will need to demonstrate an uninsured, and otherwise uncompensated, loss as a result of the fishery resource disaster, as defined for the purposes of NEAP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Permits will be selected for buyout based on a sealed bid process. Starting with the lowest offers, permits will be purchased until the funds are exhausted. Maximum purchase prices for these permits will be limited to amounts that ensure that the offerer (commercial fisherman) will not be receiving total benefits from this and any other program that exceed 75 percent of his or her uninsured, and otherwise uncompensated, commercial fishery loss resulting from this fishery resource disaster, and in no case more than $100,000 per individual. The State of Washington, in consultation with NMFS, will reserve the right to reject any and all bids. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This program was originally designed to be applied to the Washington State troll and gillnet fleets. However, Washington State may elect to include the charterboat fleet. Fishermen may contact the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife for updates on the development of this program. For more details about the buyout program, consult the September 7, 1994, notice of the proposed program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Habitat Restoration Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The habitat restoration program will hire eligible commercial fishermen (i.e., those who suffered uninsured losses as a result of the West Coast salmon fishery disaster), both tribal and non-tribal, at a ``living wage'' to perform work that has a long-term beneficial impact on the habitat of the salmon. Generally, ``living wages'' are wages commensurate with the prevailing rate for similar work conducted in a specific locality. Depending on the locality and the skills required, living wage may range up to $10&hyph;15 per hour. The types of work fishermen may do under this program will involve the operation of backhoes and skiploaders, and undertaking the necessary plantings of vegetation. Generally, fishermen will need 1 to 2 days of training. Commercial fishermen who meet the eligibility criteria will be hired on a first-come, first-served basis by contractors associated with projects that have been solicited and approved by the administrative intermediary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Habitat restoration projects are to take place in areas geographically accessible to displaced fishermen, which include the coastal counties from Sonoma County, CA, to Whatcom County, WA; Clallam County, WA; and counties bordering on Puget Sound or the Columbia River or its tributaries. If within commenting distance, projects can be undertaken in other counties, if they contain habitat important to the salmon resources associated with the fishery resource disaster. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

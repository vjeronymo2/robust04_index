			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani has said the painful  tragedy and massacre of fasting Muslims in the town of Hebron by  the criminal Zionists is a sad example of a lack of healthy  conscience and weakness of human ethics. He said the beastly  act of spraying bullets on a fasting people prostrating in the  safety of the house of God is a very ugly and shameful picture  further revealing the savage and shameful nature of the  Zionists. If there was a sufficiently enlightened and healthy  conscience in the world the incident could have shaken the world  into ending its policy of support for the Zionist regime.    Addressing a gathering of educational officers today Mr.  Hashemi-Rafsanjani criticized the stance of the UN Security  Council and the sad silence of international organizations, and  he blamed America and its allies for their support for Israel.  He said: If the world had correct education and moral  purification such incidents would not have happened, or even if  they had they would have caused a wave of protest, anger, and  disgust across the effective and decisionmaking organizations of  the world.</p>

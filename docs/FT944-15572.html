			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / A boost for the north-east revolution The Samsung project is a tremendous economic and psychological boost for a region of the UK that is undergoing its own industrial revolution. North-east England prides itself on being the UK's biggest focus of Far East inward investment in manufacturing. It already boasts dozens of foreign investment projects including two of the UK's biggest - Nissan's Pounds 926m European car plant at Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, and Fujitsu's only European semiconductor manufacturing operation, at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham. Fujitsu announced yesterday that production of 16 megabit D-ram microchips at this plant, where it has already invested more than Pounds 300m, will start next April. The success of these companies, other inward investors and indigenous companies has helped north-east England establish a track-record for exporting more of its output than any other part of the UK. Yet the area still has the highest regional unemployment rate on the mainland and suffers from continuing painful erosion of industries on which its prowess, as one of the world's leading industrial regions, was founded more than a century ago. The future of its last shipbuilder, Swan Hunter on the Tyne, hangs by a thread, and it now has only one coal mine, Ellington in Northumberland, currently mothballed but expected to reopen. The Samsung investment, with 3,000 promised jobs in electronics, is seen locally as important in its own right and also for its spin-off potential. Mr John Bridge, chief executive of the Northern Development Company, the inward investment and economic regeneration agency for north-east England and Cumbria, said: 'It's fundamental. We need, in this process of economic regeneration, very significant building blocks which set off another wave of development. This will be like Nissan; there will be a significant supplier base.' Mr Bridge believes Samsung's presence will trigger investment nearby from other companies in related activities such as plastic injection moulding and wiring systems production. Cleveland county council yesterday voiced hopes the Samsung decision would mean 5,000, rather than 3,000, new jobs. The company's investment, estimated by the NDC at Pounds 600m rather than the DTI's more cautious figure of Pounds 450m, will be located on 200 acres of the Wynyard site, but the company has taken an option on a further 200 acres. 'We have been told there are other products in mind,' said Mr Bridge. Wynyard Park, where Samsung is to establish its electronics complex, is on the Cleveland/County Durham border and is accessible to job-hunters from both sides. In East Durham, the collapse of deep coal mining in the last decade has brought 10,000 job losses, while in Cleveland, the pillars of the local economy, chemicals and petrochemicals and steelmaking, have seen heavy job losses and restructuring. Between 1981 and 1991 Cleveland lost 6,345 jobs in its oil and chemicals sector, a 27 per cent drop, 11,235 jobs in metals manufacturing, a 56 per cent drop, and 2,574 jobs in electrical engineering, a 47 per cent drop. The Cleveland economy gained 14,800 service - sector jobs, many part-time and occupied by women, but 18,149 manufacturing jobs, mainly full-time and held by men, were lost.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (11): Falling slowly - Unemployment The turning point in the west German labour market in midsummer this year coincided happily with the recovery of the ruling coalition's fortunes in the pre-election opinion polls. However, as was to be shown by the election results and is becoming increasingly apparent in the monthly jobless data, neither event was as decisive as some would have the world believe. The adjusted total of unemployed in the west fell 46,000 between June and October, and shows signs of continuing to ease. There will no doubt be gung-ho headlines when the unadjusted figure for the former GDR drops below 1m this month or next - provided winter does not set in too early and send the total up again. But even the most optimistic forecasts indicate that gross domestic product growth of 3-or-more per cent in 1995 will have little apparent effect on the jobless rate - least of all in old heavy industry areas such as the Ruhr. According to the autumn prognosis of Germany's six leading economic institutes (table on facing page) the rate in the west will average 8.2 per cent after 8.3 per cent this year. In the east, it will stay around 13 per cent. Overall, 3.5m people will remain without work. Even longer-term, as recovery consolidates, economists expect western employment to expand at only half the rate of growth in GDP because of industry's need to improve productivity further. In the east, where economic restructuring is still in full swing, the situation is complicated by productivity (as measured in GDP per employed person) which is still only half that in the west while unit labour costs are 50 per cent higher. Even so, unemployment is easing and a delicate balance has emerged in which recovering industrial companies are managing to absorb the large number of people still being squeezed out of public sector and agricultural jobs. The situation is also being eased by a growing core group of self-employed people. According to official estimates, the number of self-employed in the former GDR has risen by well over 40 per cent since the start of 1991 to almost 500,000 or 7.5 per cent of the total in work. As in the west, where 10.5 per cent of the workforce is self-employed, many have found roles for themselves in the service industries which most economists see as the main source of hope for a solution to Germany's peculiar difficulties with structural unemployment. According to a recent study from the BHF bank, the problem in the west is due partly to the mismatch between the virtual unavailability of unskilled jobs in the region and the 50 per cent of the jobless total who have no vocational or professional training. Apart from existing education and training schemes which are funded out of the labour office budget, the study suggests efforts should be concentrated on ways of developing hitherto unviable service 'industries' in areas such as social work, for example. It was essential, however, not to follow the US pattern where the 'employment miracle' had been achieved with a combination of low pay and minimal social welfare cover which generated a new layer of working poor, living on the fringes of poverty. One suggestion, much discussed among economists but yet to emerge at the political level, is that federal employment office funds, currently used for unemployment pay, re-training and work-creation projects, should be diverted into income supplements for people in work but earning less than the legal minimum. Mr Bernhard Jagoda, president of the labour office, recently proposed that such a new service sector might spring from the growing demand for home care for the elderly, and estimated it could create some 300,000 jobs. Mr Jagoda is also a strong advocate of job-sharing, claiming 25 per cent of all jobs could be split, and urging federal and local government to take the lead in public employment, where continuing waves of redundancies are threatened as a result of budget cuts. While such ideas are processed in the mill of public and political opinion, the consensus remains that most can be done in the short-term in annual pay negotiations and in the day-to-day contacts between employers and their workers' representatives. The need to bring Germany's cost of manufacturing labour under control if not into line with European competitors' is clearly underlined by the latest data which shows effective hourly pay in west German manufacturing increased by 25 per cent between 1990 and 1993; productivity rose by 8 per cent. Following modest pay increases and more job cuts there has been a sharp but unquantified increase in productivity this year, which seems likely to be sustained during 1995. Although wage negotiators are expecting slightly more generous settlements, and the job losses are slowing, improved working practices and flexible time-keeping are likely to play an important role in keeping productivity on the rise. There is also room for savings among the so-called 'voluntary' payments and benefits often agreed at company or even plant level. As the BHF bank's study pointed out, this 'tax' on labour lies largely within the area of influence of wage negotiators on both sides and can therefore be adjusted by them should the need arise.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: No shortage of advice Sir, Your comment ('Flat-owner plan fails to attract funds', November 3) that without freely available advice take-up of the right of collective enfranchisement will be low is not supported by the facts. Housing minister Sir George Young's hope to have an advisory group financed and set up to help both landlords and tenants in this area to understand the terms of the act may have foundered, but there are many bodies and firms that have already published excellent guides apart from that published by his own department (some of which are free, some not) to enlighten those entitled to participate. This federation has been giving free counselling to its members since 1971 in this field, from forming tenants associations to running a block of flats after purchase of the freehold. It will continue to do so long after any government-inspired group is laid to rest. T Gordon Buckeridge, chairman, Federation of Private Residents' Associations, 11 Dartmouth Street, London SW1H 9BL</p>

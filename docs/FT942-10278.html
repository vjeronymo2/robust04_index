			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Cassell pathfinder published Cassell, the publisher which will soon come to the market with a market capitalisation of about Pounds 15m, yesterday published its pathfinder prospectus. The document said the group, which recently bought the Victor Gollancz fiction imprint, made an operating profit of Pounds 1.2m on sales of Pounds 20.1m in 1993. Cassell is being floated by way of a placing by Charterhouse Bank, with Charterhouse Tilney acting as broker. It will raise about Pounds 7m of new money to redeem preference shares and substantially reduce debt. Impact day is May 24 and dealings are expected to begin on June 2. The group is best known as a publisher of dictionaries and reference books. Its other imprints include Ward Lock, which includes the Mrs Beeton cookery books.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Lagos, June 12 (AFP) -- Nigerian police Sunday  [12 June] ended a siege of the residence of Chief Moshood  Abiola, hours after he slipped their net, proclaimed himself  president and declared a parallel government.    A group of about 100 anti-riot policemen, armed with guns  and  tear gas cannisters, sealed off Abiola's residence Saturday,  placed him under house arrest and stationed a police armoured  vehicle in front of the entrance.    On Sunday, they lifted the siege, hours after he left the  house for a venue in central Lagos where he made his  declarations before disappearing into hiding.    Abiola, a millionaire Yoruba politician, is the presumed  winner of Nigerian presidential elections in June last year.  The military regime of then president Ibrahim Babangida  cancelled publication of the election results and installed a  hand-picked civilian government. [passage omitted]</p>

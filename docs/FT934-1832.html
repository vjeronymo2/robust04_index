			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Metallgesellschaft board to grill chief on liquidity gap Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive at the troubled Metallgesellschaft metals, mining and industrial group, faces increasing pressure from the Frankfurt-based group's supervisory board at a meeting specially convened for tomorrow. It is understood that the meeting will examine preliminary results of intensive investigations by Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, leading shareholders in the company as well as creditors, into Metallgesellschaft's liquidity. The meeting is also likely to consider management responsibility for what appear to be increasing difficulties. The investigations were launched at the beginning of last week after Deutsche and Dresdner granted Metallgesellschaft special credit facilities to meet what were then described as temporary liquidity shortages arising from the activities of MG Corp, the group's US trading subsidiary, in US commodities futures markets. The extent of the liquidity support has not been disclosed, but Frankfurt sources suggest that it may have been as high as DM2bn (Dollars 1.2bn). News of the special credit facilities prompted a fall in the share price throughout last week in spite of a public declaration of support for Metallgesellschaft from Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's chief executive. The shares, up DM4.9 to DM305.20 yesterday, have fallen by 28 per cent since the beginning of last week and the group is now capitalised at DM2.7bn. Mr Kopper said on Tuesday last week that Metallgesellschaft's liquidity shortages arose for technical reasons and were not 'life-threatening'. However, it is understood that since that statement, the banks have reassessed the seriousness of the group's difficulties in the light of new information. The banks are believed to be prepared to carry on supporting Metallgesellschaft. Mr Schimmelbusch, 49, an Austrian who has been head of the company since 1988, was voted German manager of the year in 1991, when his aggressive, acquisitive management style marked him apart from older, more staid German chief executives. Since then, though, the group has suffered badly from an influx of cheap metals from the eastern bloc and the severity of the German recession. In the year to the end of September the group lost DM347m (Dollars 205m) on turnover stagnant at DM25.5bn. The immediate cause of the group's present plight was said last week to be margin calls - cash pay-outs - on oils future contracts taken out by MG Corp on the New York Mercantile Exchange, triggered by the sharp fall in oil prices in recent month. Metallgesellschaft has insisted that it was not engaged in speculative futures trading and that the futures contracts were taken out to hedge contracts to supply physical stocks of oil. However, analysts say that many questions remain unanswered and point to the enormous risks associated with such trading activities, not least that customers will renege on contracts to buy oil at high prices, leaving the group facing a massive potential liability.</p>

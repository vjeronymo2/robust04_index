			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roberto Gonzalez Amador] </F>   [Text] The political atmosphere and a significant increase  in the U.S. interest rate in the last six days of financial  activities led to the transfer of $3 billion of Mexican deposits  to foreign markets. According to the Mexican Association of  Currency Exchange Agents (AMCC) [Asociacion Mexicana de Casas de  Cambio], as of Tuesday, however, "the tendency has decreased."    The AMCC, which comprises 39 currency exchange corporations  nationwide, indicated that the Mexican currency floated close to  the upper limits established by the eighth session of the  Stability, Competitiveness, and Employment Pact (PECE). The  association added that the Bank of Mexico poured about $3  billion of its international reserves into the exchange market  during the six days following the death of Luis Donaldo Colosio.  This was to respond to the demand for U.S. currency and prevent  a sharp depreciation of the new peso.    The Central Bank did not confirm its participation in the  exchange market activities. Nevertheless, the $3 billion that  it reportedly contributed to defending the new peso represented  11 percent of the total amount of international currency  reserves the country held in December.    "There is no doubt," according to the AMCC, that the Bank of  Mexico did in fact intervene in the exchange market to meet the  demand for U.S. dollars. Analysts accredit the demand to spring  vacations, the increase in U.S. interest rates, a general  downward trend in leading stocks, and the air of uncertainty in  Mexico generated by events in noneconomic sectors.    The AMCC said that as of 25 March, the Central Bank has sold  treasury bonds worth $2 billion. This helped prevent, "to a  certain extent," a sudden fall in Mexico's currency. By  covering the currency exchange demand, said the AMCC, the local  monetary authorities strengthened the new peso. The $6 billion  lifeline offered by the U.S. Treasury also contributed to the  stabilization efforts.    The exchange market was quiet again, yesterday, as no major  operations were recorded. The new peso did remain near the  upper flotation limits, though. If it should surpass this  ceiling, the Bank of Mexico will intervene immediately to  stabilize the exchange rate. The AMCC reported that there was  very little activity in the 48-hour dollar market yesterday,  with no large deposits or withdrawals registered. There was  some demand for the new peso in the currency exchange markets  yesterday, where it closed at a 3.35-new-pesos purchase value  and 3.36-new-pesos turnover to the dollar. The group believes  that the exchange markets will stabilize again sometime between  now and Friday, and the daily decline rate will return to the  usual 0.0004 new pesos, as established by the PECE.    AMCC reports indicate that the sale of dollars on Tuesday  was  lower than the previous days. They do point out, however, that  it is not recommended forecasting any type of activity regarding  the transfer of currency abroad. The association said that the  $3 billion that left the country did so almost "all at the same  time," within the few days following the murder of the PRI  [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate.  "The highest amounts were transferred abroad on 25 March," and  since that date "the trend has been downward."    The exchange agents said that the amount of dollars leaving  the country has not been sufficient to jeopardize the Bank of  Mexico international currency reserves, which total a  considerable amount -- a little more than $29 billion. They  also pointed out that they are sure there will be no sudden  devaluation.    One factor that promoted the transfers is the recent  increase  in U.S. interest rate. Once the 30-year treasury bond reached  7.44 percent, however, it was believed that yields had reached  their ceiling. Therefore, stability is expected to return the  financial markets in the coming days.</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> COMPANIES GRANTED OZONE EXEMPTIONS  </P> <P> The City Council this week approved its first exemptions to companies affected  by a law barring the use of chlorofluorocarbons and similar chemicals tied to  the destruction of the Earth's ozone layer.  </P> <P> Exemptions were granted to 27 companies, including many high-tech firms that  use the chemicals, known as CFCs and TCAs, commonly found in solvents,  coolants, degreasers, foaming agents, inks, plastic packaging materials and  some medical equipment.  </P> <P> Many firms said the law would cause them financial hardship because  alternatives either have not been invented or are being refined.  </P> <P> But in the case of the Tapmatic Corp., which uses 46,000 gallons of the  chemicals per year to manufacture a metal coolant and lubricant, products using  alternative substances do not sell.  </P> <P> Company officials said they would go out of business without being able to use  the banned chemicals because clients would buy products elsewhere.  </P> <P> Other companies requested exemptions allowing them more time to find  alternatives.  </P> <P> For Ricoh Electronics Inc., which manufactures copier components, the law led  to safer production materials, officials said.  </P> <P> Sixteen of the firms qualified for exemptions because they produced less than  55 gallons or 450 pounds of the chemicals per year.  </P> <P> Two firms are exempt because they work under military contract specifications.  Another is exempt because its products are crucial to health care. WENDY  PAULSON  </P></p>

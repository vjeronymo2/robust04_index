			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna/Prague, May 15 (CTK) -- Czech Trade and  Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy told the Austrian news agency  APA today he welcomed the statement by Austrian Vice-Chancellor  Erhard Busek that the Austrian Government considered the issue  of completion of the Temelin power plant "closed." Austrian  (and Czech) environmentalists, supported by political parties,  have been strongly protesting against Temelin's completion. The  Soviet-type plant, to be equipped with Westinghouse safety  technology, is located about 100km from the Austrian border.    "I have known this position of Busek for several weeks. It  was reiterated during our working breakfast on Friday morning  [13 May]," Dlouhy said. Busek, who has attended the Prague  international conference Europe and Us, told the APA after the  talks with Premier Vaclav Klaus that he understood that the  energy situation of the Czech Republic did not give the country  any option but to complete the Temelin plant.    Dlouhy said that the Czech Republic was refusing the  Austrian  proposals to convert the Temelin plant to the use of gas "simply  because it would be too expensive." He pointed to the fact that  Austria, too, had refused on economic grounds to rebuild the  finished Zwentendorf nuclear plant to gas fuel.    He expressed the doubts that the "atomic" law, which was  being prepared, could delay the Temelin completion. "Quite the  reverse. The government bill makes it possible to continue in  the construction works, planned in Temelin for 1994- 1995,"  Dlouhy said. The government is trying to finish the law before  the Temelin plan is commissioned. The parliament could approve  the "atomic law" during 1995, he added.</p>

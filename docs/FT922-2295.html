			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index regains the 2,600 level THE RECOVERY in the UK stock market was taken a stage further yesterday, the FT-SE 100 Index rebounding above the 2,600 mark with the help of a firm stock index futures sector and some bargain hunting by the institutions. Wider economic factors played little role in the share rally, which reflected the oversold position that developed in the market last week. Improvement in government bonds was ascribed to the news of a Public Sector Borrowing Requirement of Pounds 3.13bn last month, slightly lower than expected, rather than to suggestions in the UK press that a further reduction in base rates might be on the cards. Equities opened above Footsie 2,600, encouraged by the uptick in stock index futures late on Monday evening. The running was taken up by evidence on the Seaq overnight printer of at least one buying programme. Evidence of at least one more buying programme crossed the trading screens later. Traders found difficulty in tracing the complete picture, but believed that by the end of the day the market had benefited from a Pounds 125m programme from a leading UK investment bank, accompanied by similar Pounds 10m and Pounds 50m programmes, also from London sources. However, the day's Seaq total of 391m shares remained relatively unexciting, although an improvement on Monday's 359.5m. Customer, or retail, business in equities in London fell to Pounds 681.2m on Monday, one of the lowest daily totals since before the general election in April. On several days last week, customer business exceeded Pounds 1bn. The Footsie made progress throughout the day and was helped at the close by a steady start to the new Wall Street session, where the Dow gained four points in UK trading hours. The final reading of 2,616.3 on the FT-SE Index left an advance of 22.7. The recovery of confidence in the market was additionally reflected in an increased flow of stock recommendations from brokerage houses. Several leading houses take the view that the Footsie's fall last week to the 2,580 area has opened up buying opportunities. A number of stocks in the Footsie list benefited from brokerage recommendations, notably Unilever, Ladbroke Group and British Aerospace. Confidence was also helped by a pause in the flow of corporate trading results which drove the market downwards last week. Trading figures from the electricity industry were taken fairly comfortably by a market now concentrating on likely developments in pricing regulation among the utilities. Selling pressure was removed from a handful of leading stocks which have dragged the market down recently. Midland Bank, now following the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation share price, moved higher, and there was a better tone throughout the banking sector. US buyers returned for the leading pharmaceutical stocks and tobaccos rallied from nervous falls in the previous session. But oil shares remained overborne by renewed bearishness towards BP by the UK securities arm of a leading French investment house.</p>

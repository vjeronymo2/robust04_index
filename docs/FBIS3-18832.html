			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Karl-Ludwig Guenscher report: "Baltic Foreign Ministers </F> Are Pressing for Bonn's Protection"]    [Text] Bonn -- In consultations to be held in Bonn this  week, the foreign ministers of the Baltic states want to issue  an urgent warning to Kinkel, their German counterpart, against  the danger of the new Russian foreign policy and, at the same  time, ask Germany for support in defending the independence of  their states against Russian hegemonic aspirations. "The German  Government has to abandon the illusion that President Yeltsin  and Foreign Minister Kozyrev are true angels of peace," a Baltic  top diplomat told DIE WELT. On the contrary, the Russian  Government is using right-wing extremist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's  success in the election to again pursue aggressive world power  policies.    "As far as contents and mental attitudes are concerned,  there  are no longer any major differences between the things that  Zhirinovskiy wants and the policy of the government," the  diplomat said. The Western thesis that one must help Yeltsin in  order to prevent Zhirinovskiy starts from false assumptions.    In the consultations with Kinkel, the Balts want to press  Germany to extend its "role as a lawyer, which is has played  with great responsibility" so far, to "some kind of protection  guarantee," and at the same time to bring Germany's influence on  Russia to bear, in order to achieve security guarantees for the  Baltics. Kinkel will have a good opportunity for this as early  as during his visit to Moscow that is planned for this month, it  was stated.    The diplomats were disappointed at the NATO failure to admit  the Balts. The Partnership for Peace is too noncommittal, it  was stated.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COPPER prices ended an active and volatile LME session weak, but above the lows of a wide range. Copper also unsettled the other metals, which closed lower. Dealers said the steep falls in copper, following Monday's decline, reflected heavy Chinese selling that became a deluge of long liquidation and speculative sales as the market's recent uptrend came to a halt. Some GOLD dealers on the London bullion market saw news that the Dutch central bank sold 400 tonnes last year as slightly bullish. 'If a substantial element of it went to the market, then it may well be felt that the market held up surprisingly well,' one dealer said. On Comex gold futures were firmer in late trading but below the key Dollars 330 a troy ounce level breached earlier. London COCOA futures finished with gains of up to Pounds 16 a tonne with the market boosted by the weakness of sterling against other leading currencies. Dealers said Ivorian sellers' were further from the market following the pound's slump. Compiled from Reuters</p>

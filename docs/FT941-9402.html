			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: UK housing One of the big uncertainties facing the UK economy as the recovery picks up speed is how the housing market will respond. Some estate agents suggest residential property values may follow the upsurge in the commercial sector. The seeming problem of negative equity may only sharpen the upturn because it will restrict supply. In its latest inflation report, the Bank of England said the number of households with negative equity had fallen by almost one third from the peak. A further small rise in house prices would spring many more from the negative equity trap, stimulating consumer spending. Others are less sanguine. Legal &amp; General recently forecast that in a world of reluctant borrowers and cautious lenders negative equity would remain a problem until 1997-98 and might not be eliminated until the next century. The housing market may have improved but 1993 remained the second worst year on record. Although the trend is clearly downwards, there were still some 59,000 house repossessions last year. At the year end, 1.5 per cent of mortgage payments were more than a year in arrear. Negative equity also exerts a downward pressure on house prices because it restricts demand. Stricter loan criteria and higher deposits for mortgages will also dampen the market. The 0.4 per cent fall in house prices that Halifax recorded in January may be no more than statistical noise. But it also hints that house prices may only rise slowly despite a recovery in transactions.</p>

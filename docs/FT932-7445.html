			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Anger likely over M-way toll plans THE GOVERNMENT will face fresh controversy over its transport policies this week when Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announces proposals to start charging drivers for using the motorways. Opinion polls suggest that motorway tolls could prove even more unpopular than railway privatisation. A poll carried out for the Royal Automobile Club earlier this month found 86 per cent of motorists opposed to the idea. Mr MacGregor is putting forward his proposals in a green paper expected to be published on Wednesday. His aim is to find a new source of finance to fund the government's Pounds 19bn roadbuilding programme. He is expected to try to take some of the heat out of the controversy by setting out a series of options and asking for opinions rather than proposing a firm course of action. But some of the options have already been ruled out. Mr MacGregor has said Continental-style toll plazas cannot be installed on existing motorways because they would worsen traffic congestion and use too much land. He has also reluctantly acknowledged that electronic technology will not offer a more sophisticated way of collecting tolls from motorists for at least five years. This means that the most likely way of charging motorists in the short term could be to require them to buy a permit if they want to use the motorways. This system operates in Switzerland, where motorists pay SFr30 (Pounds 13.50) a year for a windscreen sticker. The government is also keen to encourage the private sector to start building toll roads. But motorists would be reluctant to pay tolls on private-sector motorways if they had paid a charge to use the public-sector motorway running next to it. The green paper is therefore likely to consider the introduction of so-called shadow tolls, under which the government remunerates private-sector roadbuilders by paying them a fee for every vehicle that uses their roads. The RAC says in a paper published today that road charging will be acceptable only if there is an equivalent reduction in vehicle excise duty and if the government guarantees to spend the proceeds solely on the road system. It also wants to see the Department of Transport's responsibilities for motorways hived off to a more business-like independent agency. The Automobile Association yesterday published the results of a poll of 2,600 motorists suggesting that 88 per cent are against motorway charges. If charges were introduced, 36 per cent would prefer to pay a toll of 10p a mile, 21 per cent would prefer an annual Pounds 50 fee and 20 per cent would prefer a 15p increase in the price of a gallon of petrol. The remaining 23 per cent had no preference.</p>

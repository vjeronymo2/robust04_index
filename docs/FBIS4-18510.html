			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Ten Points About Hartmut Bagger"] </F>   [Text] Lieutenant General Hartmut Bagger, new Army  inspector, does "not" want to lead the Armed Forces "in line  with political desires."  <H5>  Origin </H5>   Born 17 July 1938 in Braunsberg/Eastern Prussia. Found a new  home near Celle after fleeing from Eastern Prussia. Graduated  from the Protestant-Pietist high school of the Hermannsburg  Mission in 1958.  <H5>  Choice of Profession </H5>   The lieutenant general smiles. His decision to become a  career soldier -- branch of service: armored infantry -- was  seen by his "strictly and rather narrowly" religious teachers as  an "act of youthful unruliness."  <H5>  Career </H5>   Bagger is considered to be a "soldiers' man." In 1976 he  became battalion commander in Rotenburg/Fulda, in 1984 brigade  head in Hamburg-Fischbek, in 1990 division general in Wuerzburg.  His military-political profile was developed in the Command  Staff of the Armed Forces in Bonn and at the Command Academy in  Hamburg.  <H5>  Alliance Experience </H5>   The new army chief also gained experience with the alliance  unspectacularly in the daily life of the troops rather than at  the green table of NATO headquarters: "The staff work in  Hamburg, for instance, was closely linked with the Dutch, that  in Wuerzburg with the Americans."  <H5>  Style </H5>   Calm determination. Listening and watching closely as  command virtues. Is able to laugh heartily, also about himself.  <H5>  Worries </H5>   Lt. Gen. Hartmut Bagger comes to the head of the still  250,000-man strong Bundeswehr during a period of unprecedented  upheaval: "Over the past two years one out of two professional  soldiers has had to move, some even twice."    He is "grateful" to Alfred Biehle, the Bundestag defense  commissioner, for the warning about reeling troop morale.  <H5>  Hopes </H5>   The Armed Forces must "not be led in line with political  desires and they need a reliable basis for planning."    The changed assignment will make make the career of being a  professional soldier more attractive, because "international  experiences, also on other continents" are beckoning.  <H5>  Goals </H5>   Establishing the new command structure by the end of 1995.  Not allowing the Bundeswehr to be run down to become a  two-class army -- superior crisis reaction forces, inferior  national defense.    This is one of the reasons that compulsory military service  must be preserved: "Half of the young officers and almost  two-thirds of the noncommissioned officers come from compulsory  military service."  <H5>  Interests </H5>   "My family" (two sons). And his second, art-loving nature.  Bagger plays the piano and paints water-colors of flowers and  landscapes.  <H5>  Dream </H5>   Perfecting my organ playing, which I have neglected since my  schooldays and "playing myself to exhaustion" after retirement.</p>

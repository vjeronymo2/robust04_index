			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Collapse of the second Guinness Trial: Justice the loser as jury discharged - The case that brought a city financier close to breakdown though not unexpected - collapse of the second Guinness trial has created a situation that is unsatisfactory for all concerned. The judge's decision to discharge the jury from returning verdicts on the fraud and false accounting charges that the two defendants denied, because of concern about Mr Roger Seelig's health, means that the charges against him remain on the file. In theory they could be reactivated if he later becomes fit to stand trial again, but that is unlikely. The result is that Mr Seelig, who has throughout declared his innocence, has virtually no hope of a verdict that would clear his name. By the same token, the Serious Fraud Office will be unable to establish its claim that Mr Seelig was guilty of criminal involvement in the share support operation mounted by Guinness during the 1986 takeover battle for Distillers. Lord Spens, Mr Seelig's co-defendant, is faced, with the possibility that he will have to go through the whole process again For the eight women and four men of the jury, the past four-and-a-half months have been wasted, while the administration of justice has suffered through a situation with which, it would appear, it has no way of coping. That situation derives from Mr Seelig's decision two years ago, because of his mounting legal costs, to conduct his own defence. His early performance was impressive. He had a detailed grasp of his brief - he, of course, knew more about the events at issue and the inner workings of the City than anyone else in court - and he quickly picked up the technique of cross-examination. One feature of his advocacy was its informality: his questioning of Mr Olivier Roux, an old friend and former Guinness finance director who was the first prosecution witness, turned into a sort of 'Olivier and Roger' show, as the two addressed each other by their Christian names - something which was repeated as other witnesses took the stand. Central to the case were allegations of Guinness share supporters being given undisclosed indemnities against loss, which the prosecution claimed was unlawful. Mr Seelig brought out evidence of a number of instances of unchallenged non-disclosure of such indemnities during other takeovers at around the same time. He also succeeded in eliciting evidence favourable to his defence from a number of prosecution witnesses. However, it became clear that, notwithstanding Mr Seelig's undoubted abilities, the fact that he was acting as his own advocate was inexorably lengthening the trial. He was taking far longer over cross-examinations than a professional advocate would have done. The basic problem was that he did not know when to stop. He was understandably anxious to get the most out of every witness, and this led him to repetition, a too-great concern with minutiae, asking multiple questions which then had to be broken down, and asking questions that the particular witness was not in a position to answer. Time and again, Mr Justice Henry - who throughout granted Mr Seelig an indulgence far beyond that which would have been allowed to a barrister  - had to tell him that a particular witness could not deal with certain matters and that there would be other witnesses who would be better able to answer the questions. For many weeks, the prosecution too was noticeably forbearing. Miss Elizabeth Gloster QC made far fewer object-ions to Mr Seelig's cross-examination methods than she would have done had her opponent been a barrister. As time went on, however, her protests became more frequent. Mr Seelig would become frustrated and prone to emotional outbursts - that he was not a lawyer, that he was doing his best, that he had a right to defend himself and that the judge was being unfair. It also became noticeable that Mr George Devlin, a friend of Mr Seelig who since last spring has devoted his time to helping him to prepare his case, and who frequently sat with him in court, was increasingly having to try to exert a restraining and calming influence. Apart from the strain and frustration Mr Seelig was experiencing in court, he was setting himself a punishing schedule, having only a few hours sleep between long hours of preparation for the next day's hearing. On December 2 the judge told the jury that the trial would not, as had originally been expected, end around Christmas but would last at least until Easter. The hearing adjourned for Christmas on December 20. Between then and last Monday, the proceedings before the jury progressed by less than four days. Nearly a week was lost because Mr Seelig, who had been receiving medical treatment for some while, was suffering side-effects from an anti-depressant he had been prescribed. A juror's illness delayed the trial for more than a week. On January 29 matters came to a head. Mr Seelig's most emotional outburst to date crystallised the growing doubts about his ability to continue - and also the justice or humanity of requiring him to do so. It had become clear that if the trial had continued to proceed at the same pace - only 10 of about 80 potential prosecution witnesses had given evidence - it would last at least until the autumn, increasing the physical, mental and emotional strain on Mr Seelig. So on Monday the judge decided that the trial should be halted and that he should discharge the jury.</p>

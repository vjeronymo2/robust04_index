			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputies and senators have failed to report to  Congress to extend the period of work on the reform of the  Constitution. Only six amendments were approved in seven months  of work.    The constitutional reform work ended today. The reform  period was not extended, and no decision was made to start a new  constitutional reform next year.    Throughout the day today, party leaders negotiated the  approval of an amendment proposed by rapporteur Nelson Jobim for  the creation of a mechanism to make regular constitutional  amendments every 10 years. The leaders reached an agreement on  the proposal, but deputies and senators did not respond to their  leaders' call, and there was no quorum for approving the  amendment.    Consequently, the two sessions on the last day of work of  the  Constituent Congress were used to make speeches lamenting its  failure.    Former PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] leader Jose  Serra blamed the lawmakers who abstained from participating in  the debate because they did not want to commit themselves and  lose votes in an electoral year.    PFL [Liberal Front Party] leader Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes said  that the country is lagging behind history, and that it will  have fewer jobs, fewer investment, and less competitiveness.    PSDB presidential candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who  attended the last session, said he will strive for a new reform  next year.    Since it was installed in October 1993, the Constituent  Congress managed to approve only six amendments, which will be  promulgated within the next few days.</p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Repaying a father I am a single woman of 27 in full employment. My father has offered to lend me Pounds 60,000 for a mortgage. I will be paying it off over 20 years and will also pay him interest. Are there any tax implications? Your father will be taxed on the interest. You will be entitled to tax relief (at 20 per cent for 1994-95 and 15 per cent for 1995-96 onwards) on half the interest. The terms of the loan should be embodied in a formal document which can be prepared by your father's solicitors or your own, who will be able to guide you on the tax aspects. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTINUES ANTI-DRUG FIGHT, IS WRITING A BOOK;  </P> <P> NANCY REAGAN JUST SAYS NO TO IDLENESS  </P> <P> In the day room of a drug recovery center in Pacoima -- Pacoima -- Nancy Reagan  sat well forward on the seat of the least worn of five brown vinyl sofas.  </P> <P> That intent, doe-eyed gaze that had variously annoyed or enchanted onlookers  through 20 years of political campaigns seemed unfeigned here, for these were  bona fide horrors she was hearing from the 26 women: I started getting high on  PAM cooking spray as a kid. . . . I tried to kill my little sister by luring  her into a pit of broken glass. . . . I swiped my father's bottle of  Thunderbird and chugged it down. . . . I watched my mother spoon dope into  balloons to sell. . . . I have six children, three of them drug babies.  </P> <P> "Six!" interrupted Mrs. Reagan, her gaze suddenly wider yet. "Six?"  </P> <P> She had shaken their hands when she arrived at Via Avanta House -- "Oh, how  cute!" one of them had gasped at the sight of her -- and she told them "how  proud I am of all of you."  </P> <P> When they had finished their searing stories, it was her turn to speak, and  they clung to her with their eyes as she did:  </P> <P> "We all go through painful times . . . you have to learn that's part of life.  Life was never meant to be level, one happy level all the time. God never meant  it to be that way. There are testing periods. It's not just us -- we're not  being picked out and tested. Granted, you've all had more than your share; some  people do, for one reason or another. But you can get out of it and you're  taking the first step. . . . I don't care what your station in life is, you go  through some difficult times."  </P> <P> Nancy Reagan, former First Lady, anti-drug crusader, author of her upcoming  memoirs, center of a worshipful and wealthy circle of old friends, was  addressing her remarks to a circle of recovering drug users, women isolated by  poverty, burdened by too many children and too little education -- a crummy  poker hand in which PCP or crack or speed looked like the one card that could  make everything bearable, then wound up being one joker too many.  </P> <P> Listen on a different plane, though, and she might have been speaking about  herself as well. For Nancy Reagan, back in a private and privileged life after  spending eight years on the laboratory slide of the presidency, has her own  "painful times" to remember. Surely there were moments in the last eight years  when she was convinced that she too was being "picked out and tested" -- when  her husband was nearly assassinated; when her mother and adoptive father died;  when she and her husband both battled cancer; when the Iran-Contra scandal  threatened Reagan's presidency; when her lavish, borrowed designer clothes, her  absorption in astrology, her imperious style, all fed the mills of criticism.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'She's a Western Girl'  </P> <P> "I can tell you she is much happier here than in Washington," said Stuart  Spencer, the veteran Reagan campaign strategist. "Washington is a different  town . . . a very 'in' town, a company town, and she's a Western girl."  </P> <P> On the 68-year-old Mrs. Reagan's retirement calendar, besides lunches and  dinners with her intimates:  </P> <P> * A November book tour that will take her from Detroit to Dallas, California to  New York;  </P> <P> * Speaking engagements lined up for her at $30,000 each through a Washington  agency;  </P> <P> * Videotaping breast cancer public service messages for the American Cancer  Society;  </P> <P> * A trip to Japan with her husband in October,  </P> <P> * And on almost every page of her datebook, some event or program to bang the  gong for her anti-drug crusade.  </P> <P> It is the raison d'etre for the Nancy Reagan Foundation office, sharing the top  floor of a Century City building with her husband. She has taped anti-drug  radio and video spots, starred at young people's anti-drug rallies at Dodger  Stadium and the Rose Bowl and in Chicago with actor "Mr. T," she startled some  Reagan loyalists by calling for a ban on semiautomatic assault rifles as "tools  of the drug trade," and in April, she tagged along behind police on a raid of a  rock house that was so thoroughly media-mobbed that it was a surprise that  anyone was still on the premises to be arrested.  </P> <P> "This is not a white-gloves dainty approach," Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg  declared.  </P> <P> No one expected her to be an ex-First Lady of the Rosalynn Carter mold,  building homes for the poor. But of the varied crises that plague society --  poverty, racism -- drugs is the one that has become personal for her. Drugs has  leaped the social ladder to reach every rung, into the lives of people she  knows, killing movie stars' children and welfare mothers' children alike.  </P> <P> Drugs "was the greatest fear of all of us who were mothers in California in the  1960s," said Nancy Reynolds, a longtime friend and now a Washington political  consultant. "I'm sure she had plenty of friends whose children were deeply  involved in drugs -- everybody did. We all knew people whose kids died of it.  We were always scared to death."  </P> <P> On her First Lady drug tours, "people began to tell her things about their  children they wouldn't tell anyone else, children talked to her -- that touched  her. That really gave a purpose to her, to being a First Lady."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Concerned Layman  </P> <P> Her questions on those tours have been a concerned layman's, not an expert's:  "Who got you started on drugs? You started right away on cocaine? Usually I've  found most people start on pot. . . . Do you think the main factor for anyone  going into drugs is the self-esteem?"  </P> <P> "Mrs. Reagan is not a treatment counselor," said Reagan spokesman Weinberg.  "She can lend a hopeful presence, if you will, to those who have been afflicted  by this plague. That's the greatest talent she has."  </P> <P> A California political consultant who works with other Republican candidates  characterizes Mrs. Reagan as "an ambitious, driven, semi-politician in her own  right," and "a hard person for people to love. She is always two notches above  the average person. Her husband was only one notch above. . . . Rather than  being a First Lady people tended to love or feel warm about, she was a First  Lady people felt would go to any lengths to help her husband. . . . You  wouldn't want to cross her path."  </P> <P> But when it comes to the drug crusade, "Just because she has a steeliness in  her doesn't mean she's not altruistic. I think she really wants to contribute  something to society in that way. I don't doubt her motivation in that way  whatsoever."  </P> <P> There have been moments, though, when good intentions and the logistics to  accomplish them seemed to be pulling in different directions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Launched With Grandeur  </P> <P> The fund-raising campaign for the center that was to bear Nancy Reagan's name,  operated under the aegis of the nationally regarded nonprofit drug-abuse agency  Phoenix House Inc., was launched with all the grandeur of a great ship.  </P> <P> It was to be a formidable project, renovating an abandoned medical center,  establishing live-in treatment, after-school programs, research and training,  and offices for Mrs. Reagan. In 1988, Merv Griffin put together a big-bucks,  big-name fund-raising breakfast at his home. Griffin was also the host when the  Reagans came to town last January for a $1,000-a-ticket Beverly Hilton benefit  dinner ornamented by caviar, blue-corn blinis and Don Rickles' jokes. By  mid-1989 the Nancy Reagan Center had very deep pockets indeed -- more than $2  million, and at least another $2.5 million in pledges toward the estimated  $10-million cost.  </P> <P> Many of her friends signed onto the Center's advisory committees, among them  Mike Wallace, with whom she has taped a lengthy "60 Minutes" interview about  her upcoming book. The rich and famous are still clamoring to help, to have  Nancy Reagan grace their premises, said Suzanne Marx, national campaign  chairman of the center.  </P> <P> "I must have 3 million worth of offers sitting here -- Tiffany's, Cartier, Van  Cleef -- everybody, everybody's been touched by drug abuse," Marx said.  </P> <P> But the Nancy Reagan Center stumbled coming out of the chute. At last January's  gala, it was the 17 pickets outside the hotel, not the movers and shakers  inside, who would have the last word. Residents of Lake View Terrace, the site  that had been chosen, were wrathful in their opposition. In May, Mrs. Reagan  withdrew her support for that plan for the center.  </P> <P> Mrs. Reagan, asked about it last month, seemed to pronounce the matter a dead  issue, and her relationship with Phoenix House all but severed. The Lake View  Terrace plan is "over, finished," she said. "The last thing I wanted is to  upset the community, that was not my aim, so I will continue my drug interest  and activities and I'll do it through (the Nancy Reagan) Foundation."  </P> <P> Phoenix House is still "looking for another site," not having "received any  communication from Nancy Reagan's people or Nancy Reagan herself to stop  looking," said Phoenix House spokesman Chris Policano.  </P> <P> With millions legally earmarked for a Nancy Reagan Center, Phoenix House has  written to donors about the quandary, but clearly does not want to relinquish  the donations, or thereby the Nancy Reagan Center that brought them in.  </P> <P> "What we're doing is figuring out how this can all be handled," said Phoenix  House vice president for development Sara Ann Fagin. "This is (an) extremely  complicated situation under philanthropic law; they've all taken tax deductions  in the previous year for this already. This is a very complicated situation.  We're working it out with a whole lot of people."  </P> <P> Mrs. Reagan is putting her efforts into her own foundation. As of this week, it  is authorized to raise funds in Los Angeles, and executive director John  Gustafson said a charity tennis tournament in October tops the event list.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grant Applications  </P> <P> The foundation has some money already, an amount Gustafson will not disclose,  and has sent letters asking various drug education and treatment programs in  the area to apply for varying matching grants: for example, $5,000 if a group  raises $25,000, Gustafson said. The Nancy Reagan cachet makes every dollar bulk  even larger.  </P> <P> Last April, Mrs. Reagan accompanied Los Angeles police on a rock-house raid,  eating fruit salad in a nearby motor home while waiting to go onto the  premises. Some neighbors cheered her, a few grumped in the background. Some  mothers afterwards called it "a dog and pony show." "We feel we're being  exploited," one said. "There are more constructive ways to do this."  </P> <P> Her highest profile remains the "Just Say No" mantra, which she uttered "not  thinking this was going to be like a household word, but it did and I'm glad it  did."  </P> <P> It still brings in letters. One touching, ill-spelled note came last month from  a 15-year-old boy being treated in Arkansas. "I can't say that the 'just say  know' champain helped me directly because I didn't go to treatment by my own  will," he wrote. "The 'just say no' champain did help me indirectly and in that  way I'm greatful. My mom saw some comercals and posters. She took a look at my  drug abuse and put me into treatment."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Just Say No Group  </P> <P> Mrs. Reagan remains honorary chair of the nonprofit Just Say No group, based in  Walnut Creek, Calif. Executive Director Ivy G. Cohen said the clubs, for 7- to  14-year-olds, now number 15,000 in the United States, in housing projects and  prosperous suburbs, with a few dozen internationally, and more chartered every  week.  </P> <P> Each club receives a packet of handbooks and guides to foster "good values,  friendships, so they develop social circles of positive (peer) pressure," Cohen  said.  </P> <P> The organization also markets accessories, from club start-up kits for $50 to a  baseball cap for $3.75.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Help to Addicts  </P> <P> Just Say No has been faulted by some drug experts for offering a fine upbeat  message for young children but hardly being of help to a crack addict.  </P> <P> Controversial research last year concluded that while drugs did indeed ravage  the lives of heavy users, those who used less had fewer troubles, and those who  had only experimented briefly showed, like non-users, no appreciable impact at  all. That flew in the face of the "even one is too many" premise and the Just  Say No message of abstinence.  </P> <P> Against that, some researchers felt that the First Lady's campaign had  sloganeered and politicized a complex psychomedical social crisis.  </P> <P> Karst Besteman is executive director of the Alcohol and Drug Problems Assn.,  and from 1974 to 1980 was deputy director of the National Institute on Drug  Abuse. While he praises Mrs. Reagan for bringing drug abuse to public  attention, he is equally vigorous in noting its shortcomings.  </P> <P> "Her being willing to stand up as First Lady and say, 'This is the way it  should be,' it put a little backbone into the suburban middle class to say  'Hey, I won't put up with this.' " Nonetheless, "an abstinence campaign like  Just Say No has a very narrow band of effectiveness, in terms of demographics  and age." Counseling addicted mothers or crack users requires techniques  "vastly different from how I talk to fourth graders."  </P> <P> He faults the Reagan Administration, not its First Lady, for being slow off the  mark. Officials "used her as a shield" for years to substitute for a real drug  policy, he said.  </P> <P> "If you'd said to me, 'Is this good federal policy?' I'd have said, 'No, it's  inadequate.' If you said to me, 'As a private issue for a First Lady, did she  do a good job of highlighting drug abuse?' I'd say she did a good job, but  that's a totally different criterion."  </P> <P> Nonwithstanding a leap in the use of crack cocaine, the reported decrease in  other drug use bespeaks a turnabout of public attitudes, and Reynolds is not  alone in declaring that Mrs. Reagan "certainly deserves some credit for making  people aware of the horror of drugs."  </P> <P> Mrs. Reagan herself takes something of a bow, as at Via Avanta: "When I first  started almost nine years ago, nobody knew anything about drugs, nobody knew  there was a problem, admitted there was a drug problem. . . . I can't tell you  the difference between this and 8 1/2 years ago."  </P> <P> She and her staff may have listened to criticism of Just Say No, and begun  focusing their message where it will do the most good -- children who have yet  to use drugs.  </P> <P> At Via Avanta, Mrs. Reagan told the women: "Now I am encouraged by the young  people. I get very cross at the older people who should know better." She  warmly praised their struggle to free themselves of drugs, then almost as an  aside noted a cold fact of demographics: as "the (drug-free) young people get  older, they'll push out the older ones."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A 'Class Photo'  </P> <P> She circled the room, hugging each woman, then called gaily, "Let's do a class  photo!"  </P> <P> Afterward, a 20-year-old former cocaine user with three children couldn't get  over it: "I've watched her make history for eight years and everything and it's  like wow, here she comes, interested in our program."  </P> <P> The woman whose six children had so astonished Mrs. Reagan still stood in the  day room, her face still aglow from the contact. "She's a miracle to me."  </P> <P> Outside Via Avanta, against a backdrop that could have been chosen by the  Reagan White House for visuals that said "struggling neighborhood" -- blue  trash dumpsters, cinder-block walls, the racket of a freeway -- Mrs. Reagan  answered questions. What does she bring to those women inside? She paused for a  fraction of a moment: "Hope, I think -- I hope. And that somebody's interested  in them and has been for quite a long time."  </P> <P> Air conditioning rumbling, the Secret Service's ink-blue Lincoln was waiting in  the parking place that had earlier been reserved by two lengths of gift-wrap  ribbon, pink and red, taped up between two plastic chairs. Mrs. Reagan climbed  in, waved, and was off.  </P></p>

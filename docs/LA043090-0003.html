			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: AND NOW, A WORD FROM OUR CENSORS  </P> <P> In keeping with my preference for offensive, tasteless and derogatory material,  I now present The Adver- tisement They Didn't Want You to See.  </P> <P> It was an ad for Select-a-Car, a San Diego-based service that promises to take  the haggle out of buying a new car by acting as your surrogate shopper/  negotiator.  </P> <P> The ad showed a woebegone sap trapped in a cell.  </P> <P> The caption:  </P> <P> "In Some Countries Putting People in Little Rooms for a Long Time Is Called  Torture. In America We Call It Buying a Car."  </P> <P> Ad executive Neal Melden thought his creation was downright clever.  </P> <P> He tried to buy space in several newspapers, all of which have taken other  Select-a-Car ads.  </P> <P> This one proved to be an ad too far.  </P> <P> "We rejected it because, personally, I found it offensive," said Ira Rosenthal,  classified advertising manager for the North County Blade-Citizen.  </P> <P> "We rejected it on the basis that it is tasteless," said Gerry Wilson, director  of marketing for the San Diego Union-Tribune.  </P> <P> He said it seems to smack of poking fun at the hostages in the Middle East.  </P> <P> (The U-T ran the ad for one day by mistake.)  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Times rejected the ad because of the newspaper's code banning  ads with "derogatory statements which attack or slur any company, line of work  or individual."  </P> <P> Also joining the rejection chorus: the Riverside Press-Enterprise, the  Escondido Times Advocate and the Temecula Californian.  </P> <P> Melden sensed the hot breath of the auto dealers association, prime buyers of  newspaper advertising space. Not so, said the newspapers.  </P> <P> Melden has decided to redesign the ad.  </P> <P> But he's still puzzled over hitting a solid wall of newsprint.  </P> <P> "I had asked that the ad be in the A section, near all the stories about rape,  incest, AIDS, murder and mayhem," he said.  </P> <P> "The ad must have been pretty bad not to be able to be printed alongside that  stuff."  </P> <P> </P> <P> She's Been There  </P> <P> Evelyne Hall-Adams, 80, a retired recreation supervisor living in an Oceanside  mobile home park, will be attending a Republican Party gala for high rollers  this week in Washington.  </P> <P> The Republicans sent her complimentary plane tickets and hotel reservations.  </P> <P> The event is the spring meeting of the Republican Senatorial Inner Circle.  </P> <P> Two days of insider briefings and a party with President and Mrs. Bush.  </P> <P> Invited are people who have given $1,000 or more to the party, plus a few  honored guests such as Hall-Adams. Republicans figure that several races this  fall are going to be close.  </P> <P> That's where Hall-Adams comes in. She's an expert on close races.  </P> <P> She and Babe Didrikson finished in an apparent dead heat in the 80-meter  hurdles in the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. The time: a world record 11.7  seconds.  </P> <P> In a disputed decision, judges gave the Gold Medal to Didrikson, the Silver to  Hall-Adams.  </P> <P> Hall-Adams later turned pro and in 1988 was inducted into the Track Hall of  Fame.  </P> <P> She'll be among 3 dozen sports Hall of Famers invited to the Republican bash.  Another: former Charger Coach Sid Gillman.  </P> <P> Hall-Adams doesn't run much anymore, but the competitive spirit is undimmed.  </P> <P> She feels she was robbed in '32, and that she and Babe should have shared the  gold.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Did I Say That?  </P> <P> It says here.  </P> <P> * Former San Diego Councilman Mike Gotch, running for Assembly, is using an old  quote from Pete Wilson in his campaign literature: "Mike, working with you has  been a great pleasure for me . . . "  </P> <P> Right, such a pleasure that in his latter years as mayor, Wilson put Gotch in  political deep freeze and broke with council tradition to deny him a committee  chairmanship.  </P> <P> * Law, language and lucre.  </P> <P> Warning in the felony arraignment division of San Diego Superior Court:"Front  row reserved for attorneys, translators and revenue recovery."  </P> <P> * North County bumper sticker: "Free Tibet."  </P></p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Greens affirm pacifism GERMANY'S Green party, the sole established political party still increasing its support in the polls, voted at the weekend to disarm and eventually abolish the Bundeswehr, the German armed forces. A special conference in Bonn also rejected by a large majority any move to send German troops abroad as part of military peace-keeping or peace-making operations. Thus the Greens, who may well be a candidate for membership of the next government if they continue to pick up votes from the main parties, remain solidly committed to their pacifist traditions. By going so far as to call for abolition of the Bundeswehr, the party is likely to scare off middle-of-the-road members of the Social Democrats (SPD) doubtful about the wisdom of a coalition with the Greens. The SPD is currently negotiating a 'red-green' coalition for the city parliament in Hamburg, where the party lost its overall majority last month. The Greens almost doubled their vote to more than 13 per cent. The city's SPD leadership is deeply divided on the issue, and voted by a bare 13-11 majority on Friday to pursue negotiations. Mayor Henning Voscherau argues that Green policies on economic development, housing, law and order and the environment may prevent the SPD pursuing effective policies on the key issues likely to decide next year's national elections. Confirmation of the Greens' pacifism is likely to reinforce similar doubts in the national SPD leadership. However, a continuing strong performance by the party might make a red-green coalition for the next Bonn government a genuine option, with a clear left-wing bias.</p>

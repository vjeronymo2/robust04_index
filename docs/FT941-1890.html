			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bourne End reduces deficit to Pounds 55,000 Bourne End Properties, the property investment company, achieved a small profit in the second half of 1993, resulting in a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 55,000 for the year, against a deficit of Pounds 1.17m in 1992. The company successfully pushed through a 3-for-1 rights issue late last year, which has transformed the company and given rise to a more aggressive investment policy. At the December 31 year end, borrowings had increased almost threefold to Pounds 105m, but net asset value per share rose 12p to 85p and gearing was more than halved from 580 per cent to 230 per cent. During 1993, net rental income increased from Pounds 3.47m to Pounds 3.81m, while net interest payable fell from Pounds 4.22m to Pounds 3.34m. Mr Leo Noe, chief executive, said that rental income was currently 1.3 times interest payable, despite a further Pounds 21m of acquisitions announced in February. The company is comfortable with current debt levels. 'If the market continues to improve, we would be doing our shareholders a disservice if we reduced our gearing by much,' he added. Bourne End has renegotiated its debt, and more than half is now fixed for between 15 and 20 years, at interest rates of below 10 per cent. The company's property portfolio was valued at Pounds 147m in December, representing upward valuations totalling Pounds 11.9m, of which Pounds 5.5m was on proper-ties owned before 1993. Bourne End's net worth increased from Pounds 39m to Pounds 45m. Losses per share were reduced to 0.4p (8.2p) and a final dividend of 0.25p is proposed, maintaining the total for the year at 1p.</p>

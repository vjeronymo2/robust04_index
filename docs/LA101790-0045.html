			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISIS IN THE PERSIAN GULF;  </P> <P> ISRAELI ISSUES SEEN AS PERIL TO GULF ALLIANCE  </P> <P> Efforts to link Iraq's seizure of Kuwait with the Arab-Israeli conflict are  threatening to open cracks in the Arab-Western alliance against Iraq, and the  killing of 21 Palestinians by Israeli forces last week in Jerusalem has  aggravated the situation, diplomats and analysts say.  </P> <P> "Israel's action in Jerusalem has definitely put more pressure on the Western  coalition," one British diplomat observed. "This will not help matters in the  alliance."  </P> <P> At the same time, Simon Lunn, an official with the North Atlantic Assembly in  Brussels, asserted: "We say there's no linkage, but the shootings in Jerusalem  reinforce what we know in reality: These two situations, in Arab eyes, are not  unconnected."  </P> <P> And France's President Francois Mitterrand has declared, "I don't want to mix  these two questions, but one cannot try to defend human rights in one area and  neglect them in another."  </P> <P> European officials generally tend to resist connecting Iraq's seizure of Kuwait  in August with Israel's seizure, in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967, of the West  Bank and Gaza Strip, but they take the position that Israel should negotiate  with Palestinians at an international conference. Israel has rejected this  view.  </P> <P> British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd was among the most outspoken in warning  that failure by the U.N. Security Council to condemn Israel could have  jeopardized the united front against Iraq.  </P> <P> "I am very clear when talking to Arabs that the Arab-Israeli dispute is not  like (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein's aggression against Kuwait," Hurd said.  "Equally, when talking to Israel, we are all entitled to say: 'Is this what  Israel is about, trying to bring about your own security by this kind of  repression and denying all rights to the people whose territories you occupy?'  "  </P> <P> Hurd believes in setting up an international conference on settling the  Arab-Israeli dispute, but only after the Persian Gulf crisis is resolved.  </P> <P> Angelika Volle, European specialist at the Foreign Policy Institute in Bonn,  said the problem is that "European allies have never worked out a truly  coordinated policy on the gulf."  </P> <P> Now, another potentially serious difference in the gulf conflict has surfaced  between the United States and its European allies: what to do in the event  Hussein decides to pull his forces out of Kuwait.  </P> <P> The United States, Britain and Arab allies such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt are  inclined to punish Hussein even if he does withdraw. But most European  countries -- and by far the majority of the United Nations -- reportedly would  settle for withdrawal, which is all the various Security Council resolutions  call for.  </P> <P> "If Hussein does decide to pull out," one European diplomat in London said,  "then there are going to be differing views on what to do next."  </P> <P> Lunn noted: "Some observers are calling this the worst-case scenario: Saddam  pulls out unpunished and remains in Baghdad, with sanctions removed, in a  position to do it again. This could cause consternation, and one could see a  breach among the members of the alliance on what to do next."  </P> <P> French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas argues that it is essential for Western  Europe to provide protection for Palestinians living under Israeli rule or face  Arab accusations that it is operating under a double standard in defending  Kuwaitis but not Palestinians.  </P> <P> Dumas, like Hurd and Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis, is calling  for a foreign ministers' conference to deal with the Israeli-Palestinian  dispute.  </P> <P> Some British and American hard-liners fear that Mitterrand may be seeking an  accord with Hussein that will fall short of total evacuation from Kuwait.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Israel, which has had no role in the anti-Iraq military buildup, has  been the most persistent in warning that Hussein must be brought down. Its view  has been supported by hawks in the United States, Britain and the Arab world.  </P> <P> As expressed by one diplomat in London, this view is as follows: "If Hussein is  allowed to withdraw from Kuwait unpunished, he will remain strong, in control  of his country, and in two or three years, with the oil flowing again, be in a  position to undertake a massive attack with non-conventional weapons. The  allied troops will have pulled out, and will we be prepared to deploy the same  forces again to stop him?"  </P> <P> Hans Binnendijk, director of studies at the International Institute for  Strategic Studies in London, said: "Even in the U.S., there are divisions  between the Pentagon, which doesn't want to let Hussein off the hook, and those  who would settle for a pullout. Except for Britain, the European allies are in  a much more cautious mode."  </P></p>

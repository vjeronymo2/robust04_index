			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: War rages for Treasury's ear THESE ARE heady days for Westminster backbenchers. After years as inconsequential makeweights, an anaemic government majority and the presence of Maastricht at the top of the political agenda, have contrived to give them a modicum of real power. Mr John Townend, the Conservative MP for Bridlington, demonstrated this emphatically over the weekend, when he took the government unawares by predicting on BBC television that there would be intense pressure to devalue sterling if the economy was not showing signs of recovery by the beginning of next year. A majority of Tory MPs would now favour a general realignment of the exchange rate mechanism, said Mr Townend, whose prime source of influence is as chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, to which he was recently elected, seeing off a challenge from Sir David Mitchell, a former transport minister. In this capacity, he will routinely represent Conservative backbench views on the economy, being guaranteed the ear of the Treasury team whenever he requires it. His election has widely been regarded as evidence of a drift to the right within the parliamentary party. The presence in such a position of this outspoken and staunchly Thatcherite Euro-sceptic will at least be helpful to chancellor Norman Lamont and his Treasury colleagues in one key respect. He is as convinced as they are of the importance of keeping spending under control. 'I strongly believe in a balanced budget,' he says, remarking on the additional strain under which falling Treasury revenues are putting public finances. But his stance on interest rates may contribute to an uneasy second half for Mr Lamont if the economic news does not improve. In the continued absence of 'green shoots', a bluntly delivered message to the effect that lower interest rates were necessary to kick-start a recovery might come from Mr Townend - a successful small businessman - as soon as November. If achieving this meant engineering an upward revaluation of the D-Mark or even ditching the exchange rate mechanism, this Hull-born wine merchant and hotelier would shed few tears - as his weekend comments made clear. He expresses doubt, however, that a unilateral rejection of the ERM would actually achieve the desired objective. Britain is 'really hog-tied' to the mechanism, he says, lapsing into the Humberside argot with which his conversation is peppered: Bridlington is probably the only British constituency in which pigs outnumber people. A provincial Tory squire of the old school, Mr Townend holds the sort of views on non-fiscal issues you might hear voiced a hundred times over at Conservative party conference. In favour of restoring capital punishment, he was one of 11 Tories to oppose the government's 1990 bill to allow residence for 50,000 Hong Kong families. 'I was certainly representing the views of my constituents,' he says. He is one of the true believers who still argue that the newly-elevated Baroness Thatcher would have beaten off Mr Michael Heseltine's challenge had she opted to run in the second Tory leadership ballot. Among his less trumpeted achievements, Mr Townend is credited by Mr John Prescott, the Labour deputy leadership candidate, with smoothing his path to Westminster when Mr Prescott first contested the Hull East seat 22 years ago. As the Labour frontbencher recalls, popular disenchantment with local housing policies adopted during Mr Townend's stint on Hull city council helped him home with a comfortable 22,000 majority. The defeated Tory candidate on that occasion was one Norman Stewart Hughson Lamont. Mr Tim Collins, press minder to Mr John Major during the general election campaign, has been appointed Tory party director of communications, succeeding Mr Shaun Woodward. Mr Tim Smith, Tory MP for Beaconsfield, becomes a party treasurer in succession to Lord Beaverbrook, and Mr Tony Garrett succeeds Sir John Lacy as head of campaigning.</p>

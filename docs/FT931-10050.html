			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Changes for an extended family - Anglo American's reshuffle NOT EVERY member of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa's extended 'family' was entirely happy with the outcome of the latest reshuffle of the group's international assets. But the reorganisation pleased most of those directly involved as well as long-time Anglo observers. The reshuffle involved no less than four companies perceived to be in Anglo's orbit: Charter Consolidated sold its 38.3 per cent shareholding in Johnson Matthey for Pounds 342m. A new company jointly owned by Minorco and Johannesburg Consolidated Investment acquired 20 per cent of JM and the rest of the shares went to London-based institutions. Mr Jeff Herbert, managing director of Charter, a UK industrial company, was wearing a huge smile yesterday because Charter started the ball rolling some time ago by deciding the stake in JM, the world's biggest platinum marketing company, simply had to go. It represented about half Charter's market value but Charter had limited management influence and no direct access to JM's cash flow. By putting the cash received on deposit Charter can double its income from the Pounds 6m collected in JM dividends to Pounds 12m in interest. If Mr Herbert's joy was not entirely unconfined yesterday, it was because a leak about the JM share sale forced Charter to shelve the second element in its strategy - cutting Charter completely adrift from Anglo's influence by buying back the near-36 per cent of Charter owned by Minorco, Anglo's Luxembourg-based overseas investment arm. Nevertheless, most analysts expect that will be Mr Herbert's next step and he confirmed yesterday that was one of his options. Mr Herbert said Anglo had exerted no pressure on him as he reshaped Charter during the past five years. Minorco was always supportive and helpful, not least over the decision to sell the JM shareholding. Nevertheless, some close to the deal suggested Anglo was called on to mediate about which family member should buy the JM shares. Johannesburg Consolidated Investment approached Charter to buy 20 per cent of JM last November. JCI, which has a 33 per cent shareholding and manages Rustenburg, the world's biggest platinum producer, had heard that the JM stake was up for sale and had strategic reasons for making sure it did not fall into unfriendly hands. However, Minorco did not want JCI to take more than 10 per cent of JM. Minorco has a direct 30 per cent shareholding in Engelhard, the US platinum market group and one of JM's rivals. One day Minorco might want to increase that stake but its soundings among anti-trust regulators in Europe and the US suggested that this might not be possible if 20 per cent of JM was held by any one member of the Anglo family. So a last-minute compromise was worked out for Minorco and JCI to share 20 per cent of JM, insiders suggest. From Minorco's point of view this enabled it to keep a strategic shareholding in JM, even if that stake was reduced from about 14 to 10 per cent, and still equity account its interest in the platinum company. Any threat that the reshuffle would attract the unwelcome attention of anti-trust authorities was further lessened by the sale of 18.3 per cent of JM to institutional investors, thus widening the ownership base. Barclays de Zoete Wedd and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew placed the shares at 456p each with institutions in London. Mr David Davies, chairman of JM, pointed out that once the deal was completed, JM would be 'a truly independent company.' The effective control exerted by Charter's stake would be removed and trading liquidity in JM's shares should improve - an important consideration for a company with realistic ambitions to join the FT-SE 100 index. Mr Davies also pointed out that the reshuffle would provide a direct link between JCI, manager of Rustenburg, and JM, which for 60 years has had exclusive marketing rights to Rustenburg's platinum output. This could lead to some important commercial benefits. For example, fuel cells to propel vehicles could be most important for the platinum business in 10 to 15 years time but would be extremely expensive to develop. 'So when you have JCI-Rustenburg, interested in new uses for platinum, and JM at the forefront of fuel cell technology, the two together become a potent force.' Many on the outside looking in at the complexities of the deals, agreed with Mr Rob Weinberg, analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, who suggested that 'the deal appears to have been well-structured for the benefit of all parties. Charter has disposed of its interest in JM at an attractive price, Minorco has retained its strategic interest, JCI has moved downstream in the platinum industry and strengthened its links with the company which markets its products. And the market has picked up a good line of JM stock at a 7 per cent discount to Monday's market close.'</p>

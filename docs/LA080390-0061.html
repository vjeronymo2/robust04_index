			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. LAW FIRM WINS SUIT OVER CLIENT RAIDING;  </P> <P> LITIGATION: A JUDGE RULED THAT 12 PARTNERS WHO HAD DECIDED TO LEAVE WYMAN  BAUTZER ILLEGALLY PERSUADED CLIENTS TO JUMP TO THE NEW PRACTICE THEY WERE  FORMING.  </P> <P> The prominent Los Angeles law firm of Wyman Bautzer Kuchel &amp; Silbert has  won a major victory over a group of former partners who left in 1988 and took  some of the company's biggest clients with them.  </P> <P> Retired temporary Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lester E. Olson ruled Monday  that partners of Wyman Bautzer -- then known as Wyman Bautzer Christensen  Kuchel &amp; Silbert -- did not force out the group of 12 partners, who were  led by a former colleague, Terry N. Christensen. Christensen, who left in 1987  to work for financier Kirk Kerkorian, tried to engineer a return to the firm  early in 1988 -- reportedly as managing partner -- but no agreement could be  reached.  </P> <P> A split developed, and the 12 Wyman Bautzer partners joined Christensen to form  a law firm called Christensen, White, Miller, Fink &amp; Jacobs. The group then  sued to dissolve the old Wyman Bautzer partnership, contending that relations  had become too bitter for the partners to work together.  </P> <P> Among other things, the Christensen group also objected to the way that 1988  income was distributed after the breakup.  </P> <P> Olson ruled that the Christensen group "improperly solicited" clients of Wyman  Bautzer to try to persuade them to leave the firm and hire the Christensen  group. This was done even before the Christensen lawyers left Wyman Bautzer, he  said. Some of the clients who switched firms were Capital Cities/ABC, MGM/UA  and Campbell Soup.  </P> <P> "A certain amount of dissension and angst lurks in the cavernous streets of  Century City and pervades the business of the practice of law there and in  other parts of metropolitan Los Angeles County," Olson wrote. "Therefore, what  might at first blush appear to be insoluble disputes, bitterness and dissension  become management problems capable of solution, at least when they are not  subjected to the outside interference imposed by Christensen."  </P> <P> Christensen denied that his firm did anything wrong in soliciting clients or in  the way the lawyers left Wyman Bautzer.  </P> <P> "Clients have a right to change law firms whenever they want to," he said.  Christensen said the firm plans to appeal the decision.  </P> <P> Howard L. Weitzman, a partner with Wyman Bautzer, called the ruling "a complete  and total win."  </P> <P> "There's nothing wrong with leaving and going into business for yourself, and  there's nothing wrong with competing," Weitzman said. But, he added, "when they  actually made the move, they tried to blow up the law firm."  </P> <P> The ruling detailed some contentious doings at Wyman Bautzer, including a  "temper tantrum" by one attorney during a partners meeting (he stayed with the  firm) and the appropriation by another attorney (who left with the dissidents)  of eight choice Dodger season tickets.  </P> <P> At the time, the tickets were the subject of a lawsuit filed by Rosalind Weiner  Wyman, widow of one of the law firm's founders. Wyman, who as a member of the  Los Angeles City Council was instrumental in bringing the Dodgers to Los  Angeles in 1958, contended that the law firm breached an agreement that would  have given her the chance to buy the front-row box seats behind the Dodger  dugout under certain conditions.  </P> <P> That dispute was smoothed over. The tickets were returned to Wyman Bautzer, and  a settlement was negotiated under which Rosalind Wyman gets the seats for one  out of every three games.  </P> <P> In the upcoming part of the trial that determines the amount of damages,  Christensen White must show "that there is no causal connection between their  breach of duty and the loss of certain clients of the old Wyman firm," Olson  said. That phase also will determine whether Wyman Bautzer owes Terry  Christensen any more money after previously paying him $271,000.  </P></p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Arts: An Oliver] for the nineties - A spectacular staging evokes Dickens' world of Romantic despair The new Cameron Mackintosh production of Lionel Bart's 1960 musical Oliver] is - of course - a spectacular hit. It has been announced for months; bookings are already being taken for five months hence; and I noticed, as I rushed to my deadline from the theatre, that Liberty's already has a window of the 'Who will buy' scene. To find fault with a hit of this order would be about as practical as trying to stand in the way of a herd of charging bison - though I, who have a kamikaze instinct in these matters, have a fault or two I will in due course try to find. But first I report that I did all those things you hope to do at a musical - gasped, laughed, cried. And the composer, who was sitting behind me on opening night, sounded as if he was hyperventilating - with, I hope, pleasure. Spectacular is the key word. Sam Mendes's staging starts with a terrific image - Oliver's pregnant mother Agnes rushing in lonely misery against a violent storm - and at once we are in the bleak world of Romantic despair that is vital to the original Dickens novel. Then in moments we are in the symmetrical militaristic regime of the workhouse. The next half-hour, it must be said, sags. The original Oliver] was spectacular too, by the standards of its day; it was probably the first West End show I ever saw, as a titch in short trousers, and my memories are largely of the amazing revolving stage. In the 1994 Oliver] the stage does not turn - but once we are on the streets of London, in the company of the Artful Dodger, Anthony Ward's scenery begins to do marvels. Brilliantly, Ward puts St Paul's Cathedral and other sights before us in breathtaking succession - and reminds us that Bart's musical is actually a lovesong to London. What a gift to the tourist trade this staging is] And yet resident Londoners may watch it with even stronger emotion. Bart's Oliver] is also a lovesong to the traditions of the music-hall. Bart, in 1960, was far from original in this (it is, indeed, easy to see that he was simply doing to Dickens what My Fair Lady had done to Shaw, and that 'Consider yourself' very cleverly repeats the formula of 'Get me to the church on time') but so what? In the 1994 staging, it is Matthew Bourne's choreography that is most alert to the music-hall element of this musical; and, watching some of the wonderful traditional steps Bourne gives Fagin (Jonathan Pryce) and his thief-children in 'Be Back Soon', I cried in wonder. What British choreographer since Frederick Ashton has shown so much sense of the musical wit of these old music-hall steps? Still, this staging is better seen than heard. William David Brown's orchestrations and Martin Koch's musical supervision do Bart's score no favours. The most original and beautiful musical episode in Oliver] is 'Who will Buy?' - the fantasia of arching street-melodies all overlapping and prompting Oliver himself to his one moment of lyric radiance ('Who will buy this wonderful morning?'). The street-songs (which so touchingly show Bart's love of bygone London traditions) should drop upon the still morning air and illumine it. But the whole scene here feels pre-packaged and undersung. The ensemble radiance that should infect Oliver is here replaced by neat, tepid cuteness. Little Adam Searles's Artful Dodger is the first performance that gives the production the shot of spontaneous energy and charm it needs. He is only a child, but he has the kind of winning chuckle, smile, and bubble that many adult performers try for in vain. He and his chums, leading us to Fagin and the thieves' kitchen introduce us to the production's star - Jonathan Pryce. Here too is an artist who takes command of the whole show from his first appearance. Tall, piratical, canny, Pryce is a consummate performer; just hear how he draws out an elaborate cadenza in 'Pick a Pocket or Two' and then, economically but deftly, coughs. Next we meet Sally Dexter's Nancy - not only the best singing of the evening but also the most generous attention to her every fellow performer and the most thrilling energy. These three performers carry the show to triumph. And yet, and yet . . . Several times my eyes filled with tears, not thanks to the current performance, but because it so frequently failed to match the eloquence of the original cast album - which, ah me, I grew up on. The Palladium cast is strong in rhythm (except in the slow, lyrical numbers) but shockingly dull in melodic phrasing or in dynamic variety. The great ascents of Beadle Bumble's 'One Boy, Boy for Sale' fall flat, as do the plaintive repetitions of 'Where is Love?' from Oliver (James Daley). The Sowerberries wreck the witty, urbane, creepy 'That's your funeral' by shouting it. For this, Mendes - sometimes Bourne too - must take responsibility; but what the show needs most is better musicianship. Neither Pryce nor Dexter make the great impression that they could in their big solos. You will never know why Oliver] inspires such affection if you only listen to the current cast. But anyone with an eye will be impressed and sometimes thrilled. At the Palladium, W1</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BAIL $2.5 MILLION FOR ACCUSED KILLER  </P> <P> Bradford Warren Powers Jr. told police that he decided to "take the law into  his own hands and make the doctors pay" for his father's death when he shot  four people in a rampage at Mission Bay Memorial Hospital, a deputy district  attorney said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Prosecutor Robert Eichler made that assertion in a brief San Diego Municipal  Court hearing in which Powers pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder and  three counts of attempted murder.  </P> <P> Powers, his eyes moist and bloodshot, spoke only once to the judge, when he  interrupted the hearing and said: "I don't wish for bail."  </P> <P> Judge William Woodward set bail at $2.5 million, despite Deputy Dist. Atty.  Robert Eichler's request that the 46-year-old La Jolla man be held under no  bail. The prosecutor said he wanted no bail because Powers poses a threat to  the community and because he had planned to flee to Oregon before he turned  himself in to Oceanside police, an hour after he allegedly opened fire in an  emergency room Saturday.  </P> <P> The spray of bullets killed a nurse and a student trainee -- on his first day  at the job -- and wounded the on-duty physician and the father of a patient.  </P> <P> The victim involved in the third count of attempted murder was identified as  nurse Terri Fagen, but Eichler declined to elaborate on what happened to her.  </P> <P> Asked after the hearing whether he would seek the death penalty, Eichler said  he was still reviewing the case. "It's a double homicide -- that makes it a  possibility just by definition," he said.  </P> <P> The shootings occurred about eight hours after Brad Powers Sr. died in the same  emergency room, suffering a heart attack while doctors were attempting to  repair a ruptured abdominal aneurysm.  </P> <P> Authorities allege that the younger Powers, who has had psychiatric problems  dating back at least 25 years, was distraught over the death of his father, a  well-known architectural illustrator, and returned to the scene to seek  revenge.  </P> <P> In the days since the shootings, a dark side to the father-son relationship has  emerged. The younger Powers, who lived at home and seldom held a job for more  than several months, was occasionally physically and verbally abusive to his  father, a doctor and a family attorney said in telephone interviews.  </P> <P> At the request of a family member, the coroner's office investigated whether  physical abuse had contributed to the elder Powers' death, said Dr. H. E.  Hammerstead, the doctor who tried to save the aging man when he was brought  into the emergency room. The coroner's investigation, however, found no signs  of physical abuse, he said. Officials with the coroner's office declined to  comment.  </P> <P> The elder Powers, 75 when he died, had postponed his retirement for fear that  he lacked funds to support his wife, their son Powers Jr. and his two children,  now 20 and 23, said Marvin Mizeur, an attorney who has known the family for 16  years.  </P> <P> "There were many episodes where (Powers Jr.) was emotionally out of control. I  have seen him calm one moment and then blow up the next," said Mizeur, who  represented the younger Powers during part of his divorce case and continued to  assist the elder Powers in legal matters.  </P> <P> "His family indicated that he made threats to (Powers Sr.) and struck him once  or twice," said Mizeur, who added that these reports of violence occurred  during the '70s.  </P> <P> Though the younger Powers felt close to his mother, Mary, he was often hostile  to his father, Mizeur said. And the elder Powers felt threatened by his son.  "It was not a pleasant situation for Brad Sr. for the last 10 years. And it has  gotten progressively worse," Mizeur said. "I do know certainly there was verbal  abuse -- that was practically a constant thing."  </P> <P> In 1965, Powers Sr. filed a petition in San Diego Superior Court to begin  having his son tested for mental illness with the possibility of having him  committed to authorities, court records show. Powers Jr., then 21, single and  unemployed, was examined by Dr. Carl E. Graner.  </P> <P> But the elder Powers changed his mind and suddenly withdrew his petition.  Family members were unavailable Tuesday to talk to The Times.  </P> <P> Police said the handgun allegedly used in the shootings had belonged to the  Powers family and was kept at the home for protection. The 6-inch, 8-shot  .22-caliber revolver was found in Powers Jr.'s white Corvette Monday.  </P> <P> A memorial service for the dead -- nurse Deborah Kay Burke and Edward Thomas  Rooney, a student trainee -- is scheduled for Thursday at the hospital.  </P></p>

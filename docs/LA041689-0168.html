			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SPANGLER HOLDS OFF TRACK VETERANS AT SAUGUS FOR 1ST WIN  </P> <P> Keith Spangler found himself ahead of some really big wheels with eight laps  remaining in Saturday night's NASCAR Sportsman "40" before a crowd of 3,697 at  Saugus Speedway.  </P> <P> Spangler, a 19-year-old track sophomore from Northridge, cruised around the  one-third-mile oval under a yellow flag, leading the pack and quite likely  licking his chops at the prospect of taking his first career checkered flag.  </P> <P> Yet Spangler had to be glancing in his rear-view mirror.  </P> <P> In second place was Gary Sigman of Carson, currently atop the Sportsman  Division standings three weeks into the season and winner of the evening's  trophy dash.  </P> <P> In third was three-time defending Sportsman champion Dave Phipps of Simi  Valley, currently sixth behind Spangler in the standings and winless thus far  this season.  </P> <P> Yet, it was experience that yielded to youth -- though only by the margin of a  bumper.  </P> <P> Spangler withstood a second yellow flag and hard charges by both Sigman and  Phipps to take the flag and increase his lead over Phipps, which stood at seven  points when the evening began.  </P> <P> "I thought I was as good as they were," Spangler said. "They're only human. So  am I. I just tried to drive as hard as I could. That's about all you can hope  for."  </P> <P> Spangler moved into the lead for good when Jim Morrill of Lancaster spun out on  Lap 17 and surrendered the lead.  </P> <P> Canoga Park's Doug Renno posted his first career victory in dramatic fashion,  winning the 25-lap Hobby Stock oval main event over Brian Kelley of Arleta.  </P> <P> A nudge from Kelley nearly forced Renno to spin out in Turn 4 of the final lap.  But Renno's tires held and he beat Kelley to the flag by a half-length.  </P> <P> Kelley lamented Saugus' inverted starting system, which places fast qualifiers  in the rear in order to promote a more competitive contest. "Starting in the  back," he said, shaking his head. "By the time you get to the front, the race  is over."  </P> <P> Kelley moved steadily through the pack until moving into second on Lap 16.  Renno had assumed an eight-car-length lead, but a yellow flag on Lap 23, caused  by Scott Roark of Agua Dulce slamming into a wall, set up a trophy dash to the  finish.  </P> <P> "One more lap," Kelley said. "Oh, man, I was trying so hard. But he held good."  </P> <P> Joe Barreras Jr. of Canyon Country won the 15-lap, Hobby Stock figure 8 main  event.  </P></p>

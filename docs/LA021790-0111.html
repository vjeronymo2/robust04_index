			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> TEXAS;  </P> <P> SETTLEMENT REACHED IN FATAL BUS CRASH  </P> <P> A Texas couple will receive $3.3 million in the first out-of-court settlement  reached in the deaths of 21 children in a school bus accident, a lawyer said in  Houston. Kenneth Sparks, who represents Raul and Margarita Ortega of Alton,  whose son died in the accident, said that a $1.5-million settlement agreed to  by Valley Coca-Cola Bottling Co. would provide an interest-bearing series of  monthly payments guaranteed for 35 years. The bus and the company's truck  collided at an intersection in Alton last September, sending the bus into a  water-filled pit.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ROCKET TEST SITE EXPLOSION HURTS MAN, STARTS FIRE  </P> <P> An explosion caused by a liquid oxygen spill at a Rockwell International test  site near Simi Valley injured a worker and triggered a small brush fire,  Ventura County fire officials said Monday.  </P> <P> The brush fire broke out shortly after the 4:12 p.m. explosion at Rockwell's  Santa Susana Field Laboratory, company spokesman Paul Sewell said.  </P> <P> The blaze consumed less than an eighth of an acre about five miles south of  Simi Valley and was under control within half an hour.  </P> <P> Sewell said the accident occurred when the worker, who was pumping liquid  oxygen from a 28,000-gallon tank, spilled some of the highly explosive  material.  </P> <P> The worker, whose name was not released, suffered a minor cut on his hand and  was taken to Humana Hospital West Hills for treatment. Officials suspect that  the explosion was due to equipment failure or human error.  </P> <P> "It's not a hazardous procedure under normal circumstances. This is something  that's been done literally a thousand times," Sewell said.  </P> <P> Sewell said investigators have secured the area, a test site for booster rocket  engines used in satellite launches. A test scheduled for today has been  canceled until Rockwell completes the investigation.  </P> <P> About 50 Ventura County firefighters and a crew of eight Rockwell firefighters  responded to the brush fire.  </P></p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Ulster talks cry out for early success: Leaders of Northern Ireland's main parties speak to David Owen on possible problems The gamble appears to have failed. Now it is time to revert to more orthodox methods. With hopes of an early IRA response to the Downing Street declaration fading fast, London has been trying to inject momentum into the three-year-old talks process with Ulster's non-violent political parties. It badly needs a success to prevent the impetus behind the drive for a lasting settlement for the province from draining away. There are also hopes that progress in the political talks might yet be the lever that eventually persuades republican leaders to ditch the armed struggle and embrace the process. As Dr John Alderdice, leader of the non-sectarian Alliance party, puts it: 'As Sinn Fein sees the train drawing out of the station, they may be prepared to jump on board.' Yet a series of Financial Times interviews in recent days with the leaders of the four main constitutional parties indicates that many serious obstacles still stand in the way of a positive outcome. The leaders' comments, in brief, point to a long and tortuous process with success far from assured. The words with which the Rev Ian Paisley greeted the announcement by the then Northern Ireland secretary Mr Peter Brooke in March 1991 that a basis for formal political talks existed still seem apposite. 'The gate into the field has been opened,' the leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party said at the time. 'But . . . there is a lot of hard ploughing in front of us.' The main problem areas appear to be as follows: The 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed' formula. This, by definition, precludes the possibility of gradual progress. Every syllable and punctuation mark has to be agreed before anything can be set in stone. Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, regards the principle as 'crucially important'. It ensures the talks address all the relationships - within Northern Ireland, between north and south, and between the two governments, he says. An agreement confined to the question of 'who wields power in Northern Ireland' would not necessarily solve the province's problems, Mr Hume believes. Unionists favour a less ambitious framework paving the way for a return to devolved government in Ulster, independent of what might be agreed in the other two 'strands' of the talks process. They point out that a blueprint for an Ulster assembly was drawn up by a working party comprising all four constitutional parties during the talks initiated by Mr Brooke. Mr Paisley says openly that, as far as he is concerned, the formula no longer applies. It was exposed as a 'fallacy' during the 'failed' Brooke talks process, he says. How to handle the relationship between the north and Dublin. There is no disguising the fundamental differences between the participants on this second strand of the talks process. An Ulster Unionist party document to be published this month will argue that the relationship should be handled by ad hoc meetings between Irish ministers and Ulster assembly representatives. But proposals implying that no separate north-south institution - such as a dedicated secretariat - is necessary would probably be anathema to the SDLP and to Dublin. Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, goes so far as to say: 'Not only are the institutionalised bits unnecessary, but they are unconstitutional. 'They would tend to tie elected representatives from one part of the United Kingdom into bargains/arrangements/undertakings without our sovereign government being aware of it,' he says. The DUP's boycott of the talks. Not only is Sinn Fein excluded from the talks process. So at present is the DUP. While this could make agreement between those who are participating less difficult to achieve, it might also undermine its effectiveness. As Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, said yesterday: 'A political settlement that brings peace is one that has to have widespread acceptance.' The current DUP line is that it will not return to the talks until London explicitly rules out any possibility of a united Ireland. According to one senior DUP official, London would have to 'embark on a new security policy that demonstrates the British are here to stay, irrespective of consent'. The reluctance of some participants to move from bilateral discussions back to a round-table format. After the experience of the Brooke talks, some are wary of returning to what they see as the 'goldfish-bowl' of round-table discussions. There is though a general recognition that the current time-consuming bilateral structure cannot continue indefinitely. Mr Molyneaux favours 'a fair amount of commonality' being established before participants go back to sitting around a table. The two governments' apparent inability to prevent a continuation of terrorism. It is in Mr Hume's words 'quite obvious' that the talks process's prospects of success would be improved immeasurably if they took place 'in an atmosphere of total peace'. That is why the SDLP leader says he has pleaded for patience in awaiting Sinn Fein's response to the joint declaration. Continuing terrorist killings can only exacerbate tensions. But can a cessation of violence be delivered even in the event of an end to the IRA's 25-year campaign? Mr Paisley, for one, is pessimistic.</p>

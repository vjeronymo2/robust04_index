			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Stephen Alderman, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary staff] </F>   [Text] Britain's Royal Marines are to help train a new  Baltic peacekeeping battalion, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind  announced in the Commons today.    He disclosed that he had today formally agreed that the UK  would contribute to the training of a Baltic joint peacekeeping  battalion composed of contingents from Lithuania, Latvia and  Estonia.    This was part of a phased multi-national programme of  assistance, Mr Rifkind said at question time.    He added: "The UK's contribution will be led by the Royal  Marines who will provide individual and company level training."    A Defence Ministry statement said the move followed a recent  meeting at which the defence ministers of the three Baltic  states indicated their wish to accept UK and Nordic offers of  assistance.    The statement added: "The UK fully supports the Baltic  states' intention to form a joint peacekeeping battalion and  welcomes the prospect that, once established and trained, the  battalion would be available for UN peacekeeping duties.    ``This is an important venture, both politically and  militarily, and provides a tangible demonstration of  outward-looking Baltic cooperation, and an opportunity to  further consolidate and build on the excellent progress already  made in strengthening political and military relations between  the UK and the Baltic States.''    The precise nature of assistance was now being examined by  experts and officials would meet later this month in Copenhagen  to agree the next stages, the statement added.</p>

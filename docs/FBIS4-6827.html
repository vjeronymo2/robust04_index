			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP from Washington] </F>   [Text] The ROK and U.S. Governments are having a  difference of opinion over the export of the ROK defense  industry, said officials of the two countries on 21 April.    According to ROK and U.S. sources, the ROK Government, via a  diplomatic channel, has officially asked the United States to  approve of the ROK's sale of military equipment to other  countries, However, the United States has showed no reaction so  far.    Under the Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] on the defense  industry signed between the two governments, in principle, the  ROK has to have U.S. approval in order to sell military  equipment manufactured with U.S. technology to a third country.    Pointing out that the details of the MOU were eased in 1982  and 1989 to pave the way for the ROK to more readily export  military equipment, the sources said that the recent official  request was based on this adjustment.    The U.S. Government was originally scheduled to respond to  the ROK Government's request on sales in some 15 fields,  including artillery of various types and armored personnel  carriers, to Southeast Asia and Latin America by last February,  but has yet failed to respond, added the sources.</p>

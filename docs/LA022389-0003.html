			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETAIL PRICE RISE IS HIGHEST IN 2 YEARS;  </P> <P> GREENSPAN CALLS 0.6% JANUARY FIGURE DISTURBING; INTEREST RATE BOOST SEEN  </P> <P> Consumer prices leaped forward 0.6% in January, the largest such increase in  two years, the Labor Department said Wednesday in a report that rattled  financial markets and raised the specter of higher interest rates as the  Federal Reserve cracks down.  </P> <P> Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, alerting Congress for the second  time in as many days to the perils of accelerating inflation, labeled the  unexpectedly high jump in prices "disturbing" and "worrisome." He warned that  the nation's economy may be faced with a no-win choice between still higher  inflation and a serious recession if the central bank does not succeed in  damping the price pressures now.  </P> <P> On Wall Street, share prices tumbled from the opening bell and the Dow Jones  industrial average ended the day down 42.50 points, apparently bringing the new  year's rally to a halt. (Details in Business.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fed Likely to Act  </P> <P> Investors apparently saw the price figures as strong new provocation for the  Fed to push interest rates sharply higher to curb the surge, crimping economic  growth in the process.  </P> <P> "There is little doubt that inflation is rising," said Donald Straszheim, an  analyst at the Merrill Lynch brokerage firm in New York. "The question now is  not whether there will be worse inflation this year, but how bad the numbers  become . . . . I think Greenspan knows the next step is a wage-price spiral and  that's why he will keep tightening" credit.  </P> <P> The 0.6% January consumer price increase, after two consecutive months of  modest 0.3% rises, was the largest advance in the consumer price index since  January, 1987, when it jumped 0.7%. More ominous, perhaps, was the fact that  wholesale prices for the period, reported two weeks ago, moved ahead a full  percentage point, almost certainly foreshadowing still more retail inflation in  the months ahead.  </P> <P> Partly because of that wholesale jump, economists had been prepared for an  inflationary advance of about 0.5%. But a price surge of 0.5% outside the  volatile categories of energy and food gave them particular pause.  </P> <P> "This was not good . . . " said David Wyss, of Data Resources Inc., the  Lexington, Mass., economic forecasting firm. "The mix that made up the number  is worse than we expected." Wyss' firm now sees inflation at an annual rate of  more than 5% this winter, tapering off only slightly later in the year.  </P> <P> Straszheim predicted that annual inflation could hit 5.5% to 6%. The rate for  1988 and 1987 was 4.4%.  </P> <P> Greenspan, in his second day of congressional testimony on the Fed's monetary  policy, said a recent rise in wage costs was probably the reason that prices at  the consumer level were beginning to climb more rapidly.  </P> <P> "What is worrisome is the fact that there is a trend," Greenspan told a House  Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs subcommittee. He stressed the central bank's  determination to fight inflation by trying to slow economic growth with higher  interest rates. "The purpose of our policy is to make certain that trend does  not continue," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Danger of Recession  </P> <P> Greenspan was blunt about the potential costs if the Fed's credit tightening  fails to curb escalating inflation. "If inflation re-emerges, I think a  recession will move up on us much more quickly than we can imagine," he warned.  "And when it occurs, it will be a prolonged one."  </P> <P> There were few redeeming features in Wednesday's Labor Department report. One  was that several of the large increases in categories other than food and  energy could be explained away as once-a-year price increases that most likely  will not recur until next January.  </P> <P> Among these, noted Stacy Kottman of the economic forecasting project at Georgia  State University in Atlanta, could be the 0.8% increases in medical care and  medical services. Both probably were magnified by annual increases in insurance  premiums that click in during January.  </P> <P> Similarly, prices for new cars -- up 0.7% -- and auto financing charges -- up  1.6% -- reflected the fact that special industry rebates for car and truck  purchases lapsed in January. The rebates were largely reinstated by  mid-February, suggesting that car price inflation, at least, will moderate in  the next price report a month from now.  </P> <P> "January is a time of year when you have price changes in quite a few  services," Kottman said. "These won't continue at this rate as you go through  the year, so we won't get this much inflation all year."  </P> <P> But the broad range of the price trend was seen as alarming, nonetheless.  </P> <P> The price of admission to theaters, movies, concerts and other performing arts  increased 1.2% during the month, helping push the entertainment category up  0.8%. Food prices rose 0.7%, driven primarily by steep, drought-caused advances  of more than a percentage point for beef, pork and poultry. The price of motor  fuels jumped 1%.  </P> <P> Overall, consumer price inflation was moving at an annual rate of more than 7%  last month.  </P> <P> Even without food and energy, the annual rate of inflation last month was about  6%. So Wednesday's forecasts of inflation later in the year moderating to a  range between 5% and 6% seemed at best cold comfort.  </P> <P> Before seasonal adjustment, the consumer price index advanced 0.6 to 121.1 of  its 1982-1984 base of 100, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods  costing $100 during the base period would have cost $121.10 in January, 60  cents more than in December.  </P> <P> In the Los Angeles-Anaheim-Long Beach metropolitan area, consumer prices rose  0.3% without seasonal adjustment, and, over the last 12 months, prices in the  metropolitan area were up 4.8%, compared to a 4.7% increase nationwide.  </P></p>

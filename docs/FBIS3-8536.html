			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna, March 10 (AFP)--Talks on a proposed  Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia could be concluded here Friday  [11 March] with leaders from both sides flying in to work out  the final details, the head of the Croat delegation said  Thursday.    Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, in Vienna Thursday,  is to participate Friday "for the final phase, if the talks end  then," Bosnian justice minister Kasim Trnka said.    The head of the Croatian delegation, Zagreb's deputy foreign  minister Ivo Sanader, said further discussions were needed on  the "demarcation of the Croat and Moslem cantons" in the future  federation.    The Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic might also  participate in the talks Friday, Trnka said.    U.S. special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, Charles Redman,  returned to Vienna, following trips to Belgrade, Zagreb and  Sarajevo earlier this week in an unsuccessful effort to convince  the Serbs to join the federation plan and end more than two  years of bloodshed.    There was "still a lot of work to do" on the federation  before negotations were completed, he said.    The talks are focusing on a U.S.-brokered federation plan  signed last week in Washington. It calls for Bosnia's Moslem  and Croats to join their territories under a loose federation  that could eventually be linked with Croatia.    Thursday's session was focussing on the number and  delineation of cantons in the future federation, according to a  Bosnian official.    "There could be three Croat cantons and four Moslem  cantons,"  he said.    The talks were also to cover the organisation of Bosnian and  Croatian forces, until recently engaged in bitter fighting in  central Bosnia, and the federation's political structures.    In Zagreb, the Croat news agency Hina said U.S. General John  Galvin, the former head of allied forces in Europe, flew in from  Sarajevo to the southern Croatian city of Split Thursday to  prepare a meeting the following day between Bosnia's Moslem and  Croat military leaders, Generals Rasim Delic and Ante Roso.    The Friday talks, expected to be also attended by U.S.  General Larry Smith from NATO's Naples base, are to focus on the  military aspects of the Vienna talks, including a joint command.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 9 (CTK) -- The election of Richard  Falbr as chairman of the Bohemian-Moravian Chamber of Trade  Unions (CMKOS) is more favorable than unfavorable, Premier  Vaclav Klaus said today.    "Of course a more moderate candidate won," he said, adding  that it was not really up to the government to make such an  evaluation.    Congress delegates today voted down a suggestion to withdraw  from the General Agreement between the unions, government, and  employers as a "last resort" to President Vaclav Havel's  signature of the new labor law amendment, which the unions had  strongly opposed.</p>

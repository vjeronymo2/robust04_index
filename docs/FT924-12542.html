			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Skanska Yesterday's warning that writedowns at Skanska will be even bigger this year than in 1991 is a sober reminder of the Swedish influence on European property markets. In one of the last big binges of the late 1980s Swedish investors reacted to the lifting of domestic capital controls by pouring money into German, Belgian, Dutch and British real estate. They are now suffering the hangover. Many have already been wiped out; others or their bankers are well represented in the list of potential sellers waiting for the first flicker of an upturn. Skanska certainly paid top dollar for two City developments, one of which remains tenantless while the other is just 15 per cent let. To be fair there is no indication that the company will do other than hang on to these investments, and it has the balance-sheet strength to do so. For the moment there are presumably enough headaches back home, what with extraordinary losses from unauthorised dollar speculation and mismatched loans. Bottom fishers may be attracted by the SKr48 share price given net assets of perhaps SKr80-90 per share and signs of resilience in the main contracting businesses. Assets, though, are hard to value these days, not least in Scandinavia. There is also a feeling in Stockholm that things will get worse before they get better.</p>

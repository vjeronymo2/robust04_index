			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy's  control the al-'Anad Air Base, their liquidation of the  rebellious forces of apostasy, treason, and secession in  Shabwah, and their seizure of the strategic 'Atiq and its  adjacent areas are evidence of the determination of these forces  to execute their military tasks. The forces of unity and  constitutional legitimacy should be commended for their concern  for saving civilians from the effects of the military clashes  with the forces controlled by the supporters of the apostasy and  secession gang.    We want to reiterate that the overwhelming victory in  Shabwah, and, particularly in 'Atiq -- which is considered one  of the most important strategic areas purged of the secessionist  forces by the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy --  is considered an important stride toward ridding the homeland of  the secessionists who sold themselves to the devil. We are not  exaggerating if we say that the forces of unity and  constitutional legitimacy, which are achieving successive  victories, will never hesitate in assuming their military tasks  imposed by their faith in God, the homeland, the revolution, and  unity and by their loyalty to constitutional legitimacy and  democracy, which we accepted as our option to build a new Yemen,  the Yemen of progress and prosperity. This is a firm conviction  entrenched in the minds of our Armed Forces, who are protecting  the homeland and unity and defending constitutional legitimacy.  This should also dominate the minds of the remaining men  carrying arms in the misled units that are still being moved by  the rebellious and secessionist gang against the forces of unity  and constitutional legitimacy.    Those who are still receiving orders from the gang of  apostasy and secession -- the gang which declared its secession  with impudence and blatant challenge toward the will of people  -- must realize that they are now considered mercenaries. It  would be better for them to stand at the side of unity and  people and to defend constitutional legitimacy. The rebellious  and secessionist gang, which is receiving money from the enemies  of the homeland -- in addition to the money they have plundered  -- is only interested in destroying the gains and achievements  of the people, in shedding blood, and spreading death. Then,  this gang plans escape with the millions they have plundered to  outside the homeland.    Therefore, we urge the units still being controlled by the  gang of apostasy and secession to join the forces of unity and  constitutional legitimacy and to stand where the Yemeni people  want them. The units that are still under the control of the  scum from the secessionist rebellious clique, should realize  that al-Bid and his treacherous rebellious gang -- the enemies  of the people who declared secession -- are playing an agent  role and do not care about the consequences. Their imaginary  state, which they have proclaimed, is not set up on land or  based on legitimacy. This state has no supporters or position  from which it can defend its presence.    Thus, the proclamation of a secessionist state is only an  illusion. The forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy and  the Yemeni people know how to react to this madness that  prompted the forces of mutiny and treason to announce the  secession statement of hallucination, which exposed the nature  of the gang of apostasy and secession and revealed their hostile  objectives against the Yemeni people and their unity.    As we speak today about the ugliest creatures -- whom our  people have known and who lived among our people, humiliated  them, seized the liberties of their sons, desecrated their  sanctities, and tampered with their potentials and resources --  we urge the sons of beloved Aden, who are suffering from the  injustice of the stupid followers of the traitors 'Ali Salim  al-Bid and his deviant clique, to wake up. This clique has no  concern for the fate of the misled people. If the deviant  al-Bid was able to escape from Aden, leaving the misled ones for  their dark destiny -- if they continue to follow the orders of  his clique -- he, and his men, will not escape punishment. The  forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy will chase him as  well as his clique, which escaped with him to the Hadhramaut  Governorate, whose people have suffered from the humiliation and  injustice at the hands of the gang of apostasy and secession in  the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. The sons of Hadhramaut will  never forget the killing of the ulema and the prominent figures  in [word indistinct]. Neither will they forget those who were  buried alive because they differed with the YSP. The sons of  Hadhramaut will stand, in words and deeds, at the side of the  forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy. They know full  well that these forces seek the wellbeing of the homeland and  its people and the purging of the Yemeni homeland from the filth  of the apostasy and secession gang which has become the  bitterest enemy of the Yemeni people, their unity, gains, and  national achievements. This gang will certainly have its  inevitable punishment, and nothing will obstruct the will of God  and the patient Yemeni people.</p>

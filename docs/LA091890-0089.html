			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SIX CITIES STILL IN CONTENTION FOR '96 GAMES  </P> <P> If the International Olympic Committee has a sentimental bone in its collective  body, the ancient city of Athens should win in a walk Tuesday when the members  choose the site of the 1996 Summer Games.  </P> <P> But in an era of broadcast contracts worth megabucks, mammoth national teams,  and mushrooming security and environmental worries, will sentiment be enough to  win the day?  </P> <P> That's the question nobody could answer here Monday as the 87 current members  of the Games' governing board met in a sprawling hotel complex. Tuesday they  will vote among Athens and five other cities contending for the Olympiad that  will mark the 100th birthday of the modern revival of the ancient Greek  athletic competition.  </P> <P> "This choice is so up in the air that nobody, on the committee or off, can  predict who will win," said Robert Helmick, the Des Moines lawyer who has one  of the two U.S. votes on the committee as president of the U.S. Olympic  Committee. Anita DeFrantz, a former Olympic rower and president of the Amateur  Athletic Foundation, has the other.  </P> <P> The six contending cities -- Athens; Atlanta; Belgrade; Manchester, England;  Melbourne, Australia; and Toronto -- each will make a half-hour presentation to  the committee Tuesday, and Helmick said that could be unusually important this  time.  </P> <P> "It's like a jury trial," he explained. "In a close case, the summation can be  decisive."  </P> <P> Following these final plugs, the vote will be taken in a series of secret  ballots. The sealed envelope containing the name of the winning city will be  opened, Oscar-style, by IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch.  </P> <P> With Samaranch not voting, the winner needs its name on 44 ballots. The low  city drops out in each round until the winner is chosen, and the results of  each round are posted before the next round.  </P> <P> Although nobody here was predicting a winner, there is a strong emotional pull  on the committee toward Athens.  </P> <P> The first Olympic Games -- probably a series of running, chariot, spear, and  archery competitions among Athenian soldiers -- were held near the base of  Mount Olympus in Greece during the 8th century B.C. The signature event of the  modern Olympics, the marathon, is based on a famous moment in Greek history,  when the Athenian Army messenger Phidippides ran 26 miles 385 yards and then,  with his dying breath, gasped out the words "Victory at Marathon!"  </P> <P> When the French nobleman Baron de Coubertin convinced the world to revive the  Olympic tradition in 1896, he held the first Olympiad in Athens, and the  marathon race traced Phidippides' steps.  </P> <P> All that history would be relived, of course, if the centenary of de  Coubertin's Olympic dream were scheduled for Athens.  </P> <P> In addition to history, Athens has excellent athletic facilities that clearly  have impressed committee members, Helmick said. But Athens also has major  traffic bottlenecks and a pollution problem so severe that the ancient Greek  temples are corroding. If air pollution in Greece is so bad it can imperil the  Parthenon, what will it do to an athlete's lungs?  </P> <P> Athens, Belgrade, and Manchester all face a geographic problem as well. Since  winter and summer Olympics will be held in Europe in 1992 (Albertville, France,  and Barcelona), the committee may want to move to a different continent for the  '96 Games.  </P> <P> Atlanta and Toronto have a similar problem because Olympiads were held in their  countries -- Los Angeles (1984) and Calgary (1988) -- within the decade.  Melbourne's boosters have been pushing this geographic argument hard, noting  that no Olympics has been held in the Southern Hemisphere since 1956 -- in  Melbourne.  </P> <P> The Atlanta contingent here, which includes Mayor Maynard Jackson and former  congressman and mayor Andrew Young, has been talking up both the city's  old-fashioned charm and its up-to-date broadcast facilities. Among other  things, Atlanta has promised customized television feeds of the '96 Games all  over the world.  </P> <P> Amid the low-key campaigning of the six cities, the IOC acted on a few other  issues. The members decided Monday to continue the ban against South African  participation in the Olympics but left open the possibility that the political  changes there could prompt a reversal.  </P> <P> The IOC said it was joining with five national mints to produce a series of  legal coins carrying the Olympic rings as part of its 100th birthday  celebrations. The coin program will involve Austria, Australia, Canada, France  and Greece, each issuing one gold and two silver coins in succession from 1992  to 1996. Each will have its own theme. The U.S. Mint was approached about  joining the coin program but a difficult legislative process ruled out American  involvement.  </P> <P> The committee also voted to continue the practice of releasing a flock of doves  (actually, white pigeons are normally used) during Olympic opening ceremonies.  Some pigeons evidently were roasted by the Olympic flame on opening day of the  Seoul Olympics in 1988, and that prompted animal rights groups to demand a  change for future Olympiads.  </P></p>

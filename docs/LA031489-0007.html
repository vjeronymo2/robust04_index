			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Leftist rebels in El Salvador dynamited an election center near San Salvador,  the capital, and threatened to target election workers unless they resign. The  rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which has called for a boycott  of the March 19 presidential election, also repeated its warning for vehicles  to stay off roads. In a broadcast on the clandestine Radio Venceremos, the  rebels said election workers who do not resign will be "considered by our  people as part of the counterinsurgency," which would make them targets of the  guerrillas. The rebels have boycotted all five elections this decade, but their  threats against election workers and the attack on the election center were  unprecedented.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- The Social Democratic  Party's [of Japan -- SDPJ] stance on taxes and its policy toward  North Korea remained the main stumbling blocks to agreement  among coalition parties Thursday [21 April] morning, political  sources said.    The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest of the  coalition parties, is stipulating that an increase in direct  taxes should be linked to "an end to the consumption tax and the  establishment of new taxation after seeking the people's  consent."    The other parties want reference to the consumption tax  restricted to the expression "including reorganization of" the  tax, but support a compromise that omits reference to "the  consent of the people."    At meetings of its three top executives and its central  executive committee, the SDP leadership spent the morning  discussing possible ways to reach a compromise with the other  coalition parties.    But during a 10.30 A.M. [0130 GMT] break in proceedings,  sources said, it appeared the party was determined to insist on  the revised proposals it had originally put before a meeting of  coalition leaders on Wednesday.    If agreement is reached among all the coalition members  Thursday, the parties will hold a meeting of their leaders to  secure written assent to the deal and choose Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata, leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], as  successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    Shinseito is the coalition's second largest party.    This outcome would mean that a plenary session of both  houses  of the Diet could not be convened until Friday at the earliest,  but political sources said it is possible political manoeuvering  and negotiations over the new cabinet could further delay the  process until Saturday.    Other policy issues negotiated among coalition members  included the question of North Korea's suspected development of  nuclear weapons. The SDP holds that in the event of an  emergency, Japan should engage in "close collaboration" with the  United States, South Korea and China.    But Shinseito's top strategist Ichiro Ozawa disagreed,  arguing that in a hypothetical circumstance where China has  exercised its right to a veto in the United Nations Security  Council and Japan subsequently is subjected to a missile attack,  Japan would be unable to engage in "close collaboration" with  China, nor treat it in the same manner as the U.S. and South  Korea.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters Thursday  morning that the party would engage in "spirited debate" over  the unresolved issues.    "We have to deal with the budget as soon as possible,"  Murayama said. "We are reaching the limit. We want to sort  things out somehow."</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Major prepares blueprint for Ulster peace MR JOHN MAJOR reinforced his personal commitment to a political settlement in Northern Ireland yesterday by pledging to table a comprehensive plan if the momentum towards peace founders. The prime minister's statement to MPs at the start of the new session of parliament marked the second time in a week he had chosen a high-profile occasion to put his political authority behind the peace process. He repeated his readiness to offer Sinn Fein a place at the negotiating table if it permanently renounced violence. Senior Whitehall officials said the government was drafting proposals covering all three central elements in the search for a political settlement. Any blueprint would include plans for a devolved assembly in Ulster, enhanced co-operation between the province and the Republic and a new agreement to replace the Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference. The statement overshadowed the announcement in the Queen's Speech of a programme of legislation designed to give substance to the 'back to basics' theme driving the government's domestic policy agenda. As expected, the 13 measures announced for the new parliamentary session will be dominated by an omnibus criminal justice bill, marking a much tougher stance on law and order; a legislative drive against regulation; and an overhaul of the organisation of teacher training. But Mr Major took a conscious decision to keep Northern Ireland at the top of the political agenda by modifying the government's position on the circumstances in which it would put forward its own plan. He indicated that he was no longer prepared to make a return to the negotiating table by all four constitutional parties in Ulster a precondition for a government blueprint. In an explicit warning to the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party, Mr Major added that 'no party or organisation' could exercise a veto on the process. Speaking as tens of thousands of people rallied in Northern Ireland to demand an end to the terrorist violence, he said he wanted a permanent end to violence and a political settle-ment. He emphasised that the precondition for a place in the process for Sinn Fein was that 'the violence must stop - and be seen to stop'. He added that the guarantee for the present constitutional status of Northern Ireland was 'cast-iron' as long as it represented the majority's wish. Signs of unease on the Conservative back benches that Mr Major may have leant too far in the direction of Sinn Fein were voiced by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor. He questioned the point of contacts with an organisation committed to undermining Ulster's status. Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, responded positively to Mr Major's remarks, saying he could see 'no cause for alarm' in what the prime minister had said. But Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the DUP, scorned recent calls for peace, saying they would come to nothing. Details, Pages 10-11 Ulster efforts stepped up, Page 13 Joe Rogaly, Page 24</p>

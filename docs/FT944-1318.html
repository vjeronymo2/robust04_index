			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Jamaican bank taken over The Jamaican government has taken over one of the island's banks because of dissatisfaction with its operations. Auditors will run the Blaise Trust and Merchant Bank for an unspecified period, according to Mr Omar Davies, finance minister. There were no indications of the nature of the government's concern. The finance ministry had contemplated taking over the bank earlier this year, but delayed its move then after the management was changed. Mr Davies said that 'new information' on the bank's operations led to the takeover.</p>

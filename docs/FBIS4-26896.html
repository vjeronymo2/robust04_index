			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, June 27 (XINHUA) -- A "houses for all" estate  project has been launched here in the old industrial city of  Wuhan, which reportedly has a fifth of its residents short of  homes.    Zhang Kexiao, a senior official in charge of housing  development, said the plan is to build 3.19-million-sq.-m of  fully serviced homes by 1997 on the eastern outskirts of the  city, the capital of central China's Hubei Province.    Zhang said these houses will be able to accommodate about  200,000 people, each currently having less than eight sq. m of  housing area, the minimum figure prescribed by the central  government.    "The site levelling, the building of roads, water and  electricity facilities for the whole area have now been  completed, and we expect to complete the 800,000 sq. m of houses  of the first phase by the end of the year," he said    The whole project will cost nine billion yuan, he added.  Some 30 to 40 percent will be financed by the Hong Kong-based  New World Group, the rest by the city government.    He noted that the government has reduced or remitted part of  the taxes and charges for the project, such as the land rent, to  ensure the houses will be affordable to low-income residents.</p>

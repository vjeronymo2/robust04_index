			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Russians 'money-laundering' Millions of pounds have been laundered by Russian criminals through banks in the United Kingdom since Russia's moves towards market and currency liberalisation, a senior UK law enforcement official announced yesterday. Mr Albert Pacey, director-general of the National Criminal Intelligence Service, told reporters in Moscow that of 13,000 'suspicious' transactions reported by UK financial institutions last year, 200 involved funds from the Russian Federation. 'That is not a large number but what distinguishes them were the amounts of money involved - from half a million pounds to several million pounds,' he said, speaking after meetings designed to build a working relationship with Russian law enforcers.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Arts: New look at the Tate - The gallery's rehang For the fifth time running, Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate, begins his year, and ours, with a fresh trawl through the collections: and what was once a matter of high contention is now accepted with but a shrug of irritation at familiarity confounded, and pleasurable curiosity as to what new, fresh, forgotten things have been pulled out of store. The serious point is that with works of art, as with people, even the most familiar or important are seen anew in fresh company, for good or ill. The serious question is: how far should one go in indulging such change for the sake of it, at the sacrifice of any more settled context and consideration? The answer - compromise if you like - is simply the striking of a balance between the two. Serota's first great coup was born of his audacity in entirely re-ordering the historical sequence of the displays that he had inherited with his appointment. His second, no less radical, was the opening up again of the central axis of the Tate, the Duveen Sculpture Hall, and rededicating it to its original purpose. Once done, both changes seemed obvious and inevitable and, five years on, we would hardly wish them undone. The shift of the Tudor and Stuart paintings, with which the sequence of the displays begin, from the bustle of the galleries at the front of house to the furthest corner gallery at the back, is especially happy for the appropriate quietness and sense of permanence it affords them. They are in any case, by the very nature of the collection, less subject to constant reshuffling. The Sculpture Halls, on the other hand, have been subject inevitably and most conspicuously of all to the annual change-around, and triumphantly so. It is in the nature of the Tate that it should hold so much more than it can ever show together, and sculpture simply presents the problem at its most acute. Turn and turn about is the only way, and with last year's Rodins now replaced by Anglo-French turn of the century academicism - Reynolds-Stephens' 'A Royal Game', of Elizabeth I and Philip II at chess, dominating the entrance lobby - and minimalism giving way to British sculpture between the wars, the contrast could hardly be more piquant. With not only Gill, Gaudier and Epstein but more obscure figures such as Frank Dobson, Leon Underwood and John Skeaping given proper recognition, Henry Moore's old claim virtually to have invented modern British sculpture is neatly rendered untenable. But general criticism of the Serota policy is not to be dismissed altogether. There are two main wings to it: that changes have been too many and too extreme; and that the hang itself has often been indulgently sparse  -space where there might have been pictures. My own sense of it is that the criticism has been met, but only to a degree. The hang seems a little more settled than before and certainly more comprehensive, at least on the British side from the 16th to the 19th century. The 18th century is served well enough, from Hogarth and his contemporaries to Gainsborough, Zoffany, Stubbs and Reynolds, Wright and Copley, then into the 19th century with the landscape painting of Constable, Cox, Turner, Crome and all. The pre-Raphaelites have a room to themselves, as do the high Victorians, Martin, Leighton, Orchardson, Millais and Burne-Jones - and how good to see Farquharson's sheep in a blizzard, and Frederick Walker's delightful young widow stepping out through 'The Old Gate'. British aestheticism, impressionism and post-impressionism are also well served, with a room of Sargent, Albert Moore, Whistler, Steer, Sickert and Gwen John, and another of late Derain and Bonnard along with Smith, Gross - a fascinating comparison with Derain - Grant and Vanessa Bell. William Nicholson, father of Ben and, in many eyes, infinitely the more gifted painter, is rightly given a small display to himself. But from here the problems start, not so much in the particular choice of what is shown, as in what is necessarily left out. From the Cubists and Vorticists in Room 14 through to the old modern side, the sense is that suddenly the Tate has run out of space. From this point the displays, room by room, are increasingly selective, even cursory, as they light upon this subject, now that - Bacon and Giacometti; a roomful of portrait heads; abstraction in the 1940s, '50s, '60s. This is, of course, a political statement that is being made, not so obliquely. The Tate indeed ran out of space long ago. Positive initiatives have already been taken, at Liverpool and Saint Ives, and we await the decision on what might be done at Bankside or the South Bank. But the problem remains for the moment what it has always been, that the Tate as it is has an impossible brief. We, for our part, must make up our minds just what it is we want and expect of it: our national gallery of British Art; of modern British in its international context; of international contemporary art? Yes please; all three. The New Displays 1994: The Tate Gallery, Millbank SW1 - sponsored by British Petroleum</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / US group in talks on global telecoms link-up: French and German companies may take stakes in Sprint Sprint, the large US telecom-munications group, confirmed yesterday that it was discussing a global partnership with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, both of which might take equity stakes in the company. Deutsche Telekom confirmed the talks and said it would make an announcement within the next few days. A deal would constitute the second significant US-European telecoms alliance, coming a year after the launch of a Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.53bn) tie-up between British Telecommunications and MCI, the second largest US operator. Leading international telecoms operators are all attempting to position themselves as service providers to multinational companies amid rapid growth in global communications traffic. If the deal goes ahead, analysts expect AT&amp;T, the largest US operator, to renew its efforts to forge a European partnership to bolster its 'Worldsource' venture, launched last year. Sprint's announcement came 24 hours after the company said it had terminated talks about a full merger with Electronic Data Systems, the computing services subsidiary of General Motors, although the two said they would continue to discuss some form of alliance. Sprint is the third largest long-distance and international carrier in the US, with a market share of just under 10 per cent. It also has large local and cellular telephony interests and earned Dollars 480.6m from continuing operations last year on revenues of Dollars 11.4bn. It said the proposed partnership with the European companies would concentrate mainly on providing 'seamless, global telecommunications services to business customers'. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom signed an Ecu1bn (Pounds 770m) alliance last December, geared particularly at the international data market. It has been actively seeking a US partner over the past year and is known to have been in talks with AT&amp;T. The talks envisaged France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom making minority equity investments in Sprint through purchases of a new class of Sprint stock at a premium. The company declined to elaborate on the potential size of the investment, but analysts speculated that it might involve several billion dollars. Shares in Sprint, which has a market capitalisation of more than Dollars 13bn, rose Dollars 1 3/8 to close at Dollars 39 3/8 in New York yesterday. The final form of any deal would remain problematic until the future status of the French and German operators is determined. Deutsche Telekom is in the throes of an uncertain privatisation process, and the French government has yet to decide whether to proceed with privatisation of France Telecom. Unless both companies move to the private sector, it may not be possible to exchange equity stakes. Race to link world telecoms, Page 31</p>

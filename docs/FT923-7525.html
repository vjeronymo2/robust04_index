			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries fall sharply at long end LONG-dated US Treasury securities fell sharply yesterday on fears that President Bush may announce tax cuts in his acceptance speech later this week at the Republican convention. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  17/32 at 98 21/32 , yielding 7.356 per cent, although that was above its lows for the day. The two-year note was little changed, however, up just 1/32 at 100 5/16 to yield 4.064 per cent. After an impressive month-long rally, the Treasury market has suddenly been gripped by worries that President Bush is willing to sacrifice his long-term goal of balancing the budget in favour of a short-term economic stimulus in the shape of a tax cut. UK government bonds continued to rise yesterday, following Friday's strong rally on the back of favourable inflation figures. Yesterday's rise was held in check by sterling weakness but the Liffe gilt futures contract rose from 97.17 to trade at 97.23 by late afternoon while in the cash market, medium-dated issues made the strongest gains. The 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 rose from 103 7/32 to 103 3/8 to yield 9.22 per cent while shorter-dated issues were little changed on the day. DEALERS reported firm buying interest in French government bonds with investors apparently anticipating a favourable result in an opinion poll on the government due to be published this week. The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2002 fell from 8.97 per cent to 8.92 per cent, while the Matif futures contract climbed from 105.92 to 106.08. The release of favourable inflation data had little impact on the market. Elsewhere in Europe, German government bonds ended the day only slightly higher after Friday's strong gains, but dealers said the market was awaiting the key money supply data due out later this week. JAPANESE government bonds rallied yesterday afternoon after a weak start, with the futures contract reaching its highest level since September 1989. Profit-taking pushed the bond market lower at the start of trading, with the yield on the benchmark No 129 moving from its opening of 4.8 per cent to 4.83 per cent. Dealers noted modest buying interest and short-covering later in the trading session, pushing the yield on the No 129 to 4.77 per cent.</p>

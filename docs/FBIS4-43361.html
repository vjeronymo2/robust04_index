			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "People's Party for Freedom and </F> Democracy's Demand for Cutbacks Puts Talks Under Pressure"]    [Text] The VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]  is putting the "purple" coalition [comprising the VVD, the Labor  Party (PvdA), and Democrats 66 (D66)] negotiations under  pressure by demanding extra cutbacks on social security  benefits. The PvdA opposes this measure and, in turn, is  pushing for cutbacks in areas including defense and road  construction, which the VVD finds difficult to accept.    The VVD regards cutbacks in the WAO [Law on Labor  Disability]  as unavoidable in order to find sufficient funds for a general  reduction in tax levels. [VVD leader] Bolkestein suggested  cutting back the level and duration of benefits. "We have gone  through the central government budget in detail some three times  now, and eventually you exhaust the possible ways of finding  money there. That means that great emphasis has to be laid on  social security. We are hoping to do that through quantitative  measures, but if that is not successful, then we must reach for  the ultimate weapon," he said.    On Tuesday [14 June], PvdA leader Kok repeated once again  that such social security cutbacks were not on the agenda as far  as he was concerned. "That is not my preference. And I will  fight to the bitter end," he said.    But yesterday the negotiators succeeded in reducing their  differences about how many extra billion guilders [G] of cuts  still have to be found. On Monday, the VVD felt that another G2  or G3 billion should be saved on top of the G7 billion regarded  necessary by PvdA leader Kok.    But on Tuesday evening, VVD leader Bolkestein said: "If that  were to be all, then I would say: That is totally inadequate.  But Kok has explained that other elements must be included as  well. Once again you can differ as to whether that is hard  enough, but with it Kok clearly exceeds the G7 billion."  Bolkestein referred to savings on the cost of civil servants as  an example.    The PvdA and D66 want to wait and see what will be yielded  by  the far-reaching cutbacks in the WAO, that were decided upon by  the current cabinet. Initial calculations are based on a yield  of G750 million. The VVD doubts whether that is enough. The  liberals are prepared to wait a year to see how the WAO costs  evolve, but are now demanding a guarantee from the PvdA and D66  that further cutbacks will not be ruled out.    The Central Planning Bureau (CPB) has calculated that the  provisional proposals of the "purple" coalition would produce  only disappointing job gains. This has also put pressure on the  negotiation process between the PvdA, the VVD, and D66. The job  gain forecast by the CPB is so small that the negotiators regard  the results as improbable. Therefore they have asked the CPB  for a more detailed explanation.    An example of one of these disappointing forecasts is the  plan to allocate employers a fiscal deduction for workers  employed on the minimum wage. This could increase employment  opportunities for the unskilled.    The intended coalition partners would allow the measure to  cost G1.8 billion. According to the CPB's calculation models,  the financial commitment in this specific wage cost subsidy  would produce only 8,000 jobs.    This result is all the more disappointing because the G1.8  billion represents nearly half of the G4.1 billion put aside by  the three parties to improve employment opportunities for the  unskilled. The party specialists had calculated an eventual job  gain of 100,000.    The CPB also estimated the job gain produced by other  proposals would turn out far lower than the parties would like.  The CPB would not give a forecast for some components, because  the calculation model is not capable of doing so.    CPB director Zalm has often called for the policy of  imposing  collective labor agreements on industrial sectors to be  abandoned, on the grounds that this would increase jobs. The  same applies to more flexible redundancy rules. However, the  CPB has made no estimate of the job gain if the "purple"  coalition were to put these proposals into practice. On Tuesday  Zalm was not available for comment.</p>

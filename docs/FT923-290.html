			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Teachers call for forcible opting out ALL SCHOOLS in each local education authority area in England and Wales should be obliged to opt out of its control once 75 per cent of pupils are at schools which have already opted out, the National Association of Head Teachers said yesterday. This would prevent a local authority from 'withering on the vine' to the detriment of the diminishing number of schools left in its authority. Mr John Patten, education secretary, welcomed the proposal. 'They are being more radical than the government. I think it's quite a constructive input to the debate and I will consider it carefully,' he said. The government's white paper on education, published in July, says the proposed Funding Agency for Schools will have joint responsibility for school provision with local education authorities once the level of primary or secondary pupils in opted-out schools reaches 10 per cent. The funding agency would take over completely when the level rises to 75 per cent. The funding agency would take over payment of funds to opted-out schools as well as a range of powers from local education authorities. The NAHT urged a rethink to stop the confusion of town halls and the funding agency being forced to share power. It said that the agency should control provision of places once a 50 per cent threshold was reached, with all primary or secondary schools opting out automatically once 75 per cent of pupils were grant-maintained. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, said the proposal was 'dangerous, destructive and defeatist' and accused the NAHT of 'chucking in the towel before the fight has begun'. However, the NAHT yesterday attacked the white paper a free-market recipe for 'confusion and uncertainty'. Plans for schools to opt for a new system without local education authorities were 'fatally flawed', it said. The suggestion that the cost of the new framework, including new bureaucracies, could be met without extra cost showed a 'breathtaking disregard of current underfunding', the NAHT said. The National Union of Teachers, the largest teaching union, yesterday also attacked the changes set out in the white paper, saying it was a 'charter for political interference'. It warned that the plan would take power away from town halls, which are accountable to voters, and place it instead in the hands of the government and bureaucrats. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary, said: 'Instead of freeing children's abilities through high-quality education, he (Mr Patten) intends to tie up their future with red tape stretching back to Whitehall.' Business should increase links with schools and make a 'blue-chip' investment in well-educated young people, Mr Patten told a Confederation of British Industry conference on the white paper. He told the conference: 'We need to create an environment in the classroom which actively promotes and encourages a positive attitude towards industry. Industry can be exciting and rewarding. We must help young people to see this.'</p>

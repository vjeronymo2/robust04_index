			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / 'Woman of Fashion' sells for Dollars 1.98m: Saleroom 'LA MONDAINE', or 'The Woman of Fashion', by James Jacques Joseph Tissot, depicting a girl at a smart party being helped out of her fur coat by her elderly lover, sold for Dollars 1,982,650 (Pounds 1.38m) at Sotheby's in New York on Wednesday, an auction record for the 19th-century French artist. It was one of the 15 'Women of Paris' paintings Tissot completed in the 1870s, portraying the self-confident 'New Woman' of the Third Republic: the young girl at the centre of the painting boldly holds the gaze of the viewer. The picture came from the collection of the Toronto industrialists Joey and Toby Tanenbaum, selling near the top of its estimate. Two other paintings from the series were also sold by the Tanenbaums. 'Sans Dot' ('Without Dowry') shows a young widow in black offering herself for inspection in a park, and went well below its Dollars 1.2m-Dollars 1.8m estimate, at Dollars 882,500. 'The Sphinx', an inscrutable young woman on a couch, fetched the same sum, also selling below target. Obviously, Sotheby's was expecting too much from a still convalescent art market. Even so, with a sale totalling Dollars 10.2m and only 15 per cent unsold, it will be pleased with one of the first big art auctions of 1993, and one in which successful bidders now have to pay a 15 per cent premium, instead of 10 per cent, on top of the hammer price. A record price of Dollars 800,000 (way above the top estimate of Dollars 360,000) was paid for 'The Mirror' by the British artist Sir Frank Dicksee. It was bought by the London dealer Macconall-Mason who advises Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, the leading buyer of Victorian art. It shows a young girl staring at herself in a hand mirror. Belle-Epoque and orientalist pictures did best in a sale of pictures likely to appeal to first-time buyers enjoying a revival in the US economy.</p>

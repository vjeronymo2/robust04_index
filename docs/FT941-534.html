			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Kravchuk sets new hurdle in the path of parliament Ukrainian voters were confronted with a fresh obstacle to the election of a new legislature yesterday, when the government announced a complicated procedure for the run-off elections which must take place by April 10. The procedural complication will make it more difficult for voters to elect a viable legislature. Unexpectedly high voter turnout in the Sunday elections threatened to thwart Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk's hopes to introduce direct presidential rule after what he forecast would be a turnout too low to legally elect a new parliament. By confusing the procedure for the run-off votes, which must take place in 90 per cent of the seats, Mr Kravchuk's government appears to be looking for another way to prevent the emergence of an effective legislature. Mr Ivan Yemets, the chief election officer, announced yesterday that the crucial run-off ballots need not, as previously believed, be held simultaneously on April 10, but may be held as early as April 2, depending on the wishes of the regional administration. Holding the vote at different times in different regions of the country could confuse voters. Mr Kravchuk, who toyed with plans to introduce direct presidential rule on the eve of the elections, has reason to fear last Sunday's vote. Unexpectedly, 75 per cent of Ukrainians showed up at the polls and initial results suggest they voted for a legislature more independent and reform-minded than its communist-dominated predecessor. Voters also gave a powerful mandate to two leading Ukrainian political figures, and possible contenders for the presidency. Mr Ivan Pliushch, the out-going speaker of parliament, and Mr Leonid Kuchma, the former prime minister, both won seats with strong majorities and have insisted that the presidential elections be held on schedule in June. Mr Bohdan Krawchenko, the Canadian director of Ukraine's main school of public administration, predicts the new parliament will be evenly divided between centrists, national-democrats, and communists. He also believes economic reforms will now be forced to the top of Ukraine's political agenda. 'The power vacuum at the heart of Ukraine is gone,' he said. The remaining power-struggle, regardless of how the conflict between the president and parliament is resolved, is that between Ukraine's disparate regions. Crimea, which elected a separatist president in January, voted strongly for closer ties with Moscow and voters in eastern Ukraine endorsed more economic integration with Russia. However, the polls in these regions have no legal weight and both Crimeans and eastern Ukrainians appeared content to wait until a new parliament is convened before pressing their demands.</p>

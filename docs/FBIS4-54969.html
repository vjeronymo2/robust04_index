			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Media Should Serve the Public"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava -- The UN General Assembly proclaimed 3  May as International Day of Press Freedom. It is being marked  for the first time this year, with the support, and  participation, of the International Federation of Journalists,  which represents 320,000 journalists from 75 countries,  including the Slovak Republic. The Slovak Syndicate of  Journalists [SSN] as a specialized professional and nonpolitical  organization issued a statement on this occasion, which it made  available to the TA SR.    It states, among other things, that fundamental changes in  the status of the mass communications media and in the building  of the independent position of journalists took place in  Slovakia after November 1989. "In spite of this we observe  attempts, which we regard as a relapse into past practices, to  politically control media, which should serve the public and not  narrow political interests." According to the SSN, this has been  documented in the last few days by the events surrounding the  Slovak Television Council. The SSN goes on to draw attention to  the fact that Slovak Radio is short of 8 million korunas a  month, even though it has already reduced the number of radio  stations it operates from three to two. Due to economic  pressures, Slovak Radio abolished last year 125 permanent posts  of editors and other creative workers. In the process of  transformation, the media has found itself in a complicated  economic situation. The SSN considers it essential that stable  economic conditions be created for the press, radio, and  television. A system of support, which is quite common in  democratic countries, must be established where necessary for  the democratic and pluralistic operation of the media. The SSN  regards as optimal a combination of indirect and direct support.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- The Beijing, Shanghai,  Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Taiyuan, Wuhan and Wulanhaote branches  of the central and southern area chapter of the headquarters of  Koreans in China of the National Alliance for the Country's  Reunification [Pomminnyon] issued a joint statement April 7  denouncing the new war provocation moves of the U.S.  imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique.    The statement charged that the "civilian"-veiled traitorous  clique of Kim Yong-sam, a heinous warmanic, as if the deployment  of over 1,000 pieces of U.S. nuclear weapons in South Korea,  were not enough, is begging for the resumption of Team Spirit  joint military maneuvers and deploying Patriot missiles in a bid  to unleash a nuclear war in conspiracy with U.S. imperialism.    The statement said: "The branches of the central and  southern  area chapter bitterly denounce the reckless arms buildup of the  U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique as a wanton  challenge to the nation's desire for peace and denuclearization  of the Korean peninsula and an unpardonable act to exterminate  the nation."    It declared they would intensify the anti-U.S., anti-war and  anti-nuke struggle in order to save the nation from the danger  of nuclear war, in hearty response to the 10-point programme of  the great unity of the whole nation, and courageously turn out  in the noble cause of defending Korean-style socialism centred  on the masses and achieving the independent and peaceful  reunification.</p>

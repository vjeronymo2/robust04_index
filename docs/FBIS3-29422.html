			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by U Chong-chang: "Is There a Change in Kim </F> Chong-il's Health?"]    [Text] It was learned that North Korean President Kim  Il-song's son, Kim Chong-il, has critically damaged his brain.  According to information obtained from China in mid-January, our  intelligence agency said: "Kim Chong-il was in a traffic  accident around September 1993. He is in critical condition,  with broken bones and brain damage."    This information was obtained by an official of the National  Unification Board [NUB] through a researcher of a Chinese  strategic institute when they participated in a seminar on  Northeast Asian affairs held in the United States. The Chinese  researcher said that he heard of such news from a friend with  whom he served in the Army and who is currently working at the  Chinese Embassy in Pyongyang and from a friend from school.    The content of the information conveyed by the Chinese  researcher is as follows: "Kim Chong-il, who is a speed demon,  was in a traffic accident while driving his car at high speed.  Kim damaged his brain and his bones were broken. North Korea  invited Chinese experts who can read X-rays well as well as  brain surgeons. However, the North Korean side did not allow  the Chinese doctors to see the patient. They returned to China  after saying they could not make a diagnosis without seeing the  patient."    Related agencies including the NUB and the Agency for  National Security Planning [NSP] are currently analyzing this in  detail. A related source said: "As a result of monitoring  North Korea's various media, unusual signs are appearing  surrounding Kim Chong-il such as the reduction in the number of  teachings being carried out under his name. It seems definite  that there is a change in Kim Chong-il's health."    There is additional evidence that there is a "great change"  in Kim Chong-il's health. U.S. evangelist Billy Graham, who  recently visited Pyongyang to hold a revival service, said:  "What was most surprising about my visit to Pyongyang this time  was the fact that Kim Chong-il had disappeared from view."    According to Rev. Graham, when he visited Pyongyang in 1992  Kim Il-song said to him: "Kim Chong-il is in charge of  everything and I am standing at the second line." However, when  he asked Kim Il-song about Kim Chong-il this time, Graham says  he intentionally avoided the question. Billy Graham expressed  his will to meet Kim Chong-il by saying: "I have a gift for Kim  Chong-il." However, Kim Il-song changed the subject, Graham  said.    An expert in South-North affairs said: "In the phrases `the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il' which are being used commonly, the phrase `the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il' has been gradually disappearing  since September 1993. This shows that there is a change in Kim  Chong-il's succession system."    A scholar on the issue of the reunification of the Korean  peninsula said: "Viewing from various signs within North Korea,  it seems that Kim Chong-il will face a change in his health  before Kim Il-song. Now is the time to closely observe how Kim  Chong-il's death will influence South-North relations."    An NSP official concerned says: "As far as we know, there  seems to be something wrong with Kim Chong-il's cardiac system."  He still insists that this is "intelligence" [choppo], not  "information" [chongbo]. This official also said: "A heart  specialist from Lyon University in Paris secretly visited  Pyongyang in March 1991 and performed surgery to install a heart  pacemaker." He went on to say: "At that time, Western  intelligence agencies believed only Kim Il-song could afford  such expensive surgery and paid attention to the physical  checkup of Kim Il-song, an old man. However, Kim Chong-il seems  to be the person who underwent the surgery."    This is not the first time that it was speculated something  had happened to Kim Chong-il. Moscow radio reported in June  1993: "Kim Il-song strongly reproached his son, Kim Chong-il,  and Kim Chong-il was hospitalized for a shock from this."    At about the same time, Russia's ITAR-TASS carried a similar  report under the headline "Kim Chong-il's Health Conditions."  ITAR-TASS also carried this report in the ASIAN BULLETIN, which  is distributed to Russian Government agencies and research  institutes.    The report says: "Kim Il-song has recently strongly  reproached Kim Chong-il, his son and heir apparent, for his  mistakes in the handling of state affairs. As a result, Kim  Chong-il suffered a nervous breakdown and could not carry out  his official duties for two months." This episode immediately  followed the "rumors that Kim Chong-il fell from a horse." It  was said that during a horse ride, Kim Chong-il fell from the  horse and suffered a serious head injury. Upon receiving this  information, our intelligence agency closely examined Kim  Chong-il's appearances on Pyongyang television. The agency  found out that Kim Chong-il barely used his left arm in official  functions.    An aide to Kim Chong-il, who contacted our side's official  concerned in Beijing, China, said: "It is true that Kim  Chong-il was injured when he fell from a horse. He was not  injured in the head but slightly injured in the arms."    A little while later, Kim Song-ae, who had disappeared for  some time, suddenly appeared at an official function and  demonstrated that she is all right. Kim Song-ae is Kim  Chong-il's stepmother and Kim Pyong-il's mother. Kim Song-ae  and Kim Chong-il are on hostile terms.    Our side's agency concerned says: "When Cambodia's Sihanouk  arrived in North Korea on 22 July 1993, Kim Song-ae appeared at  the Pyongyang airport to receive Sihanouk. Kim Song-ae appeared  at an official function to welcome a foreign state guest for the  first time since she had disappeared from the public. This  means Kim Song-ae regained her past authority."    What is also drawing our attention along with the rise of  Kim Song-ae is the change in the status of Kim Yong-chu and Kim  Pyong-il. Kim Il-song's younger brother Kim Yong-chu "lived in  exile" for 18 years in North Hamgyong Province but was suddenly  appointed to vice president in early December 1993. While  serving as ambassador to Bulgaria, Kim Pyong-il was summoned in  1992. Since then his whereabouts had been vague. However, it  was learned around early December 1993 that he was in good  health and living in Pyongyang.    It is a widely known fact that Kim Chong-il and his half  brother Kim Pyong-il do not get along well. According to a Mr.  Kang who defected to the ROK from North Korea, Kim Chong-il  injured his arm when Kim Pyong-il shot him with a gun. Mr. Kang  said that he heard of such an incident when he visited Pyongyang  in April 1990 from his uncle who works for a government agency.  When Kim Pyong-il temporarily returned home while serving as  ambassador to Bulgaria in early 1990, his mother Kim Song-ae  said to him: "Kim Chong-il is treating me harshly by saying that  I am his step-mother." When Kim Pyong-il heard this he got very  angry and fired a shot at Kim Chong-il, but it only hit his arm.    The rise of Kim Yong-chu, Kim Song-ae, and Kim Pyong-il go  hand-in-hand with the signs of change in Kim Chong-il's health.  Since September 1993, when it was learned that Kim Chong-il  suffered brain damage in the traffic accident, Kim Yong-chu who  was alienated, advanced to the core of the power structure.  Also for Kim Song-ae to appear at an official meeting was not a  common matter. It was learned that after an interval in his  activities since ending his position as ambassador to Bulgaria,  it was tentatively decided that Kim Pyong-il will assume the  position of ambassador to Finland.    An official of the NSP said: "Absolute power is bound to be  concentrated in one person. The dispersion of power shows that  there has been a change in Kim Chong-il's succession system.  Also, it seems that lining up Kim Il-song's family to the core  of the power structure is a measure to prepare for an  `unavoidable circumstance' within the family."    In connection with Kim Chong-il's position, it is noteworthy  to see changes in North Korea's "Room No. 39." "Room No. 39."  is a secretariat for Kim Chong-il. The agency concerned  speculates that "Room No. 39," which used to be an office of the  Finance Ministry under the party center (refers to Kim  Chong-il), was disbanded recently and that it was merged into  the Organization Department [chojikpu]. "Room No. 39" has been  a channel for ROK business corporations' advance into North  Korea. Therefore, they pay particular attention to changes in  Kim Chong-il's position and the fate of "Room No. 39."    Via Japanese media, North Korea has recently released a  photograph of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il with Mt. Paektu in  the background. The photograph shows Kim Chong-il on top of Mt.  Paektu in the winter wearing ordinary clothes. Why did North  Korea suddenly release such a photograph?    A Chongwadae [presidential residence] official concerned  says: "North-South relations will undergo momentous changes some  time this year at the earliest, or next year at the latest." He  also says: "Those changes will be made in a direction favorable  to us."</p>

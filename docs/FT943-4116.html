			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Costain slips back into the red Shares in Costain Group fell 11 per cent yesterday as the construction and engineering group slipped back into the red for the first six months of the year and put its US mining operations up for sale. The company said that the mining division, which has been the subject of a recent Dollars 170m (Pounds 110m) investment programme, was likely to fetch in the region of Pounds 180m, although industry analysts believed the figure was more likely to be about Pounds 160m. Mr Peter Costain, group chief executive, said that the group had already received several approaches. 'There is consolidation in the industry and after our successful investment programme we believe it is the right time to exit.' He added that the decision to sell had been prompted by a review of the company's strategy resulting in a plan to concentrate its efforts on the construction and engineering business. The shares closed down 3p at 24 1/2 p. Operating losses for the mining division totalled Pounds 9.8m (Pounds 5m profits) in the period helping drag Costain into pre-tax losses of Pounds 14m compared with profits of Pounds 68.1m, which included disposal profits of Pounds 68.5m. Turnover fell to Pounds 514.8m, against Pounds 622.6m which included Pounds 38.2m from discontinued activities leaving the decline on continuing operations at 12 per cent. Losses per share were 3p, against earnings of 28.5p. The dividend, last paid in 1991, was again passed. Mr Costain said that the investment programme in the US mining business had been self-financing and had enhanced the sale value. Mr Thomas Parker, who headed the US coal operations, has left by mutual consent and been replaced by Mr Peter Hill, a member of the board. Profit margins in the construction and engineering division slipped from 1.5 per cent to 1.3 per cent as the company experienced tough trading conditions, particularly in the UK. Operating profits fell 31 per cent to Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 6.7m) on turnover down 24 per cent at Pounds 349.3m (Pounds 432.1m). Mr Costain said he expected the UK market to remain difficult for the foreseeable future and that the company was redoubling its efforts to seek overseas work where margins were healthier. The continuing divestment programme of non-core assets resulted in net debt falling from Pounds 204.7m to Pounds 63.3m. Shareholders funds increased 34 per cent to Pounds 210.4m (Pounds 157.4m), helping cut gearing from 37 per cent to 30 per cent. See Lex</p>

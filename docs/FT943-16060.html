			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Evans of Leeds climbs to Pounds 9.7m and net assets up 13p Evans of Leeds, the family-controlled property investment and development company, yesterday announced an 11 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.74m for the year to March 31. Net assets per share rose by 13p to 111p, reflecting an 8.9 per cent like-on-like increase in the value of its property portfolio. The company received gross rental income of Pounds 22.5m, compared with Pounds 19.2m in 1993, following 'some satisfactory reviews', as well as the purchase of Pounds 16m of property during the year. However, net interest payable rose to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 9.1m). The company said it was proceeding with the Pounds 100m development of the White Rose Shopping Centre in Leeds, which it is undertaking with joint venture partner Yorkshire Water. It is currently awaiting detailed planning permission for the development, which was initially planned in the mid-1980s, but Mr Bill Gibson, director, said work could commence during 1994. Given the size of the project, he said Evans was considering a number of options for White Rose, which could include taking on other partners. The company raised another Pounds 13m from the issue of debentures last year, and it has a Pounds 15m bank stand-by facility. In addition, gearing remained at 53 per cent last year, which is conservative for the sector. A proposed final dividend of 1.74p brings the total for the year to 2.53p (2.285p adjusted). This is the 18th successive year in which Evans has increased its total dividend by more than 10 per cent. Earnings per share were 5.72p (5.69p).</p>

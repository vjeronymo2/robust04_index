			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Queenie Wang and Dick Chan] </F>   [Text] China's top official on Hong Kong affairs, Lu Ping,  yesterday launched his first attack on the Governor, Chris  Patten, since arriving in the territory.    As Mr. Patten disappeared from sight, after a hectic week of  high-profile activity, Mr. Lu accused him of only wanting to put  on a political show, rather than sincerely engaging in talks,  according to newly appointed District Affairs Adviser Leung  Kwong-cheung, who attended a two-hour meeting with the visiting  mainland official.    Mr. Lu insisted he would only meet the Governor if it was  likely to be fruitful. "How could I meet Mr. Patten, he  performs a show but I don't. His attitude towards the  Preliminary Working Committee [PWC] is not only unfriendly but  amounts to a boycott of us," the visiting mainland official was  quoted as saying at a meeting with the district advisers.    "As secretary-general of the PWC, if I enter the room by the  red carpet, then walk out along the red carpet, without making  any progress, this would only disappoint the six million people  in Hong Kong."    Mr. Lu also attacked the Kowloon Canton Railway Corporation  for allegedly snubbing the PWC by failing to send its chairman  Kevin Hyde to a meeting with the economic sub-group yesterday.  The KCRC sent a consultant as its representative instead, and  Mr. Lu said this was further evidence of the British side's lack  of sincerity.    "Many of the PWC mainland members are department heads (in  the Chinese Government). Is our meeting with the KCRC chairman  downgrading his status?" Mr. Lu was reported as saying.    Secretary of Transport Haider Barma last night denied the  Government had played any role in the KCRC's decision. "As far  as I know, we did not have any role in this case. It (the  decision) is entirely up to the KCRC, the board is independent  from the Government. I only learned of their meeting and  cancellation of the appointment from the newspapers," Mr. Barma  said.    After a meeting with the specialist group on infrastructure  of the Business and Professionals Federation of Hong Kong, head  of the PWC economic sub-group Gao Shang-quan expressed his  disappointment at the absence of Mr. Hyde. He said: "We, with  four ministerial level officials, came to this meeting with  tremendous sincerity and ambitions because this question  (railway transportation) has to be solved very urgently."    According to sub-group member Tam Yiu-Chung, yesterday's  meeting was originally arranged as a discussion with the KCRC  only. But the PWC re-scheduled it to meet the infrastructure  experts after receiving a negative reply from the KCRC.    A newly built Beijing-Kowloon railway will come into service  in late 1995, and China wants to discuss with the KCRC the  connection of the proposed railway to the western New  Territories.    "If the question cannot be solved, it will cause economic  loss to Hong Kong. And of course, it will cause economic loss  to China also," Mr. Gao said.    Mr. Lu had earlier yesterday sought to ease the anxiety of  civil servants by assuring them their future would not be  affected by the Sino-British row.    Representatives from seven civil servant associations held  almost three hours of talks with Mr. Lu and members of the PWC  political subgroup.</p>

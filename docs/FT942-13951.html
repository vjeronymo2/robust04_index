			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Arts: A 'Hamlet' a la Fellini - Theatre On a glass pedestal a silver trunk of the sort used by music-hall magicians revolves slowly to the sound of crashing surf. A magician indeed appears, top-hatted and caped, with his assistant, a red-plumed showgirl. A bluesy trumpet plays. Out of the trunk a young man is winched in harness to dangle over the stage. Another figure emerges, a child in topcoat and stove-pipe hat, the Artful Dodger impression countered by his air of innocence and the white flower in his buttonhole. This is Horatio. The ghost is a ventriloquist's doll carried round the stage by the magician. Hamlet (yes) is winched down. Lights, a blast of circus music, and in troops the court of Elsinore. What does that jaunty minor-key strut evoke? Why is that faintly sleazy glitter, that sinister invitation to fun, familiar? Of course: Federico Fellini. If the late Italian movie director had filmed Hamlet it would have come out as something like Julia Bardsley's adaptation at the Young Vic. Bardsley's short regime has had a rough ride. I suspect this Shakespearian extravaganza will suffer from the downward roll. A shame, since the production is brave, bizarre, imaginative, hallucinatory, sometimes irritating, often poetic. As one who has appraised more great Danes than a judge at Crufts, I was kept alert and intrigued throughout. They give us variations on the theme, perhaps, rather than the play itself. But what production has ever given us every aspect of Hamlet? The text has been cut and shuffled (the most annoying detail being Hamlet's substitution of 'prayers' for 'orisons' as if that would puzzle us more than the rest of these goings-on), and characters are omitted, with much fascinating double-casting. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are played by one man carrying a life-size dummy, initially both sporting identical orange bowlers and Groucho Marx spectacles. Natasha Pope plays Ophelia and Gertrude. She lacks the vocal weight for the faintly floozy queen (red bouffant, vivid lipstick); but the image of Ophelia's mad scene evokes a blend of punk and pre-war Berlin cabaret, as she belts 'How should I your true love know?' into a mike. She cuts a vaguely expressionistic figure, a frowsy version of Wedekind's Lulu perhaps, in her clinging fur-hemmed frock and clown's blue and white banded knee-socks. Claudius' bottle-green suit, glasses and crown sustain the circus motif. Boyd Clack's disconcerting facial mixture of David Mellor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer adds conviction to this homme moyen sensuel's dabbling in political waters too deep for him. And of course one actor plays Polonius and Laertes, father (pink coat and fez) and son (purple coat). The production's emphasis on the individual's duality, internal and external character (which offers after all an explanation of Hamlet's anguished dithering), prompts two set pieces: the play scene when lust and murder are enacted by dolls, then taken over by their human counterparts as a rock score pounds and a red-nosed Hamlet leaps around, ape-like, urging them on and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, now pig-faced, fondle each other. More moving is the prince's address to the players, here a pile of dolls, and the actor he begs a speech from: the doll is a beautifully-made miniature of Hamlet himself who obliges (with his master's voice) not with Hecuba but 'To be or not to be'. This leads straight on to Hamlet in propria persona bursting out with 'Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave'. Here the levels of artifice blur: what or who is he reacting to? Come to that, who is the master puppeteer-ringmaster magician-ventriloquist behind each character? The old enigma of Hamlet's determinism is still unsolved. Rory Edwards prowls, haggard, through the title role, a neurotic wreck from the start (pullover with ape-length arms, bare feet), within an inch of genuine madness. Unless, as in The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari, the whole court is an asylum. The final duel is almost perfunctory, slow motion lunging over the central pedestal, the lines sounding flatter as if a clockwork mechanism were running down. The manipulative magician (shades of Lulu's Ringmaster) and his assistant (in fact Bardsley and her designer Aldona Cunningham) pay the play the compliment of refusing to treat it as a museum piece but something alive and resilient to bounce ideas off. Nothing is taken for granted; surprises continue to the very end when, in response to 'The rest is silence' as Hamlet wanders off, the child Horatio delivers the last lines in deaf and dumb language.

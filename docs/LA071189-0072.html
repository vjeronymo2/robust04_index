			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO ESCAPEES HOMESICK AFTER DAY AT THE BEACH  </P> <P> A day at the beach proved too taxing for two escaped inmates who called their  jailer collect and asked if they could return, authorities said.  </P> <P> Mark Allen Fox and Charles F. Rohn, both 19, were back at the Michigan  Reformatory at Ionia on Monday, facing possible escape charges, Warden Pamela  Withrow said.  </P> <P> "They said they spent the day at the beach, they were a little scared and  hungry," said state trooper Larry Medendorp of the pair's trip to an unknown  lake beach. The two, along with a third inmate who remained at large Monday,  escaped Sunday from the prison's minimum-security dormitory unit.  </P></p>

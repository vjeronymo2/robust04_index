			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Emerging risks If last year demonstrated the rewards of investing in emerging markets, this year has highlighted the risks. In 1993, emerging markets outperformed developed markets by a factor of three - increasing by 64 per cent in US dollar terms. This year they underperformed. They were down by 7 per cent in the year to mid December and fell further last week as a result of the plunge in the value of the Mexican peso and stock market. The poor performance this year reflects not just political and economic uncertainties; another issue has been the gradual tightening of US monetary policy. High yields on US Treasuries, coupled with rising short-term interest rates, have reduced the investment attractions of risky emerging markets and have enhanced the relative appeal of risk-free cash. Repatriation of funds out of emerging markets back to the US is a big factor behind the 17 per cent fall in the IFC Asian emerging markets index after four years of breathtaking gains. It did not, though, prevent some spectacular gains in less interest-rate-sensitive south American markets such as Brazil and Peru. Total net foreign investment in emerging markets for this year is likely to be about Dollars 25bn to Dollars 30bn, down from Dollars 38bn in 1993. The figure will probably fall again this year if US short rates are raised as aggressively as markets expect. The weight of money seeking a home in a limited selection of 'investable' securities in the developing world has been as much a factor in driving up share prices as the fundamental attractions of earnings growth far higher than that available in the developed world. The emerging markets will prove correspondingly vulnerable to any large-scale reversal of investment flows.</p>

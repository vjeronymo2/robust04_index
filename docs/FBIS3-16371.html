			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Reform continues in the country. Today, the state  company for the export and import of arms, Rosvooruzheniye  [Russian Arms], held a presentation for journalists. The former  USSR never traded in arms, but simply delivered them according  to agreements. So there has only been trade proper since 1991.  But in this sphere, liberalization has led to a situation where  dozens of Russian firms are tendering for contracts to supply  India with artillery shells, all selling the product of the same  factory. And the one who got the contract was the one who  knocked down his price one and one-half times.    By setting up Rosvooruzheniye, the government has created a  state monopoly on arms trading. But this does not mean that  enterprises are deprived of the opportunity to be involved in  foreign trade -- simply that this is now done under the guidance  of, or, to be more precise, while observing Rosvooruzheniye's  price controls. One of the company's main activities will be  investment of profits from promising research work -- at present  3-5 percent of the value of a contract. It will also receive  additional income, where the latter has been successful. The  arms trade is a subtle business.</p>

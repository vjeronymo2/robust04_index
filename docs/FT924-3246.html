			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Petrol prices to fall 12p a gallon BRITISH Petroleum is to cut wholesale petrol prices by up to 13.6p a gallon  -3p a litre - from midnight tonight, Deborah Hargreaves writes. Jet is to cut retail prices by 12p to take the price of its unleaded fuel to 199.6p a gallon. BP's reduction is believed to be the biggest ever and reflects falling oil prices and the strengthening of sterling against the dollar. World oil prices have fallen by almost Dollars 3 a barrel since October. The price cuts are also a sign of the intense competition in petrol retailing. Shell, Esso and Texaco say they are monitoring the situation but have not yet reduced prices. BP said that some of its stations in highly competitive areas were already charging prices that reflected the wholesale reduction and would cut prices even further.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shanghai, March 21 (XINHUA) -- Zhang Baochang, a  32-year-old intellectual, believes in luck.    Not long after he gained a master's degree specializing in  high- polymer research at the East China Institute of Chemical  Technology in 1988, he found a job at a science and technology  company, which he had hoped for.    "I like what I am doing," said Zhang, now serving as the  general manager of the Huachang Polymeter Company, one of  China's influential producers of preservative materials.    Last year saw his company generate profits totalling six  million yuan.    Zhang himself was commended as an outstanding scientist-cum-  entrepreneur.    "The reason I like to go in for business is that it gives me  a chance to apply sophisticated science to production and  fulfill the mission of a Chinese intellectual," Zhang said.    "It was this mission that has made me stay in China and  devote myself to the motherland," the general manager noted.    He attributed his company's credit to its high-tech  products,  and pledged to generate profits amounting to 10 million yuan  this year.    Zhang Baochang is typical of the young scientists who have  taken up business in China.    According to the latest statistics, there are about 5,000  non- governmental scientific enterprises, just like the Huachang  Polymeter Company, on the Chinese mainland. Heads of one third  of these enterprises are people under 40 years old.    Soon after these enterprises came into existence, they  employed a new operational mechanism to display the talents of  enterprising young people.    One example is Zhang Jianlong, 33, of the Shanghai Stone  Computer Company.    Zhang started as a salesman with the company in 1987. He was  promoted to head of the components workshop half a year later  because of his excellent work. He became general manager of the  company in 1990.    The company's sales income expanded from less than 100  million yuan in 1990 to 150 million yuan last year, developing  into one of the largest non-governmental scientific enterprises  in Shanghai.    Zhang said, "I am grateful to the company for paving the way  for me to do something I'd like to do."    Many young people share his view.    Zheng Baoqi, who has made 25 inventions, is serving as a  deputy general manager of the Shanghai Feige (Flying Pigeon)  Telecommunications Equipment Service Department under the  Shanghai No. 3 Telecommunications Equipment Plant.    By granting more autonomy to his employees and applying new  managerial measures, he made the scientists of the department  more enthusiastic about their work, and have completed 12  development projects, bringing in 270,000 yuan in profits a year.    In 1991 Zheng headed his department to set up a  joint-venture  telecommunications technology company with an American company.  Zheng became the deputy general manager in charge of the  development of science and technology and management.    His company, with a total of 78 employees, obtained a sales  income of 30 million yuan last year by developing advanced  telecommunications equipment.    "Only by applying science to production can we display our  talents properly," Zheng noted.    The deputy general manager is determined to compete in the  international market.    A survey shows that the 900,000 science workers in Shanghai  make about 2,000 research achievements a year, applying many of  them to production.    The output value generated by the 5,000 scientific  enterprises in the city totalled 20 billion yuan last year, and  is expected to top 40 billion yuan this year.    Xu Kuangdi, deputy mayor in charge of scientific work, said,  "The city is sure to have more such scientists-cum-entrepreneurs  as China's social environment further improves."</p>

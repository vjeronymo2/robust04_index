			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Rice farmers in Japan stage a ritual protest - A basic problem JAPANESE rice farmers plan to take to the streets of Tokyo today, in an orderly formation of 50 tractors, to make a carefully choreographed protest against the government's hints that the closed rice market must inevitably be opened to imports. This follows a promise of 'flexibility' by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, who has heralded, albeit through understatement, a new phase of debate on the most awkward issue confronting Japan in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. His apparent acceptance that a rice market opening is necessary provides a focus for the protesting farmers, many quietly resigned to the idea but still pressing loudly for generous compensation. 'We have to say we are opposed to imports, but there doesn't seem to be any way of stopping them,' lamented an official from a branch in Kumamoto of the Central Union of Agricultural Co-operatives, which organised the tractor protest and has invited a French farmers' representative to witness how it is done the Japanese way. A 26-year-old farmer in the same region of southern Japan complained that the quality of local rice is 'clearly higher' than the foreign product, but he and other producers may lose out 'because modern Japanese cannot tell the difference between good rice and bad rice'. There is still high emotion in some paddy fields, but part of that anger is directed against the country's manufacturers, whose 'excessive' exports are seen as a cause of international demands for a rice market opening. Protests will continue during the final stages of a debate which appeared to be settled two years ago, when the ruling Liberal Democratic party and farmers' representatives informally agreed that rice imports would inevitably be part of a Uruguay Round settlement. The script for the political theatre in Japan provides for the EC and US to settle their disagreement over agricultural trade, placing Japan at the centre of the negotiations and allowing the government to say it has defended farmers' interests in the face of international pressure. It may not happen until early next year, but Mr Miyazawa and his new cabinet are coming to terms with the responsibility of taking a decision on rice. Mr Koko Sato, chairman of the LDP's executive council, also suggested yesterday that the government must be 'flexible' on rice tariffication - the replacement of the existing ban with tariffs, supposed to be reduced gradually over coming years. He indicated that the agriculture ministry has already begun research on extra support for Japanese farmers. As Mr Sato suggests, there are two unsettled issues, the rate of tariffs and the compensation for farmers. Japanese officials have suggested that a tariff rate of 700 per cent may be high enough to keep out most of the foreign competition, particularly rice from Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and the US. But agriculture ministry officials insist that a special case must be made for rice and that the rate of tariff reduction must be minimal. They say that if rice is written into an international tariff schedule, ministry and farmers will lose control over the rate of decrease and the accompanying increase in imports. The ministry calculates that the foreign share can be restricted to between 5 and 7 per cent of the 10m-tonne Japanese market, prompting a similar reduction in the country's 2.5m hectares of rice fields. On that basis, the next figure to be negotiated is the rate of compensation. Japan already has a rice crop reduction scheme, and farmers are receiving incentives to convert paddy fields to melon or tobacco fields. Farmers are also likely to receive extra funds to advertise the homegrown product and their agricultural co-operatives are certain to get extra handouts for everything from vehicles to seminars on pest eradication.</p>

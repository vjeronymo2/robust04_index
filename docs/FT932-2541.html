			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Legal delay to ratification of Maastricht even after the legislation has gone through parliament - because of the threatened legal challenge to the government from the Euro-sceptics. The delay in ratification could be until the autumn. Although the government is confident that the challenge will be rejected by the courts, ministers will not proceed to ratification until this final hurdle has been cleared. The news will encourage the Euro-sceptics, whose plan to seek judicial review of the government's actions was seen by many Tory MPs as a futile and last-ditch attempt to stop the treaty's implementation. The threat of a challenge came last month after Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, led a government retreat and accepted an amendment which removed the social protocol from the parts of the treaty incorporated into British law. Then, the Euro-sceptics said that they would seek judicial review on the conflict between the legislation, which does not include the social chapter and the UK's opt out from it, and the government's plans to ratify a treaty that did. Whitehall officials expect the challenge not to materialise until after royal assent, expected in late July. Although the government will press for an expedited hearing, some officials recognise that it could put off ratification until September or October. One official said yesterday: 'Since you can't de-ratify, we would not want to be in a position where the government was in contempt of court.' The delay will be a blow for the government's business managers who have set an ambitious timetable to complete the bill by late July. Ministers hope that the debate on the social chapter, which is required before the treaty can come into force, will also to take place before the Commons disperses for the summer recess. It had been expected that this debate would be the last obstacle in the way of ratification, enabling the UK to ratify in the summer, and leaving Germany as the last country to ratify, probably in September. Detailed discussion of the bill in the House of Lords begins next Tuesday, and about 400 amendments - including one making provision for a referendum - have been put down for debate. In spite of the large number of amendments tabled, by agreeing to the customary intervals between the different stages of discussion, the Lords' business managers have built into their timetable an element of timing that could be compressed if it emerged that the committee stage discussion was unduly prolonged.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the </F> Democratic Left, by Stefan Hrcka; place and date not given:  "Discrimination in Privatization?"]    [Excerpts] At a meeting of the right-wing club in Zvolen  on 27 April, Milan Janicina (National Democratic Party-New  Alternative), minister for the administration and privatization  of national property, said that privatization by means of  so-called employee stock ownership would be applied only rarely.  We asked Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the Democratic  Left [SDL], whether this view is shared by the whole coalition.    [Weiss] I was surprised by this statement of the minister  for the administration and privatization of national property,  not because privatization by means of employee stock ownership  is in the SDL's program but because the equality of all  privatization methods is explicitly mentioned in the recent  Policy Statement of the Slovak Government, which is the joint  work of all coalition partners. This means that no method will  be preferred or, on the other hand, suppressed. I also want to  stress that the equality of privatization methods and procedures  is also laid down in the valid law on large-scale privatization.  [passage omitted] I would like to add that a number of  decisions involving the privatization process belongs to the  jurisdiction of the government as a whole and not just to that  of individual ministers and ministries.    [Hrcka] In other words, no decision on excluding employee  stock ownership from privatization has been made, and no  discussion of this issue has taken place in the government  coalition?    [Weiss] There has been no such decision. This is the  personal view of the minister for the administration and  privatization of national property. There are discussions in  the government about the concept of privatization. This concept  should be drawn up in cooperation between the Ministry for the  Administration and Privatization of National Property and branch  ministries. At any rate, the SDL will be pushing in the  government for the equality of individual privatization methods.  We will oppose administrative decisions made in advance,  without an analysis of the situation of individual enterprises  earmarked for privatization and without an evaluation of the  quality of individual privatization projects, determining how  many billions worth of property will be privatized by this or  that method and, above all, decisions made in advance about  which contenders or methods have better or poorer chances of  being successful. After all, this is exactly what we criticized  about the previous government.</p>

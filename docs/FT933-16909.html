			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / US court ruling puts back Nafta approval APPROVAL of the North American Free Trade Agreement appears unlikely this year after a US federal judge blocked its consideration by Congress when he ruled that the treaty's impact on the environment had not been assessed. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said the court's decision was not in the public interest and the administration would request an expedited appeal to a higher court. Meanwhile, it would continue to negotiate side agreements governing labour and the environment with Canada and Mexico, the other countries in the pact. The pact is bogged down in those negotiations and faces a battle in a Congress worried about lost jobs. Although the higher court might come to a decision within two months, there is no guarantee it would find in the administration's favour. Judge Charles Richey found that Mrs Carla Hills, the former trade representative, and ex-President George Bush had violated the Administrative Procedures Act by negotiating and signing Nafta - due to be implemented in January - without assessing its impact on the environment. The judge said they had violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires an environmental impact statement for 'every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment'. Mr Kantor said that, besides interfering with the president's ability to negotiate international agreements, the ruling raised serious doubts about the Uruguay Round of trade talks, which might also require environmental impact statements that could take months or years to compile. If there is a delay in passing Nafta, Mexico's economy would suffer worst. After the judge's decision, Mexico's stock market closed nearly 2 per cent down. Investors had expected an early Nafta accord to boost growth. The suit was brought by three environmental groups - Public Citizen, the Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth. Mr Michael McCloskey, chairman of the Sierra Club, said: 'This critical decision means trade agreements can never be negotiated again without a conscious consideration of the environment.'</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Sainsbury cleans up: A supermarket's detergent is leaving the market leaders on the shelf In few consumer markets is the battle for shelf space as ferocious as in household detergents, and in fewer still are the protagonists as powerful as Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever. The two companies dominate the business in most countries except Japan and spend huge sums on research, product development and marketing. But recently an upstart has contested their supremacy in Britain's Pounds 800m-a-year laundry detergents market, where their combined share of more than 80 per cent is among the highest in the world. The success of the new arrival, Novon, not only challenges recent trends in the detergents industry; if its initial momentum is sustained, it could herald a serious longer-term threat to the market power of P&amp;G and Unilever. The Novon range was launched last autumn, not by a manufacturer but by J. Sainsbury, the grocery chain, which sells a fifth of all detergents bought in Britain. Sainsbury says Novon, which undercuts prices of established brands by as much as 25 per cent, now accounts for more than a quarter of its total laundry detergent sales by volume, a fifth of basic powders and 40 per cent of concentrated powders and liquids. Own-label products are common in many grocery lines and provide two-thirds of Sainsbury's total sales. However, they have made few inroads until now in detergents, partly because P&amp;G and Unilever have invested heavily to support their brands. Last year, they spent about Pounds 80m on advertising in Britain. Since the mid-1980s the two companies have further raised the competitive stakes through sharply increased investment in technology and new products. Persil, Unilever's flagship brand, which was available in only two versions a decade ago, now comes in 25. Sainsbury knew it was taking on daunting odds. It had already launched an unsuccessful own-label line, Wash and Care, in the late 1980s. It tried again, it says, because it was keen to widen the chain's strong brand image beyond food sales - and because of the juicy profit margins available on detergents. This time, the company left little to chance. Novon is its most ambitious product development and involved unusually extensive market research. However, the 18-month programme cost less than Pounds 2m, a pittance by the standards of P&amp;G and Unilever. Sainsbury began by analysing why Wash and Care had failed and concluded it had underestimated the importance of product features such as particle size, colour and fragrance. These were given much closer attention in the new range. Novon was chosen from a short-list of 20 names drawn up by an outside agency, while a design consultancy was brought in to develop packaging intended to evoke the imagery of P&amp;G's Ariel and Unilever's Persil. To ensure uniform quality and regular delivery, production of Novon was entrusted to a single manufacturer - believed to be McBride, a BP subsidiary. Though backed by less than Pounds 200,000 in newspaper advertising to date, Novon has been strongly promoted in Sainsbury stores, where it is displayed separately from competing products. Publicly, P&amp;G and Unilever profess not to be worried by Novon - though both have recently responded with leaflet campaigns warning against 'cheap imitations'. Privately, they have good reason to be concerned. Novon's success shows that, for all the companies' recent emphasis on high-technology and rapid product innovation as competitive weapons, the detergent market remains open to new entrants with slender research and development budgets. 'Though P&amp;G and Unilever may obtain an advantage from a new idea for a short period, everyone will be working on it. These are areas where patenting is difficult,' says Mr Michael Rosen, Sainsbury's director of non-foods and Novon's main sponsor. 'Some of Unilever's raw materials suppliers are independent, so we can get supplies.' An even more delicate problem for the two companies is how to gauge their commercial response. They cannot afford to unleash the full force of their market power against Sainsbury, because it is no ordinary competitor - it is also their biggest and most powerful UK customer. 'It is obviously a complex relationship to manage,' admits Mr Andrew Seth, managing director of Lever Brothers, Unilever's British detergents subsidiary. The growing power of supermarkets generally has obliged P&amp;G and Unilever to tone down their formerly high-handed approach to the retail trade. These days they, and other big manufacturers, talk of the need for constructive co-operation and a relationship of equals. However, Mr Rosen does not sound like a man in a mood to compromise. There are already too many detergent brands on supermarket shelves, he says, and manufacturers are 'storing up a lot of trouble for themselves' by flooding the market with new products. 'Someone will have to decide on storage space,' he says, adding pointedly: 'Retailers are making decisions today that they would not have felt strong or courageous enough to make five years ago.' Novon, of course, has increased the squeeze on shelf space, while its sales success promises to strengthen Sainsbury's bargaining power with P&amp;G and Unilever by countering the power of their expensively supported brands. For the moment, the big detergent manufacturers are watching and waiting to see whether their precocious new rival stays the course. If it does - and if its example is emulated by other supermarkets in the UK and the rest of Europe - P&amp;G and Unilever may have to fight much harder to remain the consumer's choice.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The direction in FSH 2709.11, section 41.23a, providing procedural direction on continuing the use and issuing a new permit, brought forth comments cautioning against ``useless and unnecessary EA or EIS studies.'' These respondents suggested that extraordinary circumstances should not automatically require preparation of environmental analyses. Other respondents suggested that the entire section 41.23a be removed since the guidance prejudges, skews and appears to bias the process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Forest Service agrees the proposed policy and procedures applicable when recreation residence use is consistent with the Forest plan is unnecessarily complex. It also agrees that situations under which extraordinary circumstances would apply to permit continuation are too broad and need refinement. When use is consistent, the policy should provide an expedited process resulting in a new permit. The Forest plan is the means by which environmentally sensitive areas are identified and managed. The presence of extraordinary circumstances should not force additional environmental documentation unless it is clearly established that a material adverse environmental effect could result by continuing the use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the agency has substantially revised the proposed policy at FSM 2721.23e, paragraph 2, and FSH 2709.11, section 41.23a. This revision recognizes the public comments and the final revised NEPA policy and procedures adopted by the agency in 1992. The NEPA policy substantially clarified previous policy for excluding actions from environmental documentation. Further, the agency has chosen to minimize its direction on environmental documentation in the final policy and guidance and instead refers to the NEPA policy found in FSH 1909.15. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Briefly, recreation residence uses that are consistent with the Forest plan will, upon expiration of the current term permit, be issued a new term permit. The environmental documentation supporting the Forest plan will, in most cases, be sufficient for documenting the decision to continue the recreation residence use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When issuing new permits, a record of decision or decision notice and finding of no significant impact would be prepared only if the recreation residence use was not specifically approved in the Forest plan decision document. Issuance of a new permit is an implementation action of a Forest plan decision approving recreation residence use. The NEPA compliance requirement is fulfilled by the Forest plan environmental impact statement. Recreation residence use which has changed since being found consistent with the Forest plan would require further NEPA analysis and documentation. In most cases this analysis would cause the action to fall within a category of actions excluded from NEPA documentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An exception to the above may occur if the environmental documentation supporting the decision to continue the recreation residence use is more than 5 years old at the time of permit expiration. This requirement is set forth in the agency's Environmental Policy and Procedures Handbook (FSH 1909.15, sec. 18.03) and is based on the Council on Environmental Quality's ``Forty Questions'' document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The action necessary to issue the new term permit would commence two years before permit expiration and the holder notified of the action. New permits that continue the use would contain updated clauses that reflect current Department of Agriculture regulations and other Federal, State, or county laws applicable to the area covered by the permit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the agency is adopting final policy as described above. This is set forth at FSM 2721.23e, paragraph 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Use Not Consistent With the Forest Plan_Project Analysis. The proposed policy at FSM 2721,23e, paragraph 2b, provided direction on action to be taken when the recreation residence use was not consistent with the Forest plan. Procedural guidance at FSH 41.23b described the procedure to follow in conducting a project analysis. The recreation residence use would be inconsistent when the lands currently authorized for recreation residence use are allocated to other public uses by the Forest plan. Continued recreation residence use would thus be inconsistent with new management prescriptions, standards and guidelines. This could occur when a Forest plan defines a management area of the National Forest for developed recreation use and an amendment to the plan changes this to threatened or endangered species habitat. The recreation residence use would then apparently be inconsistent with the new management area designation. In this case, a ``project analysis'' would be prepared to determine whether the use could be accommodated along with the alternative public use, or must be removed upon permit expiration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The project analysis would identify a range of public uses consistent with the Forest plan direction, including consideration of continuing the recreation residence use, that would be compatible with the management area designation. If this analysis indicates the recreation residence use could continue, a decision would be made to issue a new permit upon expiration of the current permit. Since continuation of the use had been determined to be inconsistent with the Forest plan, the plan would have to be amended to accommodate the changed determination. If the analysis indicates that the use cannot continue, the holder would be notified that a new permit will not be issued upon expiration of the current permit. In this event, the holder would receive at least 10 years of continued occupancy from the date of notification and may be offered an alternative location, or in-lieu lot, for the use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Taiwan hits 11-month high after jail release DOMESTIC events encouraged both Taiwan and New Zealand yesterday, although most Pacific Rim markets declined. Tokyo and Bangkok were shut. TAIWAN rose to an 11-month high in active trading, encouraged by the release from jail of Weng You-ming, chairman of Hualon Corp, after his detention for more than a month on alleged involvement in a share scandal. The weighted index, which advanced 67.83 on Saturday, climbed 191.31 or 3.2 per cent to 6,112.09, the best close since June 1990 and the first above 6,000 this year. Turnover rose to TDollars 91bn from TDollars 51bn. NEW ZEALAND welcomed the news of a further reduction in debt at Brierley Investments. The Barclays index gained 25.39 or 1.7 per cent to 1,553.22 in active turnover of NZDollars 22m, down from NZDollars 33m. Brierley jumped 10 cents to NZDollars 1.20 after saying that it had sold 30 per cent of Mount Charlotte, the UK hotel chain. AUSTRALIA edged higher on foreign buying of blue chips such as MIM Holdings, up 7 cents at ADollars 1.70, and BHP, 30 cents higher at ADollars 12.35. The All Ordinaries index gained 4.6 to 1,522.4 in modest turnover of ADollars 187m, up from ADollars 159m. Coles Myer fell 20 cents to ADollars 10.50 after sales figures. HONG KONG was depressed by Friday's issue of a second batch of warrants on two blue chips controlled by billionaire Li Ka-Shing. The Hang Seng index dropped 33.45 to 3,704.43 in turnover of HKDollars 1.46bn, down from HKDollars 1.82bn. Cheung Kong dropped 50 cents to HKDollars 18 in response to the warrant issue, which was interpreted as a sign that that Li might be seeking ways to cash out of the market. SEOUL fell for the third day on political concerns. The composite index lost 4.88 to 640.62, in slow turnover of Won111bn, down from Won118bn. SINGAPORE fell, the Straits Times Industrial index tumbling 27.15 or 1.8 per cent to 1,518.80 as volume eased to SDollars 105m from SDollars 118m. KUALA LUMPUR also declined in light trading. The composite index lost 8.58 to 579.51.</p>

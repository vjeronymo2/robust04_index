			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Hunt puts Tory case in Wales MR DAVID HUNT, Welsh secretary, advised Welsh electors yesterday to follow the lead of the general election and return Conservative candidates at tomorrow's local elections. He said: 'The government has helped to transform the face of Wales, not least through the garden festival in Ebbw Vale, which opened its doors last Friday. 'In local government, we have sought to provide the best services at the lowest possible cost to the taxpayer - a contrast with the Labour party's commitment to building extravagant temples to municipal socialism at the voters' expense.' Mr Hunt was speaking in Newport, one of only four Welsh boroughs where voting is being held. All are dominated by Labour. The boroughs are Swansea, where Labour has 31 seats out of the 51 and the Conservatives nine; Port Talbot, where Labour has 24 of the 31 seats and the Conservatives are unrepresented; the Rhondda, where Labour has 29 of the 33 seats and the Conservatives are also unrepresented; and Newport, where Labour has 40 seats and the Conservatives seven. The four boroughs are the last of the 37 in Wales that hold elections every year, a third of the councillors retiring in rotation. All the others go to the polls every four years, with the next elections scheduled for 1995. There are, however, doubts over whether the counties and boroughs will go to the polls again in their present form, as local-government reorganisation is high on the political agenda.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Shi Qingbin (2457 3237 1755): "China's Foreign </F> Trade Official Says Foreign Investment Structure Has Changed"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 19 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Ma  Xiuhong, deputy director of the Foreign Investment Management  Department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation, met with reporters this morning in Hong Kong. He  said: It is expected that foreign capital will continue to flow  into China, but a structural change in foreign investment will  occur. For example, the investment in the real estate industry  has begun to shift to the construction of lower-cost housing  with slight profits and the reconstruction of the old urban  districts. Large infrastructural projects in the fields of  energy production and transportation will also attract more  foreign investment.    Ma Xiuhong said: In the course of developing the socialist  market economy, China will gradually improve the relevant  legislation in order to meet the needs of the market economy.  The policy for using foreign funds will also be adjusted to a  certain degree. However, the adjustments will make it more  favorable to outside investors in the mainland. The current  favorable policies for investment made by Hong Kong, Macao, and  Taiwan compatriots on the mainland will not change.    Ma Xiuhong said: In recent years, foreign investment in  China's interior areas increased faster than that in the coastal  areas. Although the base is low, foreign investment in the  interior has great potential. It is completely possible to  further heighten the speed of attracting foreign investment  there.    She said: Over the past two to three years, the amount of  foreign investment attracted by China has increased rapidly.  The number of contracts and agreements concerning foreign  investment in China and the amounts of foreign investment  actually made in China in 1992 all exceeded the total of the  previous 13 years. Foreign investment again doubled in 1993 on  the basis of that in 1992. By the end of 1993, there were more  than 174,000 foreign-funded enterprises in mainland China, and  their total investment reached $220 billion. The amount of  foreign funds actually used by them reached $61.8 billion.</p>

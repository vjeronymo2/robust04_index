			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / TGWU is seen as 'personnel-heavy' The TGWU, Britain's biggest union, is too 'expensive, bureaucratic and personnel-heavy,' according to a report from Klein &amp; Co, management consultants. They criticised the the 11 TGWU regions for acting as 'mini-unions'. Their report said the union should introduce proper budgeting and accounting systems and use resources more efficiently. Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, outlined the main findings of the report but stressed that no decisions had been taken on it. He indicated that the three smallest regions  - on the north coast, south coast and east coast  - were likely to be merged. He was unclear about how the political and financial autonomy of the remaining regions would be reduced to create the 'one union' culture recommended by Klein, but said there were no plans to centralise the collection of union dues. The report said the union should merge district offices, introduce proper budgeting and accounting systems, provide more professional support for officials and use its assets more efficiently. Its use of property, including its headquarters in London, should be improved to reduce the proportion  - 95 per cent  - of income the union derives from membership subscriptions. Mr Morris conceded that one reason the TGWU had missed out on mergers with smaller unions was because it had been too 'fractured'.</p>

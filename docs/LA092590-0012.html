			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $5-MILLION BAIL FOR KEATING  </P> <P> Recently, as I drove past my old Lincoln Savings branch, my mind wandered back  to the days when I enjoyed just stopping by to view Abraham Lincoln relics on  display in the lobby.  </P> <P> Somehow, it gave me a feeling of confidence to know that my savings were in the  hands of those who revered the principles of honest dealings so closely  identified with Honest Abe.  </P> <P> Now the place looks shabby and my vision of the care-worn face of Lincoln faded  for a moment only to be replaced by the figures of Keating and Cranston. Of  such experiences cynics are created and innocence is lost.  </P> <P> JOHN De ROO JR.  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

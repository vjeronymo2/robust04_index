Signing for the Russian side were Victor  Khlystun, minister of agriculture and foodstuffs and chairman of  the Russian commission; and (Genedy Roskoskov), trade  representative of the Russian Federation to Laos. According to  the two documents, the two sides have agreed to render immediate  assistance to organizations concerned to set up a joint  Lao-Russian business venture on the basis of the laws of each  country. The Russian side expressed their readiness to study  proposals to ensure the normal operations of all business  enterprises and projects set up during the period of technical  assistance provided by the former Soviet Union. As for  scientific and technical cooperation, the Lao side reaffirmed  its readiness to set up scientific and technical cooperation  with Russia on the basis of the utilization of its own natural  resources, technical lessons from Russian, and funds from third  countries, the IMF, and interested businessmen. The fundamental  task of this cooperation program is the protection of the  environment, the conservation and restoration of forests, the  raising of the level of harvest efficiency, the eradication of  crop pests, and mining and exploration.</p>

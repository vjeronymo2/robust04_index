			<p>Language: <F P=105> Somali </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Abdulaziz Shaykh Yusuf, deputy chairman of the  Somali National Alliance, SNA, who is also the chairman of the  Southern Somali National Movement [SSNM], today attended a press  conference held by Mohamed Nur Hufane, the chairman of the  United Somali Front [USF]. The press conference, which was held  at the SNA headquarters in Mogadishu, was attended by local and  foreign journalists.    Speaking at the press conference, the USF chairman said that  his organization started the struggle with the SSNM and the  principal objective was to uphold the Somali people's unity and  that it wanted existing disagreements to be resolved through  dialogue. Mr. Hufane said that after it became clear that the  SNA's objective was based on peace and the unification of the  Somali people, which conformed with the USF's objective based on  the restoration of peace among the Somali people, the USF had  decided to join the SNA, as had other organizations.    He said that he had held meetings with leaders of Somali  organizations and discussed ways of finding a just solution to  Somali problems. Mr Hufane said that recently he and his  delegation had held talks with leaders of the Horn of Africa  countries, including the Kenyan and Sudanese presidents [as  heard]. Answering many questions from local and international  journalists, Mr. Hufane said there was no internal conflict in  the USF Central Committee, of which he was chairman. He said  his organization would never accept disunity among the Somali  people. [passage omitted]</p>

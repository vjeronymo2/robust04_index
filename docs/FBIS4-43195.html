			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ioannis Loulis] </F>   [Excerpts] The well-known public opinion poll "Trends" by  the MRB organization, in view of the elections for the European  Parliament, presents some particularly interesting findings on  the current political climate in Greece. The poll, which was  conducted from 14 to 24 May, had a sample of 2,000 voters and is  carried out every six months.    The main findings of the report, which included specific  questions from Sky radio and I KATHIMERINI, are the following:    First: Regarding voter preferences, the poll does not add  anything new since it was carried out before the campaign  reached its climax. In comparison with previous polls, there  appear to be more undecided voters--up to 17.1 percent--rather  than less. According to MRB's findings, PASOK [Panhellenic  Socialist Movement] will easily maintain its leading position,  but New Democracy will close the gap. Political Spring will  show a significant increase. The Coalition of the Left and  Progress will increase its power, while the KKE [Greek Communist  Party] will maintain its power at the current level. [passage  omitted]    Second: The most substantially positive aspect of the  government is that it is considered better than the New  Democracy government of 1990-93. The two main answers to a  question regarding the government's positive aspects do not  relate to its achievements but to the "climate" it cultivates.  According to these findings, the current government is  considered moderate and open to dialogue by 46.4 percent and 45  percent respectively. The government's main advantage is that  it is considered better than the New Democracy one, with 44.3  percent responding, and the prime minister's rating is also  favorable, with 42.4 percent responding. The government's main  weaknesses are that it can only convince 29.6 percent of the  respondents that it can deal with the economic crisis, and that  only 25.1 percent of the voters consider it credible (that it  can do what it promised).    Third: The government's Achilles heel is the lack of  confidence regarding the effectiveness of its economic policy.  The MRB's "Trends" confirms this at many fronts: a) 31.2  percent of the voters express great confidence in the  government's economic policy, whereas 65.5 percent express no  confidence; b) 7.4 percent of the voters show a positive  judgment of the government's economic policy whereas 17 percent  are neutral and 63.7 percent are negative. [passage omitted]    Fourth: New Democracy has three weaknesses, two of which  relate to its past government of 1990-93 and one to the present.  The party's main weakness, which hurts its credibility today,  is the economic policy that it implemented between 1990 and 1993  and that was mentioned by 56.1 percent of the voters asked. The  other weakness mentioned was "economic scandals," by 52.9  percent of those asked. Regarding the present, "serious  internal problems" is mentioned as a weakness. On the contrary,  the fact that only 12.2 percent mentioned [New Democracy  Chairman] Miltiadhis Evert as a "problem" and only 20.1 percent  said that the party does not have capable officials to govern,  shows that Evert and his officials are the party's "winning  cards."    Fifth: The fact that [Prime Minister and PASOK Chairman]  Andreas Papandreou and Evert are the "winning cards" of their  parties is also indicated by their popularity. Coalition of the  Left and Progress Chairman Nikolaos Konstandopoulos has a lot of  friends and the difference between his positive and negative  ratings is 27.8 percent on the positive side. Evert has a  positive differential of 8.4 percent and Papandreou a 4.2  percent positive differential. Regarding [Political Spring  Chairman] Andonios Samaras, the negative opinions prevail  slightly by 2.9 percent. Whereas KKE Secretary General Aleka  Papariga has a negative differential of 35.8 percent. [passage  omitted]    Sixth: The most positive finding for New Democracy is the  feeling that a government with Evert as prime minister would  possibly be better than the current government. This view  confirms earlier MRB findings in Athens and now is confirmed  throughout the country. Specifically, 31.4 percent believe that  a government under Evert would be better than the current [under  Papandreou], 29.3 percent said it would be worse, and 27.9  percent consider that it would be the "same." At the same  time, 37 percent of voters consider the current government  better that the previous one under New Democracy, 32.3 percent  consider it the "same," and only 28.7 percent consider it worse.  [passage omitted]    Seventh: Papandreou's succession is the issue that appears  to be the source of instability for PASOK. In the first poll  after the death of Yeoryios Yennimatas--who was thought to be  the most appropriate to succeed Papandreou--four candidates  prevailed. Specifically, among PASOK supporters the order is  the following: [Former European Union Commissioner and  currently deputy] Vaso Papandreou 14.7 percent, [Industry  Minister] Konstandinos Simitis 13 percent, [Alternate Foreign  Minister on European Union affairs] Theodhoros Pangalos 12.1  percent, and [National Defense Minister] Yerasimos Arsenis 11.2  percent. Dhimitrios Tsovolas and Akis Tzokhatzopoulos follow  clearly behind with 8.7 percent and 7 percent respectively.  What appears as evidence of instability for PASOK, beyond the  fact that no one or two candidates to "succeed" Papandreou  prevailed, is that the most probable successor--especially among  PASOK voters--is Tzokhatzopoulos, even though he received a low  percentage as the most suitable in the successor category.  Apparently, PASOK voters consider Tzokhatzopoulos as the most  probable successor to Papandreou with 24.5 percent, followed by  Arsenis with 11.8 percent. On the contrary, Vaso Papandreou,  Simitis and Pangalos, who are considered as the most suitable  with high percentages, received only 4.9 percent, 8.6 percent  and 7.1 percent respectively.

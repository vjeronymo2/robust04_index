			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Arts: La Boheme - Covent Garden In the 18 years since it was new, the Royal Opera's production of La Boheme has played host to most of the leading tenors of a generation, including the big three of Carreras, Domingo and Pavarotti. With the marvellous music that Puccini gave his Rodolfo this can easily become a tenor's opera and that is exactly what happened at the first night of this revival on Saturday. The good reports that have been coming out of La Scala, Milan, about Roberto Alagna have not lied. French by birth, Sicilian by descent, this young tenor could hardly be more ideally suited to play the poet in Puccini's tale of Parisian romance. He has the looks and the stage presence, bright, smiling, quickly smartening up his hair when he hears there is a girl at his door, as well as a voice that has the role easily within its compass. This last was fortunate in the circumstances, as he was saddled with the most obtuse conductor of Puccini that this production can have witnessed in all its two decades. Mark Ermler kills the music with kindness. When the pace should be firm, he slows up. When it slows, he very nearly stops altogether. The gap between one phrase and the next becomes a ravine of silence, on the edge of which the singers are left to teeter nervously. There was no chance for the Rodolfo to make this a performance of headstrong, veristic passion and Alagna wisely did not try. Instead he used the time at his disposal to shape musical phrases of considerable elegance and beauty, varying the tone with real tenderness when he sings quietly. There is not a lot of flesh on the voice as yet, but it is a healthy sound, fresh, sappy, technically well placed. He is welcome back in London at any time. There were other debuts at this revival, including the Mimi of the Romanian soprano Angela Gheorghiu. Those with happy memories of this production will think back to her compatriot Ileana Cotrubas in the same role, but Gheorghiu is a different kind of singer, harder in sound and a touch more resilient in nature too, so that she does not win hearts so easily, although she does sing as though she cares about every phrase. Anthony Michaels-Moore was the new Marcello, not sounding very Italianate alongside Alagna, but he is taking confidently to the larger roles with which the Royal Opera is now entrusting him. Bruno Caproni and Clive Bayley completed the Bohemian quartet ably enough, without erasing memories of their predecessors. Either the audience lacked a sense of humour or their comic routines have lost their edge over the years. The latter seems more likely and so this revival gets its recommendation mainly for the chance to hear a young (half-) Italian tenor of outstanding promise. Note, however, that Alagna does not sing in the last two performances. Performances continue until 17 June. (Box Office: 071 240 1066.)</p>

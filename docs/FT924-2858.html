			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: Gillette buys Polish razor unit GILLETTE group has agreed to pay Dollars 1.5m for the Wizamet razor blade factory, in Poland's latest privatisation, writes Christopher Bobinski. The US group has also promised to invest Dollars 7.5m in the loss-making plant which once monopolised the domestic market. Half of Wizamet's output is exported. Poland's privatisation revenues next year are set to reach 8,800bn zlotys (Dollars 578m), of which half will come from sales of companies to foreign investors and public share offers. ***** TIME WARNER, the large US media and entertainment group, yesterday forecast an average annual rise in its operating profits of at least 13 per cent over the next five years, writes Alan Friedman. Mr Geoffrey Holmes, a Time Warner vice-president, also told a seminar in New York that the debt-laden group plans to bolster its balance sheet by 'monitising' around Dollars 3bn of non-earning assets owned by the company. Mr Holmes appeared to open the door to asset sales or the issue of asset-backed notes, including a 21 per cent shareholding in Turner Broadcasting System, the parent of Cable News Network (CNN) controlled by Mr Ted Turner.</p>

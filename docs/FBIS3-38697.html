[Ahtisaari] Of course, first of all I would like to thank  Elisabeth Rehn for a good and fair campaign. I think that is  quite an essential factor, for which I want to thank Elisabeth  Rehn. I also hope that the people who voted for Elisabeth Rehn  can also give their support for me in these new and difficult  tasks. At the same time, of course, I want to thank all those  who have taken part in my campaign, thousands of volunteers in  various parts of Finland. I am very grateful to all of them and  to all of you, good friends. Without your work these elections  would never have ended as they did.    [Reporter] The nation is not divided?    [Ahtisaari] I would say that the future president will face  very difficult tasks, both in the economy, politics,  internationally, and then it is important that the nation is not  divided over these issues, and I will insure that I will be seen  as the president of the entire country. This is the way I  intend to take things forward. In fact, during my entire  campaign I have stressed that the Finnish nation must not be  divided over these issues. [passage omitted]</p>

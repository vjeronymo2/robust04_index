			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by staff correspondent Sergio Berrutti from Punta </F> del Este]    [Text] While the 17th Inter-American Naval Conference will  resolve to continue with the Unitas operations, the commanders  in chief of the Navies of American countries--who are also  meeting in Punta del Este--agreed that although "the threat of a  war has decreased, regional conflicts will increase and these  conflicts will mark the guidelines in defense matters."    This information was given to EL OBSERVADOR by James Coates,  the commander in chief of the Uruguayan Navy, who also pointed  out that Navies will place greater emphasis on safeguarding the  interests of the state within its territorial waters.    President Luis Alberto Lacalle on 24 March lunched with the  commanders in chief of the 16 participating countries. Prior to  the luncheon, he said: "The naval topic has an enormous  importance for Uruguay, because our territorial waters are  nearly as large as our land area."    He maintained: "The government has enhanced the nation's  maritime role. During our tenure we have incorporated six units  and are carrying out patrols. We are protecting our natural  resources. We are ready for the task of an eventual defense that  one hopes will not occur."    Coates told EL OBSERVADOR: "The reason for these meetings is  to exchange ideas, opinions, and to submit papers on the common  links of the Continent's Navies." He added: "The naval roles  within the framework of the new world order were the main topics  discussed at this conference."    He remarked: "There was an exchange of information regarding  the policing role by the Navies and on the fight against  trafficking."    Coates indicated that a common point that was expounded by  the participating countries was the fact that "governments have  become more relaxed, that the threat of a war is seen as minor,  that regional conflicts will increase, and thus they will set  guidelines for defense matters."    Uruguay, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia,  Chile,  Ecuador, the United States, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico,  Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, Venezuela, and a delegation from the  Inter-American Defense Board are participating in the meeting,  which will conclude this coming weekend.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jiri Hanak, president of the Sellier and </F> Bellot management board, by Zdenek Hoffmann; place and date not  given: "We Are at the Center of Intelligence Games"]    [Text] [Hoffmann] Apart from drugs and pornography, the  trade in arms and ammunition is at the center of interest to  organized crime and illicit dealers. Has it ever happened to  you that you received a suspicious order?    [Hanak] This is not something that happens every day, but it  does happen. When trading in this kind of product, the  principles fixed by the law and international treaties must be  respected. We respect them. We are not interested in damaging  the reputation of our firm and the Czech Republic. We cooperate  with state bodies and the licensing department of the Ministry  of Industry and Trade. This ministry verifies the authenticity  of the documents and the customer. This is how we try to  prevent a possible misuse of our products.    [Hoffmann] So, you have not encountered problems like those  in the French film "Three Men to Kill"?    [Hanak] We have had instances where firms and also  individuals wanted to purchase ammunition for strange purposes.  Such cases are reaching an increasingly professional level of  deception. They are transparent attempts at making a deal.  They also include lobbying and attempts to influence the  management of the company. We even have information that we are  at the center of professional intelligence games. We also have  reports that pressure is exerted on members of the management of  the company, but they have to resist it because they want to  stick strictly to the law.    [Hoffmann] Most dirty deals in the world are about military  weapons and ammunition. How much of your production enters them?    [Hanak] We export ammunition to about 60 countries. Some 98  percent of the ammunition that we manufacture is designated for  hunting and target shooting; the rest is military. However, it  is difficult to tell how many of the bullets--for example,  pistol bullets--are really used for target shooting and how many  for training security firms or for other purposes. The bullets  are usually the same.    [Hoffmann] Recently, there was a report in the press that,  at the IWA, the international exposition in Germany, you  concluded a deal for ammunition sales amounting to half a  billion korunas. Is such a deal usual in your business?    [Hanak] No, it is not. We held business talks at the fair,  during which previously placed orders were discussed. We had  anticipated these deliveries. Nevertheless, I believe this is a  great business success.    [Hoffmann] You are engaged in a lucrative business with  ammunition. Is your conscience clear when you read in papers  about murders or about cases where someone has lost his life?    [Hanak] If the Czech firms stop delivering weapons and  ammunition, others will deliver them. Foreign competition would  like to enter the Czech market and take over our positions  abroad. I cannot imagine that hunters would go back to using  bows and arrows or that police could do without firearms when  chasing criminals.    [Hoffmann] In the West, they use rubber bullets that do not  kill. Can you, too, produce them?    [Hanak] We have developed cartridges with rubber bullets and  lead shot. We can supply them to the Czech police, if they show  an interest. Apart from that, we manufacture cartridges with  steel shot, which are used not to kill but to get quickly into a  building through a closed door.    [Hoffmann] For three years, you have not delivered anything  to our Army. The Army was responsible for almost half of your  production. Your economic results show that you have managed  this.    [Hanak] The establishment of the shareholders' company in  May 1992 was followed by the arrival of new management. This  management adjusted very quickly to the market conditions, and,  within several months, Sellier and Bellot went from a loss to a  profit. Our first goal was to secure the economic stability of  the company and to keep the employees on. We have succeeded in  both.    [Hoffmann] The stock quoted on the stock market is a sure  reflection of the company's prosperity. Sellier and Bellot  shares are priced at 2,000 korunas. Does this correspond to the  economic situation in the company?    [Hanak] We are very happy with the stock market's objective  appreciation of our work. I believe that the price could be  even higher.    [Hoffmann] Where have you found the competent people?    [Hanak] We found them among our own people and in other  enterprises. For our foreign trade activity, we have used the  experience of former employees in foreign trade organizations.  It paid off to stick to the principle that we should select our  people in a way beneficial to our society and to the reputation  of the Czech industry. We rejected certain tendentious  criteria, which did not have anything in common with real  qualifications. The economic results of the company testify  that we made a good selection. Apart from that, several  domestic and foreign organizations have shown interest in our  experience. Representatives of investment funds come here  asking us for advice on how to organize foreign trade, the  management of the company, and the company's internal bank. I  have received two invitations to lecture abroad. They are  interested in our experience with the transition from a  centrally planned economy to a market economy. The first  invitation is from a consortium of banks in Great Britain; the  second is from Sweden.    [Hoffmann] Do you believe that your experience can be  generalized? Enterprises are complaining that it is impossible  to do business in the Czech Republic.    [Hanak] This is the excuse of incompetent management. The  conditions for running a business in the Czech Republic are not  ideal, but, to good management, they allow the securing of the  prosperity of the enterprise.    [Hoffmann] You have begun to produce projectiles with the  same caliber as NATO's. Are you counting on selling them to the  Czech Army and increasing your arms production?    [Hanak] We are following the trend whereby our Army's  weapons will be replaced and the Army will join NATO in the  future. This is our small contribution to supporting our  government, which made this decision. Moreover, we will prove  that Czech industry is capable of manufacturing the same  products as Western industry.    [Hoffmann] You have launched a new line of production, but  the decision on the replacement of the weapons of our Army will  be made in the summer, and it will take years before individual  steps are implemented. Does that mean that the production of  the ammunition with NATO calibers will be suspended until then?    [Hanak] We are negotiating several orders for abroad.    [Hoffmann] Are you not afraid that, when the decision on  replacing the weapons of our Army is made, your company will be  forgotten and ammunition will be imported from abroad?    [Hanak] Such considerations are premature. Even if there is  no direct decision that we are to supply the Czech Army with  projectiles, we are going to win the competition because our  offer is more advantageous than that of our foreign competitors.    [Hoffmann] In other countries, do they prefer domestic firms  to foreign ones when supplying their armies?    [Hanak] In some countries, they buy weapons and ammunition  exclusively from domestic companies. There are countries in  which there are tenders for part of the deliveries. In 95  percent of cases, they are won by domestic companies.    [Hoffmann] You would certainly welcome it if Czech companies  participated in the replacement of the weapons of our Army in  the future. Are you as great a patriot as you are a hunter?    [Hanak] I use Sellier and Bellot bullets, a shotgun from the  Brno Arms Factory, and a hunting gun and rifle from the Cesky  Brod Arms Factory.</p>

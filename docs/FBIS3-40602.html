			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Madam, You Too Will Be Rolled Back!"] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, while addressing  editors of national newspapers in Islamabad, said that the  question of rolling back Pakistan's peaceful nuclear program  does not arise, because the nation's defense depends on it. She  said that the last four governments agreed fully on this issue,  and that all were united on it. She also asked the United States  to review its decision on the use of the Pressler Amendment  against Pakistan, and the unfair treatment that was practiced  over the last several years.    Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto made this announcement at a  time when her statement, in which she had earlier admitted that  Pakistan's nuclear program was frozen at the July 1990 level,  was being discussed in political, journalistic, and intellectual  circles. This happened during her previous administration.  Later, however, even after an explanation by a federal  spokesperson, Benazir Bhutto's comment became a subject of  criticism and analysis. Now that she has very loudly and clearly  told editors from around the country that the nuclear program  will be continued, popular opinion will definitely be positively  affected, and it will also help in correcting the records.  Still, the opposition insists (actually accuses) that Madam  Bhutto's earlier statement was not just a statement, but an  admission. Still, this question is very important, and it  requires an explanation: who committed the condemnable act of  freezing the peaceful nuclear program, which symbolizes our  nation's security and pride, at the July 1990 level?    We do not have to elaborate on the fact that the United  States of America and European nations openly provide  technology, advice, equipment, and other things to nuclear  programs all over the world, earning billions of dollars in  doing so. The nuclear programs of Israel, India, Japan,  Argentina, and South Africa come under this category. But they  do not object to these programs. If there are any objections in  this context, they are limited to opposition to the Islamic  world, and Pakistan is a chosen target, because Iraq's military  and nuclear capabilities were destroyed in the Gulf war. The  U.S. opposition to Pakistan has reached the point where it does  not give permission to Pakistani students in the United States  to register for classes in nuclear technology and related  subjects. Military and economic aid to Pakistan was stopped  three years ago under the notorious Pressler Amendment. The F-16  planes, which were already paid for according to the agreement,  were not supplied to us, and even some U.S. circles have  admitted that Washington's unfair treatment of Pakistan has now  reached extremes.    Soon after Benazir Bhutto's statements in July 1990 about  freezing the nuclear program, we received news from Washington  which clearly and simply indicated that the Pressler Amendment  will end now. Michael McCurry, a U.S. State Department  spokesman, went as far as implying that aid to Pakistan would be  reinstated. Benazir herself has said, "We cannot get rid of the  Pressler Amendment without rolling back our program." Against  this background, a worrisome question emerges. How can the  Pressler Amendment, which was very effective until a few days  ago, suddenly become useless? Why has the White House decided to  take it back? What are the circumstances that have forced the  United States, even after seeing the Kahuta plant in operation,  to reinstate aid to Pakistan? In this context, the concern of  our fellow citizens that there is something suspicious about the  present nuclear policy is valid (to an extent).    We believe that Madam Benazir Bhutto should complete her  five-year term in the Prime Minister's house, because this is  necessary to encourage democratic institutions and stability. We  cannot help any effort to shake up her government without any  reason. But it is the duty of Benazir Bhutto to remove all the  doubts and skepticism about the present government's intention  to make some agreement with the United States over the nuclear  program, which has resulted in good will messages from  Washington. We want to tell Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in  loud, clear, and direct words that if she rolls back our nuclear  program, she herself will be rolled back!</p>

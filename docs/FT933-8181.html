			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Impala cuts payout as metal prices weaken SOUTH AFRICA'S Impala Platinum, the world's second-largest producer, is cutting its dividend by 18 per cent to 140 cents per share in the year to June as weak metal prices caused attributable income to fall by 22 per cent to R200.7m (Dollars 59.70m). The weak financial results disguised a considerable improvement in group operating performance. Mr Michael McMahon, chairman, said the group had left behind the technical and industrial relations problems of 18 months ago. 'The on-going process of technical advance and improving operational efficiencies have put the group in a position to survive and compete in the current market and to face the future from a more robust base,' he said. Although the group achieved record production levels, a 17 per cent reduction in the total sales revenue per ounce of platinum to R2,010, caused turnover to fall by 2 per cent to R2.21bn from R2.26bn. Mining income dropped by 38 per cent to R294.1m from R476.1m. Increased production and tight cost control saw unit costs fall by 9 per cent. This followed retrenchment measures which saw the labour force decline by 18 per cent - 8,000 people - between December 1991 and June this year. Capital expenditure was curtailed drastically to R157m from R411m in 1992. Impala is now planning only a modest production increase, to 1.2m ounces a year by 1998 from 1.1m ounces currently. There is no immediate prospect of the Barplats or Messina operations being reopened. Mr McMahon said future performance would depend largely on movements in the rhodium price. He said 'it would be realistic to expect next year to be similar to or only slightly better than the year under review'.</p>

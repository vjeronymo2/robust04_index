			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Chemical markets 'dead' Germany's chemicals industry is facing its worst year since the last recession in 1982, according to Mr Wolfgang Hilger, president of the Verband der Chemischen Industrie manufacturers' association, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt. Falling prices, rising costs and flat output are expected to reduce profits further in 1993, added Mr Manfred Schneider, chairman of Bayer. He expected a further slight drop in prices, while other factors would remain unchanged. Although industry sales fell only 1.6 per cent to DM171bn (Pounds 70bn) last year, profits dropped 30 per cent following falls of 25 per cent in 1991 and 20 per cent in 1990. Mr Hilger, who is also chairman of Hoechst, said markets were 'dead' and the decline could cost 20,000 jobs in the west this year.</p>

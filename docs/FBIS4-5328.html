			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station Correspondent's Interview With Khieu Samphan, </F> Chairman of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea; dated 9 April --  recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] The masses in Phnom Penh are  waiting for Your Excellency; journalists in Phnom Penh have also  reported that you will greet the king on his return after a long  period of medical treatment. However, it has been reported that  you cannot make this trip. Is this true? And what are your  reasons for it?    [Khieu Samphan] Thank you comrade representative of the  Voice of the Great National Union Front of Cambodia radio. I,  like all cadres and members of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea  [PDK], am very happy at the news that the king has been  successfully treated, that he has recovered, and that he will  return to Phnom Penh on 8 April.    I sent his majesty a message saying that I and a PDK  delegation will join our nation and people in greeting him and  the queen at Pochentong airport on his return. His majesty the  king replied to me and allowed me and the PDK delegation to see  him and the queen on 13 April 1994. However, on 5 April 1994,  there was a message from the king to the head of his secretariat  in Phnom Penh informing me that the two-headed government has  refused to provide security and an escort to protect me. The  king is clearly aware that in such a situation it will not be  safe for me to see him in Phnom Penh on 13 April 1994.  Therefore, he is pleased to let me see him and the queen in  Beijing in June instead.    This royal message clearly shows the heart of the king  concerning my safety. In his role as the father of the nation  and of national reconciliation, he has always considered the PDK  as a nationalist force which has joined our nation and people to  struggle to defend and safeguard the nation and the Cambodian  race under the king's national reconciliation banner so that  Cambodia is independent, peaceful, and neutral with its  territorial integrity.    I would like to take this opportunity to express once again  my deepest gratitude to his majesty the king for his lofty  initiative above. In sum, the king is pleased to let me see him  on 13 April 1994. However, there has been opposition to the  king's reception of me and on my call on him. This is the story  and the reason for my failure to call on the king and the queen  in Phnom Penh.    This is trampling on the constitution and preventing the  king  from having any right or role. Any word or the slightest  activity by the king along the line of national reconciliation  has been opposed. By who?    In form, it seems as though the two-headed government is  opposed to my meeting with the king. However, the truth is that  the communist Vietnamese aggressors and their allies, namely the  United States, France, and Australia, are against this. They  are opposing the efforts of the king and of all nationalist  forces on national reconciliation. They are only thinking about  fueling the war of the communist Vietnamese.    [Correspondent] So, it is no longer possible for you to go  to Phnom Penh. This will be an obstacle to national  reconciliation and to a solution for peace. What do you think  should be done?    [Khieu Samphan] To answer this question we should examine  the reasons why the communist Vietnamese, their allies, the  communist Vietnamese puppets, and the two-headed government are  against my meeting the king on 13 April.    This is because they are afraid of the national force and  our  people, in particular they are afraid of the force of the masses  in Phnom Penh which has been growing in strength. Our nation  and people oppose them and demand national reconciliation and an  end to the communist Vietnamese aggressors' war. Our nation and  people clearly see that the communist Vietnamese, their allies,  and their lackeys are the ones fueling the war. Our nation and  people clearly realize that their tragedy and suffering are due  to the communist Vietnamese aggressors and their allies, the  communist Vietnamese puppets, and the two-headed government who  think only of the war, of continuing the fighting, and of  levying taxes from the people and using this money to serve the  war. What little money that has been begged from foreigners has  also been thrown into the war.    The communist Vietnamese have annexed Cambodian territory in  the east at will and have brought nearly four million Vietnamese  nationals into Cambodia at will. The two-headed government is  indifferent to this. The economy has hit the bottom. Social  problems are getting serious and are deteriorating and these  people remain completely indifferent. They are implementing the  strategy of the communist Vietnamese and their allies in using a  military war to kill the people and the Democratic Kampuchean  force. They think that if they can destroy Democratic  Kampuchea, they will kill the king politically and other  nationalist forces and that they will run Cambodia through their  fascist and barbarous policy. As for the communist Vietnamese,  they will annex Cambodia at will. They are thinking along this  line and are implementing this policy.    (Khieu Samphan continues] However, our entire nation and  people, in the rural areas, in Phnom Penh, and abroad, are well  aware of all this. They have cooperated and carried out  activities everywhere through various forms to oppose all these  warmongers.    Look at how these people are being entangled with their  policy to fuel the war! What have they solved through the  military war so far? What is the situation on the Anlung Veng  battlefield? The Pailin battlefield situation will be moving  toward that of Anlung Veng; it is just a question of time. It  is the same situation on other battlefields.    Therefore, using a military war to destroy the national  force  and that of Democratic Kampuchea will not work. Thousands of  social problems will get more serious. All this is a large  chunk of rock hanging down from the two-headed government's  neck. This rock is getting heavier and heavier. The government  cannot get out of this. If it continues to fuel the war, it  will certainly die. Why?    This is because of the strength of the great national union  force. Our entire nation and people are uniting around the  king's national reconciliation policy. This is a mighty force.  The communist Vietnamese, their Western allies, their puppets  and lackeys, and the two-headed government certainly cannot win  against this mighty force. This has been successively borne by  history. This is the current situation.    In sum, although they -- the communist Vietnamese, the  Western allies, their puppets and lackeys, and the two-headed  government -- strive to oppose the king, national  reconciliation, peace, and to continue to fuel the war, they  certainly cannot win against the force of the nation and the  people who, in cooperation with the king, need to end the war  and need peace and national reconciliation. The national  reconciliation trend is very powerful; nothing can stop this.</p>

The number of smuggling incidents  discovered rose by 4,000 to 131,000, as Joachim Gruenewald  (Christian Democratic Union), parliamentary state secretary in  the FRG Finance Ministry, announced in Bonn on Monday. The  value of the smuggled goods was 76 million German marks [DM],  which is DM16 million less than the year before. Taxes levied  on smuggled goods, however, rose from DM23 to DM32 million.

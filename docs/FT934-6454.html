			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / World Trade News: French PM frustrated in farm talks -  'We got nothing we wanted in Washington' - Balladur French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday told a meeting of more than 400 of his conservative government's backbench MPs that 'we have obtained nothing. . . of what we have asked' from this week's Washington talks on Gatt. He spoke after his trade minister, Mr Gerard Longuet, was briefed on the outcome of the Washington talks by Sir Leon Brittan, Europe's Gatt negotiator, who on his return from the US yesterday stopped over at Paris airport. Taking a robust line in front of his parliamentary majority, Mr Balladur said he would not respond to American calls that he should show 'leadership' in the Gatt talks if that meant abandoning French national interests. The prime minister's pessimism was echoed yesterday by the French Foreign Ministry which said, that 'at this stage, there is no sign of progress' on the main Gatt issues dividing the US and the European Union. Equally, however, there was no suggestion from Paris that accommodation with the US on Gatt was doomed. Mr Longuet noted that Sir Leon had left some of his officials behind in Washington to continue talks, and that France's concern was to stay in permanent contact with the negotiators. In the end-game under way in the Uruguay Round, France is increasingly frustrated at not being able to play a direct part on such issues as agriculture and audiovisual broadcasting, where it has taken a particularly tough line. Officials say they are confident Sir Leon will advise them and other EU governments on the state of play, but complained that Mr Longuet did not get this from the European commissioner yesterday. In view of the December 15 deadline which France now implicitly accepts, Mr Balladur said yesterday he would want to know 'the state of things in the first days of December' so he could consult his ministers, his coalition and European partners. Gatt will top the agenda at next week's Franco-German summit in Bonn, which will precede a EU foreign ministers' meeting.</p>

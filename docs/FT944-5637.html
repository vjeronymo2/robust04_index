			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Advisers to be appointed for National Grid float The government is about to appoint financial advisers on the forthcoming flotation of the National Grid Company, Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said yesterday. National Grid is owned by the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales, but the government holds a golden share and wants to ensure that electricity customers as well as shareholders benefit from the Pounds 4bn sell-off. The decision to appoint advisers underlines the political sensitivity of the flotation, even though it involves companies privatised five years ago. Earlier this week, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, and Mr Eggar held discussions with the regional companies about their plans, providing a further indication of the close interest that the government will be taking in the flotation. Mr Eggar said his department had not yet formed a view about the proposals. 'There are clearly issues about the split between shareholder and customer and taxman. But we are at a very preliminary stage.' He expected advisers to be appointed 'very quickly'. Under plans being circulated for discussion, the regional companies would inject Pounds 750m to Pounds 1bn of debt into National Grid to enable it to pay them a large dividend. The companies would use this money to pay capital gains tax of about Pounds 1bn on the sale of their National Grid shares, and make a payout of about Pounds 10 to all domestic electricity consumers. Yesterday Seeboard, the regional company serving the south-east, said it would demerge its holding in National Grid by transferring its shares to its own shareholders. It would also pass some of the benefits of the flotation to its customers, though it declined to say how much. This was the first time a regional company had formally indicated its preferred method for handling the flotation. Each company will choose its own way. Although the majority are expected to use the Seeboard route, some may keep the value from the flotation within the company rather than give it to shareholders. Sir Keith Stuart, the chairman of Seeboard, said that by the time his company had paid capital gains tax on National Grid shares and paid its customers, it expected to be 'modestly' out of pocket. However, he believed this was the best way of maximising value for his shareholders. Lex, Page 16 Seeboard results, Page 20</p>

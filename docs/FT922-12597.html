			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / High street sales decline in March HIGH STREET sales declined in March reversing seven successive months of year-on-year growth, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. The CBI monthly distributive trades survey showed that retail sales volumes in March were not only lower than a year ago but were also down on the previous month. The drop in sales since February was unexpected and contradicted recent tentative signs of economic recovery. However, Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said that retailers expected sales to improve now that the election was over. Several factors distorted the year-on-year comparison for March, the CBI said, notably the value added tax increase introduced after the 1991 Budget. This gave a particular boost to sales of electrical and household goods in March last year. The CBI attributed the monthly decline to election uncertainties. Before this survey, the CBI had been reporting a modest recovery in the high street. Yesterday Mr Whittaker said he expected the improvement to resume in April adding to patchy indications that the UK economy was on the brink of a recovery. Earlier this week, the Central Statistical Office released figures which showed that manufacturing output increased by 1.1 per cent in February. A survey of British purchasing managers two weeks ago indicated a revival of manufacturing activity in March compared with February. Meanwhile, Cullens, the food retailing chain, reported sales for the week ending April 12 were the highest weekly total for 18 months. Clothing and shoe retailers reported volumes in March down on a year ago as price discounting, which boosted sales in January and February, ended. Lex, Page 20</p>

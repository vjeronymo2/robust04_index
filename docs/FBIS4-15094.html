			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- "I am convinced that the  agreement on civic accord In Russia is possible and necessary  for all of us, both politicians and Russian citizens," says a  message of Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent today to the  parliament speakers, possible signatories to the agreement and  mass media bodies.    "The agreement shows that our new political system is  consolidating, we are turning more powerful and sincere and  political ambitions and interests have less power on us.    "However, the improvement, adoption and implementation of  the  agreement can be hampered: Mutual mistrust and striving for  victories at the expense of the opponent are still great. This  cannot be forgotten, if we really want to achieve accord and  civic peace in Russia," stressed the message.</p>

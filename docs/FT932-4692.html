			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Retail fillip helps BAA to 49% advance BAA, the privatised UK airports operator, reported a 49 per cent advance from Pounds 191m to Pounds 285m in pre-tax profits, helped by a recovery in passenger traffic and retail sales, combined with sharply higher productivity. Passenger volume at BAA airports rose 8 per cent to a record 77.7m (72m) for the year to March 31. After falling 3.7 per cent in the opening half, passenger revenue improved 2.5 per cent in the second. The company said the recovery in passenger spending at airports reflected an improvement in the general economic outlook as well as the positive impact of sterling's devaluation. Retail income, which rose 10.5 per cent to Pounds 321.7m, was set to overtake traditional income from airport landing charges over the next 18 months. Income from airport charges grew only 1.7 per cent to Pounds 369.3m despite the 8 per cent increase in passenger traffic. This reflected tougher Civil Aviation Authority price regulations. Overall, revenues rose 5.5 per cent to Pounds 952m. Sir John Egan, chief executive, described a 7 per cent rise in underlying pre-tax profits, before provisions and gains from asset sales, as 'very sound' in a testing climate for the aviation industry. The company was now 'cleared and ready for take-off.' He was confident BAA would show much higher annual profit growth over the medium to long term, compared with its medium term forecast of an annual average traffic rise of 4 per cent. Underlying profits rose to Pounds 297m (Pounds 279m). They included lower property provisions of Pounds 29m (Pounds 55m), reduced staff restructuring costs of Pounds 5m (Pounds 36m), a Pounds 5m charge for retirement benefits and a Pounds 24m gain from the sale of the electricity distribution network to London Electricity. Productivity increased 27 per cent. Staff numbers fell 19 per cent to 8,417. The company had a positive cash flow for the first time since it was privatised seven years ago, with a net cash inflow of Pounds 163m. Borrowings were cut by Pounds 102m, reducing gearing from 50 to 36 per cent. Earnings per share rose 37 per cent to 41.7p (30.4p). A final dividend of 9.75p lifts the total to 16p (14.5p).

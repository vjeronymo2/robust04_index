			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIST JOE AVERAGE AS A LOSER IF CAPITAL-GAINS PLAN DIES  </P> <P> Critics of President Bush's proposal to reduce capital gains taxes oppose such  a cut because they believe it will lead to larger budget deficits and a more  inequitable distribution of wealth. In fact, the proposal will lead to smaller  budget deficits and a more equitable distribution of wealth.  </P> <P> Capital gains cut opponents come to their erroneous conclusions because they  simply do not understand the vital role capital formation plays in fueling  economic growth. Nor are they familiar with the scarce availability of risk  capital in our country today. Instead, they are stuck in a zero-sum world where  it is more important to prevent affluent investors from benefiting than it is  to provide middle-class and lower-income workers and entrepreneurs the  opportunity to move up the economic ladder by creating wealth from new  ventures.  </P> <P> A cut in the capital gains tax will have the following positive effects:  </P> <P> * Federal revenues from capital gains taxes will increase in 1990 and 1991,  because individual and institutional investors will realize capital gains  earlier than they would under the higher tax rates.  </P> <P> * Starting in 1990, and continuing as long as capital gains are taxed at a  lower rate, individual and institutional investors will move significant  amounts of capital from interest-bearing investments (such as bank certificates  of deposit, leveraged buyout junk bonds and government debt instruments) to  equity investments in new ventures that offer innovative products and services.  </P> <P> * Federal revenues in 1992 and beyond will be greater, because of corporate  income taxes paid by the ventures founded with 1990 risk capital and the income  taxes paid by the employees of these ventures. In addition, capital gains  revenue will increase as the absolute volume of capital investment offsets both  the lower tax rate and the effect of the early realization by investors of some  capital gains in 1990 and 1991.  </P> <P> * Tens of thousands of middle-class entrepreneurs will obtain the risk capital  necessary to launch ventures. At present, many excellent new concepts go  unfunded, because of a severe lack of risk capital.  </P> <P> Uncollateralized debt financing is virtually impossible for these entrepreneurs  to obtain. Even with collateral, debt financing in American is twice as  expensive as it is in Japan or Europe.  </P> <P> Equity capital from the larger venture funds in America is also now virtually  impossible for small, middle-class entrepreneurs to obtain, since these funds  shy away from providing the seed financing to "two guys in a garage" start-ups.  Instead, the organized venture funds now prefer to invest in the leveraged  buyouts of existing corporations or other activities that they perceive as less  risky. Today's entrepreneurs are limited to finding capital from their own  savings, from the modest bank accounts of believing friends and relatives or  from the occasional financial angel (angels are an informal nationwide network  of successful entrepreneurs who collectively are the largest source of risk  capital for start-ups today).  </P> <P> A reduction of the capital gains tax will provide financial angels with  incentives to invest more capital in start-ups and may increase the net return  to venture funds sufficiently enough to allow them to get back in the seed  capital arena and out of the leveraged buyout business.  </P> <P> * Those new ventures that succeed will provide jobs and career opportunities  for middle-class and lower-income workers, enabling many of them to take the  next step up the economic ladder. Most new jobs in the 1980s have been created  not by the expansion of Fortune 500 companies but by the success and growth of  small companies. The lower capital gains rate will create more small companies,  and more jobs.  </P> <P> * Investors will benefit from a higher return on their investments. Though many  of their equity investments will provide no return as some companies struggle  and ultimately fail, some investments will succeed extraordinarily well. The  average return on invested capital to investors will be greater with a lower  capital gains tax. More importantly, capital will be more wisely invested in  activities that create and spread wealth, as opposed to activities that simply  preserve wealth.  </P> <P> If capital gains tax opponents are truly concerned about the standard of living  for middle-class and lower-income people, they should be willing to step out of  their anachronistic assumptions that anything beneficial to the well off must  automatically be bad for the rest of us. The 1990s should be a decade in which  all Americans can pursue enlightened economic self interest, not one where  political grandstanding polarizes our country by conjuring up outdated visions  of class struggle.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTE RESIGNS AS CHRB SECRETARY  </P> <P> After ducking verbal brickbats from horsemen, state legislators and  racing-board members, Len Foote has resigned as secretary of the California  Horse Racing Board, about a year before his scheduled retirement.  </P> <P> Foote's resignation, which takes effect at the end of March, was announced  Friday at a meeting of the racing board in Monrovia. A board member, requesting  anonymity, said that Foote decided to resign after a meeting with Henry Chavez,  who recently became board chairman.  </P> <P> Neither Foote nor Chavez could be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Rosemary Ferraro, another board member, said that the body hopes to name a  replacement for Foote in the next 60 days. Dennis Hutcheson, the assistant  secretary, will be a candidate, but board sources indicated that he would not  get the job.  </P> <P> A general shake-up in Foote's Sacramento office is expected. Among those who  are vulnerable is Bob Chilimidos, the board's chief investigator.  </P> <P> In the summer of 1987, Foote became one of the most powerful figures in  California racing when the board approved a resolution that gave him broad  authority and enabled him to sidestep the board in making many decisions.  </P> <P> At Friday's meeting, the board rescinded that authority, meaning Foote's  successor will not be able to operate in such a free-wheeling style.  </P> <P> Foote, who lives in Fair Oaks, served as the racing board's chief investigator  from 1966 until 1976, when he was appointed board secretary.  </P> <P> His office supervised California racing during an era when the state challenged  New York for national supremacy. Last year, however, the sport in California  drew the wrong kind of headlines, when Foote accused several trainers,  including nationally prominent Wayne Lukas and Laz Barrera, with running horses  that had cocaine in their systems.  </P> <P> The charges were dropped except for those against Roger Stein.  </P> <P> Stein, who has filed a $25-million lawsuit against Truesdail Laboratories, the  state testing facility which detected the cocaine, said Saturday that Foote was  added as a defendant in the suit.  </P></p>

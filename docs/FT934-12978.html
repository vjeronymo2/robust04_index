			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Interest rate ignorance - At a Glance Credit card holders are largely unaware of the interest rates they pay, according to a survey from Save &amp; Prosper, which recently launched a low-rate card. Nearly 70 per cent did not know the rate charged on their card, and only 15 per cent guessed in the correct range of 22-25 per cent. The survey found that around 37 per cent of card holders do not pay off their balance in full each month. New GM card, page IV.</p>

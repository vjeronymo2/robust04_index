			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Serb climbdown boosts Yeltsin Relief is palpable in Moscow that Russia's intervention helped persuade the Serbs to heed Nato's ultimatum, thus avoiding the risk of air strikes, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. There had been a widespread fear among Russian officials and Russia watchers that air strikes would have hurt President Boris Yeltsin by presenting his already strong ultra-nationalist opposition with a golden opportunity to undermine him on a second front, namely foreign policy. After successfully hobbling his course of bold economic reforms, by enabling Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, to squeeze radical reformers out of the government, they would have used the air strikes against Serbs, fellow Slavs, to attack the president's pro-western foreign policy. Presidential officials yesterday lost no time in milking the president's Bosnian 'triumph' for all its worth. Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's press secretary, said it showed he was 'the unchallenged leader of Russia'. 'The world was almost on the brink of a world crisis, which threatened to grow into a war drawing in the major powers . . . Without firing a single shot, without threatening anyone, without putting the lives of its soldiers at risk, without spending a single rouble, Russia has actually won an important battle for its world status.' No doubt cheered by the news, Mr Yeltsin returned to the Kremlin yesterday after a long and unexplained illness.</p>

The report, which the European Union [EU] executive is  slated  to examine Wednesday [23 March], came also on the eve of  Monday's meeting of the EU Finance Council, at which the  ministers will discuss budget reform and fines against Italy for  having surpassed its assigned milk quotas, the amount of which  could create new hurdles in Rome's attempts to right its  accounts.    The report for the European Commission stated how Italy had  made marked progress in improving its primary surplus, assets  net of deficit interest costs, and underscored how the  withdrawal of the Italian lira from the European Monetary System  (EMS) had permitted interest rates to come down sharply and thus  contributed to keeping the global debt in line with programmed  objectives.    Even though interest rates are expected to remain low, the  report continued, "the persistence of a risk premium towards  another European Union Member State makes it necessary to speed  up the process of reducing the deficit and thus avoid a trend  reversal for the factors needed to correct finance."    After stressing how the progress made so far to correct  finances but continue in 1994 and beyond, the report underscored  how last year represented a turning point for the initiation of  the long-awaited privatization program which was now producing  concrete results.    The income from the privatization operations were calculated  in the report at 5 percent of the gross domestic product but,  the report added, a significant portion will be absorbed by the  necessary operations to restructure and thus the total impact of  privatization for the reduction of the deficit will be very  small.    Other important achievements made by Italy and cited in the  report included the reduction of inflation, to 4.2 percent in  1993, and the reduction in labor costs of half a percentage  point which, together with the devaluation of the lira, allowed  Italian enterprises to become more competitive.    The report from the European Commission went on to observe  how the full application of structural reforms for public  employment, health care and local finances will allow the  Italian economy to rest on more solid foundations towards  European convergence. Suggestions and guidelines were also made  in the report for the future and included rigorously sticking to  the process to right public finance in order to thus stabilize  and then reduce the pressure of the deficit on the GDP.    Inflation, the report added, must continue to decline and  the  gap must be reduced between Italy's inflation rate and that of  the average of the European Union, now around 2.5 percent.    In the context of a healthy recovery with growth for the  economy and employment, the report concluded, aside from  progress towards convergence, there must also be not only a wage  policy which keeps inflation in check and a budget policy aimed  at righting finance, but also a monetary policy which ensures  exchange stability.</p>

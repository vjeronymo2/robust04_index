			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (6): Micro-state with a mind of its own - Andorra and Switzerland / A look at the advantages of living in the heart of the Pyrenees After 700 years of feudal rule the 180-square mile Pyrenean micro-state of Andorra decided last year that enough was enough. Slotted between France and Spain it had always been ruled by its French and Spanish co-princes. Following a referendum, the approval of a constitution and elections, Andorra is now free to decide its own destiny, with the power of veto held by the co-princes eliminated. Since the beginning of the year it has been studying the constitution and planning its future, while its population waits to see what changes are in store. That population of 58,500 includes only 13,320 Andorrans. The principality is also home to 28,000 Spaniards, 7,000 Portuguese, 5,000 French, 1,300 registered Britons, plus a mix of other nationalities. Its attraction is its lack of taxes. 'No income tax, no VAT, no capital gains tax, no wealth tax . . . ' chorus estate agents' advertisements for its properties. It has almost no direct taxation but imposes a small levy on imported goods. Its prices are low and 10m tourists pour in each year and buy from its shops. Its splendid mountain scenery and long winter sports season bring their own following. But what now? It seems almost certain that Andorra's freedom from most forms of direct taxation will not be affected, say local people. 'One of the most exciting proposals is that the principality may establish itself as an offshore financial centre and allow non-Andorran financial institutions to operate here,' says an estate agent. 'The possibility of offering multinational companies licences to base their European operations within Andorra, free from corporation and other business taxes, is said to be under consideration.' A conference held by the Collegi d'Economistes had come out strongly in favour of radical changes to the allowable capital structure of companies. The finance minister and many political leaders were calling for selective changes to the legislation which would allow foreign-owned companies a proper framework for activities in the country. 'If either or both of these proposals is implemented, the benefits to residents and investors will be considerable and we would anticipate rises in property values, both residential and commercial, throughout Andorra.' Some 80 per cent of Andorran property is sold to foreigners and, in the last two years prices, which had been rising, have stabilised. British agency G A K Williamson &amp; Associates, based in Hampshire, handles property in Andorra. It says studio flats on its books start around Pounds 37,000; two-bedroom apartments are Pounds 75,000 to Pounds 80,000 and three to four bedrooms, Pounds 100,000-plus. Rental returns could be 7 per cent to 8 per cent net on the smaller apartments. There are no restrictions on foreigners buying or letting a property in Andorra. To take full advantage of its tax benefits you would have to live there. This would mean becoming a permanent resident. Many people simply stay there as 'permanent tourists'. For skiing enthusiasts, the Massana valley offers opportunities to buy studios and apartments 10 to 15 minutes' drive from the slopes, from Pounds 40,000. Or you could pay Pounds 1m for a large chalet. Andorra has five principal ski stations, within an hour of each other and at varying heights. There are 140 pistes, testing different capabilities. Another British-based agency with Andorran property is L &amp; D Goss, in Shropshire. This offers homes built by just one developer, La Pleta - because it likes the company's style. Leslie Goss is not alone in being critical of some modern Andorran building: 'Row upon row of multi-storey rectangular blocks, in which the size and layout of each apartment is identical.' Such blocks are cheap to build but their units have a low resale value because there are so many from which to choose, he says. La Pleta has a different approach. It has been building three villages, with properties no more than three storeys high. They are of natural stone, timber and slate, in the Catalan style, hugging the landscape, or around squares, with seating or a fountain. One such village, in Ordino, is complete and sold, but resales are available. The second, El Tarter, near ski slopes, offers new property, as does the third, near Ordino, which is in its early stages. The last two will each have 150 two to five-bedroom apartments, priced from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 250,000. The official language is Catalan and Spanish and French are spoken. The principality is not a member of the EU. 'Nor likely to be, due to the Andorrans' natural loathing of bureaucracy and antipathy to taxation,' says one foreign resident. Construccio Immobiliaria 5A in La Massana, Andorra, offers home buyers a complete package. Properties are designed by its architectural company, constructed by its building company and can be furnished from its furniture shop. An administrative section takes care of rental, maintenance, car hire and other services. Viviane Girault, executive director, says its cheapest new property is a one-bedroom flat with garage space, at Pounds 63,000; its most expensive, is a large apartment at Pounds 136,500. Among resales she can offer an almost new chalet at Pounds 350,000, being sold by a British owner. Andorra has no currency of its own so a purchaser can pay in any currency. Girault says that people planning to let have three choices. With so few Andorrans, foreigners come to work in banks, shops, ski resorts and there is a big demand for long-term rentals. The short-term market is also buoyant particularly for properties in skiing areas. The third choice is aparthotels. These, furnished and run as four-star hotels are usually sited near a sports or shopping centre. Units are sold to buyers who put them back into a letting pool. Income from renting goes into the pool and expenses are taken out. Owners can use the properties for designated periods themselves, receiving an annual payment. Guy Griffiths, director of Roc Propietats, in La Massana, provides services such as valuations, organising powers of attorney, arrangement of mortgages, account opening and general liaison with an Andorran bank. His co-director Su Downham, is also British but married to an Andorran. 'Our aim is to offer the widest cross-section of properties in the principality,' he says. Roc's typical prices are: small studio/one-bedroom investment flats, from Pounds 30,000; two-bedrooms, from Pounds 60,000; three-bedrooms, from Pounds 85,000. Large apartments with gardens, up to Pounds 560,000, chalets from Pounds 199,000 to Pounds 860,000. At present the majority of properties changing hands are resales, but new developments are continually coming on stream. During the recession in Europe, Andorran property continued to sell because of the principality's appeal to a worldwide market. Griffiths says his agency receives inquiries from residents of Switzerland and Monaco, who see Andorra as an alternative to their current base at significantly lower entry fees.

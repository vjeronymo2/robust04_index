			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Lev Ryabchikov for TASS] </F>   [Text] Simferopol 18 April, TASS -- Crimean President Yuriy  Meshkov and Vice-Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov called on the  CIS leaders to support the return of the deported people of the  Republic.    In an appeal issued on the eve of the 50th anniversary of  the  deportation of Crimean Tatars, Armenians, Bulgarians, Greeks and  Germans from the Crimea, they stressed that the disintegration  of the Soviet Union and the emergence of new independent states  have complicated their return to their homeland.    Ukraine cannot finance the programme alone, the appeal said.  Meshkov and Saburov called on the CIS presidents and governments  to support the programme and help restore the rights of the  deported people.</p>

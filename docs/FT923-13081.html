			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Britain to work for abolition of coal levy THE UK government is to use its presidency of the European Community to target the levy on EC coal and steel for early abolition. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has agreed that progress on phasing out the levy before 2002, when it is due to end anyway, should be one of the objectives of the meeting of the council of EC industry ministers in November. The Department of Trade and Industry has come under pressure from both British Steel and British Coal to see the end of the tax, which amounts to about 0.3 per cent of the value of what is produced. The levy dates from the treaty of Paris in 1952, which set up the European Coal and Steel Community  -the forerunner of the European Economic Community itself. At present some Pounds 500m has accumulated in the fund, which is used to finance tasks such as re-training and job replacement. The distribution of the money is primarily a matter for the EC Commission. To some extent those tasks are matched by other schemes set up more recently: the re-training function, for example, is closely paralleled by the separate Rechar funds. Quite apart from the government's political distaste for what one minister has called an 'iniquitous production tax', ministers are conscious that they will need to be certain in the run-up to coal privatisation about the future of the levy. Even if the government is able to leave the question unresolved during parliamentary debate on the legislation itself, which is due to be brought forward in the autumn, potential purchasers of the industry will want to be clear about how long the levy will continue and whether the industry might benefit from a share of whatever remains in surplus. The UK will also be using its presidency to press ahead with work on setting up an evaluation and monitoring system for the cohesion funds to be established under the Maastricht agreement. Ministers are anxious that those countries contributing most can be sure the funds are being properly directed within the countries that will benefit. Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, said yesterday that his priority at the two research council meetings during the UK presidency would be to make progress on the future of the Framework Programmes of research. He made clear that the programmes should concentrate on identifying generic technologies which had a broad application across industry, and that the emphasis should be on quality rather than subsidy.</p>

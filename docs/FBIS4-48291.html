			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has appealed to employers to pay  workers who absented themselves during the election last month  and the presidential inauguration last Tuesday. Labor Minister  Tito Mboweni said that the historical importance of the days had  been generally accepted, and they had accordingly been declared  public holidays. He said that he trusted any misunderstanding in  this regard would be cleared up in the interests of national  peace and development. COSATU [Congress of South African Trade  Unions] said earlier that it had learned that some employers had  not paid their workers for the holidays and it called for the  matter to be rectified.</p>

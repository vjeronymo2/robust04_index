			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News 7" </F> program]    [Text] Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of the Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party], spoke at a lecture in Osaka today and  indicated that as early as after the fiscal year 1994 budget  bills have passed through the House of Representatives, ruling  and opposition parties will begin moving toward forming a new  government for the nation's basic policies, such as how to deal  with the issue of DPRK's suspected development of nuclear  weapons.    In his speech, Ozawa said: In the process of future  political  realignment, a new government must be one in which an agreement  has been made in a calm and rational manner regarding not only  personal relationships but also new policy issues so that it can  respond to a new world order.    Making references to security matters, such as how to deal  with the issue of DPRK's suspected nuclear weapons development  and problems of administrative and financial reforms, Ozawa  indicated that as early as after the fiscal year 1994 budget  bills have passed through the lower house of the Diet, ruling  and opposition parties will begin to move toward forming a new  government to decide how the nation's basic policies ought to be.</p>

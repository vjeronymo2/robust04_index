			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jonas Uzurka, chief of staff at the Vilnius </F> division of the Volunteer National Defense Service: "Farewell  to SKAT"]    [Excerpts]Lithuanian Prime Minister A. Slezevicius  has confirmed to RESPUBLIKA that a presidential decree is being  drafted which will reorganize the Volunteer National Defense  Service [SKAT]. It seems that it will be restructured as the  National Guards, and the name of SKAT will disappear. "The SKAT  has required changes for a long time. However, everything will  be planned and accomplished consistently. We will try to do our  best to prevent the sad events in the woods near Kaunas  [reference to volunteer mutiny] from recurring," said A.  Slezevicius. A detailed plan of reorganization has already been  drafted at the National Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces  Staff. Today we are publishing an article by Jonas Uzurka,  chief of staff at the SKAT Vilnius division.    Many Lithuanian citizens become concerned when they see a  man, wearing an indefinite uniform and a red beret with the  national emblem, in the street. Many foreigners are terrified  when they see a volunteer, dressed the same way, but armed and  usually drunk, at the airport. [passage omitted]    People fail to understand the extent of such disorder in the  SKAT. In my opinion, the principal reason for this is that the  SKAT was created and managed by people who ignore military  discipline. The most important issue for them was to get cushy  positions for themselves and their acquaintances. Therefore,  they invited "like- minded" persons to assume positions, the  number of which was exaggerated immoderately, awarded ranks and  orders to themselves, and engaged in commercial activities  shamelessly. Where have you seen an officer working as a  marketer!? Is it possible to train a volunteer to defend the  homeland if the facilities of the SKAT division in Vilnius are  leased to 17 commercial firms alone? We need not be surprised  that volunteers guard commercial stalls rather than warehouses  with ammunition.    Currently, the SKAT has about 1,000 full-time employees,  while there were only some 500 of them in the National Defense  Ministry between the wars. This may be why SKAT employees react  so noisily to any criticism and accuse critics of destructive  communist activities for their word of truth immediately.    "Honor" trials for honest volunteers are becoming more  frequent. [passage omitted]    Therefore, the reorganization of the SKAT is essential.  According to the plan, the number of its full-time jobs will be  reduced to 500. One should understand at last that not a single  military formation can be beyond the law, and that commerce is  not an officer's job. It is only when the armed forces are  isolated from politics, and when soldiers obey the statutes and  laws alone, that the Lithuanian people will believe that they  see a defender of the homeland rather than an armed criminal.  Let those who are unable or unwilling to submit to the military  discipline engage in trade, but not in military activities.  This will be more beneficial to the community.    Despite the current commotion over the SKAT, I hope that we  will have real, disciplined, and honorable defense structures  shortly.</p>

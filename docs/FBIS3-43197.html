			<p>Recent     Russian-language press articlesreporting the present state  of AIDS prevent ion and control in former Soviet republics are  gisted.      The independent multinational physicians' newspaper MEDITSINSKAYA  GAZETA has devoted an entire issue to World AIDS Control Day (1  December 93). KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA (1 December 93) ran six articles  on AIDS on its second page the same day.  KOMMERSANT-DAILY, LESNAYA  GAZETA and other newspapers have also recently published articles on  AIDS developments.  Key information from these articles is  summarized below by republic.      RUSSIAN FEDERATION      Draft Legislation to be Reviewed      New draft legislation on AIDS, which was previously considered by  the Russian Supreme Soviet, has been included in a package of  priority items for the Duma.  In a second-page article, Professor V.  V. Pokrovskiy speculates that adoption of the bill may result in  abandonment of mass compulsory AIDS testing in favor of voluntary  testing and public education on safe sex practices.      Pokrovskiy feels that the territorial centers' role in AIDS  control is growing as a result of the increasing economic and  political role of the krays, oblasts, and republics which fund them.  By contrast, the only part of the extensive 1993 federal AIDS  program that was actually funded was the federal purchase of test  systems for territories.  Pokrovskiy thinks that the federal  government may not fund the program at all in 1994-95.      Other problems affecting the Russian AIDS control program,  according to Pokrovskiy, are the failure of the AIDS centers to  focus on prevention of sexual transmission of AIDS and the failure  to allocate manpower and organize AIDS control institutions where  the incidence is greatest (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93).      HIV Incidence      The number of Russian HIV carriers began to increase rapidly in  1993.  Eighty new HIV carriers were identified, and 32 HIV-positive  patients developed AIDS.  Of the 692 HIV carriers detected in  Russia, 124 are AIDS patients, 96 have died, and 435 are foreigners  and have been deported  (Moscow IZVESTIYA 3 Dec 93).  The average  age of the AIDS patients was 28, and the ratio of men to women was 8  to 1.  Two of the HIV-infected were donors (Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY  17 Nov 93).      According to Vadim Pokrovskiy, director of the Russian Center for  AIDS Prevention and Control, the pattern of HIV transmission in  Russia has changed.  Starting in 1990 HIV has spread predominantly  among Russian homosexuals and to some extent among intravenous drug  users.  Initially, the virus was spread primarily by foreigners or  through medical negligence.  Pokrovskiy predicts a sharp rise in  incidence among drug users within the next two years (Moscow  KOMMERSANT-DAILY 17 Nov 93).      A front-page column in MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA lists the incidence  of HIV carriers by city and oblast. Moscow leads with 125, 70  percent of whom are male homosexuals.  Following it are three  localities where the infected are primarily victims of medical  negligence in 1988-89: Rostov Oblast with 109 carriers, Kalmykia  with 98 and Volgograd Oblast with 72.  HIV was sexually transmitted  to most of the 59 St. Petersburg and 33 Moscow Oblast patients.  Twenty territories have no identified AIDS carriers and the rest  have a few each (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93).      Testing      Twenty-five million people were tested for AIDS in Russia during  1992, 21 million in 1993 (Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY 17 Nov 93,  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA 1 Dec 93).  For initial screening, laboratories  use domestically produced test systems, which are less reliable than  foreign systems.  Specimens that test positive are sent to the  Russian Scientific Methodological Center for AIDS Control, where  foreign test systems and computer analysis are used to confirm the  diagnosis.  Positive results at this stage are retested and then  confirmed by immune blotting (Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 8 Jun 93).      Russian Azidothymidine      Domestically produced azidothymidine has been tested and  evaluated as equal in quality to the English version of the drug  (Moscow KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA 1 DEC 93).      AIDS Database      The Volgograd AIDS Prevention and Control Center, in  collaboration with the Volgograd Medical Institute, has created a  screening program for analyzing test results.  The system, which  includes a database on patients screened for AIDS starting in 1990,  makes it possible to determine the extent to which a risk group has  been screened. A supplementary program analyzes the effect of  therapies on individual patients.  The programs have been placed  under the control of the municipal public health committee (Moscow  MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93).      AIDS Education      The periodical OGONEK, television company VID, and the OGONEK-  ViD-AntiSPID [Anti-AIDS] charitable fund are jointly sponsoring the  first international competition for films on AIDS.  During the year-  long contest, documentary, educational and dramatic films on AIDS  will be broadcast weekly on the Ostankino channel (Moscow LESNAYA  GAZETA 4 Dec 93).  On 1 December in Moscow, the charitable All-  Russian AIDS Control Association and Russian Ministry of Health  jointly produced a benefit program including meetings with  physicians and distribution of literature (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA  GAZETA 1 Dec 93).      KAZAKHSTAN      Galiya Sheriyazdanova, director of the Kazakhstan Aids Prevention  and Control Dispensary in Almaty, believes that AIDS screening of  Kazakhstan residents may be unreliable.  As the result of  environmentally caused depression of their immune systems, they  produce few antibodies when exposed to the human immunodeficiency  virus, causing false negative test results (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA  GAZETA 1 Dec 93).      Press figures on HIV incidence in Kazakhstan are inconsistent.  MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA (1 Dec 93) reported that only one HIV carrier  had been detected, but the Almaty newspaper KARAVAN reported a total  of 9 registered HIV cases and one AIDS death (Moscow SELSKAYA ZHIZN  21 Jul 93).      Few Kazakhstan residents seek AIDS testing.  Only 411 patients  requested screening in 10 months of 1993, despite a public education  effort that establishes a monthly quota of lectures, seminars and  published writings for AIDS center physicians (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA  GAZETA 1 Dec 93).      UZBEKISTAN      Based on the results of an international symposium held in  Tashkent, the World Health Organization is developing a program of  assistance to Uzbekistan. WHO's representative at the symposium  believes that Uzbekistan is capable of containing the spread of HIV  (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93).      Uzbekistan maintains a network of AIDS control institutions  despite a low HIV infection rate.  Testing of 11 million individuals  detected 31 HIV carriers, including 24 foreigners, who were  deported, and 7 citizens. There has been one AIDS death.  The AIDS  service consists of centers in Karakalpakistan, Tashkent, and all 12  oblasts; 90 diagnostic laboratories; and over 100 offices for  anonymous treatment.  Funding is received from a state interbranch  program, although at least one oblast center has a commercial  sponsor that funds building repair and medical supplies (Moscow  MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93).      According to Olim Yakubov, head of the republic's AIDS prevention  and control center, the priorities of the Uzbekistan AIDS program  are equipping AIDS centers and educating physicans and medical  workers.  Mass AIDS testing has been abandoned in favor of screening  high-risk groups such as patients with venereal diseases,  homosexuals, and drug addicts.  In addition, all pregnant women and  donors are tested.  A key need is AIDS diagnostic systems and  medical equipment, which are available in Uzbekistan on a barter  basis only.  Banking system problems and the introduction of a  national currency have reduced the delivery of AIDS test systems to  Uzbek AIDS Centers by 40 percent.  Needed supplies and equipment are  not being sent from Russia or Ukraine because the payments are not  being transmitted (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93.)      UKRAINE      AIDS is on the rise in Ukraine.  From March to December 1993, 29  new AIDS cases were detected, more than during the entire previous  year.  HIV incidence has increased from 4.4 per million in 1992 to  5.4 per million.  One hundred forty one people are infected, and 8  adults and 4 children have died.  The largest numbers of HIV  carriers are found in Odessa Oblast, Kiev, Donetsk, and  Dnepropetrovsk Oblasts and in the Crimean Republic.  The virus was  sexually transmitted -- heterosexually in 76 cases and homosexually  in 16 (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93). These statistics may  not include infected foreigners, since Ukrainian AIDS Committee  chairman Matsuk reported a total of 303 HIV carriers detected as of  1 January 1993, including 112 Ukrainians and 191 foreigners (Kiev  DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA 5 Jun 93).  Ternopol epidemiologist Tamara  Burtnyak considers weakening of immune systems by the Chernobyl  nuclear accident to have increased Ukrainians' susceptibility to  AIDS (Ternopol VILNE ZHYTTYA 26 Oct 93).  Ukraine is pursuing a mass  screening program, with 1.9 million examined every quarter (Moscow  MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93).      Ukraine's AIDS detection abilities have been enhanced by new  developments. The Ukraine AIDS Committee has created a national  reference laboratory for HIV infection and has developed a reference  panel of positive sera to be used in evaluating the quality of  imported test systems.  The US firm Abbott is selling third-  generation test systems and modern equipment to the Kiev Scientific  Research Institute for Hematology and Blood Transfusion.  Only two  Ukrainian firms manufacture test systems, using raw materials  imported from other former Soviet republics.  Most medicines for HIV  carriers and AIDS patients are obtained from abroad (Moscow  MEDITSINSKAY GAZETA 1 Dec 93).      A KHRESHCHATYK article blames an outbreak of "'exotic' contagious  diseases,'' including AIDS, on "the uncontrolled stay of foreigners  in Kiev."  Sixty-five of the 92 new AIDS cases in Kiev were aliens  (Kiev KHRESHCHATYK 15 Dec 93).      Convicts incarcerated at the Interoblast Hospital of the  Administration of Internal Affairs in Donetsk Oblast wrote an open  letter to KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA (1 Dec 93), complaining of unsanitary  conditions and poor treatment.  They allege that they have not  received necessary medications and have been refused treatment by  the Ukrainian AIDS Center in Kiev.      BALTICS AND BELARUS      Latvia reported 14 AIDS patients and 16 HIV-positive individuals  (Riga Radio Riga Network 1 Dec 93).  Belarus has recorded 98 cases  of HIV infection, 69 of them in Minsk. One-fourth of the Belarusian  HIV carriers have developed AIDS and 6 have died.  There are an  estimated 900-1200 HIV carriers in Minsk.  Sexual transmission of  the virus predominates (Minsk VECHERNIY MINSK 30 Nov 93).  Lithuania  has detected 19 HIV carriers ranging in age from 19 to 40 and  including 14 homosexual males and 1 woman.  During the past year,  Abbott test systems have been used in Lithuania to screen donor  blood for HIV (Vilnius TIESA 3 Dec 93).      GEORGIA      According to Tengiz Tsertsvadze, senior doctor at Republican AIDS  and Immunodeficiency Center, Georgia has recorded 16 HIV carriers,  11 of them citizens of the republic.  Drug addiction and the  shortage of disposable syringes, medical equipment, and sterilizers  are key factors promoting the spread of AIDS.  Tsertsvadze predicts  20,000 cases by the year 2000 and several hundred thousand cases by  2010, unless radical action is taken.  AIDS screening, which is  voluntary, is down to one-quarter of the 1990 level because of the  lack of money to purchase test kits. Consequently, AIDS statistics  are probably understated, in Tsertsvadze's opinion (Tblisi NOVAYA  GAZETA Nov 93).      (AUTHOR:  DOBBINS.

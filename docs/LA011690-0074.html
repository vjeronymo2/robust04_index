			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE FULLERTON HITS A LOW FOR THE ROAD  </P> <P> The road has been brutal to Cal State Fullerton this season. Pauley Pavilion  and the Thomas and Mack Center have taken their measure of the Titans, and they  have found them wanting.  </P> <P> Fullerton has lost on the road to UCLA and Nevada Las Vegas. The Titans can  accept that.  </P> <P> They have been beaten by Colorado State in a gym named after a whale, Moby  Arena. They have lost to Wyoming in the isolated town of Casper, and to Utah  State in snowy Logan, Utah.  </P> <P> They can accept all those. But they never thought they would see the day that  they would lose in a place still looking for someone to be named after, a new  arena called the Student Union Recreation and Events Center. A crowd of 2,126  there rattled the Titans into a 66-60 loss to San Jose State on Monday.  </P> <P> Yes, the same San Jose State that started a program almost from scratch this  season after the player walkout against Coach Bill Berry last season. Yes, the  team that had lost 21 games in a row before beating Texas Christian in the  fourth game this season.  </P> <P> Yes, the Titans said, this one was humiliating.  </P> <P> "This is the biggest," said Wayne Williams, Fullerton's point guard. "I never  expected to lose to San Jose State."  </P> <P> At the beginning of this season, with four starters back from a 16-13 team, the  Titans had other expectations.  </P> <P> "In the beginning, I had hopes of going to the NCAAs," Williams said. "But the  way things are going now, I don't know."  </P> <P> Fullerton, 8-6 overall and 2-3 in the Big West Conference, is 2-6 on the road.  </P> <P> San Jose State, with a record of 5-9 and 2-3 in conference play, already has  matched its victory total of last season, when it finished 5-23.  </P> <P> In the company of victories over Texas Christian, Santa Clara, Idaho State and  UC Irvine, this may rank as the biggest victory since the walkout.  </P> <P> But who is quibbling?  </P> <P> "Every win for the Spartans is a big win," Coach Stan Morrison said.  </P> <P> Cedric Ceballos led Fullerton with 24 points.  </P></p>

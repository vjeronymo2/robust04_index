			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: A gap in understanding Sir, Why does Samuel Brittan continue to waste his time on the fool's errand of attempting to measure the output gap ('The enigma of the output gap', February 16)? The very fact that estimates of the gap vary between 1.5 per cent and 7 per cent should be sufficient to discredit the concept. First, the wide divergence of these estimates draws attention to the fact that we simply do not have the information - on capital scrapping, production functions or the degree of mismatch between capacity and demand - to make reliable estimates of the gap. Second, if we do not know the size of the output gap, then we cannot test the hypothesis that it is a central determinant of inflation. In giving publicity to these wild goose chases, Mr Brittan is reinforcing the public impression that economists have nothing to contribute to an understanding of the world. Could his considerable talents in future be used to address questions where an answer is at least possible?

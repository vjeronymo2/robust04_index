			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Foreign groups intensify battle in PC market COMPETITION IN Britain's personal computer market, already the fiercest in Europe, has intensified sharply with the arrival of two large companies from the US and continental Europe. Plans to take a share of the UK's Pounds 3bn personal computer market were announced yesterday by Gateway 2000, a large US manufacturer. Vobis Microcomputer of Germany announced plans to enter the UK market last month. Gateway will market its full range of computers direct to users while Vobis is selling its 'Highscreen' brand through Dixons, the electrical retailer. Direct-selling manufacturers use neither retailers nor distributors but advertise their products in newspapers and trade magazines, completing the deal by telephone or mail order. The technique was pioneered by Dell Computer Corporation of the US which has grown in a decade to revenues last year of Dollars 2bn. More than 30 per cent of PCs are now sold in the UK this way. Gateway says it sells more IBM-compatible PCs this way in the US than any other manufacturer. It has set up an assembly and distribution centre in Dublin from which it intends to attack the UK market before moving into France and Germany. It was established in 1985 and employs 2,500 people in the US. It made pretax profits of Dollars 105m last year on a turnover of Dollars 1.1bn. Vobis, one of the largest PC manufacturers in Germany, is following its compatriot Escom AG, which this year started a chain of small retail stores in the UK. About 15 have already opened and Escom is aiming to have 26 by the end of next month. The PC market in the UK has grown vigorously over the past 12 months - driven by substantial advertising campaigns and falling prices. According to Context, a London-based consultancy, sales this year are likely to be 22 per cent up on last year. Some 93,000 units were shipped in July alone, 37 per cent more than the year before. The value of the computers shipped increased by only 17 per cent, however, an indication of the sharp decline in unit prices. Context says the average price of a system is now Pounds 1,400; most experts believe prices will not fall much lower but customers will get more features for the same price. Most machines are based around the leading Intel 486/SX microprocessor. According to the marketing consultancy Romtec, Compaq of the US has the lion's share of the UK market with 13 per cent. IBM is only 1 percentage point behind. Apple has 7 per cent and Dell has 6 per cent. Toshiba, Elonex and Olivetti hold 4 per cent apiece while none of the other 200 or so manufacturers have more than 3 per cent of the market. Mr Ted Waitt, the chief executive of Gateway, said the UK launch had been planned for three years. He said Gateway hoped to sell by innovative advertising, low prices and first-rate customer service. A top-of-the-range system would sell for less than Pounds 2,500. Mr Michael Spiro, finance director for the UK company Elonex, which will compete with Gateway in the direct market, said the US company's declared prices did not seem all that exciting: 'What can they do? They have to use the same components from the same sources as everybody else.'</p>

			<p>Decomposition   Equipment That Uses Plasma   <F P=102> 94FE0326I Tokyo DENKI SHIMBUN in Japanese 11 Nov 93 p 2 --  FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0326I </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo DENKI SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] A group consisting of the National Institute for  Resources and Environment, the Agency of Industrial Science and  Technology, MITI, and six private corporations -- including  Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd., and Nippon Steel Corp. -- has  developed a technology for decomposing freon, which is known to  destroy the ozone layer, and believes that the technology could  soon be implemented. The group verified that an initially  established target of decomposing 50 kg freon in one hour was  achieved. The technology was also confirmed to be effective in  the decomposition of halon. Based on the judgement that ``the  technology can be commercialized,'' the group plans to  commercialize the decomposition device.    In July 1990, the group began a research project concerning  the use of plasma capable of breaking atoms into nuclei and  electrons, for the purpose of decomposing freon into harmless  materials. As a result, the group developed a 100-kW  decomposition device that was tested for verification through  March 1993.    A mixed gas of freon and steam is fed to the plasma device,  and decomposition takes place in a plasma state at approximately  10,000C. A neutralizer (sodium hydroxide) and a fixer  (calcium hydroxide) are added to the acidic gas formed by the  decomposition to produce salt and fluorite.    In the verification tests, the group decomposed freon 113  (which is used to clean semiconductors), freons 12 and 11 (which  are used as refrigerator coolant), and halon 1301 (which is the  active ingredient in fire extinguishers).    As a result, the different types of freon were successfully  decomposed at the initially established target rate of 50 kg per  hour. This rate is equivalent to the decomposition of enough  freon for approximately 280 units of household refrigerators.  The decomposition of freon was reliable at an efficiency of  99.999 percent, and the decomposition products were proven to be  harmless. Also, halon was decomposed at a rate of 53 kg per hour.    The group also confirmed that the total cost of decomposing  1  kg of freon was less than &yen;300, which included approximately  &yen;100 for operation, including the cost of electricity, and  additional costs for facilities and labor.    Based on the verification test results, the group plans to  study the feasibility of the commercialization of the  decomposition device in FY93 and, in the spring of 1994, begin  to contact government and private organizations involved in  freon recovery.    In February 1990, at the Montreal Protocol Second Treaty  Nations Conference, it was decided that the so-called  ozone-layer- destroying substances -- such as special freon,  special halon, and trichloroethane -- would be totally banned in  the period from year 2000 to year 2005. Subsequently, an  increasing number of nations began to enforce the ban earlier  than year 2000. Japan has also decided to enforce the ban by the  end of 1995.    The freon decomposition technology, along with the  development of freon substitutes, appears to have a bright  future. In Japan, various combustion and catalytic methods are  currently being studied, although studies are still at the basic  research stage.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Scots may elect for a German influence: A growing Labour interest in the proportional-representation option PROPORTIONAL representation based on the German model is emerging as favourite to be chosen by Labour as the basis for electing candidates to its proposed Scottish parliament. Such a move would not be binding on the party nationally, but would have a strong influence on its debate on electoral reform. It would also set a precedent for abandoning the UK's first-past-the-post electoral system. Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's constitutional spokesman, said a consensus was developing among Scottish members in favour of an 'additional member' system to elect assembly members. Under this format, voters cast two votes - one for an individual constituency candidate, as at present, and another for a party. Labour is committed to establishing a directly elected Scottish assembly with significant legislative and tax-raising powers 'at the earliest possible moment'. The preferred approach would be similar to the system that has been used in Germany since 1948, although Mr Darling stresses that the intention is not to import it 'in pure form'. Labour would want to adapt it in order to meet Scotland's circumstances, he said. In Germany, half the parliamentary seats are filled with the first-past-the-post winners, while the other half are allocated from party lists, reflecting voters' party preferences. Mr Darling said that Labour would not necessarily stick to this 50:50 ratio. The party is veering towards the additional-member approach - and away from the alternative-vote model which has also been considered - as it would maintain a constituency link, Mr Darling said. Mr Darling said Labour has 'no plans' to address what it regards as the separate issue of Scottish representation at Westminster if the proposed assembly is created. As Scotland is already among the parts of the UK which are numerically over-represented in the Commons, this appears to leave its plans vulnerable to attack on the grounds that they would pamper an area accounting for an important slice of the party's Westminster representation. Labour has promised that it would grant the assembly power to adjust expenditure levels by varying Scottish income-tax rates. The body's other responsibilities would include the electricity industry, the Scottish Development Agency, industrial training and the operation of regional development policies. The party's commission on electoral systems is due to present its recommendations to the national executive committee at the end of this month. LABOUR'S CHANCES of election victory will be damaged by a fall in electoral registration in marginal seats, according to a survey of last year's registers by the independent Electoral Reform Society. 'The short-term effect will be to steepen the electoral mountain facing Labour at the next general election,' it said. The sharpest declines were in London, with falls of more than 4,500 since 1987 in each of five constituencies. Many people are believed not to have registered in order to avoid the community charge. The biggest fall, at nearly 10,000, was in Putney where Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, holds the seat with a majority of 6,436. Sharp drops were also recorded in four other Tory-held London seats: Hornsey and Wood Green (majority 1,779), Kensington (4,447), Hampstead and Highgate (2,221) and Streatham (2,407). The society predicted that this year's electoral register - to be released on February 15 - would reveal a further fall. Electoral Statistics, HMSO, Pounds 6.20.</p>

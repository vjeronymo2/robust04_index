			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The negotiating teams of the Slovene Christian  Democrats [SKD] and the Liberal Democracy [LDS] met this  morning. They held an hour of consultations in view of the  recent SKD proposal to form a government coalition of two  parties, that is, without the United List, while the Social  Democrats have already announced their departure from the  government.    As it was expected, today's meeting did not produce any  concrete decisions about the fate of the future government  coalition. After the meeting of the negotiating teams of both  parties, we can also expect a meeting of the members of the LDS  executive council and the SDK council. The SKD will make the  final decision about this next week and definitely before the  annual party conference that will take place between 22 and 24  April.    A segment of the party's membership demands departure from  the coalition. However, a sober examination shows the great  political damage that the party would suffer if it left the  coalition at a moment when tangible results in new spheres that  will also bring electoral points are in sight.    One, therefore, should not expect any more explicit  decisions  from the afternoon meeting of the SKD council. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Asia, Unite!] </F>   [Text] The trade dispute between Malaysia and Britain has  once again underlined the need for a united Asian front to take  on the trade warriors of the West. The decision by Kuala Lumpur  to ban British firms from government contracts worth billions of  dollars has set a trend for the rest of the Third World  countries to follow. Though these underdeveloped countries have  not modern technology for which they depend on the West, they  have huge markets which can be used as leverage against the  coercive policies of the West. In the past Europeans had used  trade as a launching pad for the furtherance of their  imperialistic ventures. But the West should understand that  this is not the 17th century. The East is now quite capable of  protecting its hard earned freedom. The Malaysia-UK row started  when the British Press alleged that top government officials in  Kuala Lumpur including Prime Minister Mahatir Mohamad had  received kickbacks form British firms and the revolation of  connections between arms and aid donations. The British  Government argues that it has been using aid donations to boost  weapons sale in order to salvage British ailing arms industry.    The Malaysian decison to stop dealing with British should  serve as a beacon for the rest of the Asian countries. This  should be specially so in case of major nations such as China,  India, Indonesia and Pakistan who may not have as sound a  technological base at present but are rapidly catching up with  the West. China can provide the leadership that is vitally  needed in a world where regional trade groups such as European  Community are increasingly becoming cartels to protect the  interest of its members. It may not be out of place to refer to  the EC trade representative's statement warning that his  organisation will not allow any country to isolate one of its  members for discriminatory trade ban on political grounds. He  was commenting on China's threat to impose sanctions on Britain  because of the latter's policy on Hong Kong.    With the West now realising that its economy and military  power is steadily but surely declining, it is desperately  searching for new markets. Europe is already united under the  banner of European Economic Community and Africa has not enough  purchasing power. Thus Asia remains the only continent whose  huge markets can save the sinking economy of the West specially  the United States which according to one of its former secretary  of state Henry Kissinger, is to lose its status of a superpower  in a decade. It is not surprising at all that Kissinger has  suggested that the United States should assume the 19th century  role of the Britain in order to make sure that Asia does not  unite under a single power.    Kissinger's statements must serve as an eye opener for those  who still believe that the proposed new world order means  anything less than 21st century equivalent of neocolonialism.  Henry Kissinger has even gone to the extent of reminding his  countrymen that they have fought two wars to make sure that  Eurasia is not controlled by a single power centre implying that  the Americans should be ready to go to war again if needed.  Kissinger's utterance that the United States has learned to  live with a united Europe makes it abundantly clear that the  United States should be concentrating on promoting the forces of  discard in Asia. [sentence as published]    Though Henry Kissinger no more holds an office, he gives  expression to the contemporary US policies on Asia. Examined in  the context of Pakistan's proximity to the Central Asian states  via Afghanistan the civil war in Pakistan's neighbourhood does  not seem to be a coincidence. Since Afghanistan provides the  closest access to the Central Asia instability in this region  serves US interest in the best possible way. It helps  Washington to keep the countries of the region specially Iran  and Pakistan in a constant state tension and making it difficult  for the regional powers to unite in a bloc encompassing Paksitan  Afghanistasn, Iran and Central Asian states of the former Soviet  Union.    For us in Pakistan the lesson is very clear. The policy of  staying away from Afghanistan runs counter to our interest.  Islamabad will have to double its efforts to bring peace to  Afghanistan, without whose cooperation the creation of a  regional economic bloc will remain only a dream.</p>

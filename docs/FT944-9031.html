			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Climbdown on full-blown sale - Crown Agents The Crown Agents, the government agency responsible for financial, professional and procurement services in developing countries, is to be moved into the private sector. The measure, announced in the Queen's Speech, marks a climbdown from original plans for full-blown privatisation. Instead, the agency will be transferred to an independent foundation, limited by guarantee, and with no government representatives on the board. Managers of the agency, which plays an important role in implementing the Overseas Development Administration's bilateral aid programme, welcomed the move. They believe it will create greater accountability and prove to clients that it is independent of government pressure to 'buy British'. The move is not intended to raise money, although it is possible a small amount will be raised from the repayment of debts owed by the Crown Agents to the government. The agency has made payments of about Pounds 20m in capital and interest since it was established in its present form in 1979, but last year made a profit of only Pounds 244,000. The agency employs 800 staff with offices in 38 countries and an annual turnover of about Pounds 250m, making it one of the world's biggest purchasing organisations. It receives no regular subsidy and less than 30 per cent of its income is generated from the UK. Its new structure is similar to that of the Wellcome Foundation, the health insurance groups PPP and Bupa, the AA and RAC motoring organisations and the British Standards Institute. The board will include members who reflect 'the international character of the agency's work', as well as representatives of aid agencies and the commercial sector. The agency's profits will not be distributed but will be reinvested in its work, which it says has a 'social purpose'.</p>

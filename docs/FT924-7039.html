			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Basque area in first international offering THE Basque area, one of Spain's 17 autonomous regions, yesterday launched its first international bond offering, a DM200m 10-year Eurobond arranged by Goldman Sachs. Previously, the region has met its financing needs in Spain's domestic market, where it issues four and five-year debt called Euskobonds. The shift to international funding is designed to broaden the investor base and extend the maturity profile of the region's debt, said Mr Victor Mugica, vice-minister of treasury. He added the government plans to issue a greater proportion of foreign currency debt next year. This year, the Basque government has raised a total of Pta51.8bn, of which yesterday's D-Mark offering accounts for about 9 per cent. In 1993, the government plans to raise about 30 per cent of its Pta66bn borrowings in the international market. The DM200m Eurobond is rated AA2 by Moody's and AA by Standard &amp; Poor's, the same rating as for Spain's debt, although the paper is not guaranteed by Spain. The rating reflects the Basque government's consistently large operating surpluses, modest debt burden and considerable financial flexibility, according to S &amp; P. The Basque government can use borrowings only for capital investment. The proceeds of the issue are not swapped. The borrower chose to tap the D-Mark market because, as well as being a current focus for investor demand, rates are substantially lower than in Spain. Mr Mugica had also been considering the dollar sector, but was discouraged by the greater volatility of the currency and the steep yield curve - the government was keen to raise long-dated funds.</p>

Observers point to the rigid tone of Boris Yeltsin's  statement.    In accordance with the political amnesty resolution, the  defendants figuring in the trial over the organizers of  last-October's disturbances, among them Aleksandr Rutskoy and  Ruslan Khasbulatov, were freed from the Lefortovo jail last  Saturday.    Yeltsin said that the crime situation was very serious in  Russia and that organized crime had risen to an inter-reguional  and international levels. Russian criminals are penetrating  into the former Soviet republics and foreign countries, he said.    Yeltsin believes that this is tied to the Russian law  enforcement bodies' inefficient work. He said that he attached  great importance to the federal program of combating crime for  1994-95 which will be discussed by the Security Council.    "The Russian citizens must be confident that the government  can be effective against crime," he said.    IF [INTERFAX] Note: In his February 24th message to  parliament the president said that the implementation of  measures planned in the program is connected with corresponding  financing, which will compel Russia's parliament to take "hard  budgetary decisions. No matter how hard the economic situation  in the country is, there is a need to do all in human power to  satisfy the most urgent financial and material requirements of  the law-enforcement agencies," Yeltsin stressed. In his  message the president points to the need to dismantle  interdepartment barriers and liquidate the legal and  organizational confusion in the work of the law-enforcement  agencies. He also mentions the need to form in the structure of  the Interior Ministry a strictly centralized system of units for  combating organized crime, and provide them without delay with  the best personnel, equipment and finances.</p>

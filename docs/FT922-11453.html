			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / International Company News: Court clears way for Acil bid AUSTRALIA'S Federal Court yesterday cleared the way for an ADollars 127m (USDollars 97.6m) bid for Australian Consolidated Investments (Acil) by two companies associated with Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur. The court validated an offer document issued by Rossington Holdings, the vehicle for the joint bid by Brierley Investments (BIL) of New Zealand and GPG, the British company acquired by Sir Ron in 1989. The court extended until May 1 the deadline for Acil to send its response to shareholders. The previous deadline expired on Tuesday. Rossington lifted its stake in Acil to just under 20 per cent earlier this week by buying 3.8m shares in the market at 20 cents each. However, the company denied it was the buyer of a further 8m Acil shares which changed hands yesterday. Sir Ron launched the joint bid in February, but has faced strong opposition from Acil, which has fought the offer in the courts and advised shareholders to reject it. In the Federal Court, Acil argued that Rossington's offer document did not adequately state how the bid would be funded. Rossington told the court that BIL would provide 90 per cent of the funding and GPG 10 per cent. The ultimate success or failure of the Rossington bid will depend on a group of banks which controls a 19.9 per cent stake held by the Adelaide Steamship group and a 40 per cent stake formerly controlled by Mr Alan Bond. Rossington's bid for Acil is the first joint takeover attempt by the two companies with which Sir Ron is associated since he acquired GPG. He resigned as Brierley Investments chairman in 1990, but remains a director. Acil, formerly Bell Resources, was a vehicle for takeover activity by the late Mr Robert Holmes a Court. It was later part of the Bond Corporation Holdings group.</p>

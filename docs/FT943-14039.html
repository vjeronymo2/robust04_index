			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Time for a new US tune Successful jazz musicians must combine the ability to improvise with rigorous technique. Though neither President Clinton nor Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan made a career of their saxophone playing, the US dollar's recent travails demand much the same skills. They are right not to keep slavishly to the market beat, but the underlying theme should not be forgotten. The week ended better than it began: with the dollar rallying above its record lows against the yen, and long-term bond yields below their levels when Mr Clinton took office. Over the past 18 months, investors have been listening to the US Administration's haphazard comments about the dollar. Mr Clinton may hope that they are now following his plea to judge the dollar by US economic fundamentals. But the verdict on those is more mixed than he implies. The president's case against a further dollar decline rests on three planks. First, unlike other major industrial countries, US economic recovery is now well advanced, with GDP forecasts promising steady growth in output and jobs for this year and the next. Second, inflation remains subdued: there is little to indicate that a rapid monetary tightening is needed to keep demand in check. Finally, the nascent recoveries in Europe and Japan mean that the American current account deficit, though substantial, has reached its low-point, and should prove less of a worry in the months ahead. How plausible is all this? The administration's projections for US output growth in 1994, as revealed in last week's mid-session budget review, remains 3 per cent, with the pace expected to ease slightly in 1995. Most observers think that the economy is currently expanding somewhat faster than this, as evidenced by last Friday's leap of 379,000 in the number of jobs. Whatever the true figure, few would argue that America's current problem is anaemic growth. Performance fears Fears about current US economic performance do not, however, centre on its weakness. They focus instead on the possibility that the economy is already coming up against capacity constraints that will feed through into wages and prices. Mr Greenspan has raised short-term interest rates four times since February, by a total of 1.25 percentage points. Even Mr Clinton now accepts that the current rate of 4.25 per cent will have to rise before the end of the year. The two are unlikely to agree on the timing of that increase, although the president may wish to have the ritual outrage of some constituents well behind him in the run up to November's House and Senate elections. Yet, for the moment at least, both do seem at one in their opinion that interest rates must remain a lever for domestic demand management, not for attempted manipulation of the dollar. Recent growth Yet many would cite domestic reasons for lifting that lever as soon as possible. In addition to the buoyant employment figures, for example, capacity utilisation is reaching levels that have historically triggered inflation. Against such capacity pessimism is a currently fashionable view that recent growth in productivity, combined with rapid equipment investment, over the last 18 months is overturning historical truths about US economic capacity. Prices and wages may not continue to support such optimism, but last week's figures - flat producer prices with a slight rise in consumer prices - did not indicate the need for a drastic correction. In other words, the Federal Reserve chairman was given few domestic excuses for raising rates now rather than at the next time the FOMC meets on August 16. Where the line between 'domestic' and 'foreign' fundamentals is getting increasingly hard to draw is with regard to the third - and shakiest - leg of the Clinton case for the dollar, namely, the balance of payments. It is the coincidence of two events, one familiar, the other unprecedented, which has caused the trouble. The familiar one is US structural current account deficits, exacerbated by faster domestic growth than in its trading partners. As in the early 1980s, this leaves the US needing to attract foreign capital equivalent to about 2 1/2 per cent of GDP to balance the books. What is unique about the current situation is that the need for foreign funding does not end there. Funds must also be found to offset the Dollars 130bn of capital the US is currently sending abroad, compared to an average of only Dollars 10bn a year in the 1980s. Mr Clinton may be right to argue that the flight from the dollar has been overdone. But he cannot be as confident as he sounds that the fundamentals are on the dollar's side. Its plight is a reminder of long-standing US weaknesses. The world's largest economy is trying to achieve rapidly rising individual incomes with a net saving rate of around 2 per cent. Mr Clinton should tell Congress it cannot be done.</p>

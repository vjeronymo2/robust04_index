			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Generator enters gas market NATIONAL Power, the electricity generator, is one of 32 bidders which have been allowed to buy gas from British Gas to sell on to the industrial and commercial market. The company said it had bought a 'very small amount' to 'gain marketing and operational experience in the gas market'. It had customers lined up to buy the gas. Rival generator PowerGen already has a toe-hold in the gas market through Kinetica, a joint venture with Conoco, the oil company. Several other successful bidders are joint ventures between regional electricity companies and gas suppliers. British Gas agreed with the Office of Fair Trading earlier this year to sell 500m therms of gas in the first of a series of annual sales aimed at reducing the company's share of the industrial market from 90 per cent to 40 per cent by 1995. British Gas said yesterday that it could not release details of the allocations, but it is thought that 23 suppliers each received 17.8m therms, with nine others receiving the minimum allocation of 10m therms. Some larger suppliers criticised the way the auction was operated, warning that it could impede the development of competition. Mr John Astrop, commercial director of Kinetica, which supplies 1,000 sites, was 'very disappointed' with the allocation. He said: 'It is less than we hoped for, and shows the problems with allocating the gas on a per capita basis without taking account of who are the established, long-term players.' He was worried that the auction may have encouraged smaller companies to buy gas, although they would be unwilling or unable to secure longer-term supplies. This could hinder the growth of longer-term players and slow the development of real competition. The Gas Consumers Council said it was surprised at the number of successful applicants, and welcomed the widened choice for consumers. Many observers said it was inevitable that an 'after market' would develop in gas supplies, with trading between independent suppliers.</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Equity futures trading dreams begin to fade - Derivatives The dream of expanding equity derivatives trading in London through the introduction of mid-250 index futures appears to have turned sour. The first futures contract on the FT-SE mid-250 index - the 250 biggest stocks below the FT-SE 100 - was launched at the begining of February on the OMLX exchange, a screen-based securities and derivatives exchange started in Sweden. Liffe's mid-250 product started trading three weeks later. But six months on, some market participants have not only started questioning the usefulness of the mid-250 futures contract as a product but suggest the OMLX should throw in the towel. Volumes on that exchange have continued to slide from a peak of 5,778 in the first month to no contracts in July. Liffe's contract has performed with an average of 3,500 contracts in each of the last three months. By comparison, the FT-SE 100 contract traded an average of 342,000 contracts a month over the same period. Several reasons are cited for the the failure of the new contract. Chief among these is the unfortunate timing of the launch. US interest rates were raised the day the OMLX started trading. This not only triggered a large correction in the stock market but also inspired a move by institutional investors back to FT-SE 100 equities. Products associated with the 250 thus fell out of favour. Dealers also point to a lack of liquidity in the 250 stocks. Stocks in this group are by nature much less liquid than FT-SE 100 constituents. Traders therefore have less scope to arbitrage. Some market participants describe the launch as premature. Mr Barry Marshall, head of derivatives investment at the Gartmore fund management group said: 'It was introduced a little too early. We still haven't managed to persuade all our clients to use the FT-SE 100 future. 'More effort should have gone into helping clients understand the benefits of futures rather than introduce new products.' Mr Nigel Croft, derivatives analyst at Kleinwort Benson, believes there is a market for the mid-250 index future but not as it is presently used: 'I think there will be demand for it as a tool for asset allocation, particularly as more people get used to asset allocation in one country and between sectors.' However, the general problems that confront the mid-250 futures contract as a product cannot mask the specific failure of trading on the OMLX exchange which seems to have been severely squeezed by Liffe. Many dealers say they prefer the face-to-face dealing and the geographical proximity offered on the Liffe. Institutions that have used the 250 contract have also indicated a preference for dealing through Liffe. A trader at BZW said: 'They tend to see Liffe as more creditworthy even though the risk is with us when we take on the deal.' Independent traders known as locals, a mainstay of the Liffe trading system, have also shyed away from the OMLX system. 'We prefer to just walk over to the mid-250 pitch and deal. With OMLX we have to phone the order through, fiddle about and so forth. . . it just takes more time to deal,' said one local. The lack of liquidity in the sector as a whole has also prevented the OMLX from benefitting from the only advantage it appears to have over Liffe, that of offering traded options in the mid-250 index. Liffe has yet to introduce mid-250 traded options. As one trader put it: 'You need liquidity in the futures to get into the traded options. Without that there is no reason for us to be involved.' Directors at the OMLX, acknowledging the less than impressive performance, introduced in June 'flex' future and options which allow dealers to adjust the strike prices and expiry dates of contracts like over-the-counter products. The move was designed to inject liquidity into the market and to attract any OTC mid 250 business. But for some it was already too late, and they were not prepared to try anything new offered by the OMLX exchange. A manager at derivatives traders Tullet &amp; Tokyo said: 'As far as I am concerned that product on the OMLX is dead. It just doesn't work.' But Mr David Courtney, marketing director at the OMLX refuses to concede defeat. He said: 'Our members recently decided that we there was still a need for us and decided we should continue. We plan to do so.' But so too does Liffe. This week it announced its contract had received clearence from US authorities to be sold to US customers.</p>

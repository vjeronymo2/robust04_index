			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by Pascal Barollier] </F>   [Excerpt] Sarajevo, May 19 (AFP) -- Bosnia's Moslem-led  army has stepped up offensives on several fronts, UN officials  said Thursday [19 May], as Western governments issued fresh  warningins that they will pull their peacekeepers out of Bosnia  unless serious peace negotiations resume. UN Protection Force  [UNPROFOR] spokesman Rob Annink said the Bosnian Army was  strengthening its positions on both the eastern and western  fronts in central Bosnia and "feels ready to launch an attack"  against Serb forces. He said the heaviest fighting Thursday was  around Brgule, Olovo and Kladanj, towns located between Sarajevo  and the northern city of Tuzla, where UN military observers  counted up to 200 explosions Wednesday.    The UNPROFOR has not been allowed to visit the combat zone,  Annink said. He said the larger Bosnian Army has an advantage  over the Serbs along the eastern front because the hilly terrain  favors ground troops over the Serbs' stronger artillery. "The  Bosnian Army is an infantry army while the Bosnian Serbs have  mostly artillery," Annink said. He said the army would have a  tougher time along the western front where the Serbs control the  high ground overlooking the town of Turbe. But, he added, the  army has managed to concentrate its troops in the region thanks  to the federation plan signed in February between the country's  Moslems and their former Bosnian Croat enemies. The pact has  allowed the government army to redeploy troops from previous  zones of conflict with the Croats.    The upsurge in fighting came as Britain and Spain joined  France in raising the possibility they will pull their  peacekeeping troops out of Bosnia in the absence of progress  toward peace.    British Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas Hogg said  the Bosnian Moslems "have to recognize military defeat when it  stares them in the face...    "I recognize this is extraordinarily unpalatable," he told a  private group Wednesday night in remarks reported Thursday.  "Time is running out," he said. "We have eight weeks or so" to  see positive developments in the peace process. A Foreign  Office spokesman stressed that Hogg was not referring to a  withdrawal of troops within any set time limit.    Spanish Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas meanwhile said  in Madrid that it was "probable in the coming months we may  consider reducing our troops in Bosnia... The UN peacekeepers  cannot stay on a mission forever."    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Wednesday that  France "cannot leave our UN peacekeepers indefinitely (in  Bosnia) if the people they are trying to help have governments  that don't want peace." Juppe said Thursday in Paris that the  foreign ministers of Russia, the United States and five Western  European countries may hold a meeting on Bosnia-Herzegovina June  13. He said the meeting may be decisive in terms of future  French policy in Bosnia. France has warned in recent days that  it would consider pulling out its 6,800 troops stationed in the  former Yugoslavia unless there was a breakthrough in the peace  process within six months. Britain has about 3,000 troops  stationed in ex-Yugoslavia while Spain has 1,487. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA) -- The second plenary  session of the Fourth Council of the Chinese Journalists  Association (CJA) opened today in Beijing.    CJA Vice-Chairman Li Yan made a report at the meeting on the  work of the association. More than 200 members of the council  in mass media across the country took part in the meeting.    Li hailed the great contributions the association has made  over the past three years in developing China's journalism.    Talking about the association's future task, Li said the  role  of "bridges" and ties of the association as a non-governmental  organization should be brought into full play.    He said the association must better serve all journalists,  uniting and promoting the press circles to make greater  contributions toward new success in China's reform, opening and  modernization drive.    The vice-chairman added that the CJA should make positive  efforts to push forward the exchanges and cooperation between  Chinese journalists and overseas journalists.    He noted that as an authoritative non-governmental  organization the CJA should adapt itself to meet the demands of  the time and the journalists, broaden mass viewpoints and play a  better role as a bridge and tie in the new situation.    He said that China has more than 500,000 people who are  engaged in journalism.    Xu Weicheng, deputy director of the Propaganda Department of  the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, also spoke at the  meeting.    Xu said that it is necessary to adhere to the correct  orientation of the ideological and media work, serving the  economic construction, reform and opening, and social and  political stability.</p>

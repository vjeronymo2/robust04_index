			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANGERS OF OVERPOPULATION  </P> <P> After reading the article by Paul R. and Anne H. Ehrlich ("One Potentially  Lethal Disease," Op-Ed Page, April 4), I cannot help but feel that it is ironic  that we spend millions to aid the starving of the world when half of the time  the food does not touch the hungry lips due to lack of transportation and  communication in the rural areas, or the load goes to the wrong hands.  </P> <P> Why don't we spend these dollars on educating the Third World countries with  respect to birth control? Overpopulation, no matter where, is a global problem  and that should be our main concern.  </P> <P> SHEMI AMARSI-SALLIS  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Bill on independent press body wins second reading A PRIVATE member's bill seeking to establish an independent press authority to secure 'due accuracy' by newspapers and periodicals was given a second reading by 119 votes to 15 in the Commons yesterday. The bill was described as 'premature and misconceived' by Mr Robert Key, the junior heritage minister, and a procedural manoeuvre by some Conservative backbenchers to block its progress was defeated by 129 votes to 11. Mr Clive Soley, Labour MP for Hammersmith and chief sponsor of the bill, underlined his willingness to accept amendments supporting press freedom when appealing for co-operation from newspaper editors at a press conference after the debate. The bill has only a remote chance of reaching the statute book because of the number and scope of amendments that have to be considered during the line-by-line committee stage. The government's dissatisfaction with the existing Press Complaints Commission was reaffirmed by Mr Key, who made it clear that ministerial reluctance to establish a statutory regulatory body, as recommended by Sir David Calcutt in his recent report, did not mean it had been ruled out. The government will take into account press response to Sir David's criticisms and the views expressed in the debate on the bill and in the forthcoming report by the Commons heritage committee on privacy and media intrusion before reaching conclusions about a statutory regulatory body. In response to questions at the press conference Mr Soley warned newspaper editors that unless they co-operated in getting 'something like my bill' on the statute book they risked legislation on privacy without any counter-balancing measure on press freedom.</p>

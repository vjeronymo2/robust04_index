Provincial party committee Secretary Xie Shijie delivered a  speech in which he called on principal party and government  leaders at all levels across the province to correctly handle  dialectical relations between population and economy; strengthen  a sense of urgency in population control while striving to push  economic growth onto a new stage; and further improve family  planning work.    At a time when a provincial people's congress session and a  provincial Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  session were being held, the provincial party committee and  government jointly invited principal prefectural, city, and  autonomous prefectural leaders, as well as principal leaders in  charge of the various provincial departments concerned, to a  forum to discuss family planning work. This was indeed an  unprecedented move in the province's history.    Qin Yuqin, provincial party committee deputy secretary,  presided over yesterday's forum at which she delivered a speech,  calling for establishing a system whereby family planning forums  are held at regular intervals so that leaders can discuss and  formulate strategies and push family planning work onto a new  stage.    Zhang Zhongwei, provincial party committee standing  committee  member and provincial vice governor, first took the floor to  brief the leaders on Sichuan's population situation.    Provincial party committee Secretary Xie Shijie and Xiao  Yang, provincial party committee deputy secretary and provincial  governor, delivered important speeches at the forum.    Comrade Xie Shijie pointed out: While building a socialist  market economic structure we should correctly handle dialectical  relations between population and economy; place population  growth under control; and strive to improve population quality,  this being our basic national policy with special significance  to Sichuan entering the international market and participating  in international competition. He stated: Market competition  will in no way repel family planning. Rather, it calls for  integrating social family planning with household family  planning; integrating a social restriction mechanism with an  interest orientation mechanism; integrating propaganda and  education with the legal system in this regard; integrating  administrative management with family planning among the masses;  and integrating conception and sterilization with quality  childbirth in order that the broad masses of the people are able  to consciously implement family planning in production  activities, daily life, and family life.    Comrade Xie Shijie called on principal party and government  leaders at all levels to conscientiously implement to the letter  all five family planning requirements laid down by General  Secretary Jiang Zemin; take personal charge of and assume  overall responsibilities for family planning work; and firmly  grasp the following three work aspects:    1. Strengthen grass-roots family planning networks and  implement the instruction issued by the provincial party  committee and government about stabilizing the family planning  contingent, building more family planning offices at the  township level, and training family planning contingents at the  village level;    2. Conscientiously examine the family planning situation and  assume personal responsibility for attaining family planning  quotas.    3. Increase the financial input into family planning;  provide family planning with sufficient operational funds; take  family planning as an important criterion for appraising,  commending, rewarding, selecting, and promoting party and  government cadres; and step up education on family planning as  one of the basic national policies among party members and  cadres. The party members and cadres should try to set a fine  example and play an exemplary role in this regard.    Comrade Xiao Yang said: Being a populous province, Sichuan  will find it more difficult to realize comparatively well-off  living standards. In view of this situation, principal party  and government leaders at all levels should take personal charge  of and assume overall responsibility for family planning work.  We should strive to build stronger and more efficient family  planning organizations and support grass-roots family planning  cadres in their work. All cities across the province should  step up control of the floating population and provide family  planning with sufficient operational funds. Should we fail to  provide family planning with sufficient operational funds, we  will unavoidably face serious consequences and have to spend  more money in this connection.    Yang Xizong, provincial people's congress standing committee  chairman, also delivered a speech in which he stressed: We are  carrying out family planning work here in Sichuan on a solid  basis. We have both rich family planning experience and  effective family planning measures. Family planning depends on  human efforts! We should conscientiously publicize and  implement "Sichuan Provincial Family Planning Regulations";  conduct family planning in accordance with the law; further  regularize family planning; and place family planning within the  orbit of the legal system.    Leaders from Chengdu, Chongqing, Neijiang, Nanchong, and  some  others areas across the province reported on their respective  family planning work; exchanged family planning experiences; and  studied ways and means of strengthening family planning.    Also attending the forum were Song Baorui, Yang Chonghui,  Diao Jinxiang, Xi Yifang, Kang Zhenhuang, Liu Changjie, Geng  Quanli [provincial military district political commissar], Zhang  Shikui, and others.</p>

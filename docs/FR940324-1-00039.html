The VICP was established by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99&hyph;660 [42 U.S.C. 300aa&hyph;10 et seq.] (Act), and provides a system of no-fault compensation for certain individuals who have been injured by specific childhood vaccines. Petitions for compensation under this Program are filed with the United States Court of Federal Claims, with a copy served on the Secretary, who is denominated the ``Respondent.'' The Vaccine Injury Table (Table) included in the Act establishes presumptions about causation of certain illnesses and conditions, which are used by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to adjudicate petitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 312 of the Act, Congress mandated that the Secretary review the scientific literature and other information on specific adverse consequences of pertussis and rubella vaccines. In accordance with the requirements of that law, the Secretary entered into a contract with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to perform this review. The IOM published on August 27, 1991 a report of its review entitled, ``Adverse Effects of Pertussis and Rubella Vaccines'' (hereinafter ``IOM Report.'')  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 312 also required the Secretary to propose regulations to amend the Table as a result of such findings. Accordingly, on August 14, 1992, the Assistant Secretary for Health, with the approval of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 36878) a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to amend the Table. The NPRM was issued pursuant to section 2114 of the Act, which authorizes the Secretary to promulgate regulations to modify the Table. As required by section 2114(c) of the Act, the Department provided for a 6-month comment period which closed on February 11, 1993. In addition, on December 3, 1992, the Department held a public hearing for the purpose of receiving oral testimony on the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency analyzed the comments received in preparation for publication of the final rule. During this process, however, the Agency became aware of the imminent publication of a 10-year follow-up study to the National Childhood Encephalopathy Study (Madge N., Diamond J., Miller D., Ross E., McManus C., Wadsworth J., Yule W. The National Childhood Encephalopathy Study: A 10-year follow-up. A report of the medical, social, behavioural and educational outcomes after serious, acute, neurologic illness in early childhood. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology 1993; Supplement No. 68;35(7):1&hyph;118; Miller D.L., Madge N., Diamond J., Wadsworth J., Ross E. Pertussis immunization and serious acute neurological illness in children. British medical Journal 1993; 307:1171&hyph;1176, hereinafter ``Miller study.''). Because the National Childhood Encephalopathy Study (NCES) was reviewed initially by the IOM, and because the Miller study looked specifically at the relationship between vaccine administration and resulting neurological damage, the Department determined that it should not proceed with publication of the final rule until there had been a sufficient opportunity to consider the conclusions of the new Miller study. Accordingly, the Department asked the IOM to convene a Committee for purposes of evaluating the Miller study in light of the conclusions of its initial report. On March 2, 1994, the Institute of Medicine issued a report entitled ``DPT Vaccine and Chronic Nervous System Dysfunction: A New Analysis.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has determined that the public should have an additional 30 days to comment on the conclusions of this report prior to publication of the final rule. Only those comments addressing the conclusions of this latest IOM report will be considered. Commenters should address whether the proposed rule should be modified in light of the conclusions of this latest IOM report. The Department will consider carefully all comments received, and will address these comments in the preamble to the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is not able to reproduce herein the entire study for review by the public. Set forth below, however, is the Executive Summary of the report containing the IOM's conclusions. Copies of the full report can be obtained by contacting the National Academy of Sciences, 2101 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20077&hyph;5576.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

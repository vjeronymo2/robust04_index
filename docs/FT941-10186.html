			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: SEC to propose new rules for stock trading systems The Securities and Exchange Commission voted yesterday to propose new rules that would establish record-keeping and reporting requirements for brokerage firms operating automated stock trading systems in the US. The proposals represent the first action the SEC has taken to follow up on its Market 2000 report. Published last month, Market 2000 was the agency's first big study of US financial markets in more than 20 years. The report recommended a series of regulatory and reporting changes that it believed would improve market supervision and oversight. Mr Arthur Levitt, chairman of the SEC, said that while he welcomed the lower costs and improved efficiencies that the automated trading systems had generated, the systems were having a growing impact upon securities markets, and it was important that regulators gathered more information about their activities. Under the terms of the new rules, which will not be introduced until the end of a 60-day period for receiving comments from the industry, firms operating the trading systems would have to make quarterly reports to the SEC about participants, volume and transactions on the systems. The rule changes are aimed primarily at big securities firms which use their own trading systems to execute orders for their institutional and retail clients. Seeking to cut costs and improve efficiency, more firms have moved this kind of business in-house, rather than use the more conventional floor-based exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or the computer-based markets like the National Association of Securities Dealers' Nasdaq systems. Yesterday, Mr Bernard Madoff, of Bernard Madoff Securities, a firm that operates one of the biggest off-exchange automated trading systems, said he anticipated little difficulty in complying with the SEC's new rules.</p>

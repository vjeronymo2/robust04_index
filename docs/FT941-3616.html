			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Tea There was good general demand, reports the Tea Brokers' Association. The few best east Africans on offer held firm but bright liquoring teas lost 3 to 5 pence. Coloury mediums were generally steady but others were irregular and sometimes easier. Brighter Ceylons met good competition and prices moved higher. Plainest types were often neglected. Good demand at firm rates. Quality 190p/kg, good medium 135p/kg, medium 118p/kg, low medium 90p/kg. The highest price realised this week was 228p/kg for a Rwanda pf. 1.</p>

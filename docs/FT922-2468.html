			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Leading Article: The choice of the Irish THE PEOPLE of Ireland have never held so much power. Should they, like the Danes, reject the treaty on European Union in their referendum on Thursday, it would probably fail. But this makes their choice not only more important, but still more difficult. It is not now a choice between Ireland's being in the European Union and remaining outside it. It is between a European Union that might include 11 or even all 12 of the present members of the EC and either no such union or one far narrower in its membership. Irish voters must be as clear as possible about the implications of their choice. What would happen to their country - and to Europe - if the current project for European Union were to fail? Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, has been apocalyptic. He has told the Irish people that rejection of the treaty 'would put the whole future of European integration at risk and would also put a serious question mark over our place in Europe'. Similarly, he has warned that 'it is not realistic to think that we can reject the European Union treaty and still enjoy the benefits of full membership'. Yet it is not obvious why this hope must be unrealistic. Why should the EC not survive an Irish 'no'? If it does survive, why should Ireland - a member in good standing, just like Denmark - be excluded? Mr Reynold's prophecies of doom should not be given complete credence. Large stake Nevertheless, they cannot be ignored, simply because Ireland's stake is so large. Ireland is the only poor country that benefits substantially from the Common Agricultural Policy. It receives a total transfer of some 6 per cent of its gross domestic product, not to mention six Irish pounds for every pound paid to the EC. It would appear mad for the Irish to risk such sums. But while a 'no' vote would risk such a loss, it would not ensure it. If the EC were to survive with Ireland still a member, but the project for union were to fail in its current form, Ireland would still benefit from existing EC policies. What Ireland would lose would be the planned increases, particularly in the 'cohesion fund', though the scale of those increases now looks uncertain. But if the Maastricht Treaty is ratified, Ireland expects to receive IPounds 6bn between 1994 and 1998 from the EC's structural and cohesion funds, compared to the IPounds 3bn it received between 1989 and 1993. Lost transfers Apart from the lost transfers, the other likely cost to Ireland would come via the effect on confidence in peripheral currencies. Ireland has made a heroic effort at economic convergence within the ERM. Consumer price inflation is down to 3 1/2 per cent and, prior to the Danish vote, short term interest rates were less than 0.2 percentage points and long term rates less than a percentage point above German levels. Complete failure of the project for economic and monetary union would probably lead to wider differentials and higher real interest rates, even if the ERM itself were to survive. Smaller transfers and higher interest rates: these are the most likely consequences of a 'no' vote. If Ireland were forced out of the EC altogether, however, the losses would be far greater and not merely in budgetary and monetary terms. Ireland might then lose its access to the EC market as well. Nevertheless, participation in Emu is itself not necessarily in Ireland's interest. The lower interest rates that are likely would help, as would the extra transfers. But Ireland's is a very different economy from those in the European core and the risks of an irrevocably fixed exchange rate are large. Without provision for substantial transfers to offset unforseen economic shocks, participation in Emu would be a gamble. Irish voters must recognize that a 'no' vote is likely to end concerted moves towards European Union. For Ireland itself, the economic consequences of such a vote would depend largely on whether it could remain part of a still healthy EC: to be outside the EC would be a disaster; to be inside the EC, but not in Emu, need not be as great a disaster. The prime minister probably exaggerates how stark the choice facing the Irish people is. But of its importance for Ireland and for Europe there can be little doubt.</p>

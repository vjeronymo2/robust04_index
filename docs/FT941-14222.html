			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Management: Business school blueprint / An examination of Manchester's plans to go federal Eighteen months on from the row over the future of its internationally-renowned business school, Manchester University is striving to reassert itself as a top-rank European centre of management education and research. Its ambitions include a place in the world league which arguably includes institutions such as Harvard, Stanford and Northwestern of Illinois in the US, and Insead, London Business School, Henley, Warwick University and Cranfield in Europe. Manchester's aim is to offer 'cradle-to-grave' management education from undergraduate courses to post-doctoral research, including masters degrees (MBAs) and a range of shorter courses for experienced managers. All this will be provided under the umbrella of the new Manchester Federal School of Business and Management, which comes into being this month and which will start operating formally in October. The federation will comprise Manchester Business School, an entirely postgraduate institution, and three organisations which have all scored five out of five in the UK government's ratings of quality of research: the university's department of accountancy and finance, the school of management at University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist) and a small group of academics and postgraduates in a group called Prest - a programme of Policy Research in Engineering Science and Technology. The federation will have about 200 teaching staff and 2,000 students, of whom between 35 and 40 per cent will be postgraduates or experienced managers on courses. The three main institutions have functioned independently until now but, according to Martin Harris, the university's vice-chancellor, were competing fiercely for both staff and students and in danger of triplicating teaching posts. Harris says the federation will encourage economy of scale and synergy, mainly through pooling teaching and research staff. Staff will operate between the institutions according to demand. Students will be able to take various combinations of subjects and courses throughout the federal school, as well as combining them with other relevant courses, such as the engineering sciences, in the university. A points system for degrees, with students gaining marks incrementally as they complete the various constituent modules of combinations of courses, is planned. Harris believes the federation will get better financial treatment from the government's Universities' Funding Council than if Manchester's business and management functions had gone their own way. Part of the federation's planning is a project costing up to Pounds 11m to locate all the institutions near the present business school buildings. The federation issue was at the heart of the row over the future of Manchester Business School. The staff were split over whether the school should go its own way as a practically-oriented, less 'academic' body. Those favouring autonomy included the school's council of private-sector leaders, who resigned and asked the government to intervene. But the government stood back. Tom Cannon, the school's director, left his post shortly after, although he retains a visiting chair in corporate governance. The school, now headed by the internally-promoted Tony Cockerell, has a new board of private-sector heavyweights, chaired by James Ross, chief executive of Cable &amp; Wireless, who got his own MBA in Manchester. It includes Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary to the Treasury, whose appointment made up for the loss of Sir Peter Middleton, one of his predecessors as head of the Treasury. Manchester academics naturally hope that the federation marks a new dawn. 'There has been no full-range international business school in the UK until now,' says Cary Cooper, an American psychologist who works at Umist and is an authority on managerial stress. 'Most schools concentrate on postgraduate and post-experience work. In terms of staff numbers, as well as the range of courses and disciplines covered, this will be pre-eminent.' There are still plenty of sceptics, however, who wonder if it will work. The one missing factor is leadership. As most management teachers acknowledge when talking about organisations generally, many co-operative efforts fail because ideals, or mutual self-interest, are not enough without someone in charge to drive them through. Cooper, who knows more than most about the psychology of leadership in management, agrees this is a weakness. The hope must be that it is not exposed. If it is, the old axiom, 'those who can, do; those who can't, teach,' would rarely have been better exemplified.</p>

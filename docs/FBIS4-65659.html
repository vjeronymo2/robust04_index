			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/408: "Results of Monthly Surveys </F> of European Opinion (January-April 1994)"]    [Text] Since January 1994, the Commission is doing pilot  monthly surveys (five questions). The definitive formula with a  solid sample and methodology will come into force at the end of  the year. Here are the results of the four first months  test-exercises:  <H5>  White Paper </H5>   Between the 3rd and 13th January 1994 -- monthly monitor 1  --  18 percent of Europeans say they have heard or read something on  the white paper. In April -- monthly monitor 4 -- 25 percent  had become aware of something on the subject.    On EC average, the level of expected positive effects of the  white paper fell a little between January (47 percent) and April  (42 percent).  <H5>  Enlargement </H5>   In March 1994, the vast majority support membership of  Sweden  (83 percent), Austria, and Norway (82 percent), Switzerland (81  percent) and Finland (80 percent).    In April 1994 -- monthly monitor 4 -- "after the next  accession to the European Commission (European Union) of  countries such as Austria, Finland, Norway or Sweden," 64  percent of Europeans favour membership of Hungary, 61 percent  membership of Poland, 59 percent membership of the Czech  Republic and 57 percent membership of Slovakia.  <H5>  The Conflict in Ex-Yugoslavia </H5>   Between the 1st and the 8th of February 1994 -- monthly  monitor 2 -- four out of five European citizens (82 percent)  opposed "letting things as they go now" in the conflict between  the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims in Bosnia.    Of the possible measures proposed to the respondents, that  of  using "fight when necessary to get humanitarian convoys through"  received the highest support: 75 percent (90 percent in  France). Followed by, though not closely:     -  Launch air  strikes: 37 percent for; 55 percent against (53 percent of  French favour this but only 9 percent of Greeks and 6 percent of  Portuguese).    -  Lift the arms embargo against Bosnia: 33 percent  for; 54 percent against.    -  Withdraw all troops: 31 percent for;  62 percent against (71 percent of Greeks are in favour).    -  Lift  the embargo against Serbia: 28 percent for; 58 percent against  (67 percent of Greeks are in favour).    -  Break off negotiations  with all sides: 23 percent for; 69 percent against.   <H5>  European Elections </H5>   In April 1994 -- monthly monitor 4 -- one in two (50  percent)  European citizens confessed that in casting their vote to elect  members of the European Parliament, their opinion about national  issues will be more important. Forty-two percent said that  European problems will be more important for them at the time of  their vote.  <H5>  Satisfaction With Democracy and Support for the European </H5> Union    In April 1994, 48 percent of Europeans said they were "very  satisfied" or "somewhat satisfied" with the way democracy works  in their country.    Support for the European Union among those who think  membership is a good thing has not really changed between  January (56 percent) and April (58 percent) 1994. The situation  among those who think membership is a bad thing is almost  identical: 14 percent in january, 13 percent in April.    Following a slight decrease from February to March in those  who think that "all things considered, their country has  benefitted from membership of the EU" (- 3), the level remained  stable between March and April (49 percent).</p>

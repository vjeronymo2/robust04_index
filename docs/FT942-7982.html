			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Changing cultures of capitalism Does culture determine economics or economics culture? The issue has raged for a long time. Marx and contemporary Chicago economists are alike on the economic side; Max Weber, the early 20th century German sociologist who wrote about Protestantism and the rise of capitalism, on the other one. Both have now accumulated a lot of egg on their faces. Attempts to explain the fundamentalist revolution in Iran in terms of rational utility maximisation by Iranian citizens have, to put it mildly, been extremely unconvincing. Of course the cultural and economic spheres interact. Peter Berger, the American sociologist, has coined the term 'economic culture' for the resulting product. As he explains in an article in the McKinsey Quarterly, the interaction has to be studied in careful case studies. One reassuring conclusion is that comparative cultural advantage changes. The Japanese bent for organisation building may not be such an advantage in a post-industrial society based on information technology. Berger also throws much needed doubt on much of what is written about the Confucian element in Asian economic success: 'Few Taiwanese entrepreneurs are steeped in the Confucian classics.' His most stimulating remarks are on the US-originated counter-culture of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Most of its members have now accepted 'the system' but have retained some of the beliefs and lifestyle of their youth. They are to be found particularly in communications. (Their trademark can be very simple, such as avoiding wearing jacket and trousers of the same colour less they be accused of wearing a suit.) Is this kinder, gentler capitalism doomed to be conquered by the uptight varieties? Berger wisely leaves open the alternative optimistic hypothesis that the more sensitive types of behaviour may have an advantage in the emerging service economies. Just how diverse the cultural forms of capitalism can be is illustrated in a new book of essays by American writers entitled The Culture of the Market. It is a book to dip into at leisure and will be most instructive if read without too relentless an attempt to derive lessons from it. The essay nearest to the present day concerns the remarkable vogue of The Lonely Crowd published in 1954 by the American author David Riesman, the one sociologist to have made the cover of Time magazine. By the early 1970s more than 1m copies of the abridged edition had been bought and the book still sells. The Time cover has two small-scale figures behind Riesman's head. The first, 'dressed in a dark Victorian suit and wearing long, bushy 19th century sideburns, seems to stride briskly and purposefully away from the reader, oblivious to all but his quest, a giant gyroscope strapped to his back. The second man, dressed in a light coloured suit, is a more modern 20th century man, perhaps a salesman, facing in the opposite direction'. The outer-directed person escaped from the authoritarianism of the 19th century home, school or business, only to be smothered by the new conformism of his peer group. Riesman had a knack of highlighting relevant children's stories such as the young engine Tootle, which lands in trouble because of its unwillingness to 'stay on the tracks with the other engines'. Most of the chapters go back, however, to earlier periods. There is an absorbing essay about the painter Edgar Degas's tense relations with markets, which not only gave him a varying sales outlet but were the source of some of his most famous pictures, such as a New Orleans cotton office, a sulking banker and a galaxy of scurrilous stock exchange types. The most ambivalent of the pictures is Madame's Birthday, in which 'tactile values' are graphically shown. In a very different vein, there is an account of the American essayist Henry Thoreau's temporary period as a semi-hermit refugee from commercial life. But so far from being any kind of collectivist, Thoreau was a radical individualist in the American mould, who could not resist instructing his readers on simple hermitage book-keeping and was not above some self-mockery. At the opposite cultural extreme, Balzac's novel Pere Goriot reveals how far the European bourgeois has often been from any simple idea of utility maximisation: material goods are sought as symbols of honour, family dignity and snobbish attainment. The weekly budget of one character is exhausted in a vain attempt to arrive with clean boots at the home of a minor aristocrat. But an antidote to nostalgia is provided in Martin Wiener's account of the moralist-disciplinarian criminal policy of Victorian England, which some over-promoted British ministers would like to see restored. Anthropological studies have shown the most varying patterns of linkages between different beliefs. Similarly capitalist heroes, who wrote their autobiographies as moral tales, could be anything from stern supporters of hierarchical order to rebellious hedonists and modernisers. The main non-materialist advantage of modern capitalism is that it is a necessary - but far from sufficient - condition of an open society in which many alternative cultures can flourish.

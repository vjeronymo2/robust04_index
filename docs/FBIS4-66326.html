			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chen Meifeng [7115 5019 7685]: ``Major </F> Breakthrough in Neutron Radiography Technology'']    [Summary] Changchun, 13 Apr (XINHUA) A miniature portable  neutron radiography system with applications in national  defense, aerospace, and other leading edge scientific areas was  recently developed by the Physics Deparment at Northeast  Teachers' University (NTU) and just passed formal appraisal here  in Changchun. This non-destructive testing equipment, heavier  forms of which have long been used for nuclear reactor  monitoring, can now be conveniently used out in the field for a  variety of other tests. The key to the completion of this task,  which the NTU researchers took over 6 years ago from the  National Defense Science, Technology and Industry Commission,  was the development of the scintillation augmentation screen,  whose main performance parameters--especially imaging speed and  resolution have been certified by the experts to meet the best  current international standards. The system, which has a sealed  neutron source tube, can take either film photographs or can  send low-light-level cumulative images to a computer for further  enhancement.</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Barings The 54 per cent jump in Barings' first quarter results prompts the question whether they must know something which a struggling Warburg does not. Perhaps the secret of success in investment banking is to eschew market-making in securities, focus on lucrative niches and steer clear of low-margin businesses. But such a strategy has long been closed to a bank of Warburg's size. It is also easy to exaggerate Barings' triumph. The mere fact that it has had a good first half, helped incidentally by the fees from a number of one-off deals such as the 3i flotation, does not say much for the quality of its earnings. Barings' profits have fluctuated wildly in recent years, from Pounds 66m in 1989 to Pounds 21m in 1992 and Pounds 100m last year. Nor is net return on capital outstanding at slightly over 20 per cent. Barings itself admits the need for a higher return to compensate for the volatility of its profits flow. Here, it becomes just like any other merchant bank. It must be continuously on the look-out for new high margin business, even in the emerging markets in which it specialises, and it must remain on its guard against rising costs. Administrative expenses rose 33 per cent in the first half, which partly reflects the sunk costs of its emerging market network. Barings assumes its return will improve as that investment continues to come good. If so, its strategy will be vindicated. If not, and bond markets eventually recover, a fickle City might one day end up lavishing praise instead on Warburg for its clever skills on proprietary trading.</p>

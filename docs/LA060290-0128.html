			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG PROGRAM CURBS COCAINE USE, STUDY SAYS  </P> <P> A five-year government study has shown for the first time that a comprehensive  anti-drug program can significantly reduce cocaine use among teen-agers,  researchers announced Friday.  </P> <P> A preliminary analysis of eight schools in the study found that 1.6% of the  program students used cocaine in the last month, contrasted with 3.7% of those  not in the program.  </P> <P> If the same percentage difference on cocaine use were applied nationally, it  would mean 500,000 fewer teen-agers were using cocaine, said Charles Schuster,  director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, at a news conference.  </P> <P> "I would like to emphasize that this is the first time we have data on the  impact of prevention programs in reducing the use of cocaine, including crack  cocaine," he said.  </P> <P> Researchers from the University of Southern California began tracking 5,500  teen-agers when they were in the sixth and seventh grades in 50 Kansas City  schools and studied a similar group at 57 schools in Indiana.  </P> <P> The effort apparently also produced significant reductions in teen-agers' use  of cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana -- so-called gateway drugs, Schuster said.  </P> <P> Those reductions included:  </P> <P>  -- 24.1% of the participating students, now high school juniors and seniors,  smoked cigarettes in the last month, contrasted with 32% of those who did not  receive the program's prevention messages.  </P> <P>  -- 36% of the students who participated in the program said they drank alcohol  in the last month, and 50.1% of those not in the program admitted the same  behavior.  </P> <P>  -- 14.2% of the program students smoked marijuana in the last month,  contrasted with 20.2% of those in a control group.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpt] Yesterday Vitor Constancio, the former secretary  general of the Socialist Party (PS), accepted [PS leader]  Antonio Guterres's request to participate in the list for the  party's National Commission. Constancio's return to active  partisan politics is considered "a very important event" by the  PS leadership. The political apparatus' "boss," Jorge Coelho,  saw it as a "great contribution to the party's central objective  of winning the 1995 legislative elections."    Together with Constancio, Jaime Gama, Torres Couto, and Jose  Lello also returned to the party's higher leadership. The list  proposed by Guterres, which will go to a vote on 25 February,  also includes former Social Democratic Party (PSD) member Helena  Roseta. Guterres now hopes to convince Constancio to head the PS  list for the European Parliament elections. Decisions will be  made after Guterres's reelection as secretary general, expected  on 11 March.

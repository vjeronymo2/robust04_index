			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Observer: Legend has it Anyone who knows anything about Greek mythology will find Bill Rooney's choice of come-back vehicle a trifle bizarre. Little more than a year after he was forced off the board of Spring Ram by institutional investors upset by three profit warnings in eight months, Rooney has taken control of Atreus, a bathroom goods supplier. According to Greek legend the House of Atreus was cursed and the story of his family 'is virtually unrivalled in antiquity for complexity and corruption', according to the Encyclopedia Britannia. At one point Atreus serves Thyestes, his elder brother, the flesh of Thyestes' own son, whom Atreus had earlier slain. Welcome back Bill.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Cumbria wins first inward investment from Far East CUMBRIA has won its first inward investment from the Far East, the Northern Development Company and the West Cumbria Development Agency announced yesterday. Sammi (UK), a wholly owned subsidiary of Korean audio speaker manufacturer Sammi Sound Technology Corporation, is taking over a former shoe factory on the Lillyhall industrial estate near Workington. The Pounds 1.6m project, won against competition from Germany and Turkey, will initially create 67 jobs. The factory, due to begin production next spring, will assemble and manufacture a range of speakers. Of the 20 Korean manufacturing plants already established in Europe, seven are in Britain. Three of these, Samsung, Goldstar and Inkel, have settled in north-east England with NDC help. The NDC and WCDA hailed Sammi's investment as a turning point for Cumbria, which has been hampered by poor communications links in its fight for inward investment. 'It's highly important, it's a tremendous morale boost,' said Mrs Barbara Stephens, WCDA operations director. She believes it would stimulate further interest in West Cumbria from the electronics sector. However, she said that Workington's development area status, under which Sammi's project has been granted regional selective assistance, has since been downgraded to intermediate ranking under the new assisted areas map.</p>

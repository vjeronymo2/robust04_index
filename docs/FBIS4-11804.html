			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Will Washington Lift The Siege on Jordan </F> During April?"]    [Text] Since the negotiations on the Jordanian and other  tracks are scheduled to resume in April, the U.S. Administration  must reconsider its siege of Jordan. This is especially true  because His Majesty King Husayn linked Jordan's participation in  the negotiations with the lifting of the siege imposed on the  Port of al-'Aqabah.    It is true that President Bill Clinton yesterday affirmed  that the negotiations on the Jordanian, Syrian, and Lebanese  tracks will resume in April as scheduled. However, it is also  true that the continuation of the U.S. siege of the Port of  al-'Aqabah will obstruct the resumption of the negotiations on  the Jordanian track.    U.S. Secretary of State Christopher promised to take  measures  to assist Jordan in facing the siege. However, the U.S. stand  on the siege has yet to change. This U.S. stand needs to be  seriously reconsidered in a way that is in keeping with Jordan's  seriousness about stopping negotiations if the siege continues.  In other words, the U.S. Administration should respect Jordan's  interests and stop trying to harm its economy and trade by  continuing the unjust siege. The U.S. Administration should  realize that Jordan will not submit to unjustified pressures and  harassments.    The U.S. Administration should review its recent stand on  the  identity of Jerusalem and should not disavow its Arabism. It  should appreciate His Majesty King Husayn's historic concern  about the Arabism of Jerusalem. This is especially so since all  the Security Council resolutions on which the peace process is  based stipulate that Jerusalem is an integral part of the  occupied Arab territories.    Moreover, Israel's decision to annex Arab Jerusalem is  unrecognized by legitimate international bodies, leb by the  Security Council itself.    The U.S. Administration is fully aware of the burdens Jordan  has been shouldering as a result of the Gulf crisis and the  serious economic and social losses it has been suffering on all  levels.    However, instead of compensating Jordan for its large  losses,  the U.S. Administration continued the siege, with the intention  of causing more harm to its economy and trade. The U.S.  Administration is doing this in an attempt to force Jordan to  abandon the constants of its principled stands.</p>

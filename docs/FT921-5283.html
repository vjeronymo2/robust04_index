			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Vance mission to calm Bosnia tensions MR Cyrus Vance, the United Nations special envoy, yesterday returned to Yugoslavia in an emergency mission to calm ethnic tensions among the three main national groups in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Mr Vance's mission follows a weekend referendum in which Moslems and Croats, who make up 71 per cent of the population, voted to break away from Yugoslavia. The remainder, Serbs, refuse to leave the remnants of the Yugoslav federation. Mr Vance was expected to arrive in Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia, today after meeting Serbian and Yugoslav army leaders in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital. Sarajevo was designated the headquarters for UN peacekeepers, but many fear the tensions in Bosnia could jeopardise the UN initiative to despatch 14,000 peacekeepers to neighbouring Croatia. Barricades have been erected, intermittently disrupting Sarajevo, as well as Visoko, Pale and Romanija, predominantly Serb villages outside the capital. But federal armoured vehicles yesterday rumbled through the city to prevent militants from blocking main roads. Joint police and army patrols were part of the peace agreement reached late on Tuesday night which staved off the threat of open warfare between Serbs and Moslems. A statement yesterday from the Serb headquarters, however, said: 'People here have lost faith in the possibility of a political agreement with the Moslem people.' In northern Bosnia an agreement yesterday between Serb and Croat political parties was reported to have halted fighting in Bosanski Brod, where 60 mortar bombs hit the town in an overnight attack. The 33,000 population of the town, which borders Croatia, is 41 per cent Croat and 33 per cent Serb. Most spent Tuesday night in underground shelters. Radio Sarajevo reported two people were killed on Tuesday night in Gacko, southern Bosnia. The Commonwealth of Independent States, itself beset by ethnic turbulence, has decided to send 900 volunteers to join UN peacekeeping forces in Yugoslavia, Leyla Boulton writes from Moscow. Colonel Viktor Loginov, an, Afghan veteran, will command the infantry battalion made up of elite paratroopers.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / International Company News: Pricing crucial for Credito Italiano - Prospects for Italy's first big privatisation At 4pm this afternoon, potential shareholders in Credito Italiano, Italy's seventh biggest bank, will learn how much the government expects them to pay for the 840m shares being put on the block in the country's first big privatisation. Making the Credito Italiano flotation a cast-iron success is essential for the credibility of Italy's long-delayed privatisation programme. A keen price for Credito Italiano is a must for many reasons. In spite of the L10bn (Dollars 5.8m) advertising budget and an unprecedented selling campaign, next Monday's opening day of the flotation is far from ideally timed in view of the difficulties facing the bank and the Italian economy. This year will be one of the toughest on record for the banking sector. Analysts expect heavy provisions on loans to recession-hit industry and a squeeze on margins because of falling interest rates. Large rises in fee-related income thanks to the buoyant stock and bond markets will counter the impact, but profits will remain subdued. Credito Italiano is heavily exposed to some of Italy's most serious corporate crises, notably Ferruzzi, as well other prominent rescue candidates. Ominously, the draft prospectus warns: 'Provisions for possible loan losses in 1993 will be much higher than in 1992 and exceed amounts deductable for tax purposes.' The less than ideal timing, coming before even preliminary 1993 figures for the bank are released, is accentuated by the turbulent political climate. Next week, the sparks are likely to fly in Rome as parliament gets to grips with the 1994 budget. General elections are expected to follow before long. The poll, forecast for early next year, will mark a crucial step towards the renewal of Italy's political class, largely discredited by corruption scandals. In the meantime, the stock market will remain a hostage to any of a thousand imponderables on the political front. Credito Italiano's privatisation is also a pace-setter for other deals over the next two years. In February, the treasury is to sell up to 30 per cent of Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the Rome-based financial services group. That will be followed within weeks by the flotation of IRI's majority stake in Banca Commerciale Italiana, another big bank, and by a first tranche of the Ina state insurance group. If all goes to plan, 1994 will close with the privatisation of a stake in the Enel electricity generating authority. This week, the treasury appointed Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, and Merrill Lynch of the US as global co-ordinators for the deal. The year after should see the privatisation of the Stet telecommunications group and most of the energy assets of the Eni energy and chemicals concern. A successful sale of Credito Italiano's shares would set the tone for subsequent transactions. 'If investors find themselves with a tidy premium, they'll obviously be more likely to put up money for the other deals,' notes one experienced UK public relations man advising the treasury. By contrast, a flop would cast a shadow over the entire privatisation process. Many investors recall the March 1992 flotation of an initial 20 per cent of Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the big Turin bank. After trading briefly at a premium, the shares soon fell below the issue price and have not recovered since. The need for a success is accentuated by Italy's extremely tight timetable for privatisation. IMI is due to make its debut barely two months after Credito Italiano and BCI will follow within weeks. 'Investors will have to have exceptionally short memories to prevent them being influenced by a Credito Italiano flop. The treasury has got very little margin for error,' says one Milan analyst. To some extent, matters are outside the government's control. The political scenario is so strewn with potential booby-traps that trying to steer round them appears pointless to many. Further signs of polarisation in voting patterns in Sunday's mayorial run-off elections; a surge in support for the neo-fascist MSI party; or inflammatory statements from the autonomist Northern Leagues could all give investors a fright and set the bourse tumbling. At least Mr Achille Occhetto, leader of the Democratic Party of the Left, (the former Communists), which performed strongly in last month's partial municipal elections, has pledged to support the government in getting the 1994 budget through parliament. Given the risks, the treasury may veer towards generosity in pricing Credito Italiano. This week, the marketing machine has moved into full swing, with plentiful hints that the offer will be oversubscribed. Were Italy on its 10th privatisation, ministers could afford to be tough on pricing. In the circumstances, discretion may be the better part of valour.</p>

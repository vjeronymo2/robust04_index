			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Surikov from the "Current Event and </F> Commentary" program]    [Text] Listeners: The Western mass media reported over  the weekend that Russia is arming Korea [DPRK] and has sold 40  submarines to them. What is the true story? Here is a  commentary by station commentator Surikov.    First of all, it should be noted that arms sales are now one  of the major export items of many countries. Commercial arms  supplies should not be a cause for surprise. Russia's submarine  sales to Korea are nothing but scrap metal. The intermediary in  this purely commercial deal is a Japanese company. The  company's general manager (Shibata) told ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY:  Last October Russia sold three submarines, which had long been  decommissioned and scrapped, to Korea. The submarines carried  no weapons whatsoever. Pyongyang cannot use them for training,  much less for combat. The most reliable guarantee is that  representatives from the Russian Navy directly oversaw  professional Korean workers in breaking down the submarines into  several parts. The Japanese company did not violate domestic  laws banning indirect weapons and military technology sales to  other countries.    Speaking at a press conference in Vladivostok, General  Gromov, commander in chief of the Russian Navy, said: Russia  has not supplied weapons to Pyongyang; nor does it plan to do so  (?in the near future). Selling scrap metal to other countries  is not a secret practice. Many scrapped and disarmed warships  and submarines are berthed in some Russian ports. (Shibata)  said: Korea aside, China and Japan are very interested in  buying such scrap metal. This shows that reports by the Western  mass media are only rumors that do not tally with the facts at  all.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: The week ahead When HSBC Holdings announces its results on Monday, there will be strong interest in the dividend level. The poor reception of National Westminster bank's results last week was attributed partly to the fact that NatWest raised its dividend only 6 per cent compared with a 20 per cent rise at Lloyds bank. Analysts are expecting a rise of a third in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.3bn, against Pounds 1.71bn. Midland is expected to more than double last year's Pounds 315m profit. Without the exposure to past bad debts from corporate lending, Abbey National is likely on Tuesday to show a steadier increase in pre-tax profits for 1993 than the UK's other banks - to about Pounds 700m (Pounds 564m). Most attention will focus on the dividend increase, which some analysts are expecting to be generous because of Abbey's strong capital ratios. GKN, the engineering and industrial services group, is expected to report a 20 per cent decline in profits for 1993 on Wednesday. The group hinted at the Pounds 97m (Pounds 121.8m) pre-tax figure three weeks ago when it launched its contested Pounds 497m bid for Westland, the UK's only helicopter manufacturer. Sir David Lees, GKN chairman, has blamed the decline on redundancy and restructuring costs of some Pounds 20m and an exceptional Pounds 11m charge covering closure costs at UES, the group's associated steel company. The sharp upturn in the new car market should help both T. Cowie and Henlys Group, two motor distributors which report their full-year results this week. Cowie, which also operates a sizeable vehicle leasing business, is expected on Wednesday to post pre-tax profits of about Pounds 33m (Pounds 24.3m). Full-year pre-tax profits for Henlys (due on Friday) of about Pounds 6.3m are expected, against a Pounds 848,000 loss. Zeneca's full-year results on Thursday, the first since the demerger last summer from ICI, have already been foreshadowed by a trading statement in January. The company should see pre-tax profits at close to Pounds 650m compared with a pro forma Pounds 442m last year. Its attractiveness to yield-minded investors should be consolidated with a dividend of 27.5p giving the shares a yield of 4.6 per cent. Associated British Ports, also reporting on Thursday, is expected to rebound from last year's Pounds 36.6m pre-tax loss - recorded after Pounds 83.6m of property provisions - to show a full-year profit of at least Pounds 60m. Results on Friday from Cookson Group, the specialist industrial materials company, should provide solid evidence of the state of recovery in both the UK and the US. Excluding a Pounds 5.5m exceptional gain on disposals announced at the interim stage, full-year pre-tax profits of between Pounds 90m and Pounds 95m are expected, against 1992's Pounds 72.5m total.</p>

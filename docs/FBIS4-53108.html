			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Indonesia and New Zealand have agreed that New  Zealand deputies need to visit Indonesia. Minister and State  Secretary Murdiono said this when he briefed reporters on the  results of talks between President Suharto and Prime Minister  Jim Bolger in Jakarta this morning. He said the two leaders  agreed that such visits would be beneficial. The minister said  Bolger did not bring a petition on East Timor from New Zealand  deputies. The prime minister simply asked the president about  East Timor. Suharto said the East Timor people had decided to  be part of Indonesia. Any resistance to the East Timor people's  strong wish to remain part of Indonesia will be categorized as  an act to undermine national security.    According to Murdiono, the two leaders also touched on  matters to be discussed by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  [APEC] forum.

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Compaq to unveil range of cheaper computers COMPAQ, the US computer maker, will today unveil low-priced desktop and notebook personal computers, as it revamps its product and marketing strategy to regain momentum against cheap 'clone' makers. Compaq will also slash the prices of several products by up to 30 per cent. Competitors are expected to follow suit in this latest round of the personal computer price war. Throughout the 1980s, Compaq grew by offering leading-edge personal computer technology at a premium price. However, market share has declined over the past two years. Last October, after a reshuffle in which Mr Rod Canion, president and chief executive and a co-founder of the company was replaced, Compaq announced it would offer products that competed on price rather than features. Today, Compaq will unveil the ProLinea line of desktop personal computers aimed at the under Dollars 2,000 (Pounds 1,098) segment of the market, which represents more than 50 per cent of all desktop personal computers sold in the US. US prices start at Dollars 899 for a 386SX model with a 40MB hard drive and 2MB of internal memory, and range up to Dollars 1,899 for a 486DX model with 120MB hard drive and 4MB of internal memory. The new notebook computers, called the Contura line, come in two models with US prices ranging from Dollars 1,700 to Dollars 2,500.</p>

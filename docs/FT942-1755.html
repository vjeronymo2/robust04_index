			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Telegraph cuts price to 30p in fight with Times Mr Conrad Black declared war in Britain's broadsheet newspaper market last night by cutting the weekday cover price of the Daily Telegraph from 48p to 30p. The move brings the price of the newspaper down to that of The Times, which was reduced to 30p in September. 'This is war and no one goes to war in other than a sober mood but we are market leader and we will protect our position,' said Mr Black, the Telegraph's chairman. Last night, The Independent reacted by cutting the price of the newspaper from 50p to 20p - but for today only. It said it would review pricing policy. The Telegraph's retaliation came after 10 months of insisting it would not match the price of The Times. But in April the Telegraph's circulation dipped below 1m for the first time in more than 40 years. There was a further fall in May to 993,395 as The Times reached record sales of 515,000. Mr Black said Telegraph sales were now above 1m but he was not 'going to sit like a suet pudding' and allow any competitor to attack his share of the market. The move will cost the Daily Telegraph Pounds 40m in a full year, and Mr Black admitted there would be an effect on profits 'for some years', although much of the cost would be offset by cost-cutting and tax relief. The board said it intended to maintain current dividend levels. Less than two weeks ago, Mr Black told the annual meeting of Hollinger, whose interests include 57 per cent of the Telegraph group, that circulation of the Daily and Sunday Telegraph was 'quite satisfactory' in spite of cut-price competition. But he said he would consider 'remedial action' if The Times' circulation rose to more than half that of the Telegraph. The price of the Saturday edition and the Sunday Telegraph will remain at 70p each, although the group has a weekend offer of the two for Pounds 1. Mr Max Hastings, editor-in-chief of the Telegraph said: 'The Daily Telegraph readers have remained extremely loyal, with 96 per cent continuing to purchase the paper despite the dramatic price cutting activities elsewhere.' Mr Black said last night that when Hollinger sold Telegraph shares worth Pounds 73m on May 20 he had no intention of cutting the paper's price, but May circulation figures had changed his mind.

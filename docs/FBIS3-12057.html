			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Our America" commentary by Manolo Ortega from the "Evening </F> Information Review" newscast]    [Text] The shots that ended the life of Luis Donaldo  Colosio, presidential candidate of the Institutional  Revolutionary Party [PRI] in Mexico, thwarted the plans of a  young politician who -- everything seems to indicate -- did not  randomly select the poorest neighborhood in the border city of  Tijuana to stage a political event in which he would explain his  main government proposals. No one will ever be able to criticize  or applaud Colosio in the future because no one will know if the  words which were virtually his last might have come true: "I  want to be president because I want to support the most needy in  my country."    Thus far, while the incredible and forever debatable theory  of a lone assassin makes the rounds, Colosio's death has upset  Mexico's political panorama, cast a gloomy shadow over Carlos  Salinas de Gortari's administration, and created uncertainty  regarding who will be the next presidential candidate for the  party that has been in power for more than 50 years in Mexico.    The assassination has shocked the entire world but it has  devastated Mexico because, emotions aside, it has created an air  of instability with regard to the 21 August elections when  approximately 50 million Mexicans will elect a new president  under turbulent social conditions.    Carefully selected, Colosio graduated in 1972 from the  Monterrey Technological Institute and studied regional  development and urban economy at the post-graduate level at the  University of Pennsylvania. He was an academic researcher in  Austria and in Mexico he taught classes at several institutions.  After Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office, Colosio was  appointed president of the PRI, thus becoming one of the party's  youngest leaders. Colosio was also a senator for Sonora State,  secretary of urban development and ecology, and later secretary  of social development, the post he held until he was appointed  PRI presidential candidate in November, 1993.    Colosio's campaign encountered no problems at the outset but  following the Zapatist National Liberation Army's uprising on  New Year's day, he was widely criticized by the opposition and  factions in his own party for his alleged failure to speak out  against the crisis and because his team of advisers was  perceived as weak. It has always been said that Manuel Camacho  Solis, a former Federal District mayor and former foreign  minister, was Colosio's chief rival. Quite recently, however,  Camacho publicly relinquished his presidential ambitions, which  is why the slain PRI candidate seemed to have a clear path to  the presidency unless another party won.    The dramatic void created by Colosio's death has the PRI in  suspense because it must appoint a new presidential candidate.  Many people have mentioned Ernesto Zedillo as a possible  candidate -- totally dismissing Camacho Solis -- a former  education minister, a brilliant economist, and also a former  budget minister, [the latter] a position that had been held by  Mexico's last two presidents, Miguel de la Madrid and Carlos  Salinas de Gortari prior to their election. Nevertheless, some  analysts believe Zedillo is not the politician the PRI needs at  this time; they need someone who is capable of dealing with a  growing wave of popular discontent as well as with the as yet  unresolved conflict in the southern State of Chiapas.    Colosio's assassination took place on the very day the  Mexican Senate approved legislative reforms aimed at making the  election process more honest. The reforms in question resulted  from a strong political struggle to make the elections as  impartial as possible, especially in view of the political  tension experienced in Mexico during past presidential elections.    The PRI is in need of a new party spirit, new work methods,  and less bureaucracy. Colosio once said it should keep the  people at the core of its decisions, which should not be made  from behind a desk. If the armed uprising in Chiapas prompted a  radical change in Mexico, the assassination of the PRI  presidential candidate creates renewed uncertainty and  expectations which will not be easy to fulfill.</p>

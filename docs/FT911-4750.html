			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / The Finance Bill: Benefits from a wider definition - Debt and Equity THE TAX system distinguishes debt from equity in a variety of ways. Most clearly, dividends and interest are treated differently, both for the paying company and the recipient investor. The difference in form, however, does not necessarily reflect any difference in economic substance: fixed rate preference shares can look more like debt, and certain debts, such as non-recourse loans or borrowings where the rate of interest depends on the results of the borrower's business, can be more akin to equity. The different treatment of debt and equity distorts the financing decisions of companies. Having created the distinction, the tax system seeks in places to undo it, for example, by treating interest in certain cases as if it were a dividend. However, in its present form, the system can do little to counter the basic attraction of debt compared with equity. Related problems arise where special reliefs are available between a parent and its subsidiary companies. These enable the losses of one company to be set against the profits of another, dividends to be paid without ACT and capital assets to be transferred without tax charge. To take advantage of such reliefs the companies must establish the requisite common ownership. This is done through ownership by one company of a particular percentage of the equity of another, entitling the owner to that percentage of the dividends and assets of the other company. This is designed to identify the true owners of the underlying profits and assets of the company. Accordingly, 'equity' for these purposes does not include fixed rate preference shares. But debt may be counted as equity unless the debt is a 'normal commercial loan'. It can be important, therefore, for a subsidiary company to ensure that a third party loan qualifies as a normal commercial loan. If not, it may cease to be entitled to the benefits of the group provisions between itself and its parent or sister subsidiaries, as its parent may cease to own the required percentage of its equity. A change in the definition of a normal commercial loan set out in the Finance Bill goes some way to ensuring that genuine borrowings can be made on the commercially desired terms without jeopardising reliefs. Up to now, a loan was not a normal commercial one where it provided for the interest rate to fall as the borrower's results improved. Similarly, certain limited or non-recourse loans secured on particular assets were not regarded as normal commercial loans. Now certain of these loans will qualify as 'normal commercial loans'. However, the changes are limited: a loan where the interest rate falls as the business or asset values improve is 'normal', but not if the rate can increase as the business or asset values deteriorate. Similarly, a non-recourse loan secured on investment land is 'normal', but not necessarily one secured on other assets. The author is a partner with Linklaters and Paines</p>

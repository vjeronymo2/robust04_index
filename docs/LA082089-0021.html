			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LESSONS FOR STUDENTS AND PARENTS ON CAMPUS VIOLENCE  </P> <P> I read "Campus Crime Crusade" (by Beverly Beyette, Aug. 10) with mixed  feelings. I am grateful for the article but wish it had gone one step further.  </P> <P> In a month we are sending our youngest child and only daughter to a UC campus  so we need to know the extent of violent crimes on the campuses. During a  two-day orientation for parents and students in June, school officials avoided  the issue of campus violence and focused instead on academic challenges,  extracurricular activities and homesickness. Rape was only mentioned once; I  brought it up in the question-and-answer period.  </P> <P> Our daughter, faced with leaving home for the first time, will be alarmed by  the article and begin to doubt her decision to go away to school. Her needs and  those of the many students entering college this fall would have been better  served by a less graphic description of Jeanne Clery's murder and a more  thoughtful comparison of the incidence of violent crime on campus with other  threats to student safety -- alcohol-related deaths, suicide, AIDS, steroid  use. An accompanying column with a checklist of positive steps an individual  student can take to minimize the chance of becoming a victim of campus violence  would have given our daughter what she needs to develop a plan for action.  </P> <P> The painful experience of the Clery family shocks us into facing a problem on  college campuses. Many of us cannot wait for the universities to install new  security systems. We must begin by facing the campus violence issue with our  college-bound children and offering them the means to protect against it.  </P> <P> JUDITH CARTER  </P> <P> San Marino  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks in Creole] </F>   [Excerpts] On 21 April in Port-au-Prince, Haitian Senate  President Firmin Jean-Louis presented a bill granting amnesty to  the authors and accomplices of the coup d'etat that overthrew  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on 30 September 1991.  Jean-Louis' presentation, accompanied by about 10 other  senators, took place in a hotel of the capital in the presence  of representatives of the UN secretary general's Friendly Four  countries. The following is a report by Pierre Jerome Richard:    [Begin recording] [Richard] "The senators who are part of  the  normal Senate met the morning of 21 April at the Christopher  Hotel to propose an amnesty law for the benefit of those who  participated in the 30 September [1991] coup d'etat, according  to the senators' report to the press. Several foreign diplomats,  including Eric Falt, UN spokesman for Haiti; (Mrs. Elza Ocho  Campe), Venezuelan charge d'affaires; (Francis Fillol), Canadian  ambassador; and [U.S. Ambassador] William Lacy Swing were  present at the ceremony, which began at about 1130. Senate  President Firmin Jean-Louis opened the ceremony. He thanked all  the diplomats and members of the press who were present. In the  opinion of Senator Jean-Louis, this proposal is the key to  unblocking the country's crisis. Sen. Martinez describes the  contents of this proposal:"    [Martinez] Considering that the 30 September 1991 coup  d'etat, which involved the forced departure of the president of  the Republic, is an act provided for and punishable by law, and  this event gave rise to many violations that necessarily took on  a political character.    Considering that the legislative power lays down laws on all  subjects of public interest, the Senate has voted the following  law:    Article 1. The authors and accomplices of the 29-30  September  1991 coup, which entailed the departure of the president of the  Republic, are granted amnesty.    Article. 2. This amnesty law applies to all violations  ensuing from the coup d'etat, ranging from 29-30 September 1991  to the date of promulgation of this amnesty law.    Article. 3. Regarding the rights of third parties, the  victims of the acts excused by this law will have recourse to a  special compensation fund that will be created for that purpose.    Article. 4. This law will be published and executed at the  behest of the ministers of justice and the interior in the areas  that respectively concern them.    [Richard] "Sen. Jean-Louis hopes the international community  will continue helping the Haitian people in their struggle for  democracy." [passage omitted]    "This proposal, which was supported by 13 out of 17  senators,  was adopted by senators from many blocs within the Senate. Among  those who voted for this law are Julio Larosiliere, Herard  Pauyo, Turneb Delpe, and Clark Parent. At the conclusion of the  meeting, we noted the presence of [former] Sen. Reynold Georges  and Sen. Jacques Rony Mondestin, who were going to bring their  support to the plan.    ``During the ceremony, Sen. Jean-Louis asked everyone  present  to sing the country's national anthemn. This is how the ceremony  ended, with Sen. Jean-Louis, as master of ceremonies, inviting  the guests to partake of refreshments. Many of the participants  took advantage of the refreshments to give their opinions. Among  them was foreign diplomat Eric Falt:''    [Falt] We have been in a deadlock for several months. It is  a  proposal aimed at getting out of the current crisis. We can  congratulate ourselves on that. It is a step in the right  direction. Regarding the rest, it is first and foremost a  Haitian issue. [words indistinct] but as a general rule, we  think it is a step in the right direction that could unblock the  crisis.    [Richard] "The host, Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis, asked the press  to help him popularize the bill. The senator also said he would  take steps within the Chamber of Deputies to see if it would  subscribe to this proposal in the future. Pierre Jerome Richard  for Signal FM." [end recording]</p>

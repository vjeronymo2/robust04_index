			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (13): How to raise the heartbeat - The hilly city of Zurich and its environs provide plenty of opportunities for those who wish to take exercise - ranging from walking trails to skiing and wind-surfing In many cities these days, the better hotels provide guests with jogging maps and other guides to help them get some exercise while on a business trip. In Zurich, this would be largely redundant. The city is blessed with beautiful parks with well-marked walking and jogging trails. A fair portion of its streets is given over to cyclists and the surrounding countryside is ideally suited for day or half-day walks. Slightly further afield, the highest Alps beckon to those who have at least a full day for recreation. Zurich is also a hilly city, so it is possible to raise the heartbeat just by walking about or cycling. Good bicycles can be hired from main railway stations throughout Switzerland. For walkers and joggers, the park of choice is the Zurichberg, the large hill rising on the east side of the city, with trails of varying lengths well indicated, and a vertical rise from downtown of over 200 metres. Two tram lines (5 and 6) run to the excellent zoo at the southern edge of the park. For swimmers, there are two Olympic length public indoor pools, the Hallenbad at Sihlstrasse 71 in the city centre and the Club Intersport in Oerlikon. Most visitors will be impressed by the cleanliness, efficiency and swimming discipline at the Hallenbad, but locals feel it is less than immaculate and they complain about having to slalom around the idlers there. They much prefer the wider pool at Oerlikon where they can stay well clear of the layabouts. In summer, swimming in the Lake of Zurich is a treat, with changing rooms (Badanstalt) conveniently located on both the east and west shores. From November to March, a low band of fog hangs over the city almost constantly. By the end of the working week, Zurichers have had enough and head for the mountains to get above it. Visitors, too, may feel the need. Depending on the height of the fog band, you may not have to go very far. Sometimes, it is enough to take a train of the private Sihltal-Zurich-Uetliberg (SZU) line from the main station to the Uetliberg. Its peak is only 16 kilometres to the south-west of the city, but at an altitude of 870 metres, 465 metres above the lake. Trains run every half hour - more frequently in rush hours - and the trip takes less than half an hour. (This line achieves the steepest grade in Europe for an adhesion railway, 70 metres per kilometre.) From the top of the Uetliberg, there is a delightful ridge walk south about 20km to Sihlbrugg, with several opportunities to break off sooner and catch another SZU train back from one of the Sihl valley stations. The scope for full day outings from Zurich is much greater, thanks to the country's excellent train and Postauto (bus) services. Popular destinations start with Rigi, an 1,800 metre peak rising from the Lake of Zug to the east and the Lake of Lucerne to the west. A dense network of cogwheel trains and cable cars gets you to the top where the views of the Alps are suitably spectacular. There is plenty of space for gentle walks and several restaurants. Slightly further afield are Pilatus (2,100 metres), Burgenstock (1,100 metres) and Engelberg (up to 3,200 metres on the Titlis glacier), but the facilities and charms are much the same as those at Rigi. The Swiss Federal Railways offer special day packages from Zurich to all of these areas. In the winter, the railways also offer day trip skiing packages from the main station to nearby resorts, including Andermatt, Arosa, Engelberg and Klosters. The package includes a day ski pass at a ridiculous discount, making it among the few bargains to be had in Switzerland. In the spring and summer, motorcyclists flock to the many roads over mountain passes, revelling in the endless hairpin turns. Visitors can join in the fun, as the local dealers of the main brands are willing to rent bikes, fully insured, by the day. Wind-surfing enthusiasts go to the Urner See, the south leg of the Lake of Lucerne, which benefits from constant strong winds funnelling down the Reuss valley from the Gotthard massif. Boards can be hired on the edge of the lake at Fluelen from Surfcenter Jauch (tel 044-29-222).</p>

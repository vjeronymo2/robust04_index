			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Breakthrough offers the prospect of Dollars 230bn bonus Lower trade barriers resulting from the Uruguay Round of Gatt talks in Geneva would spur an extra Dollars 745bn a year in world trade in goods by 2005, a 12 per cent increase, and raise world income by at least Dollars 230bn, according to economists at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This income gain, which is close to other recent estimates by the OECD and World Bank, would be broadly spread among the 116 nations taking part in the round. Gatt's calculations, in a report prepared for yesterday's evaluation of the results of the round, relate only to cuts in tariff and non-tariff barriers for goods. They 'substantially underestimate' the likely full effects of the round, the study maintains, because they ignore the stimulus to world trade in services, the benefits from strengthened trade rules generally and the dynamic gains from improved business confidence and hence increased investment and growth. The report shows that even without the mooted tariff-cutting deal between the US and EU due to be unveiled on Monday the market-opening package for goods is already sizeable. Developed countries have offered to cut import tariffs for industrial goods by 38 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. For farm products the average reduction (after converting all trade barriers to tariff equivalents) is 36 per cent. The proportion of industrial goods imports entering developed countries duty-free would more than double from 20 to 43 per cent, and rise from 22 to 45 per cent for goods from the Third World. The Gatt report also spells out in detail the prospective gains for the 88 developing countries taking part in the Uruguay Round. It notes that rich nations are extending lower tariff cuts on products of special interest to poorer countries, giving an overall tariff cut on industrial goods of 32 per cent for Third World exporters (other than the least developed) and just 19 per cent for the very poorest. This largely reflects below-average cuts in tariffs on textiles and clothing and on fish and fish products. Textiles and clothing is the most important single export category for developing countries accounting for 22 per cent of exports. However, Gatt points out that textile exporters will benefit from the proposed phase-out of the restrictive Multi-Fibre Arrangement governing their exports to the west. Importers are offering to cut high textiles tariffs, now averaging 15 per cent, by 20 per cent. Tariffs on tropical products, an important earner for many poor countries, are being reduced by 42 per cent.</p>

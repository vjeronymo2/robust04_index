The reassurance from Cambodia's first Prime Minister Prince  Norodom Ranariddh came after Chuan, making his first official  visit to Phnom Penh, reaffirmed that Thailand does not help any  group not a part of the legitimate government of Cambodia. At  the same time, Chuan and his official delegation sought  assurances that Phnom Penh would protect legitimate Thai  investment in Cambodia while weeding out business people seen to  be exploiting the country.    Prince Ranariddh spoke to reporters after meeting with  Chuan.    "The meeting has made progress and smoothened our  relationship," Prince Ranariddh said. Also present at the  meeting was Cambodia's second Prime Minister Hun Sen.    Chuan told the Cambodian premiers that as Bangkok does not  want anyone to interfere in its internal affairs, it has never,  and will never, intervene in Cambodia's domestic issues,  especially as far as the Khmer Rouge is concerned.    Chuan's closed-door meeting with Prince Ranariddh and Hun  Sen  was also attended by Thai Defence Minister Gen Wichit Sukmak,  his Cambodian counterparts Gen Tie Banh and Gen Tea Chamrat,  Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri and Cambodian Foreign  Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut.    Prince Sirivut had recently demanded that Bangkok state  specifically which group, the Cambodian govemment or the Khmer  Rouge, it supported.    Thai government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said the  Cambodian officials told Chuan they were grateful to Thailand  for playing a major role in helping to restore peace and for  assisting in full reconstruction and reconciliatiun.    Both sides agreed to more direct contact in the future to  avoid misunderstandings from escalating into major problems.    An informed source at the meeting said Prince Sirivut blamed  the media for exaggerating his demand for clarification from  Chuan.    Meanwhile, Chuan asked Phnom Penh to take tough action  against Thais involved in illegal activities in Cambodia, but  demanded fair treatment and protection for legitimate businesses.    "Cambodia reaffirmed it had no intention of revising  agreements that Thais have signed with previous Cambodian  governments for any benefit.    "It reiterated it would honour the agreements," he said.    Chuan raised the issue at the meeting with Prince Ranariddh  and Hun Sen. Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan, Finance  Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin and Wichit Suphinit, governor of  Bank of Thailand, were at the meeting.    Chuan said there were some companies operating in Cambodia  without an agreement. But Phnom Penh had promised to discuss  some arrangements with the companies based on mutual interest.    Cambodia's Economic and Finance Minister Sam Rangsi said his  government would honour "good" agreements.    Chuan said this confirmation would create more confidence  among Thai investors in Cambodia.    Because Cambodia was still in the transition stage of its  reconstruction and rehabilitation, it had yet to set up an  organization to handle economic and trade issues.    Cambodia agreed in principle to a Thai proposal to upgrade a  temporary border checkpoint in the Sa Kaeo-Poipet area to  permanent checkpoint.    However Cambodian officials asked for more time to study the  details of the proposal.    National Security Council Gen Charan Kullawanit said  Cambodia  needed more time because it did not have enough qualified  customs and immigration personnel to man the checkpoint.    Officials are still being trained, he added.    Aphisit said the two governments agreed that permanent  checkpoint would boost trade and help each country to collect  trade taxes.    The meeting agreed to conduct more studies into the Thai  proposal to have 11 body to oversee the boundary, and another  body to coordinate border issues.</p>

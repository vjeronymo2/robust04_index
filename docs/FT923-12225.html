			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Receivers take charge of Beaver Group BEAVER Engineering Group, one of the UK's largest family-owned machine tool companies, has been placed in administrative receivership after losing a long battle for survival amid the global machine tool recession. Mr Tony Balding, managing director of Beaver and son of its founder Mr Victor Balding, has been made redundant, along with about 80 of the Norwich-based company's workforce. The job cuts, which reduce the workforce to 60, were made by the administrative receivers, Cork Gully's Norwich branch, in a restructuring designed to prepare Beaver for possible sale. The receivership is one of the worst blows for the UK machine tool industry in a recession that has claimed about 4,000 jobs over the past two years. It could lead to more vociferous campaigning by the Machine Tool Technologies Association, which has been lobbying the government for short-term incentives to boost capital investment by UK manufacturing customers. Beaver, founded in 1951, makes computer numerically controlled lathes and milling machines, and was one of the most technologically innovative of the UK machine tool makers. 'If we had made old-fashioned products in dark satanic mills for the past 15 years, we'd have deserved to go bust,' Mr Tony Balding said. Instead, the product range had been completely updated over the past five years, and two years ago Beaver moved to a new 100,000 sq ft plant. Mr Balding attributed the receivership primarily to the continuing decline in purchases of machine tools. The company did not have enough cash to support itself over the next two to three months, and its bank, National Westminster, discontinued its lending facility. Sales at Beaver fell to Pounds 8.6m in the year ended April, from a peak in 1989 of Pounds 11.5m. Mr Mark Shires, a principal at Cork Gully in Norwich, said NatWest had gone to considerable lengths to preserve the business. He said Mikron, the Swiss milling machine producer, was one of several companies looking at the slimmed-down business.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] When one reads police reports, one forms the  impression that Russian thieves are the deftest thieves in the  world. It appears that our correspondent in Murmansk, Valeriy  Anuchin, is going to confirm this. He reports that someone has  managed to steal nuclear fuel from one of the depots of the  Northern Fleet, situated in the outskirts of the city. This was  the kind of fuel used for nuclear submarines. Three uranium  rods have disappeared. They pose no threat to [people's] health  and the environment, and apparently the thieves knew this when  they were stealing the rods.</p>

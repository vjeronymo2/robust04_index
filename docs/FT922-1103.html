			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Rise in agreed home loans 'may not be sign of revival' BUILDING SOCIETIES pledged Pounds 3.21bn in new mortgage lending last month, 16 per cent up on April. However the Building Societies Association warned yesterday that the increase in loan agreements did not show that a revival in the housing market was necessarily on the way. It said the figure was still below the Pounds 4.07bn in May last year. Net mortgage lending completed fell from Pounds 1.3bn in April to Pounds 1.24bn last month. Building societies provided mortgage loans for 50,000 house purchases last month compared with 63,000 in May last year. Last month was also poor for savings, with net receipts at Pounds 179m, down from Pounds 212m in April. Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the association, said societies remained under strong pressure from other forms of saving. Because the housing market is so slack, building societies are reducing their level of borrowing on commercial money markets. Last month they repaid Pounds 273m of wholesale funding, up from Pounds 223m in April. The societies have made net payments to the money markets for three of the first five months of this year. House prices are likely to fall by 3.5 per cent this year before steady growth returns to the market over five years, according a study published yesterday by Charterhouse, the merchant bank.</p>

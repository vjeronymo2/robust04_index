			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / International Company News: Fortis and La Caixa join forces in Spanish market FORTIS, the Dutch-Belgian insurance and banking group, is to link with La Caixa, Spain's biggest financial institution, in a Pta23bn (Dollars 217m) deal to service the Spanish insurance market. The deal is the latest in a series of cross-border agreements between Spanish banks and north European insurance companies. It follows last month's 'bancassurance' deal between Axa of France and Banco de Bilbao Viscaya. Spain will become the third principal European insurance market for Fortis, which is jointly owned by Amev of the Netherlands and AG of Belgium. 'Our other European subsidiaries will remain and we will try to develop them as well, but if we are talking about a third large country with premium income comparable to the Netherlands and Belgium then we are now talking about Spain,' said a Fortis spokeswoman. She said Fortis and La Caixa, a Barcelona-based savings bank, would concentrate on organic growth in Spain until it matched the Dutch and Belgian operations, rather than looking for further acquisitions in Spain. Fortis is to pay Pta23bn for its share in a new 50-50 joint venture which will own 80 per cent of VidaCaixa, the Spanish bank's life insurance arm, and 80 per cent of SegurCaixa, the non-life operation. The balance of shares in VidaCaixa will be directly owned by La Caixa, and in SegurCaixa by Fortis. The two parent companies will also share ownership of AgenCaixa, the Spanish sales organisation. La Caixa, which is chaired by International Olympic Committee president Mr Juan Antonio Samaranch, has been expanding into non-savings business recently. Fortis said yesterday that it would provide the expertise in designing life and non-life products, while La Caixa would contribute its knowledge of the Spanish market. VidaCaixa's life insurance premium income for 1992 is forecast to exceed Pta100bn, and SegurCaixa's non-life income should reach Pta5bn. If two existing Fortis subsidiaries in Spain are added to the new holding company then the combined premium income there should exceed Ecu900m, (Dollars 1.2bn), compared with premium income of Ecu2.4bn from Fortis's Belgian and Dutch operations.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Price rises help Coats to 10% advance: Textile group pays its first foreign income dividend Coats Viyella, Britain's largest clothing and textiles company, yesterday shrugged off patchy demand and sharp increases in raw material prices by reporting a 10 per cent rise in first-half profits. The group's success in passing on price rises to customers helped lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 62.8m to Pounds 69.2m in the six months to June 30. 'We've been more creative than other manufacturers in passing on increased prices; we've recovered costs in the market place and we're on track to make further progress,' said Mr Neville Bain, chief executive. The group had seen signs of a strengthening recovery in the UK and continental Europe, which contributed to increased sales of Pounds 1.22bn (Pounds 1.17bn). Operating profits, however, were held back by disappointing performances in two core divisions - fashion retailing and clothing. Profits in the fashion business fell from Pounds 4m to Pounds 3m after an unsuccessful attempt to attract younger customers, while the clothing division reported reduced gains of Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 5.2m) after closing its south Wales uniform factory. However, in the thread division - the largest business - profits rose marginally from Pounds 45.9m to Pounds 46.1m and all other operations, except home furnishings, improved. The figures were also flattered by sharply reduced interest payments of Pounds 14.2m (Pounds 26.1m) following the conversion last November of Pounds 97.7m worth of its 7.25 per cent convertible preference shares. Mr Bain said the group would be paying a foreign income dividend (Fid) for the first time. Under the scheme, introduced in the last Budget, companies can relieve surplus advance corporation tax by paying dividends out of overseas earnings. Coats declared a maiden Fid of 4.375p per share, equivalent to a conventional dividend of 3.5p net - an 8 per cent increase. Mr Bain admitted that the move had been prompted, in part, by market criticism earlier this year of its third successive enhanced scrip dividend, which contributed to a 15 per increase in the number of shares in issue. Earnings per share, adjusted to treat the enhanced scrip dividends as rights issues at less than the full market price, rose from a restated 4.6p to 6p. Lex, Page 22; Market, Page 27</p>

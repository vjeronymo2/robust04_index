			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev said today Russia has consistently opposed any  air action in Bosnia and warned that violators of a peace plan  for the Bosnian crisis should realize the grave consequences of  such behavior.    Kozyrev made the remarks at a press conference here when  talking about the downing of four aircraft earlier today by two  U.S. F-16 fighters in the no-fly zone over Bosnia.    He said that as aircraft will inevitably appear in the  region  sooner or later, it has become more necessary to solve all the  issues in Bosnia through peaceful means.    Violators of a peace approach should realize the grave  consequences of their behavior, he warned.    Kozyrev said it cannot be confirmed that the aircraft shot  down came from the Bosnian Serb side because all the three  warring parties possess such planes.</p>

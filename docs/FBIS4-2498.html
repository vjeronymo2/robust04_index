			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Work report of the Tianjin Municipal Higher People's Court </F> by Zhang Bofeng, president of the municipal higher people's  court, at the second session of the 12th municipal people's  congress on 5 March]    [Text] Fellow deputies: The people's courts at all levels  throughout the municipality carried out the administration of  justice by earnestly implementing the duties imposed on them by  the Constitution and law in 1993 and scored new achievements in  accelerating their self reform and improvement. In 1993 they  received 38,656 first-and-second trial cases of crimes as well  as of civil, economic, and administrative disputes, which showed  a 4.15 percent increase over 1992. They tried and wound up  38,656 cases, which showed a 4.26 percent increase over 1992.  They handled 77,978 cases of petition letters and visits  written and paid by the masses. While successfully conducting  the administration of justice, they further enhanced their sense  of initiatively rendering services and continuously paved the  new ways of serving the reform and economic construction.  Through the administration of justice and their initiative  service they made positive contributions to safeguarding the  municipality's stability; promoting the deep-going development  of the anticorruption struggle; protecting the legal rights and  interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations;  ensuring the enforcement of the state macroeconomic readjustment  and control; and promoting the smooth progress of reform,  opening up, and economic construction.  <H5>  1. We Dealt Strict Blows at the Criminal Elements Who Had </H5> Seriously Endangered the Social Peace; Strictly Punished the  Criminal Elements Who Had Damaged the Economy; and Created a  Fine Social Environment for Reform, Opening Up, and Economic  Construction.    In 1993 the people's courts at all levels throughout the  municipality received 5,581 first-trial cases that showed an  11.13 percent increase over 1992. Of these cases, those of  serious and appalling crimes showed a 16.02 percent increase  over 1992. They tried and wound up 5,552 first-trial cases that  showed a 10.4 percent increase over 1992. Of 5,843 criminals  whose cases were tried in the year, 5,800 were announced guilty  and accounted for 99.26 percent in the total, showing a 2.7  percent increase over 1992. Of these tried criminals, those who  were sentenced to more than five-year imprisonment, life  imprisonment, and death penalty (including probation) accounted  for 28.63 percent in the total; those who were sentenced to less  than five-year imprisonment, reform, surveillance, and probation  accounted for 68.89 percent; and those who were exempted from  criminal punishment accounted for 1.74 percent.    A. We deeply carried out the struggle of "dealing strict  blows at crimes" and made out-all efforts to safeguard the  social stability.    The broad masses of cadres and policemen of the people's  courts at all levels across the municipality further enhanced  their sense of dealing strict blows at crimes and deeply carried  out the struggle against crimes. They emphatically handled the  serious and appalling criminal cases that had seriously  endangered the social peace. In particular, they persistently  joined in advance in the investigations of serious and appalling  criminal cases of murder, hold-up, rape, heavy harm, gangsters,  and arson, which were bitterly hated by the masses. They  carefully examined these cases as well as tried and wound up  them rapidly. They also resolutely, heavily, and rapidly  punished in line with the law the criminal elements whose crimes  were very serious. They resolutely gave heavy judgment or death  penalty to criminals who deserved to receive. Thus, they  reinforced the dynamics of dealing blows at crimes and  continuously maintained the trend of "dealing strict blows at  crimes". They tried and wound up 2,695 criminal cases that  exerted serious influence to the society and effectively  punctured the arrogance of criminal elements. In line with the  prominent problems of public security, they actively carried out  the specialized struggles and concentratedly dealt blows at  robbery and the damage of electric equipment. They earnestly  implemented the "decisions" adopted by the municipal people's  congress standing committee with regard to banning narcotics;  punishing the criminal elements of smuggling, making, and  trafficking in obscene things; banning prostitution and going  whoring; and strictly punishing the criminal elements of  abducting women and children. They also jointly with the  relevant departments actively carried out the struggle against  "pornographic things" and "six vices" as well as tried and wound  up 64 cases of luring and sheltering women for prostitution,  making and trafficking in obscene things, participating in  gambling, abducting and trafficking in human beings, and  trafficking in narcotics. They created a fine social  environment for reform, opening up, and the establishment of  socialist market economic systems.    B. We strictly punished economic crimes, attended to trying  major and appalling cases, and promoted the deepening of  anticorruption struggle.    People's courts at all levels across the municipality  continued to deal strict blows to criminal activities that  seriously disrupted the economy in line with the law and gave  priority to punishing criminal activities concerning state  functionaries who took advantage of their posts to engage in  corruption, bribery, misappropriation of public funds,  production and marketing of fake and inferior commodities, tax  evasion, refusing to pay taxes, and other activities that  damaged the prestige of the party and the state and disrupted  the socialist market economic order. In line with the  guidelines of the central directive on handling major and  appalling cases well, we prominently grasped the handling of  major and appalling cases well. We accepted 357 economic  criminal cases each involving an illicit sum of over 10,000  yuan, accounting for 35.9 percent of the total number of  economic criminal cases, and recovered 6.8 million yuan in  economic losses for the state and the collectives. Regarding  serious economic criminals, we upheld the principle of punishing  them strictly in line with law. Of these economic criminals,  30.41 percent were sentenced to more than five years of  imprisonment, life imprisonment, and capital punishment  (including death sentence with temporary suspension of the  execution), an increase of 9.41 percentage point over the  previous year. Courts at all levels across the municipality  upheld the principle of "first be resolute and second be careful  and accurate," strictly handled cases in line with facts and  evidences, applied suitable law to the cases, conscientiously  studied and understood the state promulgated law and regulations  on economic construction and the party's relevant policies on  the establishment of the socialist economic structure, strictly  distinguished between the limit between economic crimes and  miscalculations in economic activities, and properly handled the  relationship between dealing blows and protection; strictly  distinguished between the limit between economic crimes and  ordinary economic law-breaking acts; and properly handled the  relationship between dealing blows and education. Meanwhile,  they provided economic criminal clues for public security and  procuratorial departments which they had discovered in the  course of economic trials. In order to expand the social effect  in handling cases, courts at all levels across the municipality  extensively conducted propaganda on the legal system through  public trials, meting out punishment in the public, and  reporting by the press media. Since last August, the municipal  intermediate and higher people's courts successively tried and  meted out sentence for the case of Yu Zuomin of Daqiuzhuang in  Jinghai County, and the corruption case of Hu Fengming, former  manager of Guomin Hotel, and a number of cases that brought a  great influence to the people. Particularly, the handling of  the case of Yu Zuomin caused strong repercussions in society,  showed the decision and acts of the party and the people's  government in strengthening the legal system and fighting  corruption, promoted the in-depth and sound development of the  anticorruption, and received a good comment from all social  sectors.    C. We actively participated in comprehensive management of  public security and succeeded in preventing and reducing crime.    People's courts at all levels across the municipality  conscientiously upheld the principle of "giving simultaneous  attention to dealing blows to criminals, preventing crimes, and  taking temporary and permanent measures for solution," and paid  attention to the comprehensive management of public security in  the course of giving trials. While actively conducting the  struggle to "deal strict blows to criminals," they actively  coordinated with relevant departments to manage some areas where  public order was chaotic, selected some typic cases with  educational significance, and conducted open trials in places  where the cases occurred in an effort to expand the results of  handling cases. They held 315 public trials on various sorts of  cases, concentrated efforts on meting out sentences for 908  criminals, and allowed 7,904,800 people to listen to the trials,  thus effectively dealing blows to and frightening the criminals  and inspiring the masses of people to struggle against criminal  acts. We continued to strengthen juvenile court work,  unceasingly improved the method of "educating juvenile  delinquents in the course of trials and integrating punishment  with education," further implemented the measures aiming at  helping and educating delinquents, and saved a great number of  misguided youths. We paid attention to education on  implementing legal policies before, during and after the trials,  on admitting the crimes and serving the sentence, on urging  delinquents to receive transformation, and on tracking their  acts. We handled 2,572 cases on reducing sentences and  releasing criminals on probation in line with the law, and  succeeded in promoting education and transformation of criminals  held in custody. We did a good job in helping, educating, and  examining criminals whose sentences were temporarily suspended  and their punishments were exempted or reduced, and who were  released on probation, and succeeded in preventing criminals  from committing new crimes again and reducing the number of such  cases. Suggestions for conducing judicial work were actively  encouraged. Over the past year, 452 suggestions for judicial  work were proposed, 41 percent of which were accepted, and these  suggestions yielded fairly good social effect.  <H5>  2. We Strenuously Strengthened Economic Trials and Actively </H5> Served the State Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Policy and  the Development of the Socialist Market Economy    The people's courts across the municipality accepted 6,248  cases on economic disputes for first trial, an increase of 29.7  percent; the lawsuits involved a total sum of 1,047,120,000  yuan, an increase of 169.92 percent over the previous year.    People's courts at all levels across the municipality  proceeded their work from guaranteeing the smooth implementation  of the state macroeconomic regulation and control policy and the  establishment and normal operation of the market economic  structure and made special efforts to strengthen the trial of  the following few kinds of cases:    A. They carefully handled all sorts of cases emerged in the  course of changing the planned economic system into the market  economic system. The tried and concluded 184 cases on  enterprise bankruptcy, enterprise contracted and leasing  operation, enterprise cooperative management, and enterprise  amalgamation emerged in the course of changing the operational  mechanism.    B. They conscientiously tried all sorts of cases emerged in  the process of cultivating the socialist markets. They tried  and concluded 3,262 cases on purchase and marketing contracts,  bill disputes, and infringement on patent and trademarks, and at  the same time, actively and carefully tried cases of a new type,  such as cases on disputes concerning futures trade and listing  stock in other localities.    C. They promptly handled all sorts of economic disputes  emerged in the course of strengthening the state macroeconomic  regulation and control policy. Primarily, they coordinated with  the state to rectify the financial order, strengthened the trial  of cases on bank loans, and concluded 415 cases on loan contract  disputes, and recovered 40 million yuan in overdue loans for the  financial departments in line with the law. They  conscientiously tried 121 cases on contract disputes of  construction projects occurred when the state curtailed the  capital construction funds, and coordinated with the government  to readjust the capital construction items.    D. They actively tried all kinds of cases related to the  development of the rural economy. They properly tried cases on  rural contract disputes and safeguarded the responsibility  system with the family-based output-related contract  responsibility system as the mainstay. Meanwhile, they promptly  tried cases on economic disputes involving township enterprises  and promoted the development of the rural economy.    E. We fairly tried and handled cases on maritime affairs  and maritime businesses. Last year, we tried and handled a  total of 136 cases of this kind, an increase of 183.33 percent  over the previous year. Cases involving foreign countries, Hong  Kong, Macao, and Taiwan accounted for 35.29 percent of this. As  a result, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese and  foreign parties concerned were protected and opening up and  international economic and trade development were promoted.    In the course of improving the trial of economic cases,  people's courts at all levels continuously expanded their  service for reform, opening up, and economic construction.    First, economic dispute mediation centers were established.  Economic dispute mediation centers were set up at various  grass-roots courts in the municipality, the municipal  intermediate people's court, and the municipal maritime affairs  court. In line with the demands of the Supreme People's Court,  and within the scope stipulated by laws, these centers provided  mediation to economic disputes before disputes were brought to  lawsuits by following the principle of "being simple, flexible,  rapid, and efficient." As a result, economic disputes were  resolved rapidly. Last year, economic dispute mediation centers  throughout the municipality received a total of 2,100 cases, of  which, 1,500 were concluded. Through these cases, 150 million  yuan worth of economic losses were retrieved for enterprises.  The average time to conclude a case of this kind was one month,  and some of these cases were concluded within only several hours.    Second, help was provided to enterprises to clear debts  according to laws. In light of the problem in which some  state-owned enterprises and township enterprises in the  municipality were unable to clear receivable debts and thus  seriously affected economic development, many courts positively  launched the special service activities of helping enterprises  clear receivable debts, thus promoting the development of  enterprises.    Third, the joint activity of building the legal system was  tried. We actively launched the activities of building the legal  system together with some enterprises, positively propagated  policies and laws, guided enterprises to mediate disputes, and  helped enterprises perfect contracts, establish regulations and  systems, and train legal professionals to handle cases according  to laws. At the same time, enterprises also supervised law  enforcement of courts, thus helping raise the law enforcement  level of courts.    Fourth, the contacts between courts and economic management  departments were strengthened. The municipal higher people's  court established the economic dispute coordination office  together with the municipal economic development and coordinated  in a timely and appropriate manner, 40 cases that emerged  suddenly due to the forced freeze and transfer of enterprises'  funds on accounts by the courts of other localities. The  municipal higher people's court also received and handled 228  disputes and cases of various categories, involving 120 million  yuan.  <H5>  3. We Positively Conducted the Trial of Civil and </H5> Administrative Cases, Protected Legitimate Rights and Interests  of Citizens and Legal Entities, and Supervised and Safeguarded  Administrative Organs To Do Administrative Work According to Laws    People's courts at all levels in the municipality received  and handled a total of 23,070 civil cases of the first ruling,  of which, 23,304 were concluded. With the implementation of the  "General Principles for Civil Code of the PRC" and the "Law on  Civil Procedures" as the central task, people's courts at all  levels in the municipality comprehensively enforced the laws and  policies on civil affairs, improved the methods of trying civil  cases, and laid emphasis on trying the cases in the following  aspects: They concluded the trying of 2,571 cases on real  estate, 3,026 cases on debts payable, and 36 cases on labor  disputes that were closely related to economic construction and  the development of market economy, thus promoting the  establishment and development of real estate, banking, and labor  service markets.    Second, we meticulously tried and handled 11,857 cases on  matrimonial and family disputes and protected the legitimate  rights and interests of old people, women, and children, thus  making many families more harmonious. Third, we appropriately  handled 2,498 cases on damage compensation, land, and irrigation  works, safeguarded the legitimate rights and interests of the  persons concerned, and imposed sanctions upon the behaviors  running counter to civil laws, thus promoting unity and  stability and the building of the socialist spiritual  civilization. Fourth, we continuously improved the forms to  trying cases and gave full play to the role of persons concerned  in providing evidence. Some people's courts also tried out the  methods of "separating complicated cases from simple ones" and  "opening court sessions directly," thus improving the quality  and efficiency in trying cases. Some people's courts  established real estate trying tribunals to resolve complicated  or difficult real estate cases in a correct and timely manner.  Fifth, we strengthened the work concerning the grass-roots  people's courts and newly established six people's tribunals, so  that the total number of people's tribunals throughout the  municipality reaching 208. The vast numbers of cadres and  policemen of people's tribunals fearlessly and persistently went  down to rural areas, plants, and even households to handle cases  on the spot, thus providing convenience for the masses to take  legal proceedings. These cadres and policemen also positively  guided the grass-roots units to regulate and organize work, thus  resolving many contradictions and disputes of the grass-roots  units in a timely manner.    People's courts at all levels in the municipality positively  and prudently tried administrative cases. Last year, we  received and tried 161 administrative cases of the first ruling,  a drop of 2.43 percent from the previous year, and concluded the  trying of 161 cases. Of these cases, 39.75 percent had the  specific administrative behaviors of administrative organs  maintained according to laws, 15.5 percent had their original  penalty and court decisions canceled or changed, and 31.68  percent had their lawsuits withdrawn by persons concerned. As a  result, the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, legal  entities, and other organizations were protected according to  laws, the execution of functions and powers by administrative  organs were supported and supervised, and the building of  democracy and the legal system was promoted. In the course of  trying cases, we vigorously conducted the administrative  execution work. Based on the large scale and heavy task of  rebuilding Tianjin's dangerous houses, which gave rise to more  administrative disputes, some people's courts voluntarily went  deep to real estate management and urban construction  departments to conduct investigation and study and offer legal  consultations and suggestions for key house rebuilding projects.  People's courts also transferred some judicial personnel to the  worksites of relocation projects to accept and handle the  enforcement cases registered by administrative organs, and to  resolve the problems existing in the administrative enforcement  cases so as to protect the legitimate rights and interests of  the relocated people and ensure the smooth progress of key house  rebuilding projects.  <H5>  4. We Actually Strengthened the Work of Lodging Lawsuits, </H5> Appeal Against Legal Decisions, and Execution of Legal  Decisions, Thus Safeguarding the Fairness and Dignity of the Law    People's courts at all levels in the municipality positively  and boldly accepted and tried all kinds of new cases emerging in  the development process of reform, opening up, and economic  development and actually protected the concerned persons' rights  to bring lawsuits against others and to appeal against legal  decisions. We appropriately handled the disputes that tended to  cause disturbances and that were revealed by the masses. We  patiently attended to the work of persuasion and education, thus  resolving contradictions and calming down incidents. Last year,  we handled a total of 53,674 petitions from the masses and  mediated and handled 464 simple disputes. We strengthened the  functional role of judicial and supervisory departments,  persisted in the principles of seeking truth from facts and  correcting whatever was wrong. We conscientiously handled cases  of appeal, maintained according to laws the cases whose original  judgment was right, and corrected according to laws the cases  whose original judgment was wrong. Last year, we concluded the  trying of 1,520 appealing cases of various kinds, of which, 101  had their judgment changed completely or partially. As a  result, the fairness and dignity of laws were safeguarded. For  those who unjustifiably kept appealing against court decisions,  patient persuasion was given them to withdraw appeals and accept  court decisions. We voluntarily invited people's congress  deputies and members of Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference committees to attend court sessions as visitors and  to inspect cases. We also listened to their opinions with an  open mind and consciously accepted the supervision by the masses.    In order to overcome the "difficulties" encountered in the  implementation of court judgments, the people's courts at all  levels across the municipality adopted powerful measures to  improve the implementation methods and to expand the  implementation ways by proceeding from having people's courts  serve economic construction. The municipal higher people's court  established the tribunal last year in charge of implementing the  court judgment, thus, it straightened out the relationship  between higher and lower people's courts in the work of  implementing the court judgment and enhanced the guidance and  harmony over the implementation work. As for cases that exerted  great influence and encountered great interference and  difficulties in the implementation, these people's courts asked  for instruction and reported them in a timely manner to the  municipal party committee and the municipal people's congress as  well as kept the municipal people's government informed of them  in order to enhance the contacts with various circles and to  obtain their understanding and support. The people's courts in  some districts and counties actively launched a "campaign" in  this regard and emphatically enhanced the work of handling the  long-standing discrepancies in old cases that involved multiple  links and faced great difficulties. By fostering the concept of  taking the whole situation into consideration, they assisted  outside people's courts to handle 94 cases. They also upheld  the civilized implementation in this regard, put emphasis on the  style and method of implementation, overcame and resisted local  protectionism, and emphasized that no one is allowed to regard  the withholding of hostages as a measure in implementation. The  municipal higher people's court adequately mediated and handled  10 incidents in which outside people's courts came to the  municipality to deal with their cases by withholding the  hostage. It also actively handled the incidents in which the  cadres of the municipal people's courts were scolded and beaten  in the implementation work or in taking legal proceedings.  Thus, it dealt blows at the criminal activities that impaired  the performance of official duties by upholding and promoting  justice. Through the arduous efforts made by the broad masses  of implementing personnel, the municipality received 5,951 cases  in this regard in the year and handled and concluded 5,998 cases  to show a 3.54 percent increase over 1992. It recovered  42,514,800 yuan in funds involved in these cases.  <H5>  5. We Strived To Be the First-Class Court of the Country and </H5> Further Enhanced the Work of Self Reform and Improvement    A. We made efforts to strive to be the first-class court of  the country. The municipal higher people's court put forward  the fighting target of "striving to be a first-class court in  the country through efforts in the next five years," at the  forum of presidents of people's courts across the municipality  last year. Thus, it unified the ideology and understanding of  leading cadres at all levels and of the broad masses of cadres  and policemen. Thus, a new situation in which all courts were  learning from the advanced, finding out their gap, and  vigorously catching up with the advanced, gradually took shape  in the year.    B. We enhanced the construction of leading bodies. The  leading bodies of people's courts at all levels across the  municipality were generally reinforced and consolidated. A  large number of cadres who are in the prime of life, have both  ability and political integrity, and possess higher cultural  standards, were selected and promoted to the leading posts of  people's courts at all levels. The municipality vigorously  grasped the improvement of work style and ideology among the  leading bodies at all levels, upheld the democratic centralism,  defined the duties among the staffers of leading bodies,  enhanced the unity among the leading bodies, and upgraded their  fighting strength.    C. We enhanced the reform in the systems of personnel  affairs  management. In selecting and employing cadres, the municipality  paid attention to gradually introducing the competition and  encouragement mechanism in this regard and actively explored the  systems of personnel affairs management, in which cadres are  capable of both higher and lower posts and the survival of  cadres will be of the fittest. It also upheld the principle of  integrating the material interest with the administrative  achievements and contributions of cadres and policemen and  formulated the adequate criterion of appraising achievements and  the methods of awarding and punishing personnel. All of these  played an active role in awarding the superior, punishing the  inferior, and arousing enthusiasm.    D. The construction of contingents focused on improving  administrative honesty was strengthened. The education on  improvement of administrative honesty was vigorously  strengthened. According to the central discipline inspection  commission's five regulations on leading cadres' administrative  honesty and self-discipline and the supreme people's court's  circular on strengthening the improvement of administrative  honesty, we worked out and perfected the measures and systems  for improvement of administrative honesty, concentrated efforts  on consolidating the problems of establishing personnel contacts  cropping up in the course of handling cases, generally examined  the enforcement of laws and disciplines, and realistically  solved the problems of not strictly enforcing laws. We strictly  investigated and handled 14 cases of 15 court cadres violating  laws and disciplines and actively corrected the practice of  accepting bail for probation. To stop producing new corrosive  phenomena and unhealthy practices, the municipal higher court  worked out and revised "several regulations on leading cadres at  various levels opposing corruption and advocating administrative  honesty" and "the system of responsibility for the wrong  handling of cases." The number 1 criminal court that won the  collective merit citation as well as some advanced examples in  doing solid and arduous work and making selfless sacrifice,  including the national court model Liu Shanlin, were commended  in a timely manner.    E. The improvement of professional ability and  standardizations was strengthened. Eleven training classes for  more than 800 cadres and policemen were organized. Through  vigorous investigation and study, a preliminary investigation  and study network was set up in the municipal court department.  More than 50 reports on investigation and study findings were  applied by the state science and technology commission, the  supreme court, the leading organs under the municipal party  committee, and relevant publications. The study on the new  situation and new problems relating to the judicial work was  strengthened. The municipal higher court convened 20 symposiums  of various types and worked out 13 documents guiding the  judicial work.    In the past year, although the people's courts at various  levels across the municipality made appropriate achievements,  some problems still remained. The major indicators were that  some leading cadres and judicial personnel were not suitable to  the development of the socialist market economic system in terms  of their understanding and law enforcement levels. Some cases  were not handled in a high quality manner and longer periods of  time were spent on hearing some cases. The new categories of  cases and the new situation cropping up in the course of  developing the socialist market economy were not extensively  investigated and studied. Some weak links in the management of  contingents and the improvement of administrative honesty still  existed. The cadres and policemen's political integrity and  professional abilities needed to be further improved. These  problems should conscientiously be solved and improved in the  future.    Fellow deputies:    Along with the setup of the socialist market economic system  and the socialist legal system, a large number of new laws will  be formulated this year. There will be increasingly more cases  to be directly heard by the people's courts. The judicial work  tasks will become heavier. The people's courts at various  levels across the municipality should take Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building a socialism with Chinese  characteristics as a guidance; conscientiously implement the  guidelines of the national political and legal work conference,  the national meeting of higher court presidents, and the second  (enlarged) plenary session of the sixth municipal party  committee; further strengthen and reform the people's court work  to meet the requirements for setting up the socialist market  economic system; persist in the strategic principle of "taking a  two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough;"  strictly enforce laws; improve the law enforcement levels; go  all out to maintain social stability; promote the improvement of  administrative honesty; and provide legal guarantees and service  for speeding up the municipality's reform, opening up, and  modernization.    In the new year, the people's courts at various levels  across  the municipality should closely rely on the leadership of the  party committees at various levels, consciously accept  supervision by the people's congresses and the masses, do their  duties, bravely do pioneering work, work arduously, strive to be  first-grade courts in the country, bring into full play the  trial functions, and make new contributions to stabilizing  society and accelerating the municipality's reform, opening up,  and economic construction.</p>

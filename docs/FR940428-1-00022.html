			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While programmatic rangeland management direction is made in forest plans, proposed paragraph (b) makes clear that, except as otherwise provided in this section, a rangeland project decision would be required when site-specific activities that implement management direction in the forest plan are proposed. Examples of rangeland project decisions given in the proposed rule include, but are not limited to, maintenance or modification of specific plant communities or riparian, aquatic, soil, or other resource conditions needed to promote the achievement of goals and objectives of the forest plan; rangeland improvements needed to promote the achievement of goals and objectives of the forest plan; and authorization of livestock grazing, where it is suitable and appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A significant aspect of the framework for planning and decisionmaking as proposed in this rule is the streamlining and simplification of rangeland planning. Under this proposed rule, allotment management plans, currently prepared on an allotment-by-allotment basis, would be eliminated. There has been considerable permittee and internal agency confusion over how allotment management plans fit into the agency's decisionmaking and environmental analysis framework. These allotment management plans appear to create a middle tier of planning and decisionmaking related to rangeland management that does not conform to the two-tier planning and decisionmaking process used in planning for all other forest resources. By eliminating allotment management plans, the proposed rule would conform rangeland management planning to the process applicable to all other uses and thus, clarify when and where livestock grazing and livestock use decisions are made. While the agency proposes to eliminate the use of allotment management plans, the Forest Service still intends to fully consult with and involve grazing permittees and other affected parties in rangeland planning and decisionmaking as required in both NEPA and the National Forest Management Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is generally at the site-specific project level that authorization of livestock grazing is made and the site-specific environmental effects of alternatives are fully analyzed and disclosed. For this reason, proposed paragraph (b)(l)(iii) specifies that, where a rangeland project decision authorizes livestock grazing, the decision must also specify the maximum permissible amount of grazing use, the timing and duration of such use, and other appropriate livestock management requirements or measures needed to promote the achievement of goals and objectives of the forest plan. Further, paragraph (b)(3) clarifies that where a rangeland project decision has been made that authorizes livestock grazing, the timely issuance of the grazing permit is an administrative act and not a separate decision subject to additional NEPA analysis and disclosure. Inclusion of this provision is intended to avoid any confusion about administrative appeal points and to make clear that issuance of a grazing permit is not the decision point, provided the grazing permit is issued within a reasonable timeframe of the authorization decision and the environmental effects disclosed in the rangeland project decision are still current. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although a decision to authorize grazing use may be made in a forest plan as long as there is adequate analysis and documentation of the environmental effects, it is generally more practicable to make a livestock grazing use decision and disclose the environmental effects of grazing at the project decision level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the agency intends to move toward rangeland project decisionmaking at broader ecological scales, these project level decisions cannot be undertaken and completed immediately upon adoption of the final rule. In light of the approximately 4500 Forest Service grazing permits subject to renewal in 1995, transitional procedures are thus needed to guide the agency over the short term. Under proposed paragraph (c), the agency would utilize a screening approach that permits a smooth transition for the reauthorization of grazing permits and completion of rangeland project decisions. This approach balances the interests of permittees with the need for compliance with environmental law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraphs (c)(1), (2), (3), and (4) address the situations where a rangeland project decision to authorize grazing use does not exist. Specifically, proposed paragraph (c)(1) would permit the authorized officer to issue a term grazing permit for up to ten years on allotments where there is a current allotment management plan and where the NEPA documentation associated with that management plan is also current. This provision is necessary since in many cases there are current allotment plans that are consistent with forest plan standards and guidelines and are sufficient to guide rangeland management in the foreseeable future. This provision would allow for the smooth transition from allotment management plans to rangeland project decisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (c)(2) would permit the authorized officer to issue a term grazing permit for up to ten years based on an approved forest plan for allotments that are meeting, or moving toward achievement of forest plan goals and objectives. In this situation, the forest plan must contain applicable standards and guidelines that can be incorporated as terms and conditions of the grazing permit and the environmental effects of applying the standards and guidelines on the land must be analyzed and disclosed pursuant to NEPA procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, if the allotment is meeting or moving toward achievement of forest plan goals and objectives but the forest plan does not contain applicable standards and guidelines that can be incorporated as terms and conditions of the permit, the authorized officer would be prohibited, pursuant to proposed paragraph (c)(3), from renewing or issuing a new term permit of more than three years duration. In those situations where allotments are meeting or moving toward achievement of forest plan goals and objectives, paragraph (c)(3) would allow the authorized officer to issue a term permit of up to three years duration while the agency gathers information and conducts the necessary analysis to determine if grazing should be authorized or a different term should be established. Issuance of 1-3 year term permits in this situation would require disclosure of the short term environmental effects of grazing under the permit pursuant to NEPA procedures. This term permit provision is needed to prevent undue impact on operators who are in compliance with the terms and conditions of their permit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c)(4) addresses those situations where allotments are not meeting or moving toward forest plan goals and objectives. In this situation, the authorized officer cannot issue a new ten year term permit until a rangeland project decision and disclosure of environmental effects are accomplished. However, the authorized officer may issue a term permit for a period of up to three years until a rangeland project decision is completed. The term permit to be issued during this transition period must include applicable forest plan standards and guidelines and/or any other measures necessary to move management of the allotment toward forest plan goals and objectives. Prior to issuance of the 1&hyph;3 year term permit, the environmental effects of continuing grazing under the permit must be disclosed pursuant to NEPA procedures. This term permit provision provides for resource protection and prevents undue impact on operators while rangeland project decisions are being prepared. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fundamental to proposed paragraphs (c)2, 3, and 4, is the necessity for the agency to make a determination as to whether management of a given allotment is or is not meeting or moving toward forest plan goals and objectives. The programmatic direction in forest plans establishes goals, objectives, standards, and guidelines for management of the resources on the National Forests, including management of rangelands. Forest plan goals and objectives are designed to promote achievement of desired resource conditions on the land. Site specific projects implementing the forest plan must be consistent with forest plan standards and guidelines, which provide for resource protection in the achievement of forest plan goals and objectives. Under the transitional procedures proposed in this section, agency employees would determine whether management of an allotment is meeting or moving toward achievement of forest plan goals and objectives through forest plan and allotment monitoring and evaluation, allotment field inspections, other existing resource information, and professional judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

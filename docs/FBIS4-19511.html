			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ole Mathismoen: "Power Plant on Kola Is Cause </F> for Concern"]    [Text] Norwegian nuclear authorities are quite concerned  about the safety of the power plant on the Kola peninsula and  worry about a serious nuclear accident.    This last week Norwegian authorities have received two  bulletins from the nuclear power plant Polyarnye Sori about  small accidents. On 3 March the cooling system of one of the old  pressurized water reactors sprung a leak. Fifty cubic meters of  cooling water ran out. On an international accident scale of  zero to seven, this accident rated a two. Last Sunday [6 March]  another bulletin appeared: A steam leak and an increase in the  level of radiation was measured at reactor number three that was  then stopped. This accident rated only a zero on the accident  scale.    "Neither of these accidents was particularly serious.  Neither  of them could develop into anything big. However, there is still  cause for serious concern. They say something about the  situation in general at the nuclear power plant," says Ole  Harbitz, the director of the National Radiation Protection  Service.  <H5>  Dangerous Neighbor </H5>   When questioned about whether the situation is critical, he  answers:    "It is critical that Norway has a neighboring nuclear power  plant that is in such a poor condition. An accident might just  as easily happen tomorrow as in a week or in 10 years. I will  not be surprised if there is a serious accident at the plant,"  Harbitz says. Two of the four reactors at the plant are of a  type that Western experts think should be put out of commission  as soon as possible.    He follows the situation with Argus-eyed vigilance. He is  very worried as to safety. Employees have been paid only  sporadically this winter. Often months have passed between each  payday. Work morale at the plant is consequently poor. And money  for even the simplest maintenance work has been lacking since as  far back as September of last year. This latest accident is a  typical wear-and-tear accident in which parts should have been  replaced long ago.    "We are aware that there is a lack of money for wages and  maintenance. This is cause for concern. Signals from Kola show  that the risk of a serious accident has not decreased," Harbitz  says.    When questioned as to how great this risk really is, he  answers: "The risk is a product of probability and consequence.  Even though the probability of a large accident might still be  small, the consequences for Norway will be so significant that  the risk still will have to be considered large," Harbitz thinks.    Norwegian nuclear authorities have not received any urgent  appeals for technical help from the Kola power plant. "Moreover,  we should stick to the strategy of helping with repairing only  the most critical deficiencies, but not contributing to  modernizing the plant so that it will continue to operate. Maybe  we can hope that the present problems will lead to a more timely  shutdown," Harbitz says.</p>

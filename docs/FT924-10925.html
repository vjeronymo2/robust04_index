			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Mitsubishi suffers on sluggish sales - Japanese Electronics Company Results MITSUBISHI Electric, Japan's third-largest electric machinery maker, yesterday reported a 73.7 per cent plunge in interim parent company pre-tax profits to Y12.3bn (Dollars 100.8m), while sales fell by 4.5 per cent to Y1,178.9bn. In common with other manufacturers, Mitsubishi was unable to bring down costs quickly enough to compensate for sluggish sales. The company's heavy machinery division posted a 10 per cent rise in sales to Y266bn. However, industrial products and automation equipment sales fell by 9 per cent to Y242.4bn. Net profits fell 75.4 per cent to Y6.3bn. Mitsubishi said its net profits for the year were expected to decline by 19 per cent to Y24bn.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / The arts perform a dance of death: The Soviet heritage is suffering under free market pressures. Gone are the lavish subsidies and the bonds which lent excitement and discipline, pushing performers to the limits of their art RUSSIAN culture, the envy of the world during the era of Soviet repression, is now critically ill from the effects of freedom. In all the arts for which Russia was famed, the pride of setting international standards has been replaced by despair or cynicism. Already, it is too late to save some parts of the Soviet cultural heritage: for much else, the end seems near. But why should one care about saving the cultural heritage of a brutal regime? Did it not involve censorship of every production and KGB snoopers on every foreign tour, in every cutting room and at every opening night? Yes: but under communist rule the arts were also lavishly subsidised. Standards in music, dance and theatre were kept up and a big effort was made to spread high culture throughout society. The Soviet heritage was unfree but within its political fetters, a culture of great excellence. That duality helps to explain the present crisis and the nostalgia felt by many artists for the lost era of party control. Under the communist regime, high art was as well rewarded as popular art. Yuri Gussman, head of Russia's Cinematographers' Union and a film director in his native Azerbaijan, says: 'Directors making a film for three people were paid more than the directors of the most popular musicals. Some of them were good, some were terrible. Anyway, the market did not matter.' Now, looking back, it is said that oppression gave energy to those who sought to push their artistic boundaries to the limit, lending an excitement and discipline which today's formless freedom cannot provide. Indeed, before communism, most of Russia's great art was produced under a highly authoritarian system. Arkady Ostrovsky, one of Moscow's brightest young drama critics, says: 'Vladimir Visotsky (a famed protest singer of the 1970s who stayed just within the tolerated limits) played Hamlet at the Taganka Theatre. Everyone went to see him because he was saying something about our society. Now, the theatre is not shocking and no one wants it to shock.' Yet, in the first years of Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost policy, the intelligentsia was delighted by the progressive escape from censorship. In the late 1980s, before the failures of economic restructuring were obvious, it was a joy to see one veil after another whipped away: the publication of Anatoly Rybakov's Children of the Arbat (an anti-Stalinist novel written without hope of publication 20 years before); the performance of extracts of Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago on a Moscow stage - for which, with a shock, I saw a poster inside the Soviet Foreign Ministry in 1990. It was not easy at first. When the pianist Mikhail Rudy, who defected in 1977 in his mid 20s, came back in 1989 to play with the Leningrad Philharmonic, he found the orchestra 'glacial. . . they had not ever been able to talk to a political exile before, and they were scared'. Yet a year ago, he undertook a five-concert tour of Moscow and St Petersburg, as it had become, and recorded a disc with the same orchestra. Of the famous expatriates, only Solzhenitsyn has yet to return - and he is held up by his own doubts about the responsibilities which will be thrust upon him as one who has become an icon of nationalism. The composer Alfred Shnitke, best known of contemporary Russian composers, was once cold-shouldered by official Soviet musicology and attracted venom for being performed abroad. Now he plays to glittering crowds and is reverentially broadcast on Russian television. But in the third year after Boris Yeltsin came to power, the freshness has gone. Irina Miroshnichenko, one of Russia's foremost classical actresses and consultant to Moscow City Council on culture says:. 'These are the hardest of times in the arts. Much that we took for granted is now disappearing or being destroyed. It is so distressing.' In the theatre, provincial houses are being closed and those that remain, concentrate on popular classics, while seeking sponsorship from foreign and Russian businessmen. In Perm, the city's new business club sponsors a private ballet company. In Rostov-on-Don, the city's first privatised company buys favour by sponsoring the youth theatre and a bi-annual children's drama festival. In Moscow, the operetta theatre round the corner from the mighty Bolshoy is supported by the US Electra company. The Bolshoy itself faces the hard times in better shape than most companies: it can trade on its name, both at home and abroad. Although its performances, especially of opera, are said to lack the old lustre, it still puts on magnificent evenings - shown last year by its tribute to the Russian diva Galina Vishnevskaya, with endless encores and emotional heat. It has shaken free of the stifling embrace of Gosconcert, the state agency which arranged its foreign tours and the performances of foreign companies on its stage. Now it can keep the foreign currency it earns abroad. It has engaged the services of a British marketing group, the Sporting Partnership, which is installing a hard currency bar on the first floor, printing Bolshoy Theatre T-shirts, setting up foreign ticket agencies and printing a full colour programme. Most revolutionary of all, Alex Kilgour, who runs the partnership, has persuaded the Bolshoi to divulge its programme to the public at least one month in advance. The Bolshoy will survive. One cannot be so optimistic about Russian cinema. Although much of its output in the Soviet period was banal, it was at least Russian. Now, the cinemas in its capital show almost no Russian films: a recent count of 48 showed only three to be Russian-made; of the rest, 25 were from the US, seven from western Europe, six from Latin America and the rest from other countries. The films included The Great American Cheerleader Hijack from the US, in which has-been football stars kidnap cheerleaders and hold them to ransom; Sex Slaves from France, in which police uncover a crime ring which sells girls to rich Arabs; and Red Heat, also from the US, in which Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a Moscow policeman on the trail of Georgian drug smugglers with the help of a Chicago cop. Among the most celebrated of the contemporary Russian film makers is Stanislav Govorukhin, for his two long documentary films This is no Life and The Russia we Lost - alternately lyrical and angry evocations of a wonderful past and a diseased present. Yet The Russia We Lost played in one small cinema in Moscow this summer after its release, and then disappeared. Govorukhin's work, nostalgic and nationalistic, points to one direction for the arts in modern Russia - an attempt to rediscover the old Russian culture which was overlaid by the Soviet orthodoxy and is now being hounded into minority enclaves by commercial pressures. It is music, however which is in the worst predicament. Russian musical talent, especially pianists and violinists, dominated 20th century concert halls. Most of the artists passed through the legendary Moscow Conservatoire  -a place of frighteningly high standards and mystical discipline, where the best teachers led lives of deliberate obscurity, the finest of them never performing in public and eschewing a concert career for the craft of musical pedagogy. Igor Ketakic, a talented Serb pianist in his early 20s, now finishing his Conservatoire course, says: 'Coming here ten years ago, I caught the end of the great tradition - the tradition begun by Leopold Auer in Petersburg, going through Heifetz, Jankelevich, Perelman. (Laruissa) Glazaraova (still at the Conservatoire) was my teacher and she was one of the last greats. Now you can buy your way in and buy your way on, now you give a video recorder to the teacher to persuade him to take you. It is all lost.' Yuri Rozum, a Russian pianist now becoming internationally known after a period in which the KGB prevented him from travelling,says: 'There is a Russian school of piano and violin teaching which is quite distinctive. It set a standard. There is no question it is getting less distinctive now. We are losing our people abroad'. Rozum spends more time on the German and Italian circuits, although his home is a self-built dacha just outside Moscow, to which he commutes in a Mercedes. Some of this is simply Russia entering into world show business - with stars moving freely between the great stages. But it also represents a loss for the country, since the great stages of Russia are impoverished. The few stars who visit Russia are either emigres returning for a dewy-eyed tour, such as the Moscow Virtuosi, who now live in Spain, or foreigners coming for free. A recent newspaper article congratulated the Austrian pianist Leonid Brumberg, the Spanish guitarist Carlos Trepat and the Israeli conductor Itai Talgam for appearing 'without demanding high fees in hard currency'. But many who do come find as much chaos in the new artistic world as in Russia's politics and economics. What should have been last summer's premier event, a grandly conceived operatic pageant in Red Square lasting a week, turned into a fiasco. It was badly-organised, ill-attended and over-policed. Resentful Moscovites glared into a square one-quarter filled with foreigners barely attending to such superstars as Jose Carreras, Marylin Horne, Leo Nucci and Margaret Price. Omari Sokhadze, who conceived the venture, is still disputing the costs with the Russian and Moscow city governments. This is one of the malign consequences of freedom: the submission of what was formerly judged on political grounds to the sometimes harsher verdict of the market. Irina Miroshnichenko, in her pleasant central Moscow flat, puts it this way: 'There was censorship before, of course, but there was a lot of freedom to do the greatest plays in different ways. 'There was a lot of innovation, and every town, almost, had its theatre or even opera house. Now, everything is commercial. Some things should be, of course, but in art, not everything.' She has not escaped: she is building an apparently successful second career as a singer, with a Piaf-like number called Ah, Tak Zhal, or, in the French, Quel Dommage. Oleg Bakliashvili, another of Russia's best-known stage presences and a Russian parliamentarian, made the same point in parliament: 'Russian culture is on the verge of destroying itself. Having welcomed the market, artists now demand protection from it.' There is only a small literature or drama of the new times. The contemporary drama by Alexander Galin, Sorry, about Jewish emigres is one example, but a production of On Golden Pond by the US dramatist Ernest Thompson proved more popular with Moscow audiences. The American play's setting amid a wealthy family faced with the problems of age recalls the plot of the comically crude Mexican soap opera, The Rich Also Cry. This commands the largest audiences of any TV show from Brest to Vladivostock: the popularity of both reveal a deep need to escape to a fantastic world. For much of this century, Russian art was mummified in the socialist-realist forms favoured by Soviet leaders. It became less propagandist as the years went on, but kept at least a subliminal moral message and avoided themes such as criminality or overt criticism of the Communist party. Now the republics, including Russia, have begun a search, sometimes frenzied and discriminatory, for their own forms. This has often led them to kick out Russian cultural centres, as, for example, when the Latvian government closed down the famous Russian Youth Theatre in Riga. Despite the restrictions, Soviet art at the beginning of the century showed an extraordinary inventiveness, especially the plastic arts, walled up and covered over with pseudo-classical heroics and Gothic imperialism. Vigour and inventiveness was shown also by its finest musicians such as Shostakovich and film-makers such as Eisenstein, even though they were openly and humiliatingly brought to heel. But the first products of the new freedom, such as the films of Govorukhin, are dour and resentful, most brilliant when evoking loss and dislocation. It is unthinkable that such a fantastically rich culture could be permanently exhausted, but its recovery has yet to begin.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Demand from oil groups prompts services merger ONE of the most broadly-based companies in the world oil services business would be created by the planned merger announced yesterday between the Texas-based companies Dresser Industries and Baroid. The all-share offer by Dresser, which values Baroid at around Dollars 850m, was prompted by the growing demand from oil and gas producers for broad-based service companies able to carry out all aspects of an exploration or drilling project. This practice of buying services as a package, which according to Dresser accounts for between 20 and 30 per cent of the market, enables producers to hold down costs and shift more of the project management risk on to service companies. Dresser and Baroid said the services they offered were largely complementary, giving them a broad-based business able to compete with the industry leaders Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, and Halliburton. However, the combined company faces potential anti-trust problems from its prospective share of the drilling fluids market. Through Baroid and M-I Drilling Fluids, a company 64 per cent-owned by Dresser, the two account for more than 50 per cent of the US and worldwide market in fluids. Dresser said it would comply with any directions from the anti-trust authorities to enable the merger to go ahead, including the disposal of part of the combined fluids business. In most other respects the Houston-based Baroid, with turnover last year of Dollars 614m, two-thirds of it overseas, will extend the range of services offered by Dresser, which in 1992 reported post-tax earnings of Dollars 121m on sales of Dollars 3.8bn. Directional drilling and measurement-while-drilling services, provided by Baroid's Sperry-Sun subsidiary, and remote-controlled submarine services both extend Dresser's range. Based on projected earnings from Baroid next year of between 45 and 50 cents a share - from 24 cents in 1992 and a projected 35 cents this year - the merger would only marginally dilute the value of Dresser shares, analysts said. Few cost savings are expected from the merger, though Dresser said the reduction in central overheads would cut costs by between Dollars 12m and Dollars 15m a year. Meanwhile, the development of integrated service companies could lead to an overall reduction in revenues for the sector. Mr Jim Carroll, an analyst at PaineWebber, said: 'It's a very good deal for the oil companies: by getting one company to cover all the services, they can achieve big discounts.' Dresser shares fell Dollars 1/2 on the news, to close at Dollars 22 1/4. Baroid's share price jumped by Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 8 3/8.</p>

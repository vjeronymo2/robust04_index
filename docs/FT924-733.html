			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report GOLD dived around Dollars 4 a troy ounce in thin afternoon trade on the London bullion market after selling by a US trade house pushed the price quickly down, hitting sell stops below Dollars 335 on Comex. Dealers said the price free-fall meant players in New York had probably stood aside for a few minutes to gauge what was happening. 'No-one wanted to bid ..So it moved Dollars 2 in about 30 seconds for absolutely no reason,' one said. LME metals moved generally higher as an early surge by COPPER set off short covering across the board. But the pre-holiday markets were rather thin and price movements were exaggerated, dealers said. Chinese buying and dealer short covering gave an early boost to copper and there was also buying in expectation of Comex making an early burst above resistance. But when New York failed to follow through from its higher opening, the market turned quiet. Last three-month copper business was at Dollars 2,257 a tonne, up Dollars 27 from Friday. ZINC and ALUMINIUM also closed ahead. Compiled from Reuters</p>

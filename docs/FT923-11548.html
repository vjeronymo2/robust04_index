			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): System takes a fix on delays A new type of airport radar system called a Precision Runway Monitor (PRM), developed by Allied-Signal of the US, could help reduce delays caused by bad weather by permitting aircraft to continue to land simultaneously on closely spaced runways. PRM allows aircraft separation to be reduced safely because it provides increased accuracy and more frequent position updates by using electronic scan secondary surveillance radar. Allied-Signal's PRM uses electronic scanning to provide controllers with position updates twice a second, or 10 times faster than conventional radar. Allied-Signal Aerospace: US, 310 512 1656.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Lights, Camera . . . Cue the Speaker: Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said the  single line he speaks in Francis Ford Coppola's upcoming "Godfather III" is  "sufficient for my (movie) debut." The San Francisco Democrat spent a long  weekend in Rome doing a scene with Al Pacino. Brown was hired when Coppola told  the actor originally chosen for the part of a black politician, "Why can't you  act more like Willie Brown?" and then demanded: "Get me Willie Brown!" Asked if  his career is following the reverse course of an actor named Ronald Reagan,  Brown replied, "If I could be as successful, I wouldn't mind it." CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Power to the people - and profits, too - Now that the industry's regulator has delivered his judgment, Michael Smith analyses the prospects of the regional companies Shareholders in the regional electricity companies in England and Wales are used to good times. But, even by their standards, this has been a very good week. Following the industry regulator's Thursday announcement on what the market views as generous price controls, shares in the 12 companies rose in value by more than Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 15.9bn. There could be more to come - possibly much more. Even if the companies were simply to stand still and get on with the efficiency savings which the regulator assumes they are capable of achieving, most analysts believe that at least some of them remain under-valued and that the sector will continue to outperform the market for months, perhaps years. The companies are not about to stand still, though. They have a heavy agenda for the next year and most of it seems likely to enhance the value of their shares. Top of the list is the likely flotation of the National Grid, the transmission company owned by the regional companies and which is worth at least Pounds 4bn. One option is for shareholders to be issued with shares in the grid. Another would be to distribute money raised through the flotation to shareholders through a special dividend. Either way, they would benefit. A decision is likely in the autumn, with the flotation following next spring. Long before that, though, at least some of the companies will have followed the lead of Eastern Electricity in buying back its own shares to cancel them. With nearly all of the companies cash-positive already - and most, possibly all, expected to increase their cash piles after the review comes into force - buy-backs may enable companies to boost both earnings per share and the amount of money they can pay out in dividends. There is also the possibility of take-overs and mergers, both of and by the companies. But the City will be wary of any acquisitions the companies make outside the sector, given the patchy acquisitions record of other utilities. It would be more likely to welcome mergers between regional power companies, given the potential for economies. There is also a possibility of them attracting the attention of a conglomerate or an overseas utility company. The decisions of Professor Stephen Littlechild, the regulator, on Thursday probably will have more effect than any other single factor on the companies this decade. The distribution businesses on which he has imposed price controls contribute about 80 per cent of the regional companies' profits, and the review lasts for five years. There was no disguising the relief felt by regional company executives. In spite of public statements about the toughness of the regime, it was nowhere near as onerous as they had feared. Some analysts had, until recently, predicted cuts in distribution prices next April of up to 30 per cent, and increases thereafter limited to inflation minus 4 per cent in subsequent years. But the outcome was 11 to 17 per cent coupled with inflation minus only 2 per cent. As a result, virtually all City analysts were upgrading their forecasts for the amount by which companies can increase their dividends over the next five years. Since the yield of utility shares is one of their main attractions, dividend growth is a key indicator for investors. Estimates for real annual increases in dividends vary from 6 to 10 per cent for the sector as a whole, way above the stock market average. Average earnings per share, after an initial drop next year, should grow by at least 2 to 3 percentage points above inflation. That, then, is the broad picture. But what are the prospects for the individual companies? Although they were classified as three groups in the review, with different levels of price-cutting resulting, City views on how they fared do not necessarily relate to the group in which they appeared. This is because the price cuts take into account a number of factors, including capital spending requirements and treatment under the previous regime. Eastern Electricity's shares reached a record high on Thursday as analysts welcomed the regulator's decision to place the company in the group of three which must cut allowed prices by 11 per cent. After a poor start in the City's eyes following privatisation, Eastern's management under chief executive John Devaney is considered one of the best bets to cut costs and is on several brokers' buy lists. East Midlands Electricity was another in the 11 per cent group; this, according to one analyst, was 'the first good news they have had for two years'. Following problems over early acquisitions, the company has installed a new management which has rectified previous mistakes. But it needs some high capital spending; this was one reason for inclusion in its group. London Electricity had the biggest share rise amid relief that the regulator had, apparently, accepted its argument that its high cost base was justified by the difficulties of servicing the capital. The shares had been hit before Thursday because it was thought the company could have to cut prices by more than most. Manweb is one of three companies in the group which, on the face of it, fared worst because they must cut allowable prices by 17 per cent. But it argues that the review is less severe than it seems, partly because the company's prices are lower than permitted and partly because of the benefits accruing from the previous pricing regime. Although traditionally rated highly, analysts are divided as to Manweb's merits. Some say it can still reduce costs but others claim it is missing out by not diversifying. Midlands Electricity was in the middle group which must cut allowable prices by 14 per cent. Several brokers, including SG Warburg, say it is a buy, in part because of the number of provisions it has made which may be released into profits later. Northern Electric is one of three companies which will incur a 17 per cent cut in allowable charges from April. While it appears on few analysts' buy lists, the company's position is poor only in the context of what is considered an extremely favourable review for the sector. 'None of the shares in this sector should be sold,' says one analyst. Norweb is judged by most analysts to have fared about averagely and remains one of the sector's higher rated companies. It benefits from its plans to increase significantly the amount of money it makes from unregulated income, including overseas and retailing ventures. Seeboard was placed by Littlechild in the middle group, with a 14 per cent cut required in allowable prices. Analysts were split: some felt it had fared badly while others argued it had done well. But, with strong profitability and high dividend cover, it remains rated highly. Southern Electric is thought generally to have had an extremely good review. In spite of above-average rates of return on its capital, it ended up in the group of companies which faces only an 11 per cent cut in prices. Most brokers rate the company as a buy. Swalec appeared in the 17 per cent group and is judged generally to have had a medium to poor review. Traditionally one of the lowest rated groups, some analysts believe it has more scope to cut costs than most. South Western Electricity has been one of the main beneficiaries of the share price rise since the review's publication. It appears to have convinced the regulator that its high costs are justified because of the rural nature of the area it serves. Yorkshire Electricity was one of the first companies to accept the regulator's verdict, saying it was tough but challenging. Following a fall in its rating in the City in the past year or so, several brokers (including UBS) believe its shares are good value.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The kindest cut for electricity  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           CUT IN                         DISTRIBUTION COMPANY                   CHARGES             PROFITS &amp; YIELDS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Last pre tax     Current Electricity               1995/6           profits        dividend                              %            Pounds m         yield %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- East Midlands Electricity*  11               51.2           4.10 Eastern Electricity         11              176.8           3.89 London Electricity          14              186.5           4.36 Manweb                      17              126.3           4.04 Midlands Electricity        14              195.4           3.97 Northern Electric           17              128.7           4.20 Norweb                      14              178.3           3.95 Seeboard                    14              131.7           3.71 South Wales Electricity     17              104.0           4.43 South Western Electricity   14              116.8           4.11 Southern Electricity        11              222.0           3.97 Yorkshire Electricity       14              149.0           4.31  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COMPANY                       PERFORMANCE SINCE FLOTATION IN 1990  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Compound         Compound      Share price                          annual earnings   annual dividend  relative to Electricity              per share growth  per share growth   sector                                 %                  %            %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- East Midlands Electricity*     21.4              14.7        -2.46 Eastern Electricity            19.2              16.8         7.16 London Electricity             23.3              14.7        -6.80 Manweb                         34.6              29.5        -0.47 Midlands Electricity           20.0              30.2         5.93 Northern Electric              28.4              15.2         3.80 Norweb                         65.3              13.7         1.90 Seeboard                       27.5              16.8        12.82 South Wales Electricity        22.5              14.8        -5.50 South Western Electricity      24.6               9.6        -0.06 Southern Electricity           26.5              15.6         2.43 Yorkshire Electricity           8.6              15.0        -8.03  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *before exceptional costs  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: Company Accounts, Datastream  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 25 February, the South Korean puppets committed a  grave military provocation by firing a large-caliber artillery  gun against the areas on our side.    Around 1053 [0153 GMT] today, the armed rascals of the South  Korean puppet army, who were entrenched in Taeyongpyong Island,  fired a 155 mm gun against Changje Island at our side on the sea  off (Pokpo) in Kangnyong County, South Hwanghae Province.  Because of this, fishermen of our side, who were catching fish  in the area, were gravely threatened.    Such action by the South Korean puppets has not escalated  into an armed conflict between the two sides. This is totally  due to our People's Army soldiers' high sense of patience and  self-control.    The dangerous military provocation by the South Korean  puppets -- which was committed in broad daylight -- is a  deliberate provocation to lead the Korean peninsula to  confrontation and war.    We regard such provocation by the South Korean puppets as  even more grave because they committed it at the same time of  their persistent strategy and war maneuvers in order to crush  [apsal] our Republic, the socialist fortress, in collusion with  outside forces under the pretext of our non-existent nuclear  issue.    With a high sense of the revolutionary alertness, our people  and the People's Army soldiers are keenly watching out the new  war provocations by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean  puppets.    Because of the U.S. imperialists' and the South Korean  puppets' continuous new war provocations, a grave touch-and-go  situation has been created on the Korean peninsula. Therefore,  they must clearly see it and must not act recklessly.    Despite our repeated warnings, if the South Korean puppets  continue to embark upon the road of confrontation and war,  warmongers cannot avoid the stern punishment.</p>

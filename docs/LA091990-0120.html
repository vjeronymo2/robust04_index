Police reports allege that  Schloub sold an undercover detective a $100 ticket for a Super Bowl lottery and  accepted a $30 down payment from the detective in March.  </P> <P> Also charged with four misdemeanor offenses was Betty Lou Edmondson, a  bartender who is suspected of paying customers who hit the jackpot playing  video poker, police reports show.  </P> <P> McAndrew said he was not aware that he had been charged, and referred a request  for comment to his attorney, who was unavailable Tuesday evening. Schloub,  reached at the Moose lodge, declined comment. Bixler and Edmondson could not be  reached.  </P> <P> The charges are the result of a two-year undercover investigation by city  police.

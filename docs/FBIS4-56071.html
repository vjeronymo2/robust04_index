			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>   [Text] After yesterday and last night's bestial shelling  of Bihac and the outskirts of Cazin, the joint aggressors today  continued their attacks on the Bihac Commune. The chetniks are  using mortars and howitzers of all calibers to shell the forward  defense lines on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau and Grabez,  while on Hasin Vrh and Vrsak they continue attempts at infantry  breakthroughs. The 5th Corps members are energetically  resisting, and the defense lines remain stable. On the other  parts of the front, they continued using antiaircraft weapons,  while sniper fire and small arms' fire has intensified.    The members of Abdic's paramilitary army are also not quiet.  They are increasingly collaborating with their allies. In the  wider area of Trsak, Viskovac, and Todorovo, they haven been  concentrating fresh forces and hardware since yesterday, and are  preparing fresh attacks in collaboration with the chetniks. In  the course of the day, they have been intensifying activity on  all demarcation lines, using small arms, antiaircraft arms, and  armor-piercing weapons.</p>

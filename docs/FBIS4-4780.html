			<p>BFN     [Text] The government plans to send a team to China this  month to look into the allegedly desperate state of North  Koreans roaming around the country after slipping out of North  Korea.    The move follows reports that not a small number of North  Koreans live in fear of being caught and sent back to North  Korea.    And North Korean agents are said to be on their trail.    They are not protected by the Chinese authorities because of  an extradition pact between Beijing and Pyongyang.    According to recent press reports, it is estimated that the  number of North Koreans in this pathetic state comes to a few  thousands.    Most of them left North Korea to escape abject poverty.    Some of them carry poison to put an end to their own lives  in  case of arrest because this means an outright deportation and  subsequent capital punishment in North Korea.    Meantime, the National Assembly has decided to send a  parliamentary team to Russia to help with the fate of North  Korean loggers who deserted the logging camps run by North Korea  in Siberia.    They are also roaming around in Russia, hoping to escape the  reach of North Korea. Most of them are learned to be seeking  shelter in South Korea.    The South Korean government is studying ways of accepting  them because the Russian authorities are said to be ready to  help them leave Russia for South Korea.    But the situation is said to be a little different for the  North Koreans hiding in China because of the still strong ties  between Beijing and Pyongyang.    Notwithstanding, the government cannot turn its eyes away  from the terminal situation where the North Koreans find  themselves in, government officials said.</p>

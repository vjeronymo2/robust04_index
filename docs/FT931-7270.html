			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Keating's move MR PAUL Keating, Australia's Labor prime minister, yesterday set out his platform of new health, childcare and other welfare policies in a bid to hold on to power at next month's general elections. At this point such a record fifth term looks like a long shot for a party which has been 10 years in power, in a country with 1m on the unemployment register. Certainly, the indications are that the Labor party is trailing significantly behind the conservative opposition parties, with 42 per cent to 49 per cent in the opinion polls. The question which has yet to be answered is whether Mr Keating has improved his chances by his proposal to place the future of Australia's constitution at the centre of the election campaign. For some time Mr Keating has been advocating the idea that Australia should break away from its dependence on the British monarchy as head of state. Now he has undertaken to hold a referendum on whether Australia should become a republic by the year 2001. Traditionalists in Britain will no doubt be indignant at Mr Keating's republicanism. He has caused them to be indignant before, for example during the Queen's visit to Australia last year, when he appeared to touch her person when guiding her at a public ceremony. He has also sought to have the British flag removed from the top corner of the Australian flag, the Queen's head removed from the new ADollars 5 bank note, and the Queen's name from the oath of allegiance of new Australian citizens. The indignation of the traditionalists misses the fact that the republican debate in Australia goes back to the crisis of 1975, when the then governor-general, Sir John Kerr, dismissed the Labour prime minister, Gough Whitlam, on the grounds that the government's finances were blocked by the opposition parties in the senate. The crisis caused great anger in the Labor party, and fevered controversy over whether Sir John had the constitutional authority to act as he did. But the deeper question underlying the crisis was whether it was right that an action of that kind should be taken by the representative of a distant monarch. Australia's constitutional arrangements can only be satisfactorily settled by Australians, and if they were to decide that Australia should become a republic, that must be their prerogative. A referendum would be an appropriate method of clarifying the issue. Australians may well feel that the present system is an anomaly. Their country is a long way from Britain and has different interests. The essential case for constitutional monarchy is that it provides continuity, stability and non-partisan influence above the hurly-burly of politics. It is not obvious that such a role can be played satisfactorily by a governor-general who is notionally the representative of the Queen, but who is really a former party politician appointed by his own side.</p>

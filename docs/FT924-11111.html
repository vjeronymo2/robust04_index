			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Standards watchdog begins to bare its teeth  -Recent rulings by the Financial Reporting Review Panel underline a change in style THREE NEW decisions in the last two weeks from the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK's accounting standards watchdog, have each provided new lessons in the way the body is beginning to operate. Now entering its second year, the panel has issued 10 public statements on companies' accounting policies, including two announced on Monday against British Gas and SEP Industrial Holdings, a USM-quoted engineer. All but the first four have taken place under the chairmanship of Mr Edwin Glasgow, who was appointed in February. Some already detect a change in style since he took charge. The ruling against British Gas, and another concerning Trafalgar House earlier this month, showed that the panel was not afraid to tackle large companies nor topics which require substantial material change in financial figures. Demanding that British Gas present accounts for the nine months, after last year changing its year-end to December 31 rather than for the preceding 12 months, will reduce pre-tax profits by nearly Pounds 1bn for 1991. Amending Trafalgar House's 1991 accounts cut pre-tax profits by Pounds 83m and reduced shareholders' funds by Pounds 20m. Although it is a much smaller company, the ruling against SEP is also significant. The panel agreed with the qualification in the accounts by Bloomer Heaven, the auditors, that SEP's failure to depreciate some freehold property breached SSAP 12, the standard on depreciation or the diminution of assets. The auditor said the company should have made a provision of Pounds 89,000 and taken an additional extraordinary profit of Pounds 158,000 from the deconsolidation of a subsidiary to reflect depreciation. More important than the specific details, the SEP ruling reaffirmed the panel's belief that SSAP 12 should remain in force. There was a danger earlier this year that the standard might be seen as no longer credible or enforceable. In the only public statement so far that does not suggest a breach of accounting standards, the panel said in February that Forte had not contravened SSAP 12, even though it did not depreciate its buildings. The company did agree to provide more information in future accounts of its depreciation policies. The panel said the difference was that Forte had conducted valuations to ensure that the value of its property had been maintained or increased, in accordance with the requirements of SSAP 12. SEP had simply assumed that expenditure on upkeep would more than compensate any deterioration of its warehouses. But the ruling against British Gas raises the possibility of a new precedent. The panel said the company's action contravened the 1985 Companies Act but added that directors had not intended to mislead. That could provide an excuse for other less scrupulous companies looking for excuses. Most companies have accepted the panel's rulings without too much resistance  -although often after considerable grumbling and legal wrangling. For example, Mr Paul Curson, group financial controller and an associate director of SEP, believes his company's approach to depreciation was more accurate. 'We were very pleased to be treated so lightly by the panel,' he said. 'I support what the panel is doing, and the amounts concerned were not material so we accepted (the ruling).' Trafalgar House pushed the panel close to its ultimate sanction: the power and money to take a company to court and force it to restate accounts. Trafalgar was initially unwilling to co-operate, but ultimately backed down and complied. Nonetheless, the panel has so far limited its punishment well below this level. Apart from negative publicity, no company has yet been forced to do more than adjust its comparative figures in its next set of accounts - or in one case publish amendments in a normal results circular. Miscreants could be required to reprint and re-circulate to all shareholders the set of accounts being criticised. Even the panel's wording in its statements remains circumspect and diplomatic, avoiding inflammatory words such as 'reprimand' or 'criticise'. One concern being voiced is that the selection process of companies' accounts for the panel's scrutiny is faulty. Most being examined have visible signs of discrepancy with accounting standards: either a qualified audit report or disclosures in the notes. The more troubling practices may be more thoroughly concealed and escape attention. Others argue that the panel should extend its remit to consider other corporate financial information such as interim accounts, takeover documents and directors' reports. A final criticism is the relatively slow speed of action by the panel, which is staffed by part-time professionals. Here at least it has been able to take steps for improvement. Last month it appointing three new members: Mr Kit Farrow of Kleinwort Benson, Mr Roger Looker of Rea Brothers and Mr Christopher Swinson, a chartered accountant.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / French say Nestle can bid for Perrier NESTLE, the Swiss food group, has been given the go-ahead by the French stock market authorities for its FFr13.42bn (Pounds 1.37bn) hostile takeover bid launched last week for Source Perrier, France's leading mineral water company. The Swiss group, which is funding the bid jointly with Banque Indosuez, the prominent Paris bank, now needs to secure the consent of the French government since it is based outside the European Community. In recent days Nestle has appeared to be trying to play down the aggressive aspects of the bid which threatens to turn into a bitter battle with the Agnellis, the Italian industrial dynasty, for control of Perrier. Mr Reto Domeniconi, director general of Nestle, stressed in interviews with Espresso and Il Mondo, the Italian weeklies, that he hoped to reach an agreement with the Agnellis. He suggested that his company could keep Perrier's water and cheese interests while the Agnellis, who are in the throes of a FFr5.6bn bid for Exor, the French property group that controls 35 per cent of Perrier, could retain its holdings in wine and property. Despite Mr Domeniconi's placatory overtures, Nestle is pressing ahead with its legal battle to prevent the Agnellis from blocking its bid for Perrier. Nestle is trying to invalidate the FFr1.5bn purchase earlier this month of a 13.8 per cent stake in Perrier by Saint Louis, another company linked to the Agnellis. The combination of this holding with Exor's 35 per cent would give the Agnelli camp control of 48.8 per cent of Perrier, making it almost impossible for Nestle's bid to succeed. Nestle last week obtained a court order to freeze the voting rights attached to the Saint Louis shares. The Tribunal de Commerce, the Paris commercial court, yesterday announced it had set a date of February 25 to deliver its judgment on the validity of Saint Louis' investment. The Commission des Operations de la Bourse, another French stock market regulator, is expected to decide this week whether it will sanction the Saint Louis share sale. In the meantime Mr Umberto Agnelli, who has headed his family's drive into France, has tried to mend the damage to the Agnellis' carefully cultivated francophillic image by stressing their commitment to long-term investment in France.</p>

The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial telephone notification will be confirmed by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification letter. A copy of the notification letter also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be given to the lead assessor. An assessment assignment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that gives the name and telephone number of the laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contact person and of each assessment team member, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other available information necessary to the planning and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct of the assessment will also be provided to the lead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once the laboratory has been notified by the accrediting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority that an assessment will be conducted, the primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility for the conduct of the assessment passes to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lead assessor. Any further communications with the laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel should be made by the lead assessor. The lead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessor should keep his/her supervisory personnel informed of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the status of the assessment, and should consult with them on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any substantive problems that may arise or changes that may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are several items to be addressed in the advanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification. The lead assessor should make note of when and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to whom advance notification was provided. Written advance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification should do the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Introduce the lead assessor and team members to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Schedule the assessment, including establishing time of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrival;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Obtain verbal agreement for entry;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Confirm the appropriate address for the assessment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including identifying the location of necessary records,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as specified in the assessment plan;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Ensure that laboratory personnel are available to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accompany assessors during the assessment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Encourage the laboratory to transfer all records to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment site before the assessment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Obtain directions to the laboratory; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Allow discussion of problems, concerns, or questions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about the assessment or any other issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Especially when the laboratory has not previously been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessed by the accrediting authority, the lead assessor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be certain that laboratory personnel are aware of what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an assessment involves, what data and records should be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available and what personnel should be present. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory representative does not cooperate, the lead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessor's supervisor and the accrediting authority management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be consulted for instructions on how to proceed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

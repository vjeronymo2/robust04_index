			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> OAKLAND;  </P> <P> MILLS STUDENTS END CAMPUS BLOCKADE  </P> <P> Students at Mills College ended their two-week blockade of campus buildings,  expressing hopes that the school's officials will reverse or postpone their  decision to admit undergraduate men in 1991. The blockade began the day of the  officials' decision to go co-ed, which they said is needed to boost enrollment  and restore the school to financial health. The college's trustees are  scheduled to meet today to study faculty and alumni plans to keep Mills a  women's school.  </P></p>

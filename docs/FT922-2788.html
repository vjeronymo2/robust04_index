			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Observer: Trouble shooter Who is going to replace Sir John Cuckney? Observer poses the question following the news that Sir John has been hired yet again to try and clean up another lovely City mess - recovering the Maxwell missing millions for the unfortunate pensioners. Over the last couple of decades, Sir John has carved out a reputation for himself as the man who can be relied upon to sort out financial mismanagement or skulduggery in both the public and private sectors. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, Westland, Crown Agents, John Brown, the Port of London Authority, are just a few of the casualties who have had the Cuckney treatment. Now Sir John has been made chairman of the trust for Maxwell pensioners and has the unenviable task of persuading the private sector to cough up. If anyone can do it, he can, given his network of contacts. As an old intelligence hand, he should know where the skeletons are hidden and even if he doesn't he is rather good at twisting arms for the public good. Nevertheless, Sir John turns 67 next month and has already started to shed a heavy City work load. He remains chairman of Royal Insurance but steps down from 3i next month. Sooner or later someone else is going to have to do Sir John's dirty work. Suggestions to Number 10 and the Bank of England, please.</p>

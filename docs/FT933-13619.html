			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Laying down their lives for the UN: Dominic Lawson says the idea of international armies is fundamentally flawed OCCASIONALLY in cricket, and even more occasionally in soccer, a team is put into the field under the title 'Rest of the World.' Usually such a team plays a national side. On paper the national side does not stand a chance. In practice the Rest of the World tends to lose. It is necessary to witness such matches to understand the reason for this triumph of the underdog. Then you will see the Rest of the World batsmen giving up their wickets without the grim struggle that such players would normally offer. And the Rest of the World bowlers seem unprepared to deliver their most hostile bouncers. The point is, they are not playing for their own country, while their opponents are. The pride and motivation of patriotism is lacking in the one side, but is galvanising the other. It is this phenomenon which is dogging the United Nations' various efforts to enforce the peace in different parts of the world. Indeed, it points to a weakness in the very idea of a UN military force in sustained combat. As reports in Wednesday's Financial Times made clear, a number of national units within the UN force in Somalia are refusing to obey the orders of UN commanders to take part in attacks on General Aideed's militia. The Italians, in particular, who were the colonial power in the region, have virtually downed arms. It ill suits a man sitting at a word processor in London to accuse Italian soldiers of cowardice, particularly when such soldiers are confronted with a vicious guerrilla force which only a month ago killed and then dismembered 24 of the Pakistani contingent in the UN force. But I am sure that when the Italian army of the 1930s enforced Italian rule over Somalia, they would not have shirked such a challenge. The Italian soldier will, if necessary, risk his life for his country. But does the same Italian soldier want to risk his life for the UN, that amorphous mess of squabbling diplomats and politicians too inept to hold high office in their own countries? The same thought has dogged the member states of the UN as they attempt to impose a civilised solution on the war in Bosnia. Despite a number of attempts, notably by the Americans, to introduce the idea of a multinational force to enforce a peace in the Balkans, nothing has been done. The field marshals and generals of the European armies have told the politicians that they cannot expect their troops to risk massive casualties in pursuit of an objective so remote and incomprehensible. Moslems will fight to the death to save their land from Serbian ethnic cleansers. It is neither fair nor reasonable to expect British squaddies to fight with the same passion on such a battlefield, heroic as such men have been in their much more limited role of ensuring the delivery of food and medicine to the besieged Moslems. A number of people, who might loosely be described as Euro-gullibles, have argued that the failure of European policy in Bosnia is to be blamed on the absence of a fully integrated European military strategy. They are the same people who are enthusiastic about the provisions in the Maastricht Treaty for a common European defence policy and, ultimately, for a standing European army. But it seems to me that such a force, even if it could be achieved politically, would in practice fall victim to exactly the problems now confronting the UN in Somalia. Would an Italian contingent of a European army in Bosnia be any more willing to take on General Mladic's Serbian regulars than it has been to take on General Aideed's Somali irregulars? The Italians are among the most enthusiastic proponents of the European ideal, but they are not lemmings. And what of our British troops, with their unparalleled tradition of national defence? Would they find 'Delors and EC' a rallying cry as stirring as 'Queen and country'? It is true that the UN has enjoyed some military successes in the Middle East recently, and has thus reduced Saddam Hussein to a problem of what the military call containable proportions. But these were essentially US actions; they succeeded because that great country perceived its own vital interests to be threatened, and had - has  - the forces to defend them. During the first world war, Wilfred Owen described Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori as 'the old lie.' Perhaps; but how much less sweet it is to die for the general assembly of the UN.

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Territories sealed in response to Hamas killings Israel yesterday sealed the occupied territories for an indefinite period, banning Palestinians from entering Israel and East Jerusalem. Earlier, a second Palestinian attack in 24 hours came - as Israel remembered 6m Jews killed in the Nazi Holocaust. Closure of the occupied territories cuts off tens of thousands of Palestinians from their jobs. The move is intended to calm growing fears in Israel that Islamic groups may carry out more attacks to avenge the massacre of 29 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque in February. In yesterday's attack, a Palestinian guerrilla of the Islamic Jihad group, who lived in a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, sprayed a bus stop with gunfire at a busy intersection in the southern Israeli town of Ashdod. An Israeli was killed and four wounded. Extremist Islamic groups, now responsible for slaying eight Israelis in two separate attacks, have warned they will step up their violent activities and 'continue in the path of blood and martyrdom'. President Bill Clinton condemned the Palestinian attacks as 'acts of terrorism' aimed at stopping the Middle East peace process. The Palestine Liberation Organisation, in its first official comment, said it regretted Wednesday's car bombing which left seven Israelis dead and urged Israel to implement the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord as soon as possible. But the US said last night it was not satisfied with the PLO's reaction and expected Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO leader, to condemn the killings. Despite intense domestic pressure Mr Yitzhak Rabin's government said it would continue peace talks with the PLO in Cairo on Sunday, after observing the annual Holocaust mem-orial day and the Jewish sabbath. Hamas called on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza to stock food and supplies for 'an atmosphere of real war which will engulf the Zionist soldiers and enemy commanders in the coming days.' Hamas, which bitterly opposes the Israeli-PLO peace agreement and wants to build an Islamic state in the historic land of Palestine, said at least four more attacks were being prepared. Right-wing opposition leaders in Israel have demanded peace talks be suspended and Mr Rabin resign.</p>

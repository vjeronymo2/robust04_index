			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Caribbean groups look north for investors - Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago can now trade in ADRs THE progressive deregulation of the economies and the financial markets in Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica has triggered a second wave of corporate forays into foreign territory. The state-run Trinidad and Tobago Unit Trust has been granted permission by the US Securities and Exchange Commission to seek investments through US dollar-denominated portfolios. And the SEC has given the go-ahead for Jamaica's privately owned Ciboney hotels group to trade its shares through American depositary receipts on the US over-the-counter market. Local bankers and stockbrokers say these forays into the US market would not have been possible had not barriers to the movement of money been dismantled and currencies floated, giving business the room and confidence to successfully operate. The SEC's green light for the Trinidad and Tobago Unit Trust will allow international investors to buy into the government-sponsored Chaconia income and growth fund. The 60,000 existing unit holders will benefit from a wider investment brief. The minimum initial investment is USDollars 1,000 with subsequent investments a minimum of Dollars 250. 'This will allow local and US investors to place in their investment portfolio a US dollar-denominated security sponsored by a Trinidad and Tobago entity, but operating under the strict surveillance and supervision of the US regulatory system,' according to Mr Henry Sealey, executive director of the United Trust. The fund will have to conform to the operational, disclosure, reporting and prudential requirements of US regulations which govern mutual funds in the US. 'These requirements should make the prospective investors feel comfortable and secure,' Mr Sealey said. The fund will invest in US government securities, investment grade corporate bonds, investment grade foreign government bonds, equity securities in US, UK and Trinidadian companies, certificates of deposit and money market funds. 'It is perhaps the giant step towards creating in Trinidad and Tobago a dynamic and flexible financial institutional network necessary for the establishment of the country as the financial centre of the Caribbean,' Mr Sealey said. Jamaica's Ciboney has jumped into the US over-the-counter market with an issue of depositary receipts that will allow the company's shares to be traded in the US. The receipts will be issued by Citibank. Ciboney owns 90 per cent of the Ciboney Radisson Hotel and 34 per cent of Sandals Ocho Rios Hotel, two of Jamaica's larger holiday resorts. The group turned in after-tax profits of JDollars 77m (USDollars 3.46m) for the nine months ended February 1993, against a profit of JDollars 12m a year earlier. Mr Ivor Alexander, executive director of Ciboney, said the depositary receipt registration could be upgraded to a full listing on a US stock exchange. And he said that was a move that the company would eventually consider. 'Although trading will take place on the over-the-counter market, Ciboney can apply, in due course, for listing on a US stock exchange, and the depositary receipt registration is a natural step in this direction,' he said. Mr Alexander said Ciboney, which is listed on the Jamaican stock exchange, had 13,000 shareholders, and the 'broad-based public ownership' was conducive to 'vibrant' trading of depositary receipts. According to Citibank, trading in depositary receipts in the US in 1991 was valued at USDollars 91.1bn, representing 4 per cent of the value of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Amex and Nasdaq.</p>

One deputy was opposed and others abstained.    U.S. Vice President Albert Gore, visiting Almaty, had given  a  positive reaction to the news saying the treaty would serve to  promote the cause of peace and economic development in Central  Asia as a whole. He also spoke of signs of progress in nuclear  disarmament talks with Ukraine which instilled optimism.    The Vice President had also praised the Kazakh-U.S.  agreement  on dismantling nuclear weapons of the former Soviet Union  deployed in Kazakhstan. A bilateral working commission is due  to sit to work out an appropriate schedule soon.    The ratification of the treaty, said Gore, marks an entirely  new stage of relations between Kazakhstan and the United States.  He said strategic cooperation was based not only on shared  positions in respect of nuclear weapons but also in many  economic agreements designed to help promote the private sector  in Kazakhstan.    Gore announced that the Central Asian Business Fund was due  to open its office in Almaty whose main task would be to provide  aid to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan as countries which embrace more  consistent economic reforms than others.    For his part, President Nursultan Nazarbayev said his  country  was "honoring its obligations in respect of nuclear weapons."  However, he said Kazakhstan had set its own conditions for  dismantling them. The main one is Kazakhstan wants to hold back  to [as received] electronic and other equipment for subsequent  use in the economy before missile-containing silos are destroyed.    Gore said the Kazakh leader had accepted President Clinton's  invitation to visit the U.S. on February 14.</p>

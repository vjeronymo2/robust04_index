The change provides that a distributing plant located in the marketing area that processes and distributes primarily aseptically processed fluid milk products would be fully regulated under the order irrespective of the market or markets in which the products may be distributed.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Constance M.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The amendment will lessen the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and will promote orderly marketing of milk by producers and regulated handlers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment to the rules has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendment will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or is the handler's principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior documents in this proceeding:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of Hearing: Issued December 3, 1992; published December 10, 1992 (57 FR 58418).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Supplemental Notice of Hearing: Issued January 19, 1993; published January 29, 1993 (58 FR 6447).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recommended Decision: Issued November 29, 1993; published December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64176).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of Reopened Hearing: Issued February 18, 1994; published February 24, 1994 (59 FR 8874).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A public hearing was held upon proposed amendments to the marketing agreement and the order regulating the handling of milk in the Southern Michigan marketing area. The hearing was held, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), and the applicable rules of practice (7 CFR Part 900), in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on March 1, 1994, pursuant to notice issued February 18, 1994 (59 FR 8874).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested parties were given until March 25, 1994, to file post-hearing briefs on proposal No. 3 as published in the hearing notice, and on whether the proposal should be considered on an expedited basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The hearing notice specifically invited interested persons to present evidence concerning the probable regulatory and informational impact of the proposal on small businesses. However, no participants at the hearing testified about any potentially adverse impacts of the proposal on small businesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The material issues on the record of hearing are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Modification of the recommended multiple component pricing decision to compute the same protein price for both handlers and producers on the basis of a cheese market price and a cheese yield formula, and to include any residual value in the skim milk delivered by producers in the computation of the weighted average differential value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Amending the pool supply plant shipping requirement provisions to allow the market administrator to adjust the shipping percentages as market conditions require.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

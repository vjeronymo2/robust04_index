			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Manila finishes year with flourish The Philippine equity market, a laggard in recent years, is finishing 1993 with a flourish. The Manila composite index, higher again yesterday, has risen by a cumulative 8.8 per cent this week, for an advance of 24.2 per cent since the start of December and 128.7 per cent since the year began. The surge has been fuelled by consistently strong foreign demand, projecting a take-off in the economy and corporate profits after two years of zero GDP growth. Mr David Bates of Asia Equity sees growth of 2 1/2 per cent this year, not less than 4 1/2 per cent in 1994, and more in subsequent years as the World Bank eases its influence on the economy. The pick-up has accompanied government moves to overcome long standing electricity shortages: a series of new power stations will supplement existing hydro-electric generation and overcome seasonal shortages. Five stocks account for 90 per cent of the market capitalisation, with PLDT and San Miguel having the highest profiles with overseas investors. PLDT, traded overnight as an ADR in New York, regularly provides a clue to the local market's subsequent direction. Asia Equity sees deregulation as the key to the imminent exploitation of a vast potential for expansion of the local telecoms market, and a resulting surge in PLDT's performance. It forecasts earnings per share of 517 pesos fully diluted for the year 2000, adding that a 20 times multiple that year, still low for the sector, would give a share price of 10,340 pesos - more than five times the current value. 'Discounted back to today, this gives a current share price valuation of 4,225 pesos - more than twice the current price and 43 times 1994's earnings.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------          EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Dollar terms                      No. of     Dec 17   % Change     % Change Market               stocks       1993   over week   on Dec '92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina              (11)     876.04        -0.2        +51.0 Brazil                 (42)     218.51        -0.2        +74.8 Chile                  (20)     514.85        +6.1        +23.0 Colombia1               (8)     629.33        +1.7        +48.0 Mexico                 (56)     950.43        +2.1        +40.6 Peru2                   (7)     103.35        +5.4         +3.3 Venezuela3              (8)     542.41        +3.3         +4.4 East Asia China4                 (16)     146.59        +1.6        +46.6 South Korea5          (130)     118.31        +1.1        +20.5 Philippines            (11)     272.13        +3.8       +103.8 Taiwan, China6         (76)     114.37       +17.1        +55.0 South Asia India7                 (61)     120.25        +2.0        +28.3 Indonesia8             (31)     116.86        +8.7        +99.1 Malaysia               (61)     316.32        +4.7        +93.4 Pakistan9               (8)     367.39        +2.8        +83.5 Sri Lanka10             (5)     168.61        +2.2        +68.6 Thailand               (52)     433.44        +0.8        +88.1 Euro/Mid East Greece                 (17)     230.34        -1.2        +17.9 Jordan                  (5)     165.97        -0.1        +42.1 Portugal               (16)     112.19        -0.3        +45.4 Turkey11               (31)     193.37        +7.1       +189.2 Zimbabwe12              (5)     188.66        +2.5         na  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Local currency terms                      Dec 17    % Change    % Change Market                 1993   over week  on Dec '92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina        537,558.85        -0.2       +51.3 Brazil        83,744,758.04        +7.0     +3915.7 Chile                878.35        +6.0       +37.0 Colombia1            891.05        +1.6       +45.7 Mexico             1,273.06        +1.7       +40.2 Peru2                136.85        +5.0       +36.8 Venezuela3         1,286.19        +4.0       +37.8 East Asia China4               161.16        +1.6       +61.2 South Korea5         126.03        +1.3       +23.9 Philippines          360.86        +4.3      +123.2 Taiwan, China6       112.83       +15.8       +61.8 South Asia India7               132.98        +2.0       +39.3 Indonesia8           133.46        +8.8      +102.9 Malaysia             297.67        +4.6       +88.6 Pakistan9            499.86        +2.9      +115.6 Sri Lanka10          181.35        +2.2       +81.3 Thailand             437.14        +0.7       +87.5 Euro/Mid East Greece               381.88        -0.2       +34.1 Jordan               239.69        -0.3       +44.5 Portugal             134.42        +0.4       +72.4 Turkey11           1,278.28        +8.9      +376.6 Zimbabwe12           197.45        +3.0        na  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

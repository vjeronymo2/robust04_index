			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Lib Dems suggest early end to mortgage tax relief AN END TO mortgage-interest tax relief for home buyers in the future is envisaged in a housing policy paper published by the Liberal Democrats yesterday. The document makes it clear, however, that the tax break would continue for all those who currently receive it. For everyone else it would be replaced by a new benefit - housing cost relief - which would be available both to home owners and to tenants on the basis of need. While the party's policy is that mortgage-interest relief should simply be allowed to wither over 10 to 25 years, the paper also floats the option of phasing it out over five years, to release the money saved for other projects. In particular, it suggests that the immediate end to mortgage-interest tax relief could save Pounds 5.2bn in the first year, which could be used to cut the basic rate of income tax or to build new homes. Government help for people who have fallen behind with mortgage payments or who have mortgages above the current value of their homes is also proposed as an alternative use for the savings. One of the aims of the policies in the paper is to end the bias towards home ownership and to allow people the opportunity to move between rented property and owner-occupation in either direction. The Conservatives share the objective of reviving the private rented sector but the question of mortgage-interest relief is so politically contentious that Tory campaigners believe the paper will provide them with valuable material to use against the Liberal Democrats. The paper also proposes: A reformed and more generous housing benefit system. Greater accountability for housing associations by separating the monitoring and financial roles of the housing corporation. The introduction of 'partnership housing' to bridge the gap between normal housing association rents and the private rented sector.</p>

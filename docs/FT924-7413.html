			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Overspend at BBC more than expected THE BBC's overspend on television services in the present financial year is likely to be considerably higher than the Pounds 20m admitted to in September, an audit committee chaired by Lord Barnett, vice-chairman of the BBC governors, has discovered, Raymond Snoddy writes. Suggestions in September that the potential deficit could go as high as Pounds 60m were denounced as 'nonsense'. The BBC ordered a cut in television spending to make sure that accounts balanced before the end of the financial year. No final figure is yet available and the audit committee is unlikely to finish its work before the middle of next month.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon the comments received, the scope of the regulation may be changed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Drafting Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant Cam Lewis, Project Officer for the Patrol Commander, and Lieutenant Robin Barber, Project Attorney, Eleventh Coast Guard District Legal Office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Regulation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The event prompting a need for these Special Local Regulations is the International America's Cup Class World Championships which will be conducted in the San Diego area in October and November 1994. In addition, exhibition races will be held on two dates in October and November 1994 within San Diego Bay; special local regulations establishing measures promoting the safety of these exhibition race is the subject of separate rulemaking (CGD11&hyph;94&hyph;006). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These regulations are intended to promote safe navigation on the waters of San Diego Bay, Mission Bay and the IACC race venue during the IACC World Championship Races by controlling the traffic entering, exiting and traveling within these waters. The anticipated concentration of spectator and participant vessels associated with these races poses a safety concern, which is addressed in these special local regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A channel within San Diego Bay has been designated for the exclusive use of IACC vessels during specifically prescribed hours. This channel (the America's Cup Channel) is adjacent to the dredged main ship channel and bounded by the shoreline of North Island.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within the geographic area of applicability of these special local regulations, speed limits and operating requirements have been established for orderly passage to and from the IACC shore facilities and race venue. The America's Cup Channel passes through the Security Zone listed in 33 CFR 165.1105 adjacent to naval piers J through P on the western shore of North Island. Participants, vessels carrying race officials, and patrol vessels may transit this Security Zone during the periods these Special Local Regulations are in effect, unless otherwise notified through Broadcast Notice to Mariners and by patrol vessels on scene. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Speed limits and operating requirements are also established for other vessel traffic operating within the regulated areas during times when most IACC and spectator vessels are expected to transit the harbors. During these same times, vessels shall not operate exclusively under sail within the regulated areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations also provide for a one-way traffic pattern and a five knot speed limit. These requirements will be activated by the Patrol Commander when necessary to ensure the safety of navigation. Activation of these regulations will be announced by patrol vessels on scene and by Broadcast Notice to Mariners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, several non-anchorage areas are established for the period of these regulations to promote smooth traffic flow and ensure access to docks and piers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These Special Local Regulations will be enforced for that portion of the race venue which is located within the navigable waters of the United States to minimize navigational dangers and ensure the safety of vessels participating in and viewing the races. Nonobligatory guidelines are included for that portion of the race venue which falls outside the navigable waters of the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All vessels which fail to comply with this regulation while operating within the regulated areas during the regulatory periods are subject to citation for failure to comply with this regulation, and subject to the penalties presented in 33 U.S.C. 1236 and 33 CFR 100.50. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under Section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that Order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures is unnecessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Collection of Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federalism.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard has analyzed this regulation in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

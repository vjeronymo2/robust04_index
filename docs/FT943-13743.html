			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (1): A powerful spirit of unity - South Africa's politicians must still show they can deliver their promises, but with a charismatic leader at the helm their luck may hold It has been one of the most extraordinary political transformations of the twentieth century: South Africans have defied the logic of their past, and broken all the rules of social theory, to forge a powerful spirit of unity from a shattered nation. Nearly three months after the national catharsis which liberated black and white alike - the April 27 all-race elections - they remain dazed, proud, happy and surprised. They can hardly believe their luck. That new-found confidence is fragile, and news of the resignation of Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, the man who taught South Africa to believe in itself - has deflated the national mood. But even the departure of Mr Keys (he will step down from October) could not seriously undermine the politics of common purpose which has united South Africa. Having wrought a miracle, against all the odds, South Africans are eager now to go on to even greater feats of political magic. In a land of profound faith, and belief in one or many deities, South Africans very often adopt the vocabulary of the miraculous to explain what has happened. A right-wing Afrikaner says President Nelson Mandela, who has driven the process of unification with such wisdom and vision, is 'a gift from God.' He suggests that Mr Mandela is like the crooked stick in the Bible: God can do much good with him, though he be flawed. Even the least sentimental political analysts speak of luck and magic. Columnist Simon Barber, writing in the Johannesburg newspaper Business Day, says South Africans 'passed through the looking glass' at the moment of Mr Mandela's inauguration. 'In that instant, their country became the mirror image of its former self. No longer a pariah but, in a world of Bosnias, Somalias and Rwandas, a beacon.' Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary-general of the African National Congress, puts it even more simply: 'The gods smiled on the ANC' - not because the ANC won power, but precisely because it did not win too much power too soon. 'The four years we spent in negotiations helped to let a lot of ideas mature in our own heads and hearts, to accept sitting down with De Klerk in a government of national unity. . .' he explains. 'We were a little bit giddy. . . and I think we could have made mistakes. So, with hindsight, we played out a grand strategy but maybe some aspects of it we stumbled upon and found our way through the dark.' What they stumbled towards, during those four years of endless talk and bestial violence, was the shared vision of a new South Africa which emerged so powerfully in the wake of the remarkably peaceful elections. Hardly anyone dissents from that vision: certainly not South Africa's former rulers, the National Party, who so far seem to define their interests identically with those of the ANC. And not even the normally fractious Inkatha Freedom Party, full participant in the coalition government of national unity, or the white right Freedom Front, which has remained outside the cabinet but taken seats in all other constitutional structures. That vision has taken shape in the Reconstruction and Development Programme, a grand blueprint to transform South African society, to re-invent government and re-define patterns of ownership, influence and power. Says one businessman who fully supports the programme: 'The RDP has replaced apartheid as a grand social project. People talk about it as a kind of holy thing, beyond debate - at least in its goals.' Those goals go well beyond mere socio-economic development: building 1m new houses, electrifying 2.5m homes, redistributing 30 per cent of the land, bringing clean water, education and health to South Africa's poor. The broader goal is to re-invent South Africa in its entirety: a brave new non-racial world must be created where the main institutions of society - the civil service, the security forces, the business community, the universities, the media, the stock exchange, the banks - are no longer dominated by whites. The culture of government must change: the feudal arrogance of the National Party past, which bred obsequiousness in civil servants and sapped the general population's will to resist, must not be repeated. Mr Bobby Godsell, political analyst and industrial relations director for the giant Anglo American Corporation, says South Africa's new rulers must 'behave differently' and break the cycle of the past. A senior ANC minister argues that government must keep its integrity - even more than keeping its promises. The transformation has barely begun. Mr Ramaphosa says: 'Though we have achieved power at a formal level, we still do not have our hands on the levers of power throughout government structures.' Ministers speak of paralysis in government as politicians fight to master the civil service machine and, more importantly, as they tussle with newly-elected provincial premiers who have shown a remarkable degree of independence. Ultimately, the success of the RDP will depend on the creation of a more efficient and responsive civil service, and provincial governments which can effectively deliver development. But ministers point out that not only has the RDP given South Africans a shared vision; it has provoked a shared sense of risk, across the political spectrum within the multi-party government of national unity, and beyond. 'All of us have to deliver the goods,' says Mr Jay Naidoo, minister charged with overseeing the RDP. 'It's not going to help the National Party if Hernus Kriel (NP premier) fails to deliver the goods in the Western Cape, or if Frank Mdladlose (Inkatha premier) fails to deliver the goods in KwaZulu Natal. 'If the RDP does not succeed, the NP is as much responsible as the ANC,' he concludes. A senior National Party minister concurs: 'Unless we develop the country, we all fail. 'The need for development is so overwhelming that it overrides party political differences,' he says, arguing that such differences are a luxury which South Africa can ill afford. Deputy President FW de Klerk, the leader of the National Party, has outlined a strategy of what might be called 'constructive opposition' but is constrained by his presence in the coalition government from too vigorous dissent. In practice, true opposition is likely to come not from the National Party, or even from the less cosily entrenched Inkatha Freedom Party, but from within the ANC itself - from the provincial premiers, who have scented power and will fight the ANC-led central government for more of it; and from Mr Ramaphosa, who has remained outside the cabinet to build his own constituency within the party itself. He has defined his role as 'keeper of the soul of the ANC' - watchdog over the implementation of the RDP, and check on the governing party's natural tendency to assume the arrogance of power. For although the temptation may be for the government of national unity to act as if it rules a one-party state, South African society is likely to prove too plural - and the political system too balanced - to allow that in the end. Ironically, despite constitutional guarantees of overriding power to central government, political realities - not least of them the lust for power of provincial premiers from the ANC - seem to be bringing federalism to South Africa through the back door. Provincial premiers are flouting the authority of central government and exercising even those powers which the constitution denies them. And the centre seems to think it imprudent to resist. However bitterly the principle of federalism was resisted by the ANC - and often by the National Party - at multi-party negotiations, everyone now agrees that tension between the centre and the provinces is a healthy sign of emerging democracy. Only time will tell whether dissent will be so welcome once South Africa emerges from its current honeymoon to face the sad reality that economic growth may simply be insufficient to support the RDP's goals; that foreign investment may be slow to materialise; and that political power may not be enough to shift the burden of underdevelopment. Economic realities may yet defeat the politicians in their desire to do good. But for the moment, they still believe in miracles. And with Nelson Mandela at the helm - surely one of the greatest leaders of the twentieth century - maybe, just maybe, their luck will hold.</p>

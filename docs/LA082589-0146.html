			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OUR GANGS  </P> <P> There are 100 known street gangs in Orange County, with recorded members  totaling more than 7,000. Although they are predominantly in Santa Ana,  Westminster and Garden Grove, gangs also exist in Fullerton, La Habra,  Placentia, and as far south as San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> Each operates from a different power base. For example, Latino gangs' power  base is territory, its expansion or protection. Asian gangs are  profit-oriented; their crimes are theft, robbery, larceny, extortion and car  theft. They operate in business districts and major shopping centers. Profit is  also the motive for black gangs.  </P> <P> This is not to say that the county's gangs have an ethnic bias. "Orange County  is an equal opportunity employer" when it comes to gangs, says Tom Wright,  supervisor of the Gang Suppression Unit of the Orange County probation  department. "Almost every gang is multiethnic, whites in black gangs, Asians in  Latino gangs."  </P> <P> Detective Mark Frank of the Westminster Police Department notes that Asian  gangs don't follow the same patterns as the Latino and black groups. The Asian  gangs don't wear tattoos or spray-paint their symbols, nor do they claim  territory. They are mobile and mostly pay their visits to the Vietnamese  business areas.  </P> <P> Lt. David Salazar of the Santa Ana Police Department says the city has about 60  street gangs, with 5,500 to 6,000 identified members. The crimes that have  brought them to the attention of the police department include homicides,  drive-by shootings, assaults, car theft, narcotics dealing and petty theft.  Santa Ana has Latino, black, white and Asian gangs.  </P> <P> And, Salazar reports, even the gangs have their acolytes. "In the last few  years it's (gang membership) become somewhat of a fad," says Salazar, "with a  lot of wanna-bes imitating gang members in dress" and behavior.  </P> <P> Detective Rick Ritter says most gang members in the city of Fullerton, whether  Latino, black or Asian, are locals and grew up together, attending the same  schools, and that gang activity is more "like high school competitions, nothing  like the scale of Santa Ana or Los Angeles." Some are second-, third- or  fourth-generation gang members, and most of them get along in their multiethnic  neighborhood.  </P> <P> Their crimes are "beer runouts (running into a convenience market, picking up a  six-pack and running out without paying), assaults," according to Ritter, not  drive-by shootings or gang fights. There are hard-core gang members as well as  associate gang members.  </P> <P> Wright adds a new development in so-called "mutant" (a term Wright himself  coined) or "hybrid" groups. These new gangs are "career crooks," Wright says,  profit-oriented, very aggressive or violent, and some members are 14 years old,  younger than traditional gangs. A typical Latino gang, for example, has members  between the ages of 17 and 22.  </P> <P> Mutant gangs seem to be a spontaneous spinoff, taking the best of the more  established gangs -- such as the colors from the black gangs (red and blue  rags) and the idea of territory from the Latino gangs. "They are going very  much against the grain of gang culture," Wright says, and their methods have  provoked confrontations with the established gangs.  </P> <P> DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S GANG UNIT ACTIVITY  </P> <P> The District Attorney's Gang Unit has filed 792 cases against gang members.  </P> <P> ETHNIC BREAKDOWN OF CASES FILED AGAINST GANGS:  </P> <P> Group: %  </P> <P> Latino: 73  </P> <P> Blacks: 19  </P> <P> Asian: 3  </P> <P> White: 4  </P> <P> Out of County: 1  </P> <P> MAJOR CRIMES FILED:  </P> <P> Crime: Number  </P> <P> Homicide: 12  </P> <P> Attempted murder: 18  </P> <P> Assault with a deadly weapon: 71  </P> <P> Shooting into a residence: 10  </P> <P> Robbery: 51  </P> <P> 56 preliminary hearings  </P> <P> 12 Section 707 hearings (to determine if a minor should be tried as an adult)  </P> <P> 15 gang search warrants  </P> <P> TRIALS COMPLETED:  </P> <P> Category: Number  </P> <P> Juvenile trials: 78  </P> <P> Jury trials: 10  </P> <P> Overall conviction rate in trials: 91%  </P></p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Arts: Sex and drugs . . . popular classics - serious music, second-hand The nation likes its classical music, but at second hand. Research suggests that almost 30 per cent of the adult population will admit to an interest in classical music but only about 1.4m, or 5 per cent, actually bother to go to orchestral concerts two or more times a year. The majority prefers to get its fix at home. The obvious alternative to concert going is listening to recordings, and, after a worrying dip, sales of classical CDs and tapes are expected to reach 14m this year, approaching the 'Three Tenors-World Cup' crescendo of 16.7m in 1990. This is, however, still only 7 per cent of all album sales. It is two alternative sources of classical music that have caused the biggest waves - classical radio stations and the proliferation of classical music magazines. While the audience for orchestral concerts at the Royal Festival Hall has fallen by 20 per cent in two decades, to around 60 per cent of capacity, and orchestras around the country face rising deficits, Classic FM and the BBC Music Magazine have chalked up considerable commercial success. By coincidence both were launched in September 1992, and both are already the world leaders in their fields. Indeed Classic FM, with almost 5m listeners weekly, may have the largest audience of any commercial station playing any type of music. The BBC Music Magazine is already in profit; Classic FM in the UK expects to be in the black very shortly. Their success has come from quickly moving a successful domestic formula abroad. Even before its first issue appeared the publishing director of BBC Music Magazine received an approach from Warner Music, the direct marketing arm of Time-Warner, which wanted to distribute the magazine in the US. Today the Music Magazine sells around 65,000 copies in the UK; 20,000 in a new German edition; and over 200,000 in the US. By coincidence last month Classic FM signed a deal with Sony-Warner, a venture between Time-Warner and Sony, which will market its programmes across the US, guaranteeing the station a lump sum and a percentage of the sales. Classic FM already owns, or has an interest in, classical music stations in Holland, Finland and Sweden. There is an intriguing paradox in the success of the Magazine and Classic FM. BBC Music Magazine sells well, especially overseas, at least partly on the blessed reputation of the BBC. Yet apart from carrying Radio 3 listings (and those of Classic FM) it receives few, if any, plugs from the airwaves of its broadcasting parent. In contrast Classic FM is quite at liberty to promote any of its growing number of subsidiary activities, such as its summer music festival; its Classic FM CDs, which have shot up the classical music charts - and, next year, its own magazine. What they share is the inestimable advantage of the English language, married to the universality of music. As Classic FM's chief executive, John Spearman, says 'Mozart is not an English word'. They are also well packaged brands which appeal to the advertisers' delight, an elusive ABC1 audience, while avoiding any elitist pretensions. Spearman does not expect the launch of the Classic FM magazine to greatly affect sales of the other specialist music journals. It is aimed at a wider, life-style market, and will cover travel and food as lavishly as music. And it will not carry the monthly free CD attached to its cover, which has done so much to boost sales of the BBC Music Magazine and Classic CD. To add another twist, Classic CD has just been acquired by Pearson, publishers of the FT, which should improve its prospects. And with The Gramophone still going strong, the jostling field of classical music magazines is performing surprisingly well. The same is true of BBC's Radio 3. It has, if anything, gained from the competition from Classic FM, losing some of its remoteness, but none of its 2.5m weekly listeners. So while many members of the nation's leading symphony orchestras face yet another year without a pay rise, and a future which may well see the end of at least one orchestra, the parasites who live off the creative talent of musicians prosper. This is the way the world is going as the media increasingly acts as the selective retailer of culture. At least both Classic FM and the BBC Music Magazine take their responsibilities towards their art form seriously.</p>

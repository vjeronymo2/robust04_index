			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Scottish &amp; Newcastle 28% ahead - Strong first-time contribution from Chef &amp; Brewer pubs chain A strong first-time contribution from the Chef &amp; Brewer pubs chain helped Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the beer and leisure group, report a 28 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 114m to Pounds 145m. 'We've had great success in integrating Chef &amp; Brewer,' said Mr Brian Stewart, S&amp;N's chief executive. The group was unable to break out the underlying profit growth of the existing leisure, pub and brewing businesses. Chef &amp; Brewer, acquired from Grand Metropolitan a year ago for Pounds 703m, is thought to be earnings enhancing, several analysts said. Operating profits from all pub retail activities rose to Pounds 73.3m (Pounds 29.2m) on sales of Pounds 364m (Pounds 145m). Mr Stewart said the chain offered plenty more scope for development with, for example, the Homespreads food concept and the addition of accommodation at some sites. The group was achieving a 25 per cent return on investment in new projects in the chain, he added. Chef &amp; Brewer took little of S&amp;N's beer during the half year, however, because of its supply agreement with Courage which expires next March. 'Long-term, we would like to supply the bulk of it,' Mr Stewart said. Profits from brewing and related activities fell to Pounds 45.4m (Pounds 50.4m) on sales of Pounds 445m (Pounds 443m). Half the fall was attributable to low maltings prices which should recover next year, the group said. S&amp;N's beer volumes were up 2.4 per cent in the half year to October 30, with sales to the pub trade flat, but with improved margins, and sales to off-licences and other retailers up 11 per cent. The group benefited from the warm summer weather and a good performance from brands such as Becks lager and Theakstons and McEwans Export beer. Margins in the off-trade suffered a 'substantial decline', but some second half-recovery is expected. Leisure contributed profits of Pounds 49m (Pounds 47.1m) on sales of Pounds 202m (Pounds 192m). Center Parcs achieved a 10 per cent increase in profits thanks in part to the opening of a third UK holiday village at Longleat. Profits fell at Pontin's holiday centres because foreign competition led to a 7 per cent downturn in visitors. Pontin's bookings were up about 5 per cent in the second half, however. Net debt was Pounds 740m at the end of the half year for gearing of 41 per cent. This was a slight increase from the year-end level because of a small cash outflow as expected. The board declared a 7 per cent increase in the interim dividend from 5.78p to 6.18p. Earnings per share increased to 20.4p (18.8p) - or 20.2p (18.5p) fully diluted and excluding a Pounds 500,000 loss on property disposals against a loss of Pounds 200,000 a year earlier. See Lex</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has voiced  concern over North Korea's possible withdrawal from the nuclear  nonproliferation treaty [NPT]. Meeting U.S. senators Sam Nunn  and Richard Lugar Wednesday [5 January], he said that the step  by the North Korean leadership could deteriorate the situation  not only on the Korean Peninsula, but the world over.    Pyongyang declared its intention to withdraw from the  nuclear  nonproliferation treaty in March 1993. Grachev said Russia  favors further inter-Korean dialogue. The minister described as  counterproductive the possibility to impose international  sanctions against North Korea. The problem should not be  tackled with hastiness. He believes it is necessary to consider  the possible political and military implications that could  follow the sanctions, as well as to ask for China's opinion on  the issue, since the country has very close contacts with North  Korea.    The minister has said that Russia stands for a balanced  approach to the issue. He also believes that the international  impact on Pyongyang should be aimed at drawing North Korea to  rejoin the treaty, not at expanding its isolation. The  development of the North Korean-U.S. talks, he believes, could  be an effective means of influence. Russia and China could also  influence Pyongyang.</p>

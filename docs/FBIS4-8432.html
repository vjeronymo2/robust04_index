			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["`Every Piece of the Albanian Land Is Sacred For Us' -- </F> Statement by the National Committee for Protection the  Autochepaly of the Albanian Orthodox Church" -- ATA headline]    [Text] Tirana, April 13 (ATA) -- The National Committee  for Protection the Autocephaly of the Albanian Orthodox Church  condemned through a statement the barbarian act of the Greek  commandos who killed 2 Albanian military men and wounded several  others.    The statement writes: "Taking advantage by establishing the  democracy in Albania and the friendly feelings of the Albanian  people toward the Greek one, the Greek chauvinists used all  their means to bring to Albania propagandistic materials,  so-called `Vorio Epiri' flags, Greek priests with anti-Albanian  missions, as it was the case of Kostas Stamos; in illegal ways  they tried to take the leadership of the Albanians Orthodox  Church through Janullatus, who has declared himself the prime  bishop of the Albanian Autocephaly Orthodox Church through  devices and contrary to the statute of our church. Janullatus  has been hindering the Albanian state through slanders and has  gathered around himself anti Albanian elements."    The committee underlines that it is for preserving the  friendship with the Greek people and primarily with our Greek  brothers of the Greek minority. But at the same time, the  committee emphasizes that it is for a strict approach and  determination against the chauvinism. "Every piece of the  Albanian soil is sacred," the statement emphasizes.    Further on the statement continues as following: "We urge  our government to take measures that these acts never be  repeated, to inform all the international organisms of this  question, to dismiss Anastas Janullatus as soon as possible  because as it has been proved that he has caused great damages  to our country. We will solve our state and church problems  without the Greek intervention."</p>

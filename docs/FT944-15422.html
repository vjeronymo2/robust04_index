			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / France launches Renault shares: First step in partial sell-off - Car group valued at up to FFr42.5bn The French government will today launch the partial privatisation of Renault, the motor group that is one of the most attractive assets in the country's public sector and a former bastion of union power. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, gave a guideline price of between FFr163 and FFr178 per share for institutional investors, valuing the company at between FFr39bn (Dollars 7.4bn) and FFr42.5bn. The price range, which officials described as non-binding, is below many market estimates which have been between FFr42bn and FFr45bn. Mr Alphandery described the partial privatisation, which is expected within the next month, as an important step for the motor group and for French financial markets. 'It will give Renault the resources for development and place it in pole position for competition with its rivals. It also puts one of France's most important industrial groups on the bourse,' he said. The issue is being aimed mainly at individual investors, who will be able to make non-binding applications for shares from today. Mr Alphandery said the government planned to sell about 60 per cent of the shares to individuals, but the proportion could be increased to two-thirds if demand was strong. Previous issues in the French government's privatisation programme have seen shares clawed back from institutional investors following strong subscriptions by individuals. Industry observers in Paris predicted that Renault would also see keen interest. 'It is a household name and seems likely to be fairly priced,' said a motor industry analyst at a French merchant bank. He added that Renault, which achieved profits of FF1.07bn last year and forecasts a strong increase in 1994, was one of the few motor groups to remain in profit during the recession in the industry in 1992 and 1993. Mr Alphandery stressed that the company would remain in French hands and that the government, which holds 80 per cent of Renault's shares, would retain a 51 per cent stake. 'Privatisation is not on the agenda. There are no plans for a second tranche to be floated on the bourse.' The proceeds of the share sale are expected to be used to finance a capital increase at Air France, the loss-making state-owned airline. The government's decision to limit the flotation to a partial privatisation reflects the political sensitivity of Renault. The communist-led union, the Confederation Generale du Travail, has sought to block the sale of Renault shares, but calls for industrial action at the motor group have met with little success. As part of the operation, Volvo of Sweden, Renault's former partner in an aborted merger, will sell between 8 per cent and 12 per cent of the French company's shares. Volvo holds 20 per cent of Renault's equity, which it has kept since the collapse of the merger plans last year. The French economy minister said that foreign shareholders would be welcome and that international investors had expressed strong interest in the issue.</p>

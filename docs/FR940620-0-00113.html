However, since the secured side of a visiting area functions as a common use area among inmates or detainees, an exception has been added that is consistent with ADAAG 12.1 which states that only those common use areas serving accessible cells or rooms are required to be accessible. Under this exception, non-contact visiting areas serving areas of a facility where no accessible cells or rooms are located are not required to have accessible cubicles on the inmate or detainee side. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Non-contact visiting areas typically have safety glass or security glazing to separate visitors and inmates or detainees. ADAAG 12.3(2) references ADAAG 7.2(3) which covers a similar situation at teller windows or counters and requires that at least one provide a method to facilitate voice communication. ADAAG 7.2(3)(iii) indicates that various methods may include grilles, talk-thru baffles, intercoms or telephone handset devices. If telephone handset devices are used, this provision further requires that at least one such device be equipped with a volume control complying with ADAAG 4.31.5. One State correctional agency noted that it currently uses hand-held intercoms that are equipped with telephone-style volume controls, which is preferred over the use of an assistive listening system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Telephone handset devices are acceptable under this provision so long as at least one is equipped with a volume control. Assistive listening devices are not required at these locations. The appendix note to ADAAG 12.3 indicates that if an assistive listening system is provided, consideration should be given to the intended users and the setting in determining the most suitable type of system. The use of assistive listening systems is not recommended over other communication methods. Also, as noted in ADAAG 11.4.3 (Visiting Areas), ``security glazing'' has been substituted for ``safety glass'' as was recommended by one correctional authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule contained a requirement that accessible cubicles be identified with the International Symbol of Accessibility. As noted in ADAAG 11.4.3, several comments questioned the need for such identification since users are typically escorted to visiting areas by security personnel. Further, signage which can be vandalized or removed may pose a security hazard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The requirement for identifying signage has been removed in this section, consistent with ADAAG 11.4.3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12.4&blank;Holding and Housing Cells or Rooms: Minimum Number and Dispersion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12.4.1&blank;Holding Cells and General Housing Cells or Rooms &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Questions and issues raised in the NPRM about the minimum number and dispersion of accessible cells evoked more comment than any other in this section. The NPRM requested survey data on the percentage of inmates with disabilities in State and local prisons and jails. Most of the comments providing survey data were submitted by State correctional agencies. Among those State agencies responding to the NPRM, the percentage of inmates with mobility impairments or who used wheelchairs in State prisons systems ranged from .12 to 1.35 percent with an average of .46 percent. The Illinois Department of Corrections also shared the results of a national survey it completed in 1990 which indicate that among 27 responding States and the Bureau of Prisons, the percentage of the inmate population with ``ambulation problems'' ranged from .04 to 1.2 percent and also averaged .46 percent. In addition, the Association of State Correctional Administrators (ASCA) surveyed its members on this question but did not specify a breakout according to disability type. The results of this survey contained significantly higher percentages, suggesting that a wider range of disabilities, not just mobility or ambulatory impairments, were included in the percentages. Among 23 responding States, the average percentage of the inmate population identified as having a disability was 3.39 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Survey data were also received on local prison and jail populations. Three State agencies that oversee local or county jails and prisons provided survey results. A survey of 10 Nebraska county jails identified .07 percent of the 1991 population as having a mobility impairment. In a survey of 204 county facilities, the Texas Commission on Jail Standards determined that on average .48 percent of the daily population has a mobility impairment. According to California Board of Corrections, a daily average of 1 to 1.5 percent of the population ``requires a physical accommodation'' in county facilities among a representative sampling of 11 counties. In addition, several comments from county correctional authorities estimated that less than 1 percent of the population in their systems have mobility impairments, and one other noted that 2 percent of the population has a disability. At the local level, the City of New York submitted data indicating that .25 percent of the population in its system use wheelchairs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bureau of Prisons indicated that a 1992 survey of inmates in the Federal prisons system identified 1.25 percent of the inmates as having some type of disability and approximately .5 percent as having ``manual'' impairments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To further assess the need for accessible cells, the NPRM asked whether there are any instances in which inmates with disabilities are not housed among the general population but are housed in other areas, such as infirmaries, or are located to another facility entirely, such as a halfway house, due to a lack of accessible cells or rooms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most comments from State correctional systems noted that inmates may be housed in other areas of facilities but that this was not necessarily due to the absence of accessible cells. A comment made by the Illinois Department of Correction is representative of many of these comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> There are instances where inmates with disabilities are housed in areas other than [the] general population. This is a reflection not as much of whether an accessible cell is available in [the] general population, but rather of the Department's conclusion that in many instances programs and services can be more effectively delivered to disabled inmates who are clustered, rather than dispersed. In some instances disabled inmates are housed in infirmaries where the level of supervision is generally greater and where medical services are more readily available. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A majority of the States responding to the ASCA survey indicated that inmates with disabilities are housed in areas other than housing for the general population because accessible cells are not available. Like the Illinois Department of Corrections, some States base this practice on what they believe is a more effective provision of services, including medical care. Several States noted that the area used was an infirmary or medical unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

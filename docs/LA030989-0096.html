			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUBLIC LAND SALES A STEAL UNDER OLD LAW, STUDY SAYS  </P> <P> An antiquated federal law designed to encourage mining in sparsely populated  parts of the West instead is permitting developers to buy vast federal tracts  for less than one one-thousandth of their fair market value, the General  Accounting Office reported Wednesday.  </P> <P> Entrepreneurs taking advantage of the law paid the government less than $4,000  for land estimated to be worth up to $48 million, GAO auditors revealed in a  survey of just 20 of the hundreds of such sales concluded since 1970.  </P> <P> A random sample by the agency of 285 applications still pending before the  Interior Department found that in 12 cases alone, the government is preparing  to sell land worth up to $47 million for just $16,000, according to the report,  unveiled before the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs.  </P> <P> The mining law, enacted by Congress in 1872, permitted U.S. citizens to buy  patents for most mineral deposits on federal lands for $2.50 an acre, with  others priced at $5 an acre.  </P> <P> While the scope of the law recently has been narrowed, it still sets the same  low prices for public lands on which buyers can demonstrate that gold, silver  and other hard rock minerals can be viably mined.  </P> <P> But the GAO study found that little of the land is actually used for mining and  suggested that many tracts -- located near profitable ski resorts and casinos  -- had been bought for speculation. The report urged that the law immediately  be amended to prohibit such land sales.  </P> <P> "This is outrageous," Rep. Nick J. Rahall II (D-W. Va.) declared, endorsing the  recommendation. "At $2.50 an acre, these valuable federal lands are being  transferred out of public ownership for fast-food hamburger prices."  </P> <P> The mining law presents the most significant exception in U.S. law to a general  rule requiring public lands be sold at fair market value. It originally was  enacted to promote settlement in the West and the exploration and development  of domestic mineral resources.  </P> <P> The new disclosures about the cost of the law to the federal government add to  concerns raised in 1986, when speculators bought 17,000 federal acres for  $42,500, then weeks later sold them to major oil companies for $37 million.  </P> <P> In the face of the public outcry that resulted, the Ronald Reagan  Administration imposed a moratorium on such sales for lands containing oil  shale. But little consideration was given to potential problems raised by sales  of land yielding hard rock minerals; such sales never were proscribed.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the deadline for the Reagan moratorium has expired, leaving hundreds  of land-purchase applications again pending for Interior consideration.  </P> <P> Confronted with the evidence in an appearance before the committee, Interior  Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. testified that his department now has "no way of  dealing" with the problem.  </P> <P> But he told the committee he had "a lot of sympathy with what the GAO is  saying," and he told reporters later that "maybe it is time to revisit" the  1872 law.  </P> <P> "I am not satisfied with $2.50 an acre," he said. "We have to look at  alternatives."  </P> <P> Under provisions of the mining law, the federal government in the last 117  years has sold about 3.2 million federal acres -- an area about the size of  Connecticut.  </P> <P> In its current form, the law allows citizens to prospect for minerals on most  federal lands, and, if a valuable deposit is discovered, to buy for a nominal  fee a patent giving rights to both the minerals and the land.  </P> <P> The report by the GAO, an investigative agency of Congress, said the potential  for the law's abuse has been raised by "escalating land prices near expanding  communities, resort areas and tourist attractions." Under those conditions, it  said, the patent provision has become "an attractive means of acquiring title  to valuable land for non-mining purposes," and has resulted in "patent holders  reaping huge profits at the government's expense."  </P> <P> The report said, for example, that a 160-acre claim near the Keystone ski  resort in Colorado was patented in 1983 for $400. Last year, 44 acres of the  claim were offered for sale for $484,000 as part of a real estate development.  No mining ever took place.  </P> <P> In another case pending before Interior, investors in 1987 filed a claim for  1,280 acres adjacent to Lake Mead National Recreation Area and within three  miles of nine gambling casinos in Laughlin, Nev. The GAO report said that if  that claim were approved, the government would receive $3,200 for land valued  at between $25.6 million and $35 million.  </P> <P> Warning that the "gap is growing" between nominal prices set by the mining law  and the federal land's true value, the GAO estimated the government stands to  lose "tens of millions of dollars" if the mining law is not amended. The agency  recommended the government maintain ownership of the lands and lease them to  those who would mine them.  </P> <P> That recommendation was strongly endorsed by Dave Albersworth, a spokesman for  the National Wildlife Federation, who noted: "This law is a sacred cow, and  feeds a Western mythic mentality that believes Gabby Hayes can still go out  with a burro and pickax and find a mother lode."  </P> <P> But Keith Knoblock, a vice president of the American Mining Congress, said in  an interview that the trade group would oppose efforts to amend the  legislation.  </P> <P> Staff Writer Louis Sahagun in Washington also contributed to this story.  </P></p>

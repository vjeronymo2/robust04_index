			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: SFA eases rules for small UK derivative funds THE SECURITIES and Futures Authority has proposed a change to existing capital requirements which will ease the burden on small derivative fund managers, some of whom had threatened to move their business offshore. However, the UK regulatory authority's rules will only apply until January 1 1996, when the European Community's Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD) comes into force. This could bring even higher capital requirements than exist under the original SFA rules. Under the proposed change, the SFA will define a derivative fund manager (DFM) as an arranger who has discretionary management of funds invested in derivatives and whose income is not related to the volume of business transacted. It will recognise DFMs as a separate class of arrangers or discretionary fund managers, because they do not hold client money or assets. A reduced net capital requirement of Pounds 10,000 (excluding investments in the DFM's own funds) will apply, according to an SFA official. Under the CAD, the requirement could be Pounds 96,000 or Pounds 36,000, depending on the interpretation, which has still to be clarified. However, there are provisions which mean that any DFMs authorised under existing rules will be able to keep the same capital requirements. This could prompt a rush of DFM authorisation applications to the SFA prior to 1996. Argentaria, the state-controlled Spanish bank, has reappointed Morgan Stanley to globally co-ordinate the second tranche of its big capital flotation, writes Tom Burns from Madrid. The offer will be split into five areas, Spain, the US, the UK, continental Europe and the rest of the world. Lead managers for the Spanish segment will be Argentaria, BBV, BCH, Banesto and Banco Santander de Negocios. Warburg and BBV lead the UK part, UBS and Santander the European part, and Goldman Sachs and BCH the rest of the world.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Industrials spur S Africa Industrial shares led a rally in Johannesburg as strong local institutional demand took most blue chips higher. The industrial index advanced 61 or 1 per cent to 6,911, bringing its gain over the week to 2.6 per cent. The overall index was 43.2 better at 5,941.6, while the gold shares index picked up 22.4 to 2,189.3, helped by an improvement in bullion. Dealers said that a weaker financial rand also contributed to more positive market sentiment. In the chemicals sector, AECI led the gains with a rise of 13 per cent or R4 to R34. Analysts remarked that the group had been lagging behind the rest of the sector recently. Southern Life, the country's fourth largest insurance group, put on R1.25 at R35.25, while Barlows, the engineering conglomerate, advanced 75 cents to R35 following results last week. Dealers said that speculation about poorer than expected second-half diamond sales and troubles in negotiations with the Russian government set diamond group De Beers against the trend, receding 45 cents to R99.45.</p>

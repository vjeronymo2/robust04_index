			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Viswam: "PM: It's for Pak to Respond"] </F>   [Text] London, March 14: The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V.  Narasimha Rao, on Monday assured his British counterpart, Mr.  John Major, that the groundwork for the resumption of the  political process in Jammu and Kashmir had already been taken in  hand.    In the context of the need for restoration of normality in  Jammu and Kashmir, Mr. Rao also conveyed to Mr. Major India's  readiness to enter into a dialogue with Pakistan, emphasising at  the same time that the responsibility for responding to Indian  initiatives in this respect lay solely with Pakistan. The Prime  Minister's assurances came in response to a specific enquiry  from Mr. Major as to the current steps towards resumption of the  political process in Kashmir as well as of an Indo-Pakistan  dialogue.    During an exchange of views at a summit meeting between the  two Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street, both Punjab and Kashmir  figured in the discussions which were described as frank and  cordial. After the meeting, while Mr. Major said that the two of  them had a "good meeting," Mr. Rao smiled and nodded  acknowledgement as if to say that he concurred with Mr. Major's  assessment of the outcome.    Mr. Rao told the British Prime Minister that while the  Indian  interest in holding elections in Kashmir was both keen and  earnest, he was sceptical about the success of Indian efforts so  long as the "fear of the gun," namely instigation from across  the borders persisted. However, he reminded Mr. Major that the  Indian efforts in Punjab had succeeded and that the State was  now peaceful and democracy functioned there effectively. The  Prime Minister also secured a positive response from Mr. Major  to his suggestion that Britain consider enhancing significantly  its size of investments in India.    Mr. Rao stressed that there was need for the international  community to resolve issues like Bosnia where forces of  extremism were being invoked, with consequential repercussions  around the world.    The exchange of views at the delegation-level lasted about  half-an-hour after which the two Prime Ministers went into a  one-to-one session without aides. According to the Foreign  Secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, the outcome of the talks was on  the positive and constructive side.    Specifically in respect of India's initiatives to bring  Pakistan to the negotiating table, Mr. Rao pointed out that  India had recently offered to Pakistan six proposals for  initiating a dialogue. He emphasised that India was persistently  trying for a constructive dialogue with Pakistan. This argument  was cited by Mr. Rao while responding to Mr. Major's query as to  whether it was possible to set in place some confidence building  measures with Pakistan. The implication of Mr. Rao's response  was that such confidence building measures had already been  thought upon by India, and the ball was now in Islamabad's court.    The two Prime Ministers expressed appreciation of the  success  of Indo-British partnership initiatives which had been agreed  upon by the private sector of the two countries.    The continuation of the partnership was endorsed by the two  Prime Ministers both of whom were appreciative of the fact that  the "wicket is full of runs." Responding with a similar cricket  allusion, his British counterpart said that IBPI [Indo-British  Partnership Initiative] had had a good innings and that they  were still at the crease. [sentence as published]    Britain is opposed to the "internationalisation" of the  Kashmir issue and strongly supports India's stand that the  problem should be resolved through bilateral talks between New  Delhi and Islamabad under the Shimla agreement.    Referring to the controversial resolution on Kashmir moved  and later withdrawn by Pakistan at the recent United Nations  Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) meeting in Geneva, the sources  said the spokesman of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had  clearly stated that Britain did not believe that such  resolutions were helpful in finding a solution.    On human rights in Kashmir, the sources said there had been  a  willingness on the part of the British government to recognise  that there had been "much exaggeration" in reports criticising  India on the issue. The British leadership agreed with India's  view that "many abuses in Kashmir are committed by militants"  and that New Delhi had a democratic tradition, independent  judiciary, free press and a number of local and national human  rights organisations, which zealously worked for the protection  of human rights.</p>

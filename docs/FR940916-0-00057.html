It has also been determined to be a significant rule under the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures. Final Regulatory Assessments have been prepared and are available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In summary, the Final Regulatory Assessments finds that the cost of the Title XI program over the first two years is $144 million, resulting in an average annual cost of $72.0 million. Assuming that there is demand for maximum guarantees and guarantees will range from 70 percent to 871/2 percent of actual cost of the vessel and shipyard modernization and improvement projects, the value of the vessels, capital goods and other assets produced over the first two years of the program will be about $1.85 billion. Further, it is estimated that new Title XI guarantees could generate 19,440 worker years of employment for U.S. shipyard workers, which translates into employment for 9,720 workers over a period of two years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rulemaking document has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Federalism <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MARAD has analyzed this rulemaking in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that these regulations do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MARAD certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MARAD has considered the environmental impact of this rulemaking and has concluded that an environmental impact statement is not required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

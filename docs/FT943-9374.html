			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Confederation Life to sell UK arm Confederation Life, Canada's fifth largest insurer, is to sell off its entire UK operation. The financially troubled insurer said talks were under way with a 'financial services company of significant financial strength', for the sale of Confederation UK Holdings, which made pre-tax profits in 1993 of Pounds 27.9m (USDollars 43.24m) against Pounds 14.2m in 1992. Premium income last year was Pounds 629m, compared with Pounds 715m. Mr Alec Wright, communications manager for the UK operation, said the sale would be used to restore the parent company's capital base which had suffered as a result of falls in property values since the late 1980s. Confederation's UK arm, which began trading in 1906, is one of the leading providers of pooled pension products for medium-sized companies. The mixed pooled fund is the second largest in the UK with assets of Pounds 2.8bn and the investment management division has Pounds 5.4bn of assets under management. Its team of 850 direct sales agents markets a range of unit-linked individual insurance contracts, including standard term and savings products. The announcement follows year-long talks with Great-West Life Assurance, which is controlled by Montreal-based Power Corporation, about a capital injection and the disposal of part or all of the UK operation.</p>

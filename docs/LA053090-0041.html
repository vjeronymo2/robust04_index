			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALING WITH THE TRAGEDY OF NO-CARE MOMS, NO-HOPE BABIES  </P> <P> Freedman wrote an excellent column (May 15) on the needs of children.  </P> <P> He eloquently builds a case for "preventive investment" and "preventive  legislation." Nowhere is the immediate devastation of failed policy and  ignorance greater than with the growing number of our children living in  poverty and without hope.  </P> <P> He recommends starting with our state Constitution. " . . . We can amend the  California Constitution to guarantee that every mother and child has the right  to health care. We can . . . halt the cycle of no-care babies becoming no-care  mothers. We can make California the first state . . . to achieve universal  prenatal care."  </P> <P> DARLENE YORK  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

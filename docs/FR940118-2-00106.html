			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission agrees that the changes to Rule 154, Commentary .06 and .07 should be enacted in order to update and streamline order handling provisions and to bring the Amex Rules into line with automated exchange systems. These changes are in accordance with section 11A(a)(1) of the Act which provides that new data processing and communications techniques create the opportunity for more efficient and effective market operations. The changes to Commentary .06 and .07 will also promote equitable principles of trade and serve the public good in accordance with section 6(b)(5) of the Act <FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>  by helping to create a more efficient marketplace. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 40 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  footnote 12. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 154, Commentary .14_Orders Left With Specialist: Commentary .14 provides that a stop limit order to sell a round lot or odd lot, which has been elected but not executed before the ex-dividend date is treated the same as an open limited price order to sell and such orders are not to be reduced by the specialist or odd-lot dealer on ex-date unless otherwise instructed. The Exchange states that such commentary is valid as it applies to cash dividends, but is inappropriate where other than cash dividends are involved. The Exchange also states that such orders, pursuant to Rule 132 (price adjustment of open orders on ``ex-date''), are to be adjusted as are all other orders to reflect stock dividends or stock distributions. The Amex, therefore, proposes to amend this commentary to state that such orders are not to be reduced by the specialist or odd-lot dealer for a cash dividend but will be adjusted for stock dividends and stock distributions on ex-date in accordance with Rule 132 unless otherwise instructed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that this amendment is a logical ``housekeeping'' amendment which should be approved as it promotes just and equitable principles of trade pursuant to Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 155_Precedence Accorded to Orders Entrusted to Specialists: This rule requires that a specialist give precedence to orders entrusted to him as an agent in any stock in which he is registered before executing at the same price any purchase or sale in the same stock for an account in which the specialist has an interest. The Exchange states that since Exchange Act Rule 11a1&hyph;1 became effective, the aforementioned requirement is not universal and therefore several exemptions apply. The specialist is not required to refrain from trading for his own account when in possession of inexecutable ``G'' orders. Also, the Rule 155 requirements do not apply to on-floor orders subject to the ``two-tick'' restriction and unelected percentage orders. The Amex proposes that this rule be amended to state that the general requirement that a specialist yield precedence under Rule 155 does not apply in these three situations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that the amendment to Rule 155 should be approved because it will conform Exchange Rules to Exchange Act Rule 11a1&hyph;1 and clarify the application of Rule 155, thereby promoting just and equitable principles of trade pursuant to Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 41 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  footnote 12. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 156_Representation of Orders: Currently, Rule 156 sets forth a broker's responsibility for the handling of ``market,'' ``limited price,'' ``at the close'' and ``not held'' orders. The Amex proposes that this rule be amended (by adding paragraph (e)) to include a broker's responsibility for the handling of ``switch orders'' and to provide that a broker may handle a ``switch order'' on a ``best efforts'' basis. The Exchange states that this proposal recognizes the difficulties a member may encounter in executing this type of order since it requires the execution of orders in different securities at the same time at a designated price difference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

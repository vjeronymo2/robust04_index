			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is clear that any license amendments and technical specification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes necessitated by the thermal annealing plan would require an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity for hearing, in accordance with Section 189 of the AEA. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the scope of such a hearing would normally be limited to consideration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether the proposed license amendment and technical specification changes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in accordance with the Commission's rules, and therefore provide reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance of adequate protection to the public health and safety. Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to the more general matter of the acceptability of the thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annealing plan proposed by the licensee would not fall within the scope of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing for license amendment or technical specification change, except as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they fall directly in the scope of the requested amendment or technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specification change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, there is some question whether the AEA requires an opportunity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for hearing in connection with the NRC approval of the thermal annealing plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or the NRC decision approving resumption of operation under the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are four primary alternatives with respect to providing an opportunity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for hearing in connection with thermal annealing. These alternatives are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in greater detail below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative 1. No Opportunity for Hearing Under Rule as Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this alternative, the contention is that Section 189 of the AEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not afford an interested member of the public a right to request a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing in connection with NRC approvals of thermal annealing plans and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resumption of operation under &sect;50.66(c)(2). This alternative is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with other provisions in 10 CFR Part 50 where approval by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Director of NRR is required and hearings are not routinely offered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notwithstanding the lack of a requirement for a public hearing, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> staff anticipates that, with respect to the initial or the first several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications for thermal annealing, several informal hearings or public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meetings would be held by the staff to permit discussion of both the thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annealing plan proposed by the licensee and the technical issues related to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annealing. These hearings or meetings would ensure that all of the pertinent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical issues have been addressed by the licensee in its thermal annealing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan and by the staff in its review of the plan. These hearings or meetings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be noticed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative 2. Discretionary Opportunity for Hearing Under Rule as Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this alternative, the contention is that Section 189 of the AEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not afford an interested member of the public a right to request a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing. However, as a matter of discretion, the Commission would determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a case-by-case basis whether an opportunity for hearing will be provided in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connection with the Director of NRR's determination on a thermal annealing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application under &sect;50.66(b) of the proposed rule. In the hearing, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission would consider issues related to the adequacy of the thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annealing plan, as well as the vessel's ability to perform its safety function  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after being annealed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A case-by-case determination would also be made by the NRC with respect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to providing an opportunity for hearing on the Director of NRR's determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the licensee's justification for subsequent operation under the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;50.66(c)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In both cases, the Commission would publish a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  announcing the NRC's approval of the licensee's thermal annealing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan or approval of resumed operation under &sect;50.66(c)(2). Neither  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of the thermal annealing plan nor resumption of operation, once  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved by the NRC, would be contingent upon completion of any hearing; i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Commission does not believe that it is required to make a Section 189 ``no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant hazards determination'' (``Sholly finding'') when it provides a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretionary hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative 3. Required Opportunity for Hearing Under Rule as Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this alternative, the contention is that a hearing is required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 189 of the AEA for both NRC's approval of the thermal annealing plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and any NRC approval of resumed operation following annealing. The adequacy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the thermal annealing plan, as well as the vessel's ability to perform its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety function after being annealed, could be raised in the hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with approval of the thermal annealing plan. Licensee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of the thermal annealing plan could not commence until any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing is concluded unless the NRC makes a ``no significant hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination'' with respect to the thermal annealing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative 4. Modify Proposed Rule to Require Suspension of License Prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Thermal Annealing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this alternative, the proposed rule's regulatory approach for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thermal annealing would be modified to include a suspension of the operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> license during thermal annealing. The suspension would be automatic under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, without the need for a suspension order, although a letter confirming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the licensee's status under the annealing rule would be prepared. The rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> itself, as is currently drafted, would specify the conditions for lifting of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the suspension (Section 50.66(b)). The licensee would anneal its reactor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel without prior NRC approval of its program for conducting the annealing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon completion, the suspension would be lifted only if the licensee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated that the thermal annealing has addressed the reactor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enbrittlement such that it is acceptable to operate the plant. There would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no opportunity for hearing associated with the lifting of the suspension, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since there would be no prior NRC approval of the annealing program, a hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity under Section 189 would not be implicated by any such approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Submission of Comments in Electronic Format  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters are encouraged to submit, in addition to the original paper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> copy, a copy of the letter in electronic format on a DOS-formatted (IBM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compatible) 5.25 or 3.5 inch computer diskette. Text files should be provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in WordPerfect format or unformatted ASCII code. The format and version  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be identified on the diskette's external label.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR Part 51, that this rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly affecting the quality of human environment and, therefore, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental impact statement is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed below, the individual actions covered in this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking would either serve to enhance safety of the reactor pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel, thereby decreasing the environmental impact of plant operation, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have no impact on the environment. Therefore, in all cases these individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions will not have an adverse impact on the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> PTS Rule (10 CFR 50.61)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The inclusion of thermal annealing as an option for mitigating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of neutron irradiation would serve to decrease the environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of plant operation by enhancing the safety of the reactor pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

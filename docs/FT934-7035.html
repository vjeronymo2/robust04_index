			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: IMF rules for loans to Russia a 'cop-out' Sir, Mr John Odling-Smee's defence of the International Monetary Fund role in Russia (Letters, November 17) includes three dubious propositions that, taken together, help to account for the IMF's very limited achievements in the former Soviet Union. First, Mr Odling-Smee claims that the IMF staff are in 'close contact' with Russia at this crucial juncture. In fact, aside from a couple of resident representatives, there is no IMF team currently in Russia. The IMF work, such as it is, is conducted by telephone from Washington, and by brief fly-ins. When the IMF is actually ready to negotiate, it will insist on a prior fact-finding mission that will absorb several weeks before the start of actual negotiations. The Russians are thereby left without in-depth IMF technical assistance in planning 1994 policies. Worse, under the IMF's standard operating procedures, Russia will not see another IMF loan disbursement for several months. Second, Mr Odling-Smee takes it for granted that Russia's failure to stabilise is proof that the IMF is right to withhold its lending. The IMF simply cannot understand that by withholding its own loans at crucial points, such as early 1992 and now, it gravely weakens the chances for successful stabilisation. When a drowning man is 10 metres from shore, the IMF throws a 5 metre lifeline, content that it has met the drowning man half way. Third, Mr Odling-Smee asserts that it will lend money when 'the Russian authorities as a whole are in a position to commit themselves to and implement, on a sustained basis, a strong adjustment programme'. This IMF standard is a cop-out, and more often than not a bureaucratic excuse for inaction. In a deep crisis, reformers can never prove ex ante that they are in a position to sustain a strong programme; they win their reforms step by step, with successes leading to further successes. This was true for Schacht in 1923, Erhard in 1948, Salinas in 1989, Balcerowicz in 1990, and Cavallo in 1991. The IMF must lend when the chances are good, not perfect, recognising that its own loans can help to tilt the balance. Mr Odling-Smee neglects the very reasons that make IMF negotiations in Moscow so crucial at this juncture. Since the breakthrough to new elections, the reformers have had a strong hand. They have eliminated all subsidised credits; they have ended budget subsidies on agricultural procurement; they have ended artificial write-offs of inter-enterprise arrears; they have taken over control of credit policy from the wayward central bank; they have instituted a bold land privatisation programme; and they have adopted a tough monetary programme, that if combined with IMF funds, would limit money growth to rates consistent with single-digit monthly inflation. The new Russian fiscal year starts in six weeks, and Russia must therefore plan its 1994 programme now, not on the IMF's timetable. With pre-election polls showing the reformers with a good chance to control the next parliament, the chances for stabilisation would be good if there is adequate western assistance. Given that several weeks will be needed to conclude a loan agreement, preparations should already be under way in Moscow. IMF funds could be disbursed early in 1994 in the event the reformers triumph in the elections and are able to launch a stabilisation programme at the start of the new year. If conditions prove inauspicious, there will be opportunity enough to hold back. Jeffrey D Sachs, Harvard University, Department of Economics, Cambridge, Massachusetts, US</p>

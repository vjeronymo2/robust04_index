			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Swissair criticises Air France Swissair, the quoted Swiss carrier, said Air France's partial ownership of Sabena was hindering its plans to buy a large minority stake in the Belgian national airline. 'A continuation of Air France's involvement would appear to make little sense,' Mr Paul Muller, a Swissair director, said in the latest issue of the employee publication Swissair News. Swissair said yesterday that current negotiations depended on Air France. 'If they decide to keep their shares, then we will have to discuss a new situation,' it said. Air France owns two-thirds of Finacta, a holding company which has a 37.5 per cent stake in Sabena. It has been reluctant to dispose of its investment in the Belgian carrier. However, industry observers believe that Mr Christian Blanc, chairman of Air France, may be leaning towards a sale or reduction of the stake. 'It would be difficult for Air France to muster any further capital for Sabena, given its own need for financial resources,' said one airline industry analyst. Swissair also denied a report in a Belgian newspaper that it was seeking a 75 per cent stake in Sabena. It said its aim in associating with Sabena was to obtain influence over an operating entity within the European Union and thereby strengthen its competitive position in Europe. As Switzerland is unlikely to join the EU in the foreseeable future, Swissair faces possible discrimination on EU routes. Its existing co-operation with Austrian Airlines is helpful but insufficient. 'Expanding our group of hubs - Zurich, Geneva and Vienna - to include the capital of Europe would do much to alleviate this serious shortcoming,' Mr Muller said. Swissair has not said how large a stake it is seeking in Sabena, but there has been speculation that it would be as much as 49 per cent.</p>

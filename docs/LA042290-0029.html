			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CELEBRATING EARTH DAY  </P> <P> I think today should be called People Day. We don't need to worry about Earth;  she'll be fine.  </P> <P> It's the humans who are the short-timers here. We ought to be worrying about  what we're going to do to save us. When Mother Earth gets mad enough at the  mess we've made of her domain, she'll just send us the way of the dodo. It may  take her a while to tidy up after we're gone; we've been very sloppy guests,  and we've overstayed our welcome.  </P> <P> ANNETTE NIBLEY  </P> <P> Corona del Mar  </P></p>

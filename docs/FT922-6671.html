			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Fiat's Polish venture lifts Milan by 2.8% ITALY enjoyed a recovery, but analysts were cautious about its duration after the recent drop to 1992 lows, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN was boosted by mainly domestic buying of Fiat shares after the car company's announcement of a Dollars 2bn joint venture with the Polish carmaker FSM. Other industrial recovery plays, such as Olivetti, Montedison and Pirelli, were also in demand. The Comit index rose 13.4 or 2.8 per cent to 488.41 in relatively heavy turnover of more than L120bn after L95bn. Fiat jumped L277 or 5.6 per cent to close at L5,237 and reached L5,285 after hours. Analysts said the share was benefiting from a change of sentiment in the market as well as signs of a recovery in its domestic market. These factors made the share a 'trading buy' and could push the share back up to L6,000, they said. However, they warned that the fundamental outlook for Fiat was still cloudy: the Polish car production agreement amounted to little more than trying to expand the profit margin on its smaller models and did not address the company's weakness in Europe's larger car market; there was continued difficulty in the farm equipment sector; and Fiat's ordinary shares already looked expensive, trading on a 1993 price/earnings ratio of 13, compared to 9 for VW and 4 for Peugeot. The strength in industrials spilled over to the banking sector, as San Paolo rose L100 to L10,850 and Banca Commerciale Italiana added L105 to L3,100. FRANKFURT became a market of stocks again, after sector strength on Monday - carmakers, engineers and retailers following the settlement of the metalworkers' pay talks - and Wednesday's general upsurge on optimism about the German economy. The FAZ index rose 1.89 to 719.29 while the DAX fell 2.02 to 1,785.48. Volume fell to DM9bn from DM9.9bn. Volkswagen dropped DM6.50 to DM397.50. County NatWest wrote yesterday that VW had given guarantees to finance subsidiaries which, in conjunction with other positions, had lifted contingencies and commitments by 68 per cent to DM7.8bn; a rights issue, said County, was in immediate prospect. Among second liners Lufthansa fell another DM5 to DM133.50, while Wella rose another DM15.50 to DM644.50 for a gain of DM49.50 this week. The airline delivered poor results a week ago and has fallen 11.4 per cent since then. Wella, the hair cosmetics producer, said at its balance sheet press conference on Tuesday that high provisions, interest charges and losses on new product launches should all be reduced in the current year. PARIS eased on the last day of the May account as investors locked into their profits. The CAC-40 index ended 14.01 lower at 2,016.83 on volume of about FFr2.6bn. Sunny weather and arbitrage between the shares and the convertibles pushed Euro Disney up by FFr2 to FFr127. But Eurotunnel eased FFr1.40 or 3.7 per cent to FFr36.85 in a late reaction to the previous day's news that its bankers might withdraw funding unless the company settles a dispute with TML by August. Chargeurs added FFr10 to FFr1,280 after a positive analysts' meeting and optimism about BSkyB. But Havas dropped FFr7 to FFr535 after the company told analysts that advertising revenue would be flat this year. Perrier, which is being taken over by Nestle and Banque Indosuez, was suspended at FFr1,701 as the bidders offered to buy out the remaining minority shareholders, thereby de-listing the shares. STOCKHOLM continued to be dominated by Astra, turnover in which amounted to SKr150m of total turnover of SKr731m. Astra B unrestricted shares added SKr2 to SKr549, after a jump of SKr19 the previous day, following its positive first quarter results. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 1.8 to 1001.1. Trading was also heavy in Volvo as it B unrestricted share recovered SKr1 to SKr424. The banking index fell 1.6 per cent as investors worried about credit losses following a bankruptcy petition filed by a small real estate group. AMSTERDAM eased with the CBS Tendency index closing down 0.2 at 130.0. Akzo and DSM both weakened by Fl 1 and 90 cents respectively to Fl 160 and Fl 115.40. Fokker, a possible takeover target, lost 50 cents to Fl 35.10. Elsevier shed 90 cents to Fl 112.80: at a presentation in London yesterday the publisher forecast strong earnings growth for the rest of the year. BRUSSELS saw active trading on the first day of the new forward account, although dividend payments by a number of blue chips pushed the index lower. The Bel-20 index lost 10.33 to 1,213.86. Petrofina, paying a dividend of BFr421 a share, closed at BFr10,900 for a net loss of BFr79. MADRID's general index rose 0.57 to 260.45 with Endesa up Pta50 to Pta3,770 on news that it had signed a cooperation pact with RWE of Germany.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAY 21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Hourly changes   Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1188.32  1188.36  1189.85  1189.63  1188.36  1187.84  1187.36  1187.57  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            Day's High  1190.21          Day's Low  1186.47  ----------------------------------------------------------------------     May 20        May 19         May 18        May 15        May 14    1187.62       1180.66        1184.41       1171.24       1179.98  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Why the customer is always right - Gary Mead finds agencies having a crisis of confidence The malaise of the UK advertising industry is firmly rooted in economic recession. Since 1989, at least 2,500 jobs have disappeared, leaving a pool of about 13,000 employed in the sector; as the recession continues, the fear is that more redundancies are inevitable. But not just redundancies. Last Friday, the Institute of the Practitioners in Advertising (IPA) - the advertising agencies' trade association - staged a lugubrious conference in London, under the rhetorical title, 'Are Advertising Agencies History?' The consensus was 'of course not'; but no real agreement emerged as to what the future of advertising agencies might be. The industry's flagging morale needs a boost. But against the background of fewer jobs, frozen or reduced marketing budgets, squeezed commission rates and no indication of an end to the recession, a dark cloud hung over the IPA's 75th anniversary. Yet within that broad gloom are contrary indicators, not the least being Unilever's decision - made known to its advertising agencies last week - that it is standardising its commission payments to advertising agencies at 13 per cent. While that is 2 percentage points below the long-standing figure demanded - but today rarely obtained - by advertising agencies, some agencies used by Unilever around the world have seen commission rates forced as low as 6 per cent. It is most unusual for one of the world's largest marketing spenders - of about Pounds 1.5bn annually, making it the largest advertiser outside the US  -to make such a move. Unilever believes it could probably have forced rates down to 11 per cent. It chose not to because it wished to be seen to emphasise the importance it places on high quality advertising. Cheaper commission rates would, Unilever believes, ultimately have meant poorer quality advertising. That signal of confidence in the role of big-spending advertising was reiterated by Michael Perry, Unilever's chairman, who at the International Association of Advertisers' conference in Barcelona on September 29, said: 'Advertising is at the very heart of our business. And you can be sure that it will stay there.' Such an opinion from such a company should hearten not just Unilever's advertising agencies but those of other companies too. But if Unilever has made a very public commitment to its own marketing budgets, other companies - including Unilever itself - are privately much less certain that they are getting value for money from their advertising agencies, particularly in the field of press advertising. The first findings of a continuing study by the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers (ISBA), carried out in collaboration with the marketing communications company, Advertising Research Marketing (ARM), suggests that many ISBA members - companies which employ advertising agencies - are thoroughly dissatisfied with their relationship with advertising agencies. The study*, reflecting the views of 101 of ISBA's 750 member companies - combined, the participants spend more than Pounds 280m annually in press advertising - indicates that nearly three-quarters are highly concerned about creative and production costs. While they may have these concerns, some questions need also to be asked of the advertisers themselves. Only 30 per cent of the companies receive detailed invoices from their agencies. Invoices showing total bills only, with no breakdown of the work done and what it cost, were received by 35 per cent. While 85 per cent of the surveyed companies obtain estimates for the creative and production work from advertising agencies, only 20 per cent of the survey seek comparative quotes from other agencies, 'putting those companies who make proper use of estimating procedures in a position where they may know the price of most services, but have little idea of the relative value of what they are buying.' John Orsmond, chairman of ARM, says: 'This compounds the confusion of complexity, endemic to the industry's variable-cost conventions.' Furthermore, the ISBA/ARM study suggests that the traditional means of advertising agency remuneration - payment by percentage commission, usually close to 15 per cent - has collapsed. Just 49 per cent of the respondents now pay their agencies through the commission system, the rest by forms of retainer and time fees or separate charges, often stipulated by the client. Ken Miles, director general of ISBA, says that the survey arose from increased concern over press advertising production costs. 'A lot of advertisers are finding print production costs rising rather rapidly and they have very little idea of the real basis on which costs are placed and some of them are rather doubtful of the value they are getting.' According to Miles, there is a head of steam building up among companies which, particularly in a recession, are increasingly focusing on advertising costs. 'There is widespread agreement that the agency business is changing a great deal. There is some question over whether agencies are constructing charges in line with costs and traditional mark-ups, or whether they are charging what the market will bear.' One problem facing advertisers is the absence of industry-wide guidelines on what press advertisements can, or should, cost. But while it is difficult, companies such as ARM insist that it is possible for clients to find out precisely what it is they are paying for. By way of example, over the past 13 years ARM has developed fixed-cost mechanisms for clients, as opposed to the industry norm of variable costs. Miles says: 'I don't think there is a widespread set of circumstances in which agencies are ripping off clients. Nevertheless, any client company which doesn't bother to check is not doing their job very well.' And when surprising bills do arrive, one of the first to suffer is the reputation of the advertising agency; accounts are won on creativity but all too often lost on administration. ISBA/ARM's press inquiry is now moving into stage two, a detailed examination of actual costs specific to each stage of the creative and production process. The crucial stage three - a consideration of what to do with the information obtained - will come much later. Whatever the details of stage three, it is bound to signify yet another step in the trend of relative power shifting from advertising agency to client. While advertising agencies are far from being history, those that cannot adapt to the new economic hard-headed attitude of clients may not have much of a future. * From ARM, 1 McCrone Mews, Hampstead, London NW3 5BG.

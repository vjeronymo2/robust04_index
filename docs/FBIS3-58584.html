			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Martti Ahtisaari and Elisabeth Rehn are going  forward to the second round of the elections. Martti Ahtisaari  has 25.9 percent of the votes, Elisabeth Rehn 22 percent, Paavo  Vaeyrynen 19.5 percent, and Raimo Ilaskivi 15.5 percent. Then  there are the other candidates. There is quite a big gap to the  next one, Keijo Korhonen, with 5.8 percent; Claes Andersson with  3.8 percent; Pertti Virtanen 3 percent; Eeva Kuuskoski 2.6  percent; Toimi Kankaanniemi and Sulo Aittoniemi, both with 1  percent; and Pekka Tiainen with 0.2 percent.    Looking at the absolute number of votes, perhaps they will  stay in some people's minds. Martti Ahtisaari received just  over 800,000 votes in these elections, Elisabeth Rehn 700,000  votes, Paavo Vaeyrynen just over 600,000, and Raimo Ilaskivi  nearly 500,000. At a rough glance, there are just over 1  million votes to be distributed in the second round of the  elections, if we assume that everybody sticks to their  candidates in the first round, that is Ahtisaari and Rehn.</p>

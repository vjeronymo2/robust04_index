However, he announced that "for our part, we will continue  to  fight the occupying invaders under the leadership of our  guardian 'Ali Khamene'i."    He rejected "any settlement that leads to a peace with the  enemy at the expense of our religion, holy places, and land, as  we cannot relinquish our pride."    He added: "We will fight with all available means the  microbe  that has penetrated our body. We reject settlement, which  abolishes the identity of our Palestinian kinfolk and their  right of return."    He said that "the blood of our martyrs, the sacrifices of  the  young men of the Islamic resistance, and our kinfolk's  steadfastness in Jabal 'Amil and west al-Biqa' and our unity  will enable us to keep the jihad banner high and will help  President Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva to confront the leader of  world arrogance (U.S. President Bill) Clinton."    Concluding, he said "we have no doubt at all that the  results  (of the Geneva summit) will be in the interests of our glorious  nation, because Syria has proved its real commitment to  liberating all our usurped land as well as its complete care for  the mujahidin defending our territory and scared land."</p>

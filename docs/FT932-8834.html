			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Observer: Hope is not lost in NY What's the betting that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will appoint a woman to replace its outgoing chairman, Gerald Corrigan, who departs in August? In normal times, the front-runners would all be men, people like William McDonough, Corrigan's number two, David Mullins, the respected vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington DC, or regional Fed presidents like Richard Syron of Boston and Gary Stern of Minneapolis. These are not normal times, however, and the rumour mill suggests that the New York Fed may choose to shake things up a bit by picking Karen Horn, 49, the former president of the Cleveland Fed and current chairman of Bank One in Cleveland. Horn, who sits on the boards of BP, Eli Lilly and TRW, has experience of both public and commercial banking. She also won plaudits for resolving the Ohio savings and loan crisis when at the Cleveland Fed. She faces tough competition in McDonough and Mullins. The former was once vice-chairman of First Chicago, has advised the World Bank, and in his present position is responsible for the Fed's activities in the bond market and its implementation of monetary policy. As for Mullins, he is believed to be closest to Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan, which should count for something. He is also a native of Arkansas, President Clinton's home state - which may, or may not, help. However, Horn has a couple of things going for her. Consuela Washington's failure to get the chairmanship of the Securities and Exchange Commission means that the Clinton administration is under even greater pressure to give a top job in the financial sector to a woman. It's also worth noting that the New York Fed's search committee is, for the first time, headed by a woman - Barnard College president Ellen Futter.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Syria and Iran said they have swung their weight behind an Arab plan to bring  peace to Lebanon. "The Syrian and Iranian sides expressed support for efforts  to achieve a cease-fire in Lebanon, lift blockades, open Beirut airport, form a  committee to supervise the cease-fire and monitor ships to prevent the entry of  arms," said a joint statement, which reflected the main points of a peace plan  backed by an Arab League committee trying to end Lebanon's 14-year civil war.  Syria is the main foreign power broker in Lebanon; Iran took part in a recent  meeting that announced the formation of an alliance of Muslim and leftist  groups. Those forces have been fighting troops of Christian army chief Michel  Aoun since March.  </P></p>

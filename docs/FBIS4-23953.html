			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, June 19 (AFP) -- Pro-democracy students in  western Nigeria Saturday [18 June] staged a violent campus  demonstration, shattering the windscreen of the state military  administrator's official car, press reports said here Sunday.    About 2,000 students of the Federal University of Technology  in Akure chanted slogans calling for an immediate end to  military rule and installation of Chief Moshood Abiola, who  recently proclaimed himself president and commander-in-chief of  the armed forces of Nigeria, the reports said.    The stone-throwing students barricaded the way to the  convocation hall and prevented the state military administrator,  Colonel Mike Torey, from leaving the hall until he addressed  their demands, the reports said.    The students smashed the windscreen of his official car and  wrote Abiola's name on the sides of the vehicle.    Torey, who came to represent President Sani Abacha at a  convocation ceremony, later addressed the students, promising  that the government would address the issue of last June's  annulled presidential election during a constitutional  conference scheduled to begin June 27 in Abuja.    That election, claimed to have been won by Abiola, was  annulled by the regime of General Ibrahim Babangida for alleged  irregularities.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andrey Aderekhin: "Kuban Cossacks Against </F> Newcomers"]    [Text] Krasnodar -- The atamans and cossacks representing  the cossack societies of Akapaksiy, Primorskiy, Krymskiy,  Temryukskiy, and Slavyanskiy Rayons have sent an "open letter"  to the kray administration chief, the head of the internal  affairs administration, and the atamans of the all-Kuban and  Kuban cossack troops issuing a tough ultimatum.    "Our patience is at an end," the cossacks stated, protesting  at what in their opinion is the planned settlement of Kuban by  Caucasians. "And we resolutely inform you that to avoid an  ethnic explosion in our rayons you must take urgent steps to  expel those who, having arrived in Kuban, are stirring up  trouble, sowing interethnic hostility, and making the Kuban  people hostage.... Unless you take resolute steps we retain the  right to raise the people to a public tribunal against the  Caucasians who are violating our traditions and customs."</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alberta tries to boost oil drilling activity THE ALBERTA government has come to the aid of western Canada's struggling energy industry by substantially cutting royalties levied on oil and gas producers and by simplifying the 20-year old tax system. The cuts, which will cost the provincial treasury about CDollars 488m (Pounds 225m) over the next three years, are designed to stimulate drilling activity, which has slumped from 12,000 wells a year in the mid-80s to 4,000 last year. Furthermore, a restructuring of the tax system will provide for lower royalties as oil and gas prices decline. The present regime was put in place in the early 1970s when hopes were high that prices would keep on rising. Mr Art Hibbard, president of the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, said yesterday that, based on the amounts of money involved, the industry may drill another 500 to 600 wells this year as a result of the concessions. Mr Hibbard said the concessions 'are not a saviour or panacea for all our ills, but we believe the government went as far as it could'. The energy industry is also hoping that the sharp increase in North American natural gas prices this year and hopes that the oil price will remain at about USDollars 21-Dollars 22 a barrel will attract new investment in coming months. Under the new system, the base rate for royalties will be cut by as much as 13 percentage points. For new discoveries, the rate will drop to 10 per cent from almost 22 per cent. A one-year royalty holiday for oil wells will become permanent.</p>

Concerning the coffee issue, the  Salvadoran president has said that with the retention of 20  percent of exports, favorable results regarding international  prices are being achieved. He has said Colombia has an  important role in the participation.    [Begin Cristiani recording] We will continue to promote  certain cooperation and free trade mechanisms with Colombia.  During this short meeting, we talked about coffee. We made a  follow-up and an evaluation of the retention process, now that a  minimum price agreement was reached this week. We have seen a  favorable response regarding prices. We think it is going well,  and we believe we must continue to take these measures until a  stable price is reached. In this regard, Colombia's  participation is vital due to the impact they have on the  market. [end recording]    Concerning a free trade agreement with Colombia and  Venezuela, Cristiani has said all they are waiting for is the  settling in of the new Venezuelan Government, so as to promote  the trade negotiations.    [Begin recording] [Cristiani] We talked about a free trade  agreement between Colombia and Venezuela, and we talked about  Venezuela's situation with their new government, internal  problems, and the difficulties that may emerge from a quick  follow-up of the negotiations. We believe once President Rafael  Caldera is sworn in, we are going to continue trying to promote  the agreement. Both President Gaviria and I are interested in  reaching a free trade agreement between Central America,  Venezuela, and Colombia.    [Unidentified reporter] Did you talk about Gaviria's  candidacy to the OAS?    [Cristiani] We did not talk about that; we had already  talked  about it on the telephone. He is already aware of El Salvador's  position and that of the Central American countries. He has not  yet decided on his candidacy. He is still studying the  possibility of running, but we did not talk about it. [end  recording]    Finally, Cristiani said that even though President Gaviria  could be one of the candidates for the post of OAS secretary  general, Salvadoran support will not be given to him, because  the Central American countries have agreed to support the Costa  Rican foreign minister, Bernd Niehaus. If there were any  changes regarding the support given to the candidates, it would  have to be out of a consensus with the rest of the regional  countries, according to the Salvadoran president.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Arts: Upwardly mobile duo - Edinburgh International Festival / Patricia Morison visits exhibitions on the works of Robert Adam and Allan Ramsay THIS summer, Edinburgh commemorates two Scottish geniuses of the 18th Century: Robert Adam, who set out to be the greatest architect of his age and arguably achieved his goal, and the society portraitist Allan Ramsay. Such a monumental egomaniac as Adam would surely be pained to find that the bicentenary of his death is being modestly marked by three small exhibitions, only one of which - albeit the best - will travel to London. A mildly interesting show, Robert Adam and Scotland, has been mounted by the Scottish Record Office in the dome of the General Register House in Princes Street (until September 25). This is the most prominent of the city's buildings by 'Bob the Roman', as he called himself, and as such is well worth the visit. Nothing like so clear a case can be made for an over-designed and pretentious photographic show at the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (until September 17). Which leaves Monumental Reputation: Robert Adam and the Emperor's Palace (details below). This is a jewel of an exhibition. Admirably focused and put together with intelligence and wit, it is crammed with drawings, books, paintings and memorabilia. Ramsay's portrait of his young friend, Robert Adam, is one highlight, together with intaglio seals depicting Inigo Jones and Palladio which were used by the Adam family. Iain Gordon Brown's accompanying book (bargain of the Festival at Pounds 3.50) paints an unforgettable picture of Adam's genius for self-promotion. Residing in Rome on his Grand Tour, in 1757 Adam decided to produce an expensive archaeological book of the kind much in vogue. Emperor Diocletian's 3rd-Century palace in present-day Croatia, offered an exotic yet cheap location. The show's centrepiece is a vast model loaned from a Roman museum, and a helpful slide-show explains the influence of the palace on Adam's subsequent work. Edward Gibbon was right: elegance did triumph over accuracy. Adam was also guilty of presenting the book as all his own work when in reality it was a team-effort. However, examination of the set of proof plates recently bought by the Library has shown that Charles-Louis Clerisseau, Adam's long-suffering assistant, managed to smuggle his name on to a sarcophagus. Since the 1950s, Ramsay has been reinstated to first rank of British 18th-Century artists. Nearly 100 paintings and drawings, many still in private collections, make Allan Ramsay, 1713-84, a dauntingly large show. It will migrate from the Scottish National Portrait Gallery to London this winter. 'Mumpy' (Scots for grumpy) was Adam's nickname for Allan Ramsay, his friend during their time together in Rome. Not that Ramsay had much to grumble about. In six months before departing on this second Grand Tour, he had produced no less than 40 portraits. He became court painter to George III, albeit challenged latterly by Cotes and Zoffany. The fashionable world flocked to Ramsay as a portraitist abreast of the latest trends in Continental painting, especially French portraiture. He was notably good at graceful images of even plain women, Queen Charlotte being a case in point. As Walpole observed, Ramsay was 'all delicacy' compared with Reynolds's boldness and tempestuous colouring. It is a fair comment, and the effect of so many half-length society ladies in pink, white, and sky-blue, is rather cloying. Against them can be set Ramsay's most famous portraits, the informal images of Rousseau in Armenian costume, David Hume, Adam's second wife, Margaret, and his own black-jowled self-portrait. The semi-eclipse of his reputation came about partly because many paintings remained inaccessible in palaces and country houses. Partly, too, it was because he gave up painting in 1773 after he fell off a ladder and broke his arm while demonstrating how easy it would be to get out of the house if there was a fire. The last decade of his life was spent enjoying his substantial earnings and writing essays. Ramsay was no mean intellectual and wrote on architecture, poetry, politics, and foreign policy - a hawk, he urged a war of annihilation against the Americans. That Ramsay can now be seen in the round is due to the researches of Professor Alastair Smart, also responsible for this memorable exhibition. His book, Allan Ramsay, Painter, Essayist and Man of the Enlightenment (Yale University Press, 316pp, Pounds 45) is a well-written, fascinating study which brings Ramsay's world vividly to life. The quality of the colour plates does him no favours. In the exhibition, Professor Smart's long and impassioned advocacy of Ramsay is reflected in labels bossily insistent on the paintings' merits. More could have been said about Ramsay's workshop, influences, technique and, crucially, what he meant by 'the natural portrait'. But these are quibbles about what is a rewarding exhibition, the more so if you can catch it on home ground, almost in sight of Ramsay's famous 'Goose-Pie' house and his property developments up on Castle Hill. Cut-throat though the competition was, here is the proof that rewards were high for the upwardly mobile Scottish genius. Monumental Reputation: sponsored by Glenmorangie Distillery. At National Library of Scotland to September 30. Allan Ramsay: sponsored by Mobil. At Scottish National Portrait Gallery to September 27, opens at National Portrait Gallery, London, October 16</p>

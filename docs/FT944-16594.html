			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: C &amp; W hints Persistent talk around the markets that some sort of a deal is in the making at Cable and Wireless, possibly involving a demerger of the group's Mercury telecommunications business, was the catalyst for another surge in the shares. C &amp; W were the heaviest traded and best performing stock in the FT-SE 100 index, the stock racing up 20 to 415p. Turnover reached 16m shares, the highest since January. C &amp; W shares touched 538p at the start of the year, and where trading around 478p in August before plunging to 382p a week ago, plagued by worries about competition from the likes of BT's Cellnet and Hutchison's Orange cellular phone networks. Many analysts said stories of a possible demerger of the Mercury telecommunications business had been revived and were still wide of the mark by leading analysts but C &amp; W had expressed deep disappointment with the market's treatment of its share price. Dealers noted exceptionally heavy turnover in the shares recently and pointed to unusually heavy activity in out-of-the-money calls - indicating high speculative support. They also mentioned keen support from some big institutions, regarded by traders as having top quality contacts in the telecoms industry. A number of brokers have been promoting C &amp; W in recent weeks, notably Hoare Govett who yesterday maintained the shares were still undervalued.</p>

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: GEC in demand In an otherwise poor session, shares in defence and electronics group GEC bucked the market trend after a large institution moved to buy the stock. Fund management group Robert Fleming was believed to have issued a buy order for GEC. The institution was reported to have placed its order with BZW, which was known to have a large buying order early in the session. The stock responded by rising 5 to 329p, in hefty volume of 7.5m shares. Broker Williams de Broe yesterday reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock, suggesting it should be on a premium rating given its exposure to the cyclical cycle.</p>

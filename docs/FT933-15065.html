			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): DAX 1,800 breakthrough reversed at close THE question of the day was whether Frankfurt would extend its uptrend and take the DAX index through 1,800. Its limited success in this endeavour left bourses looking more sedate than they had done over the previous two days, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT failed to sustain its DAX breakthrough and the index closed up 13.71 on the day at 1,797.41 after a high of 1,804.56. It was still 5.9 per cent firmer on the week. Turnover was expected to remain high after Thursday's DM15.5bn. The Goldman Sachs strategists, Mr Sushil Wadhwani and Mr Mushtaq Shah, wrote yesterday that a short-term bubble was now probable, with underweight foreign investors continuing to be drawn in and a 1,850-1,900 range on the cards. 'However,' they said, 'valuation considerations suggest to us that the medium-term upside is likely to be relatively limited.' Meanwhile, non-cyclicals were allowed to shine with Allianz up DM43 to DM4,303, Deutsche Bank adding DM7.50 to DM725.50 and Schering DM24.40 to DM843. Mr Mark Tracey at Goldman Sachs said that Schering's merger of its agrochemical interests made it more of a pure healthcare company; that an important drug approval was expected imminently in the US; and a licensing agreement with Hafslund, of Norway was a third bull point on the day. However, there was still life in the cyclicals where Linde, the engineer, rose DM15.50 to DM810.50 and Volkswagen saw foreign interest as it rose DM7.70 to DM373.60. PARIS kept its attention fixed firmly on the currency markets as the franc slipped to a three-month low against the D-Mark. There were reports of intervention by the Bank of France to support the currency, rumours that the government was meeting to discuss the issue, and even speculation, particularly among US institutions, that France might leave the ERM to be able to cut interest rates independently of Germany. The CAC-40 index ended up 5.33 at 1,985.70, a gain of 2.3 per cent on the week. Morgan Stanley commented that a potential currency crisis was imminent as the speculators 'smell blood and the feeling grows that this time it will be politically and economically difficult for France to raise interest rates'. The brokers said that a further round of European rate cuts was necessary and forecast that interest rates would fall sharply over the next twelve months. Peugeot featured with a FFr17 advance to FFr635 as investors latched on to data which showed its share of the European market improving. Euro Disney eased a further 6.5 per cent following Thursday's dismal forecasts, falling FFr3.90 to FFr55.60. AMSTERDAM moved modestly higher, the CBS Tendency index finishing 0.7 up at 116.7, a week's rise of 3.7 per cent. Kleinwort Benson's Dutch team, writing in their latest research paper, continued to recommend a 'primarily defensive portfolio' over the summer. 'Last year's relative appreciation of the Dutch guilder,' they observed, 'will have a dampening impact on the recovery potential of corporate earnings'. Cyclical stocks remained prominent after Thursday's strong gains, with DSM up Fl 2.40 to Fl 95.10 and Akzo rising Fl 2.50 to Fl 161.40. The publishing sector also featured, with Elsevier up 60 cents at Fl 141.10 for a new year's high and Wolters Kluwer putting on Fl 1.10 to Fl 96.90 . MILAN was largely preoccupied by technical trading ahead of the expiry of options early next week. The Comit index closed marginally ahead, up 0.57 at 544.24, a week's rise of 1.1 per cent. Fiat continued to feature following disappointing sales figures released earlier this week and its announcement yesterday that it was to make more temporary lay-offs in the autumn. The car group's shares fell L120 to L6,405, before picking up slightly to L6,470 on the kerb. Telecommunications also featured with Sip among the day's most actives, up L15 at L2,701 and Stet gaining L40 to L3,650. ZURICH featured more profit-taking in UBS bearers, SFr12 lower on the day at SFr1,160 but still 4 per cent higher on the week. The SMI index finished at 2,402.7 with gains of 4.8 and 1.4 per cent respectively. BRUSSELS, one of last week's strong points, accelerated again after a period of digestion, the Bel 20 index rising by 16.35, most of the week's 1.5 per cent gain, to 1,301.56. VIENNA continued to follow Frankfurt, taking its rise on the week to 3.4 per cent with the ATX index up 9.37 higher at 868.39. STOCKHOLM continued in ebullient form on foreign buying, the Affarsvarlden index gaining 8.60 to 1,115.20, a week's gain of 2.4 per cent. ISTANBUL lost another 4.8 per cent as many investors took note of a government statement confirming that the budget deficit for 1993 is likely to be three times worse than previous forecasts. The composite index lost 513.9 to 10,275.3, a week's decline of nearly 15 per cent.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- July 9                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                 Open      10.30       11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1229.00    1227.35     1226.98    1230.11 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1276.65    1273.95     1274.89    1278.31  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                13.00      14.00       15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1228.92    1227.77     1228.98    1230.56 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1275.78    1274.82     1274.96    1274.12  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Jul 8     Jul 7     Jul 6     Jul 5     Jul 2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1225.73   1211.33   1203.04   1197.01   1201.31 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1270.80   1260.04   1257.80   1253.51   1259.19  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1231.22; 200 - 1278.52 Low/day: 100 - 1226.13 200 - 1272.87  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

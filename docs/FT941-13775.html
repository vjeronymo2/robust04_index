			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No need to shout Sir, I don't object to people who use mobile telephones to call from trains ('Impolite in the pub but fine on the train', January 20) - just those who are too stupid to realise it is unnecessary to shout over the intervening distance as well.

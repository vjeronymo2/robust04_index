			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gerardo Tena] </F>   [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 4 Jan (AFP) --  Samuel Ruiz, San Cristobal de las Casas bishop, spotlighted  today reports on the execution of rebel Indians by the Mexican  Army in Chiapas State, site of fighting in the past few days.    There are reports that certain guerrillas captured by the  Army have been executed, the bishop said during a news  conference. The bishop also said that it is "foreseeable" the  civilian population will be repressed by the Army, because there  has not been a delimitation of the battlefields where soldiers  are fighting the guerrilla Zapatista National Liberation Army  (EZLN).    The bishop, who held a news conference minutes before the  Air  Force bombed a hill in the outskirts of San Cristobal, said that  approximately 12,000 Army troops are deployed in the strife-torn  region.    The prelate, who is involved in the defense of human rights,  particularly that of poor Indians, said that the Army's massive  military response "seems to be a decision" to totally crush the  movement, and in this framework "there are many wounded people  who have not even been counted."    Ruiz called on the two sides to agree on a cease-fire so as  to begin negotiations with the church mediation to lay the  foundations for a concerted effort to end the conflict, which  broke out on 1 January when EZLN members violently occupied five  municipalities in the southern State of Chiapas.    He recommended that the situation be observed by national  and  foreign human rights observers, and he mentioned that Americas  Watch, Amnesty International, and Lawyers of Minnesota are  willing to come to the region to observe the situation.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Hutu refugees begin return journey to Rwanda: US army denies claims that food drops were off-target The tide of Rwandan Hutus seeking refuge in Zaire began to turn at the weekend, with thousands heading home as cholera took hold in the camps along the border, where up to 1,500 a day were estimated to be dying. Three US military aircraft yesterday made the first drops in a planned mission to bring food to refugees. A US army spokesman in Stuttgart said the drops, north of the border town of Goma, had been successful and he denied claims by aid workers that they had been off-target. Ms Alison Campbell, of the aid organisation Care, said the operation was 'a waste of time and resources of busy people in an emergency'. The air drops followed a visit to Goma by Mr Kengo wa Dondo, Zaire's prime minister, during which he reopened the frontier which had been closed since Thursday. Refugees cheered and some crossed back into Rwanda. Their return will be crucial to the new government installed last week in the capital Kigali by the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front, leaders of which say their top priority is convincing the more than 2m Hutus who have fled that their lives will not be under threat if they return. Those who are dying in Goma from thirst, hunger, cholera or exhaustion fled in fear of RPF reprisals for the genocide of the Tutsis conducted by the former Hutu government. 'The international community must help us persuade refugees they will be safe back home,' Rwanda's new prime minister, Mr Faustin Twagiramungu - himself a Hutu - said. The former rebels of the RPF have taken pains to appoint a mixed Hutu-Tutsi government to win the support of the majority Hutu population. As well as the prime minister, his deputy, the president and the justice minister are ethnic Hutus, and say they reject Rwanda's ethnic divisions. The new government promises to abolish the Rwandan identity card, which identified the holder as belonging to the Hutu, Tutsi or pigmy Twa ethnic group. As part of the aid effort, Israel said yesterday it was airlifting a field hospital, doctors and medical supplies to Goma. However, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and all relief agencies say the only solution to the humanitarian catastrophe in Goma is the voluntary repatriation of Hutu refugees. Mr Michel Moussalli, a special UNHCR envoy, said: 'We need expatriates, non-government organisations, UN military observers - the more the better.' However, there were reports at the weekend of disappearances, blamed on RPF forces in Kigali. Mrs Philomene Mukabarali, wife of former ambassador and moderate Hutu politician Mr Silvestre Kamali, said yesterday her husband had been abducted at an RPF road block in Kigali 10 days ago. The RPF denies holding him. Rwanda's new president, Page 3</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: No to parish pump society Sir, How much noise Bill Cash (Letters, November 13/14) and his parish pump society make] Of course the FT is correct that the name we use to describe Europe is unimportant] Anyone would think Cash and his like alone were defending the best interests of the people of the UK. It is high time that people making the wealth turned and told them that they do no such thing. The truth is that our economic and political future lies within Europe. Millions are toiling to make jobs and wealth in a large but keenly competitive market. They see the opportunities and work hard to turn them into profit. But people like Mr Cash seek to cripple us and suppress our commercial urges. Any fool but he realises that the European Union makes our job easier. The only sovereignty he seeks to protect is the right to sit in a parliament which grants itself extravagantly self-indulgent pay rises and makes no-hoper MPs feel important. He is a pest, he is wrong and he should be told in plain Anglo-Saxon terms to shut up or go away. Alex Robertson, Lange Leemstraat 268, B2018 Antwerp, Belgium</p>

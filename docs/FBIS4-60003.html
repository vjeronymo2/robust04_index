			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.  O free brother citizens in the brave city of Aden. Your Armed  Forces, who are defending unity and Constitutional legitimacy,  are advancing, with firmness and faithfulness, to pound at the  fortifications of the forces of apostasy and secession and to  save brave, steadfast Aden from the remnant soldiers of treason,  terrorism, and agentry, so beloved Aden can return to the  smiling face of the one united Yemen and resume its appropriate  position as the trade and economic capital of the Republic of  Yemen, in which goodness, security, peace, and stability will  prevail under the banner of unity, democracy, and Constitutional  legitimacy.    O free brother citizens in the brave city of Aden: Your  national, unionist leadership under the zealous national leader,  Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the  Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces,  is very concerned about the security and peace of all the sons  of the homeland, particularly the citizens in brave, lofty Aden.  They are waiting with patience for the moment of great salvation  at the hands of the forces of unity and Constitutional  legitimacy. These brave lofty forces continued their sacred  march toward brave Aden to save it from the pros of terrorism,  crime, and bloody liquidation, the forces of apostasy and  secession.    This is the last chance for all those who are misled by the  forces of apostasy and secession to join the ranks of their  brothers defending unity and Constitutional legitimacy, to  declare their loyalty to God, the homeland, the revolution, and  unity, and to step with all bravery and courage on the stupidity  of the forces of apostasy and secession. These forces, who are  taking their last gasp, want to set Aden on fire and destroy it,  as an expression of their grudge, stupidity, cowardice, and  meanness.    The danger facing our people in brave Aden comes from the  professionals of terrorism, crime, and destruction, the gang of  apostasy and secession, not from their unionist Armed Forces,  who are defending the dignity, life, stability, and security of  the people, protecting their unity, safeguarding Constitutional  legitimacy, and preserving blood, money, honor, and property  from the danger of the forces of apostasy and secessions, who  are using the bodies of our men, women, old men, and children in  the brave and heroic city of Aden -- through force, coercion,  threats, and violence -- as a human shield to protect  themselves, now that they have lost all their losing cards and  grown afraid of their future. They have only this rancorous,  barbaric, terrorist method that shows their disregard for the  lives of innocent people and their thirst to shed more chaste  blood, thereby recording a new chapter in their bloody  ill-omened history, which is already full of tragedies,  massacres, and bloody liquidation in which tens of thousands of  our innocent people were killed.    The forces of apostasy and secession know full well that  the moment of the fall of their criminal and terrorist scheme is  approaching and that the inevitable downfall of the symbols of  apostasy and secession in the quagmire of treason and crime is  imminent. Therefore, these forces will not hesitate to commit  rancorous acts of revenge while they are dying.    Hence, the sons of our people, particularly our free,  faithful brothers in brave Aden, must be fully alert and  vigilant to foil the last chapters of the treasonous and  secessionist conspiracy. They must be fully confident that the  forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy are very concerned  about the citizens' life, property, security, and stability. In  fact, this concern is greater than their concern about the lives  of their brave soldiers, equipment, and weapons. They are the  forces of the people who protect the people, their achievements,  security, stability, and Constitutional legitimacy. These  forces are for the people, not for an individual party, faction,  or separatist clique to protect their individual narrow  interests. They are the forces of revolution, unity, and  democracy which only aim their guns at traitors, rebels against  Constitutional legitimacy, and violators of people's options.    Therefore, the sons of our honest and unionist people in  brave Aden need to be aware of this important fact and to be  very confident and reassured that their brothers, the sons of  the Armed Forces -- the forces of unity, Constitutional  legitimacy, and democracy -- endeavor, with all honesty, love,  faithfulness, and concern, to save them from the tyranny of the  terror traitors, the advocates of apostasy, separation, agentry,  and treason. All honest civilians and military in brave,  unionist Aden should join the ranks of unity and Constitutional  legitimacy with all faithfulness, bravery, courage, and heroism  in order to write, together with their courageous brothers in  the Yemeni Armed Forces -- the forces of unity and  Constitutional legitimacy -- the chapter of freedom from the  nightmare of the forces of apostasy, separation, terrorism, and  treason, and to champion the will of their lofty, faithful, and  great people. Victory comes only from God.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (1): New agenda for world trade - Martin Wolf examines prospects for world trade after the Uruguay Round - the most complex and ambitious trade negotiation ever attempted LOOKING AHEAD: The ability of the industrial countries to adjust to emerging giants, such as China and India, must be in question.  If they fail, protection would probably be the outcome. From the beginning of next year, world trade is to be overseen by a new institution, the World Trade Organisation. Forget, for the moment, the fact that a successor to Mr Peter Sutherland, outgoing Director General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has still to be found. Ignore nagging doubts about whether the Uruguay Round will be ratified. Despite everything, it is far more likely than not that the US and European Union will resolve their internal difficulties and ratify the outcome of their seven years of hard labour. What sort of trading scene will the new body have to deal with? The starting point is the outcome of the Uruguay Round itself. The most complex and ambitious trade negotiation ever attempted, its completion was a remarkable and, on balance, hugely beneficial achievement. The commitment to bringing virtually all aspects of world trade under a single umbrella is particularly important. Gone is the special status granted for 33 years to textiles and clothing; gone is the virtual exclusion of agriculture from international disciplines; gone also is the purely ad hoc approach to the liberalisation of trade in services. Perhaps most important of all, there is now an integrated and more effective system of dispute settlement, something required by any effective international agreement of this kind. Nor should the trade liberalisation aspects themselves be ignored. There is, for example, a significant reduction in the level of tariffs: the average developed-country tariff on industrial products will fall by almost 40 per cent - from 6.3 to 3.9 per cent. Large reductions in developing country tariffs are also planned For all that, as Brian Hindley of the London School of Economics points out in a review of the round, it leaves some important problems in its wake.* Among them are: The potential for confusion if some countries choose to be members of the original Gatt (Gatt 1947), but not the WTO, while others choose to be members of the WTO, but not Gatt 1947. The weak obligations in the General Agreement on Trade in Services and the limited nature of the commitments to trade liberalisation in services. The possibly deleterious effects on the developing countries of the strong protection afforded to intellectual property. The very limited nature of the liberalisation of trade in agriculture. The long delays in liberalisation of trade in textiles and clothing, which is to be completed only by 2005, with most of the meaningful liberalisation postponed until the last few years. And, above all, the limited significance of the decision to tighten up on 'grey area measures,' such as voluntary export restraints, particularly given the failure to discipline the use of anti-dumping measures as a protectionist device. The global policy-making community must, however, do more than cope with what the Uruguay Round failed to do. Already there is a new agenda. One element in it is trade and the environment, on which a committee was established at the ministerial meeting in Marrakesh in April. Another issue being pushed by the Clinton administration, with French support, is trade and labour standards, a topic as controversial  - and potentially as threatening, particularly from the developing country point of view - as trade and the environment. Also being discussed as potential topics for inclusion in future negotiations are trade and competition policy and, still more tentatively, the treatment of investment. In addition, the WTO must negotiate membership for China, Russia and other former states of the Soviet Union. All this is the visible face of trade policy. Underneath it, there are two contrasting trends. Developing countries - long addicted to protectionism, demands for 'special and differential treatment' and non-reciprocity - have been liberalising their trade barriers, both unilaterally and within the context of the Uruguay Round, as is also true of former members of the Soviet bloc. More than 60 countries notified the Gatt secretariat of unilateral trade liberalisation during the course of the Uruguay Round. While these were mainly developing and former communist countries, their number included hitherto-protectionist Australia and New Zealand. Such liberalisation has made trade from - and to - the more outward-looking developing countries the most dynamic single element in world trade. Between 1981 and 1992, world trade grew at an average annual rate, in real terms, of 5.2 per cent (itself above the rate of growth of world output). But imports of developing countries in the East Asia and Pacific region grew at 7.8 per cent a year, while their imports from one another grew at the still more dramatic average rate of 14.9 per cent a year. For much of the 1980s, the Latin American developing countries were relative laggards. But signs of faster growth began to emerge there, too, in the 1990s, in response to policy reform. Thus the volume of regional exports rose by 7 and 9.5 per cent in 1992 and 1993, respectively, while the volume of imports went up by 18 and 8 per cent. Developing countries are looking increasingly outward, so following the advice long showered upon them by advanced industrial countries. Meanwhile, many in the latter have become increasingly dubious about the entire idea. During the course of the Uruguay Round, there emerged powerful protectionist pressures in industrial countries, as unemployment soared in Europe and the real wages of unskilled labour fell in the US. The influence of Mr Ross Perot in the last presidential election is one symptom of this development. The agitation against the Gatt in France is another. The academic literature on the effect of trade on wages and employment is vast and hitherto somewhat inconclusive. Most authors would agree that changes in technology have been more important for the demand for unskilled labour than imports from developing countries. But the ability of the industrial countries to adjust to the emergence of giants, such as China (already the world's 11th largest exporter) and India, must be in question. Should they fail, protection would probably be the outcome. This would then endanger the achievements of the Uruguay Round and even the WTO. Things would be still worse if, as seems plausible, the developing countries were to respond in kind. But if the pressure were to be resisted, the prospect for dynamic growth of exports to developing and former communist countries should be a golden one. This could even prove the start of an epoch of trade expansion as dynamic as that of the 1950s and 1960s. *Brian Hindley, 'Two Cheers for the Uruguay Round,' in Hindley and Deepak Lal (eds), Trade Policy Review 1994, (London: Centre for Policy Studies, 1994).</p>

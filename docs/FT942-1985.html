			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Flotation of 3i to go ahead despite weak stock market The flotation of Pounds 700m of equity in 3i, the largest European investor in unquoted companies, is to go ahead today despite the weakness of the London stock market, driven by strong interest from institutional investors. Institutional funds have bid for Pounds 1.2bn of equity, more than twice the Pounds 540m they are to be allocated. The bids were based on the offer price to be announced today by 3i, which is jointly owned by seven banks and the Bank of England. The company will announce that it is floating 45 per cent of equity rather than the 40 per cent envisaged earlier. Shares will be priced at slightly more than a 13 per cent discount to their net asset value, or about 275p a share. The weakness of the market since 3i announced its intention in February to float led to speculation that it might have to postpone. Yesterday's fall led to the postponement of an issue by Eurodollar, the car hire group, and other companies cancelling flotation plans. Advisers, however, have found strong demand for 3i shares in an informal 'book-building' exercise over the past few weeks. Large funds were asked to submit informal 'bids' for equity at various prices. Some 385,000 retail investors had registered for details of the share pricing by the deadline of Monday. That is thought to be the largest expression of interest by individuals in a flotation, except privatisations. One reason for institutional interest in 3i shares is that the company may enter the FT-SE 100 index this year. It would thus become a core stock for funds that want to hold a balanced weighting of the largest UK companies. The flotation also offers investors a chance to hold an indirect stake in a range of small and medium-sized unquoted companies. The company holds about 3,500 investments and invests some Pounds 400m annually. The level of institutional interest has encouraged 3i and its advisers to select a relatively modest discount to its net assets compared with other UK-listed investment trusts such as Electra, which is trading at a 17 per cent discount. But 3i is likely to argue that the price is fair because its holdings are weighted towards higher-return investments in small, unquoted businesses. It also believes that its regional branch network reduces its risks. If retail investors fail to take up the full 25 per cent of the offering, the company will allocate more shares to large funds. Failing that, they will be taken by Baring Brothers, the merchant bank underwriting the issue. The flotation will release cash for the high street banks that have owned 3i since its formation as the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation in 1945. Although the pre-registration among retail investors is not as strong as for privatisation - 2.8m new investors registered for details of the third tranche of British Telecom shares last year - it is higher than comparable efforts.

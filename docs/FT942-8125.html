From three operas Aix has had to reduce to one: a new production of Mozart's Die Zauberflote by its winning team of recent years, the conductor William Christie and producer Robert Carsen. An uninspiring selection of concerts will probably not be enough to tempt regulars back to this delightful town, though the food and general air of good living might. ALDEBURGH June 10 - 26 High Street, Aldeburgh, Suffolk IP15 5AX. Tel 0728-453543 Britten and Stravinsky are the featured composers with a wide range of their smaller-scale works on offer and a series of Stravinsky on film.

BATH May 27 - June 12 Linley House, Pierrepoint Place, Bath BA1 1JY. Tel 0225-463362/466411 This is the first festival under the auspices of the Bath Festivals Trust, launched to raise the profile of Bath as a festivals city.

Tel 0921-20221 This year's new Ring brings together arch-radical producer Alfred Kirchner and arch-conservative conductor James Levine, but its most controversial feature may turn out to be the designs of German illustrator Rosalie. John Tomlinson's Wotan and Deborah Polaski's Brunnhilde are carried over from the Kupfer production, and the new Siegfried is Wolfgang Schmidt. Giuseppe Sinopoli takes over as conductor of Parsifal. The other revivals are Tristan und Isolde and Der fliegende Hollander. Unless you are prepared to pay a heavy black market premium, it is now too late to get hold of tickets.

Tel 05574-492 0223 Fax 05574-492 0228 The opera festival at the Austrian end of Lake Constance has won an enviable reputation for artistic boldness, while preserving its appeal for tourist audiences.

Tel 0351-486 6666 Fax 0351-486 6307 With its great traditions and court palaces, Dresden has enormous potential as a festival centre, but recession and the cost of reunification are slowing the pace. The new festival director, Michael Hampe, has threaded a programme around August the Strong, whose accession as Saxon ruler 300 years ago heralded a golden era in Dresden's artistic life. Visiting baroque specialists include I Solisti Veneti and Concerto Koln, and there will be a chance to hear rare choral and operatic works by Telemann, Handel and Hasse.

The opening of the Festival Theatre, which at last gives the Festival a stage large enough to handle the grandest lyric theatre, also means that director Brian McMaster has another 24,000 tickets to sell. Beethoven is the festival composer this year and the first production at the Festival Theatre is Scottish Opera's Fidelio on August 15. Also appearing there is the Australian Opera in Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream, and those Edinburgh favourites the Mark Morris Dance Group from the US.

Making a return to the festival are directors Peter Stein and Robert Lepage. Stein presents a Russian cast in Aeschylus' trilogy Oresteia, which will last 7 1/2 hours, while Lepage gives a world premiere of his new work, The Seven Streams of the River Ota, the river which runs underneath Hiroshima. Among the other theatrical works on offer are Goethe's Torquato Tasso, about the 16th century Italian poet, in an English translation; JM Synge's The Well of the Saints from the Abbey Theatre of Dublin; and two Shakespeare plays, Antony and Cleopatra, performed in German by the Berliner Ensemble, and The Winter's Tale, performed in French by the National Drama Centre of Orleans.

Over 30 actors will play more than 400 characters on the vast stage of the Festival Theatre. Ticket prices have been changed, making the best seats more expensive but increasing the number of cheap seats. There will also be Pounds 5 'day seats' for certain major productions. The Festival still lacks a strong visual arts programme but the main summer exhibitions organised by the National Galleries of Scotland, in particular 'Monet to Matisse: landscape painting in France 1874-1914', will be on show throughout the Festival. In addition, of course, running concurrently with the Festival, will be the Edinburgh Fringe, the largest festival in the world and the national showcase for comedy; the Film Festival; and the Jazz Festival, as well as the Military Tattoo.

The most eye-catching events are rare performances of Chausson's Le Roi Arthus and Max Brand's Machinist Hopkins, plus the continuation of John Eliot Gardiner's Mozart cycle with Don Giovanni.

Tel 212-258 3212 Fax 212-261 8823 Istanbul's arts festival aims to stress the city's historic role as a bridge between Europe and Asia, but its programme is unashamedly western in origin. This year's guests include the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Gunther Herbig, the English Chamber Orchestra under James Judd and Dresden Philharmonic with soprano Hildegard Behrens. Valery Gergiev conducts the Kirov Opera Orchestra and Chorus in a series of concerts, and Roland Petit brings his Ballet National de Marseille.

Tel 08029-1819 Fax 08029-1828 The lakeside setting of Kreuth, a former court spa at the foot of the Bavarian Alps, makes this one of Europe's most peaceful and intimate festivals.

This year's programme is headed by Sviatoslav Richter and Martha Argerich.

Tel 01-251 4044 Fax 01-251 4060 Now in its third year, the Kyburgiade owes its unique atmosphere to the open-air setting of Kyburg Castle near the Swiss town of Winterthur, and to the participation of one of Europe's leading young string quartets, the Carmina Quartet.

LONDON, THE PROMS July 15 - September 10 Promenade Concerts Ticket Shop, Royal Albert Hall, London SW7 2AP. Tel:071-589 8212 The Proms are celebrating their 100th season. The temptation to look back over a century as Britain's largest music festival has proved irresistible and this year's programme comprises a survey of the people and ideals that have made the Proms so successful. Among the great figures of Proms' history allowed evenings in their tribute are William Glock, Malcolm Sargent and Henry Wood. The programme of 6 September 1900 is repeated in its entirety, an amusing historical exercise. The work of the Proms in encouraging new music is recognised by recalling past premieres by composers such as Maw, Bliss, Schoenberg and Britten. Among major premieres new this year are Maxwell Davies's Fifth Symphony and Tavener's The Apocalypse. The visiting orchestras include the Berlin Philharmonic, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Dresden Staatskapelle, Los Angeles Philharmonic and Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.

Focal points this year are a 70th birthday tribute to Swiss composer Klaus Huber, whose new piano concerto will be premiered by Andras Schiff, and a wide-ranging exploration of the way music is interpreted. Four different performances will be built around Schubert's Winterreise, including a new opera, augmented by offbeat events breaking all the rules of traditional concert form. The conventional side to the festival is as strong as ever, with leading orchestras from Berlin, Vienna, Amsterdam, Cleveland and Dresden. MALTA June 2 - 5 Manoel Theatre, Valletta. Tel 010-356 222618 Fax 356-247 451 This year's festival embraces music, architecture and the Maltese heritage.

Zubin Mehta conducts. The festival offers a retrospective on Jonas' first year as intendant in Munich, including Tom Cairns' dire production of Un ballo in maschera and Richard Jones' Jurassic Park version of Giulio Cesare. Cheryl Studer sings in La traviata, and Eckehard Mayer's new opera Sansibar can be seen in the Cuvillies-Theater. OSLO August 3 - 13 Oslo Chamber Music Festival, Inkognitogt 33, 0256 Oslo, Norway.

Theatre conditions are intimate, and picnics on the lawns of the Loretto-Hilton Center round off the amiable atmosphere. SALZBURG July 25 - August 31 Kartenburo der Salzburger Festspiele, Postfach 140, A-5010 Salzburg. Tel 0662-846682 Fax 0662-844501 The 1994 festival takes to the sky with the premiere of Stockhausen's Helicopter Quartet: while the composer controls the sound electronically in the Mozarteum, members of the Arditti Quartet will play their parts in four airborne helicopters. Back on terra firma, this year's flagship production is Don Giovanni, staged by Patrice Chereau and conducted by Daniel Barenboim, with a cast headed by Ferruccio Furlanetto, Bryn Terfel, Catherine Malfitano and Cecilia Bartoli.

Tel 057-514700 Fax 057-21866 No-one who visits Finland's premier summer festival can fail to be impressed by the stone castle courtyard in which it takes place. Poised on the edge of a lake, Olaf's Castle (Olavinlinna) is one of the world's outstanding outdoor locations for opera. The 1994 programme is one of the least distinctive of recent years, with a revival of last year's successful Macbeth and a visit from the Hungarian National Opera. Perhaps the festival is husbanding its resources for next year's big splash - a new opera by Finland's leading composer, Aulis Salinnen. SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN.

Tel 072-761098 Fax 072-760648 Torroella de Montgri is a small Catalan town six km from the sea on the Costa Brava, but it is not primarily a tourist resort. The town-centre is architecturally typical of the Emporda, the natural surroundings are lovely and numerous cultural activities take place throughout the year. The summer music festival mixes Spanish artists of the calibre of Giacomo Aragall and Jordi Savall with international guests such as the Franz Liszt Chamber Orchestra and the Choir and Orchestra of the St Petersburg Capella. WEXFORD October 20 - November 6 Theatre Royal, High Street, Wexford, Ireland. Tel 0353-53 22144 Elaine Padmore's final season as artistic director brings a classic Wexford trio of neglected operas: The Demon by Anton Rubinstein, La Boheme by Leoncavallo and Wagner's Das Liebesverbot. A full concert schedule includes recitals by Wexford's young singers, operatic scenes and late-night cabaret.

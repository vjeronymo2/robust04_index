			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 03, BNS -- The Russian Foreign  Ministry on Wednesday [2 March] called in the counselor of the  Estonian Embassy, Artur Laast, to deliver to Estonia a protest  over recent statements by Estonian officials defined in the  protest as "unfriendly" toward Russia.    The director of the 2nd department for Europe at the  ministry, Yuriy Fokin, delivered to Laast an oral protest on  statements by Estonian officials, and particularly, a speech by  Estonian President Lennart Meri in Hamburg on Feb. 25, a  representative of the Russian Foreign ministry said in a  briefing today.    Moscow characterized as "anti-Russian" Meri's calls on the  West not to trust Russia who, the Estonian leader said, is  continuing on the path of imperialistic policy, as well as  Meri's negative assessment of the activity of Russian  peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia. The Russian  Foreign Ministry says that Meri's statement about the role of  the Russian peacekeeping units, in particular, are aimed against  stabilization in the region.    "The biased character of the speech by Lennart Meri on the  whole lends proof to the opinion that the Estonian leadership is  using every opportunity to add rigidity to its position in the  relations with Russia," the Foreign Ministry representative said.    The Russian Foreign Ministry says that such statements by  the  Estonian head of state, made in a third country, "exceed the  limits of generally acknowledged international norms."    The Russian Foreign Ministry in the message delivered to the  Estonian diplomat "expressed hope that Tallinn would find  strength to stop shifting toward confrontation with Moscow." The  Russian Foreign Ministry says that responsibility for the  possible effects of such drive wholly lies with the Estonian  side.</p>

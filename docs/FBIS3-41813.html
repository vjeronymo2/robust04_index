The figures come as new evidence discloses serious  shortcomings in surgical practices in many hospitals. Hospitals  in Harrogate, Lancaster, and Eastbourne are among the riskiest,  with death rates from appendicitis and abdominal surgery more  than twice the average, while those in Chesterfield, Bradford  and Bromley are among the safest, with death rates less than a  quarter of the average.    Reasons for the variation are suggested by an investigation  into 2,700 deaths after operations in hospital, published  yesterday, which highlights dangerous practices by some surgeons  and ignorance of safety measures. The report by the National  Confidential Enquiry into Perioperative Deaths (deaths within 30  days of an operation), says that too many operations are being  performed at night by unsupervised junior surgeons on very sick  patients. Hospitals that lack staff and equipment to care for  patients safely are failing to refer them to specialist centres.    The report is based on confidential questionnaires returned  by more than 1,000 surgeons and aneasthetists. A quarter of  those approached did not co-operate. The report says this was  unacceptable.    TIMES NEWSPAPERS LIMITED, 1993</p>

The policy statement would articulate the Commission's position on the role of PRA in various regulatory programs and would communicate that position to the NRC staff, the public, licensees, and applicants for licenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff discussed its recommendations for a PRA policy statement in SECY&hyph;94&hyph;218, ``Proposed Policy Statement on the Use of Probabilistic Risk Assessment Methods in Nuclear Regulatory Activities.'' In SECY&hyph;94&hyph;218, the staff stated that an overall policy on the use of PRA in nuclear regulatory activities should be established so that the many potential applications of PRA can be implemented in a consistent and predictable manner that promotes regulatory stability and efficiency. In addition, the staff stated that the use of PRA technology in NRC regulatory activities should be increased. The increased use of PRA methods and technology is intended to complement and enhance deterministic-based regulations by using PRA technology in activities where methods and data are well understood. The staff believes the increased use of PRA technology would lead to improved risk-effective safety decisions and more focused and efficient use of NRC staff and industry resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission concludes that increased use of PRA techniques as an integral part of the regulatory decision-making process is now justified. Consequently, the Commission has proposed a policy to encourage the use of PRA and to expand the scope of PRA applications in nuclear regulatory matters to the extent supported by the state-of-the-art methods and data. An important aspect of the expanded use of PRA technology would be a strengthening of NRC's defense-in-depth philosophy by helping to identify and address weaknesses or overly conservative regulatory requirements for the physical and functional barriers. In its Staff Requirements Memorandum of October 4, 1994, the Commission directed the staff to revise the proposed policy statement and publish the proposed policy statement for public comment. The proposed PRA Policy Statement is scheduled to be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in November 1994 for a 60-day public comment period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

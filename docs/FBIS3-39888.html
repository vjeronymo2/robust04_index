Ten years later  came the unexpected decline: The party plunged to 3.9 percent  in the 1990 Bundestag elections.    A comeback now seems possible for the Greens (who have, in  the meantime, merged with the Alliance 90 [to form the Green  Alternative--GAL]). With a radically changed course, they even  want to achieve more than 10 percent in the super election year.  Polls are encouraging them. The institutes predict  double-digit results. The reason is that the Greens are  creating a new image. "Money instead of muesli" is their new  slogan. Former anticapitalists are suddenly turning into  convinced advocates of the market economy. Mass unemployment,  flexible working hours, and the privatization of state-owned  enterprises are central topics of the election campaign. "We  finally want to address economic issues," strategist Joschka  Fischer stressed. The head of the GAL in Hamburg, Krista Sager,  believes that the Greens might turn into a people's party. She  is confident that she will win the first direct mandate for the  Greens in the history of the FRG in the upcoming Bundestag  elections in the GAL stronghold Hamburg.    To achieve the high goals, the election campaign is being  planned strategically. For the first time, all land  organizations want to wage a joint election campaign. An agency  is currently coining glib slogans like "Green please." "Ecology  is no longer necessarily our priority." This is how Saarland  spokesman Hubert Ulrich described the new strategy. His party  wants to acquire a stronger profile in the economic sphere and  enter parliament again after the next landtag elections. To  everybody's surprise, the Greens in Saarland do not even rule  out an alliance with the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] led by  Environment Minister Toepfer. The environment minister is not  against this idea. "There are many points where cooperation  would be possible." He considers alliances between the CDU and  the Greens to be quite conceivable.    This is no isolated case: In Saxony, the Greens and the CDU  are also moving closer together. "Why should we not cooperate  with the Alliance 90," the education expert of the CDU in  Dresden, Matthias Roessler, asked. "We have a great deal in  common with many members of our old citizens movement." The  conservative Deputy Minister President Volker Schimpf expressed  a similar view regarding a coalition after the elections in the  fall. "Ninety percent of the functionaries support a coalition  between the CDU and the Greens," an insider stressed.    Things have reached a more advanced stage in Thuringia. In  the district capital, Meiningen, the Greens officially offered  the CDU nationwide cooperation for the first time.    The CDU group in the city parliament has already signalled  its interest. In the local elections on 12 June, the citizens  in Thuringia will, for the first time, be able to vote on this  unique project. An eastern model with export chances?</p>

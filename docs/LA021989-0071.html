			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P>  SOUL ON SOUL: The Soul Train Music Awards, which air here April 12 at 8 p.m.  on Channel 11, will debut a new honor category -- the Sammy Davis Jr. Award,  which goes to the year's outstanding live performer. The first recipient is  (surprise) Michael Jackson! Show organizers say Jackson will be on hand to  accept the award, which is more than they can say for Davis, who'll make the  presentation -- via satellite -- from Norway, where he has a concert  engagement. . . . Jeff Beck's new band is called Surprise Surprise. . . . Jules  Shear has cut a solo album (sans the Reckless Sleepers). Called "The Third  Party," it's due out later this spring on I.R.S. Records. . . . Babyface (of  the Grammy-nominated L.A. and Babyface production team) is at work on a solo  album for Motown Records. . . . One of our metal faves, Motorhead, has just  signed with Enigma Records. Expect a new album later this year. . . . Our Title  of the Week goes to Gang Green, the Boston skateboard-thrash band, whose new  RoadRacer Records EP is called "I81B4U," (a sly spoof of Van Halen's recent  "OU812"). . . . And Irish popsters Hothouse Flowers, who'll be at the Roxy for  three nights beginning Monday, will do an impromptu "busker" show at the Hard  Rock Cafe today. Starting at 1 p.m., the group will be on hand, donating a  mandolin to the restaurant's celebrity-instrument collection and giving away  albums to fans. . . . And our condolences to Ted Nugent, whose mother -- known  as Ma Nuge -- died recently of cancer. Ma Nuge had been a regular concert-goer  and written a teen advice column for RIP magazine. She'll be missed.  </P></p>

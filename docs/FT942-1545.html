			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / 'Historic' EU accord on works councils All European Union member states except the UK yesterday agreed after 24 years of wrangling on a law to set up elected works councils in up to 1,500 large trans-European companies. The councils are intended to ensure that workers' representatives in companies employing more than 1,000 people, and more than 150 in at least two member states, are consulted and informed on cross-border business decisions that affect them. A jubilant Mr Padraig Flynn, EU social policy commissioner, acclaimed yesterday's decision as 'a historic breakthrough' for workers' rights in the border-free single market. 'This flexible legislation is good for business and will improve competitiveness through better industrial relations,' Mr Flynn said. The UK is exempt from the directive through its opt-out from the Maastricht social chapter, under which yesterday's legislation was passed. However, just under 100 British companies operating on mainland Europe will be affected. A recent German study suggests that 450 German companies, 250 US corporations operating in Europe, and 220 French companies will be the most affected. Nearly 300 UK companies would have been in the net had it covered British territory. Attempts to count UK-based employees of British multinationals into the threshold at which the directive applies were jettisoned by the European Commission in April, then reinstated by the European Parliament, and rejected by EU labour and social affairs ministers meeting in Luxembourg yesterday. Mr David Hunt, UK employment secretary, said: 'I'm very pleased that it has now been accepted that the UK will not be forced to accept trade union-dominated works councils' which 'will impose unnecessary costs and bureaucracy on companies'. The revamped directive approved yesterday replaces the original Brussels plan for a uniform structure of compulsory consultation with provision for individual voluntary agreements at company level. The process is triggered when 'at least 100 employees or their representatives in at least two member states' ask for information and consultation procedures. If negotiations fail after three years, then a set of minimum standards in an annex to the directive will apply; if management refuses talks, the annex will be imposed after six months. Assuming the measure is rubber-stamped by ministers in October after a second reading by the European Parliament, and allowing two years for transposing the directive into national law, the councils should be up and running by the end of 1999 at the latest. Unice, the Euro-employers' lobby, said on the eve of the decision that 'this directive is being imposed on industry. . . thus violating the very principle of consultation that it seeks to endorse.' The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) said working people had waited a long time for this decision, which gave 'a new push to EU social policy'. This was the first Euro-law passed under the Maastricht social chapter, which could now be used to expedite proposals such as extending parental leave rights or the rights of full-time workers to part-time employees, both blocked by the UK. The UK yesterday also secured its four year derogation - a time-limited exemption Mr Hunt insisted on describing as an opt-out - for paper-boys and girls, covered by the directive ministers passed limiting the hours children can work.</p>

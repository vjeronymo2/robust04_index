			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 27(c)(2) of the Act prohibits the issuer of a periodic payment plan certificate, and any depositor or underwriter for such issuer, from selling such periodic payment plan certificates unless proceeds of payments on such certificates (other than sales loads) are held under an indenture or agreement containing specified provisions. Section 26(a)(2) and the Rules thereunder do not permit a deduction from the assets of a separate account for mortality and expense risk charges or distribution expense charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants represent that the mortality risk is assumed by virtue of the annuity rates and the death benefit guaranteed in the Contract; the annuity rates cannot be changed after issuance of the Contract. Applicants also represent that the contract administration charge will not increase regardless of the actual costs incurred. If the mortality or expense risk charges or the distribution expense charges are insufficient to cover the actual costs, Anchor National will bear the loss. To the extent that the charges are in excess of actual costs, Anchor National, at its discretion, may use the excess to offset losses when the charges are not sufficient to cover expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants assert that the mortality and expense risk charge of 1.25% is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed by Anchor National under the Contracts and reasonable in amount as determined by industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants state that these determinations are based on their analysis of publicly available information about similar industry practice, and by taking into consideration-such factors as current charge levels and benefits provided, the existence of expense charge guarantees and guaranteed annuity rates. Anchor National undertakes to maintain at its home office a memorandum, available to the Commission upon request, setting forth in detail the methodology used in making these determinations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Anchor National has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the Separate Account's distribution financing arrangement will benefit the Separate Account and its investors. Anchor National represents that it will maintain and make available to the Commission upon request a memorandum setting forth the basis of such conclusion. Anchor National further represents that the assets of the Separate Account will be invested only in management investment companies which undertake, in the event they should adopt a plan for financing distribution expenses pursuant to Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Act, to have such plan formulated and approved by their board of directors, the majority of whom are not ``interested persons'' of the management investment company within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. With respect to the distribution expense charge, Applicants represent that the aggregate amount of any withdrawal charges imposed and distribution expense charges paid, will not at any time exceed 9% of purchase payments previously made and that Anchor National will monitor each Contract owner's account for the purpose of ensuring that this limitation is not exceeded Applicants undertake to include, in the prospectus forming part of the registration statement for the Contracts, statements (1) describing the purpose of the distribution expense charge, and (2) that the staff of the Commission deems such charge to constitute a deferred sales charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants submit that the exemptive relief requested in the application is necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

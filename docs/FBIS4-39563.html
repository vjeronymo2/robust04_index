			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Viktorov: "Vladimir Shumeyko and Weapons: </F> Is There a `Bridge' Between Them?"]    [Text] The star of the former general director of the  Krasnodar measuring instruments plant started to be in the  ascendant on the political horizon in November 1991 when he was  elected deputy chairman of the Russian Supreme Soviet. In June  of the following year he joined the government -- immediately as  first vice premier. And early this year there was V.Sh.'s  "second coming" on the field of legislative power -- he was  elected chairman of the upper chamber of the new Russian  parliament -- the Federation Council.    It cannot be said that V.Sh. has outstanding professional  abilities. Outwardly there is no sign that he relies on any  influential political or economic forces. He has always stood  alone in the "democrats" camp but not, like some, by belonging  to B. Yeltsin's closest entourage. Coming from the directors'  corps, V.Sh. is not an expressor of the interests of the  military-industrial complex, and he is also a stranger to the  "raw material" and "agrarian" lobbies. Nor does he have any  authority in the "new business" milieu. What secures such  "tenacity" for V.Sh. on the political Olympus?    We do not want to draw conclusions, but some facts are  interesting in themselves.    An attentive observer may have noticed the regular proximity  of events connected with V.Sh. on the one hand and the "Most"  ["Bridge"] financial group on the other. Perhaps this is  fortuitous but it is a case of lightning striking more than once  in the same place.    The first example is connected with the NTV television  company created and financed by the "Most" holding. In the  summer of last year V.Sh. supported NTV's plans, speaking also  of presidential support for the idea of handing over the fourth  television channel "most likely to the 'Most' financial group  and several commercial banks which do not belong to it."    After the 3-4 October events V.Sh. was put at the head of  the  Ministry of Information and the Press -- and in October NTV  broadcasting on the St. Petersburg channel began. In late  December the decision to transfer the fourth channel to the  television company belonging to "Most" was finally made -- and  V.Sh. leaves this post (in connection with the ministry's  abolition). And a little later he leaves the government too.  On 17 January 1994 NTV began broadcasting as the owner of the  television channel, "timed" precisely for the moment when V.Sh.  won the hard struggle for the post of Federation Council  chairman.    A second example. In November last year the president signed  an edict on the creation of the "Rosvooruzheniye" state company  which monopolized all operations for the export and import of  arms and military equipment. The company swallowed up all three  relevant foreign trade associations and received the nickname  "Rosvor" ["vor" element of the name means "thief" in Russian]  perhaps from military-industrial complex enterprises  dissatisfied with its creation. V.Sh. was involved in this  edict, which is proved by his signature on the document. The  weekly KOMMERSANT even awarded V.Sh. the title of "founding  father" of the company. Moreover, V.Sh.'s former military  adviser -- Lieutenant General Viktor Samoylov -- was put at the  head of "Rosvooruzheniye." The principle of having "his own  man" operated in this appointment since Samoylov has  professional experience in a rather different field: Before  becoming an adviser V. Samoylov worked for nearly 10 years in  the Defense Ministry Main Cadres Directorate.    And after a while "Most" appears here -- as one of  authorized  banks of the "Rosvooruzheniye" company.    Analysts have drawn attention to the fact that the choice of  authorized banks is rather strange: They did not include those  who had any experience of cooperating with official arms  dealers. Not even the Foreign Trade Bank of Russia  [Vneshtorgbank]. Obviously the "top brass" had some reasons of  their own for this decision. Of course they did, for the status  of authorized bank imparts great responsibility. It was  KOMMERSANT again which reported that "Rosvooruzheniye" had been  allocated free credit for three years worth 1 trillion (!)  rubles for purchases of arms and military equipment from Russian  producers and that in April the money had already been  transferred to the accounts of the company, that is Most-bank.  You can understand yourselves that keeping such a sum involves  a lot of responsibility. What is interesting is that the next  month the government actually repealed the arms export monopoly  to establish which "Rosvooruzheniye" was created.    But let us return to the main subject and not a couple more  coincidences. One is serious: V.Sh. (he is also chairman of  the CIS countries' interparliamentary assembly) only had to  persuade the Azerbaijan leaders in Bishkek to sign peace  agreements on Nagorno-Karabakh and a week later the newspaper  SEGODNYA (also financed by "Most") reported that "Most-bank has  been authorized by the Azerbaijan Government to carry out  clearing operations between the two sides' enterprises."    There is another, simpler, coincidence (it could be  considered purely fortuitous were it not for all the preceding  information): The not unknown D. Yakubovskiy, who was also one  of V.Sh.'s advisers, after the noisy corruption scandal had died  down, registered a legal firm in Moscow whose clients include  among others the "Most" group.    Let us add a further series of "coincidences" (perhaps  fortuitous).    The middle of last year proceeded in Russia under the banner  of the struggle against corruption, at whose epicenter there  were two top officials -- Vice Premier Shumeyko and Vice  President Rutskoy. One half of the "fighters" poured "suitcases"  of compromising material onto the other, the other responded in  the same vein. A large part in kindling the conflict was played  by the figure of Yakubovskiy, whose importance was excessively  "inflated" but this made it possible within the tentacles of the  SEABECO "octopus" a certain trust contract allegedly signed by  the vice president. Eventually on 1 September 1993 by a  presidential edict A. Rutskoy and V. Shumeyko were both relieved  of their duties in connection with the investigation which was  being conducted into the "corruption case." It is well known  how all this ended. Why have I said all this? The point is that  former military pilot A. Rutskoy at the time had a marked  "weakness" for the sphere of military-technical cooperation with  foreign countries. During some of his visits there were  discussions of questions of supplying arms, and it cannot be  said this was without results.    Yet incidentally the potential for Russian arms exports in  monetary terms is billions of dollars (it can be measured in  rubles -- the figure of R1 trillion has already been mentioned  above and it is clear it is not the only figure)    Next, in the summer of last year Sergey Glazyev, the then  minister of foreign economic relations, only had to engage in  the introduction of order into the system of military-technical  cooperation resulting in the dismissal of the leaders of the  "Oboroneksport" all-Russia association for Glazyev to be struck  a "blow" whose initiator was V.Sh. A directive from the latter  caused the return of the aircraft on which a delegation headed  by the leader of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations was  setting off 20 August on an official visit to African countries.  The cancellation of the visit in this form is a fact  unprecedented in world practice and was an ostentatious insult  to S. Glazyev. As a result he tendered his resignation. It is  true that his resignation was not accepted and the minister  worked for a further month and resigned on his second attempt  when on 21 September at the same time as the publication of the  notorious edict no. 1400 the president brought back V.Sh. who  had been "temporarily suspended from his duties."    We cannot fail to note V.Sh.'s "talent" in the form of his  ability to put forward and use his "own" people. V. Samoylov  and D. Yakubovskiy are not the only examples. One more former  adviser -- Igor Shurchkov -- now heads the Russian Federation  state committee for industrial policy. And quite recently  V.Sh.'s fellow countryman -- Nikolay Yegorov, head of the  Krasnodar Kray administration -- was appointed minister for  nationalities affairs and regional policy in place of S.  Shakhray.    Everything that has been said above can be interpreted in  various ways but it is clear at least that V.Sh.'s "rear" is  reliable and he knows how to keep it well covered, and this  enables him skillfully to wage a behind-the-scenes struggle in  the corridors of power. And if V.Sh. is thinking of entering  the struggle for the post of president, then he can secure quite  good support -- both financial and organizational. And the post  of head of the Federation Council may very well be used for the  advance forming of the image of the "gatherer of Russian lands"  (which V.Sh. began to do in the middle of May). He has  virtually everything, he merely has to "play and win."    One wonders whether "Most" is not creating its information  "empire" with this game?</p>

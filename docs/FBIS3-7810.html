			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Lamper and Jaroslav Spurny: "Through </F> Tehran Into NATO, and Toward Full Employment"]    [Text] "Finally, we have clear rules of the game.  However, this will not protect the Czech arms factories from  being scandalized by foreign competitors, who have described the  Czech Republic as a `dealer in death.'" This is how Jan Vlcek,  director of the RDP arms consortium, commented on the government  bill on the export of military technology. The press published  this statement on 28 January 1994. By coincidence, the letter  in which Engineer Vlcek, in the name of the RDP Group, asks  Minister of Industry Dlouhy for help in obtaining arms export  licenses to Iran bears the same date.  <H5>  This Is Not Your Business </H5>   As recently as mid-January, the RDP management vehemently  denied any contacts between their company and the Iranian  regime. "That is just rumor and gossip. We are sticking to the  line of Czech foreign policy," Director Vlcek told RESPEKT at  the time. Shortly after that, it became clear that the contrary  was true. Documents confirming that Lubomir Soudek, Skoda  director general and chairman of the RDP Presidium, had held  talks on possible deliveries of surface-to-surface missiles and  the modernization of T-72 tanks with Iranian Government  officials in Teheran at the beginning of December of last year  were published (see RESPEKT No. 3/94 for details). When this  fact surfaced, the arms producers kept a cool head. "It is no  one's business what negotiations we are conducting, and with  whom. If someone wants to make an affair of it, then he should  not be surprised if the unemployment rate goes up," Soudek told  reporters.    The official reaction was unequivocal: The RDP Group's plan  regarding Tehran is doomed to failure because it is impossible  to acquire export licenses for military technology to Iran at  this time. On 18 January, MLADA FRONTA DNES even quoted an  "anonymous source from diplomatic circles," who said: "If Mr.  Soudek behaves like this in Iran after the bill on arms exports  is passed, his activity could be considered criminal."    Ten days after this statement, Jan Vlcek wrote his letter to  the minister of industry, and, within the next 10 days, the said  bill passed. Vladimir Dlouhy submitted the arms consortium's  request to his three colleagues from the government (the  interior minister, defense minister, and foreign minister).  According to Engineer Fritzl of the Licensing Office of the  Ministry of Industry and Trade, their opinion is awaited.  Reportedly, the official rejective stance on military trade  with Tehran has not changed. The RDP chiefs are equally  committed, however.  <H5>  An Untrustworthy Man </H5>   According to military experts, the only thing the RDP Group  can do is to persist. Their most ambitious program--to  modernize the T-72 tank in cooperation with French partners--has  oriented them, from the very beginning, toward very risky  markets. There are about 8,000 [T-72 tanks] in the world that  are of Soviet origin. Of these, about half are in the countries  of the former Warsaw Pact, and the rest in countries such a  Syria, China, Iran, and Iraq. Several pieces are also in NATO  states--for instance, the United States has four, but these  tanks are antiques to be put on display in museums, and the  owners do not want to modernize them.    When Lubomir Soudek and Jan Vlcek established the arms group  in the summer of last year, their plans were mainly based on the  orders of the Czech Army. It was expected that the RDP Group  would use the know-how of the French firm SOFMA while  modernizing domestic machines. The Army, however, turned down  the offer. According to the officials from the Defense  Ministry, economic reasons played their role when the decision  was made (the adaptation of one tank costs 45 million korunas  [Kc] in RDP prices, which would swallow the whole 1994 Army  budget if we wanted to modernize all of the 540 tanks of our  Army), as well as personal reasons. "Mr. Vlcek is an  untrustworthy man and his personality is unacceptable to us,"  Defense Ministry Spokesman Zdenek Borkovec says. Minister  Baudys is of the same opinion: "The RDP Group director general  is suggesting utilizing the capacity of our Army, without ever  discussing this subject with the Army. In view of the  questionable trading activities of the consortium, I consider  the participation of the Czech Army in these projects as quite  out of the question."  <H5>  Partners in the Background </H5>   Foreign markets are absolutely not interested in the arms  the  manufacturer is unable to sell even to the Army in his country.  Countries whose reputations are such that no one can openly  offer them anything are the only exception. Trade with them may  be lucrative, but there is a catch. When they come to light,  they mean a scandal for the exporting country. The perseverance  with which the RDP Group is pushing for its Iranian contract  shows that the management of the consortium decided to take  risks. Reportedly, they have already invested Kc10 million in  the T-72 modernization program without having moved a single  step forward. The efforts to sell "repair lines" to Iran are  seen by experts as logical. The experts, having applicable  documentation, could, on Vlcek's call, make the first steps  toward the conclusion of the main deal: Adjustment of the  Iranian T-72's on the basis of French technology and know-how.    "The French partners to the RDP Group play a key role in  the intended trade. Their profit would be adequate, but they  would bear practically no risk," an official from the Ministry  of Industry and Trade Licensing Department told RESPEKT  reporters. If the deal fails, nothing will happen. SOFMA has  offered its know-how not only to the Czech arms manufacturers.  It has successfully sold it to Poland and Slovakia, and  negotiations with the Bulgarians are reportedly under way. If  Soudek's and Vlcek's RDP obtains the license, SOFMA will get on  the Iranian market, something it cannot do for the time being.  Only the Czech side bears the risk of the possible scandal.    According to available statements from responsible  officials,  it seems that the contract with Iran will not be authorized.  "The fact is, however, that a very intensive lobby is being  established here. They will try to push for their interests as  much a possible," Engineer Samek, supreme director of the  Licensing Administration, commented on the course of the "Iran  case." Information provided to RESPEKT confirms his words  indirectly. Apart from Iran, the RDP Group also offered to  modernize Syria's "72's." This happened during Director Vlcek's  trip to Damascus last summer. Syrian General Hussain Al Ali came  to Prague to confirm the deal at the beginning of November. The  RDP Group management refused to answer any questions on the  matter.</p>

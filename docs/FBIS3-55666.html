Chairman Tunne Kelam admitted internal  conflicts and assured that the party strengthened itself and  also maintained its supporters (approximately 1,000 members).  Kelam described the ERSP as more centrist and orientated at the  national identity than the "Fatherland". Juri Adams stressed  the need for the cabinet reshuffle, Kelam pointed out that the  government made a major move towards "a real politicians'  government." Viktor Niitsoo criticised Toomas Sildmae's  performance at the Economy Ministry, claiming that the ministry  had submitted only one "low-quality" draft law to the Riigikogu  [parliament] last year. Adams added that the "Fatherland" had  been forced to admit Sildmae's unsuitability and claimed that  Estonia "will lose nothing" by his resignation.</p>

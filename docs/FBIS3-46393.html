			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "How Can the Memorandum of Understanding on the </F> Airport Project Be Tampered With?"]    [Text] A spokesman for the British Hong Kong Government  issued a statement yesterday. It contained the following three  points: First, it arbitrarily regarded the constantly soaring  airport construction costs as "reducing costs" and having  achieved "cost control." Second, it regarded the borrowings of  the Provisional Airport Authority and the Mass Transit Railway  Corporation [MTRC] as conforming to the memorandum of  understanding [MOU] on the airport project and the 45 billion  dollar debts left to the special administrative region [SAR] as  "not government borrowings." Third, it regarded all contracts  unilaterally signed by the British Hong Kong Government, which  straddle 1997 and which are not approved by the Chinese side, as  conforming to the Basic Law and called for SAR government  protection.    This is a blatant revelation of the British colonialists'  fraudulent diplomatic tricks and serves as lively teaching  material in modern bandit diplomacy. When signing agreements  with Britain in the future, all governments should be more  clever. They should first study clearly how the British  Government has failed to keep its word in the past, how  changeable it has been, and how it has perpetrated frauds,  confounded black and white, and willfully tampered with or  distorted agreements, lest they should be taken in.    In the joint declaration and the MOU on the new airport  project, the British Government has made a commitment, namely,  with regard to all matters straddling 1997 which require the SAR  government to take responsibilities and fulfill obligations and  which involve the transfer of power, China and Britain must  first discuss and examine them, reach a consensus, and come to  an agreement. How can it now say that, in the absence of  agreement from the Chinese side, all contracts unilaterally  signed by the British Hong Kong Government can go beyond 1997?  If such is the case, is it not possible for the British Hong  Kong Government to change the names of the governor as well as  the Executive Council into the Hong Kong Administrative and  Economic Corporation, and then sign a 53-year contract with  Chris Patten to enable him to serve as general manager of the  company. In this way, cannot the colonialist governor hang on  in Hong Kong for a long time? If the chief secretary, financial  secretary, and all departments at the secretariat, directorate,  and bureau chief levels can be corporatized in the wake of the  Legislative Council hastily passing the so-called "Corporate  Regulations," and then the British Hong Kong Government signs  contracts on all administrative posts without regard for the  nationalities of those holding the posts and gives all of them  enormously high salaries and unsupervised power, is it not  possible to extend the British colonial rule forever? Will there  still be China's sovereignty over Hong Kong to speak of by 1997?  The British Hong Kong Government's theory that "the contracts  straddling 1997 which it has unilaterally signed conform to the  Basic Law" is, in fact, a British theory of unlimited  sovereignty. It totally contravenes the principle of power  transfer outlined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration.    The "theory of not government borrowings" is also quite  preposterous. We should be thankful to the British Hong Kong  Government for advocating at this moment the fallacy that "the  Hong Kong Government itself does not incur debts" because it  enables people to see clearly the motive behind the British Hong  Kong Government move to suddenly change the "Airport Authority"  laid down in the MOU into an "Airport Corporation." The secret  is that the Airport Authority is still a framework of the Hong  Kong Government and that, by changing the signboard and turning  it into a corporation, the British Hong Kong Government can  sidestep the clause that "government borrowing should not exceed  5 billion dollars" as stipulated in the MOU. This is only a  clumsy trick employed by a swindler to escape by a cunning  maneuvering. Despite the changes, the "corporation" is still a  variety of the Hong Kong government framework. The British Hong  Kong Government still wholly owns its assets, works out its  regulations as it pleases, and appoints its administrative  personnel, and "the corporation can borrow as much as it wants."  Unexpectedly, the British Hong Kong Government still says this  is in keeping with the MOU and that "this is not government  borrowing." Is this not a flagrant violation of international  law?    According to international law, the transfer of power must  include the transfer of all government assets. Otherwise, it is  tantamount to tearing up an agreement on the transfer of power.  The assets of the MTRC and the Airport Authority belong to the  Hong Kong Government. When money is borrowed with these assets  as collateral, it will certainly lead to changes in Hong Kong  Government assets. This is the same as government borrowing  because the Hong Kong Government must be responsible for the  clauses on the borrowing by either making repayments itself or  allowing the banks to confiscate the collateral. If the British  Hong Kong Government deliberately creates a situation in which  the project cannot be finished as scheduled and the MTRC and the  Airport Authority are unable to repay debts, the SAR government  must inject funds to repay the debts. Therefore, the Hong Kong  Government's argument that "this is not government borrowing" is  logically untenable.    Even according the existing common law, a parent company  must  implement a takeover agreement when the company rights are  transferred to a new boss. It should not borrow a lot of money  and use it up, still less should it regard the debts of a  subsidiary as "having nothing to do with the parent company."  The fact that the Hong Kong government spokesman has trampled  the law to such an extent can only show that the Hong Kong  Government is in the wrong in terms of legal principle and that  it resorts to unilateral, reckless acts in looking for a way out.    In his statement, the Hong Kong Government spokesman has  consistently evaded the most substantive issue, i.e. whether it  is necessary to abide by the series of agreement reached between  China and Britain. It will not do to quibble and make a scene  by tampering with the MOU and quietly changing names, for it  only serves to lay bare even more the evil intentions of the  Hong Kong Government in failing to keep its word. It is clearly  stated in the MOU on the airport project: "Debt in excess of 5  billion dollars can only be incurred after both parties reach a  consensus on the debt proposal." According to this clause, the  British Hong Kong Government cannot borrow in excess of the  amount for the airport project, nor can it borrow in excess of  the amount in the name of its fully funded and controlled  corporations. By refusing to take the correct path of making  more capital injections, the British side cannot but come to a  dead end.</p>

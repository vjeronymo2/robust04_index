			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BUSH DECLARES KILAUEA'S PATH A DISASTER AREA  </P> <P> President Bush Friday declared a major disaster on the island of Hawaii, where  Kilauea volcano has destroyed 139 homes and caused an estimated $61 million in  damage, Gov. John Waihee announced.  </P> <P> The President's action makes federal funding available to affected individuals  and local governments. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will coordinate  the effort and designate specific areas eligible for aid.  </P> <P> "Assistance can include temporary housing, grants, low-cost loans to cover  uninsured property losses and other programs to help individuals and business  owners recover from the effects of the disaster," the White House said.  </P> <P> "Federal funding also is available to eligible local governments on a  cost-sharing basis for the repair or replacement of public facilities damaged  by the lava," the announcement said.  </P> <P> Waihee hailed the President's action and said the state would link up  immediately with federal and county officials to coordinate recovery operations  on the "Big Island."  </P> <P> Waihee said he was also grateful that the action was made effective Jan. 24,  1983, when the volcano started its devastation, and that officials had  recognized that this had been "a unique, slow-moving disaster."  </P> <P> Bush's letter to Waihee said "We will also be asking the state to develop an  appropriate mitigation solution to prevent future damage."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, civil defense authorities ordered the evacuation of some of the few  remaining homes in Kalapana as a new lava flow snaked down the volcano's slopes  and completely cut off the Kalapana Gardens housing area.  </P> <P> Civil defense spokesman Lanny Nakano said the molten rock crossed Highway 130  about 7 p.m. Thursday, followed the road for about 15 yards, and then headed  downslope into the deserted housing area.  </P> <P> He said the lava crossed Lokelani and Leilani streets at about 11 p.m.,  Lokelani was the final entrance to Kalapana Gardens that had been untouched by  the flows that destroyed most of the development.  </P></p>

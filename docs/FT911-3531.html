			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / The Council Tax: Cheers and some relief from the party faithful - Commons The outcome of the next general election will be influenced by the electorate's acceptance or rejection of the new council tax announced yesterday. Plans have also been published for streamlining local government by introducing a single tier of authorities in place of many county and district councils. FT writers report on the proposals and their implications GOVERNMENT supporters showered congratulations on Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, in the Commons yesterday when he promised to bury the poll tax and replace it with a council tax with a 'property and personal element'. Any lingering doubts on Tory benches about the effectiveness of the long-awaited funeral arrangements were dispelled by Mr Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor, whose objections to the introduction of the poll tax were overruled by Mrs Margaret Thatcher when prime minister. Ministers and Conservative backbenchers were clearly relieved when Mr Lawson, who recently warned of the political perils that would be associated with a replacement identifiable as 'son of poll tax', joined the welcome given to Mr Heseltine's proposals. Mr Lawson said there would be widespread relief that the government had had the courage to 'consign the poll tax to oblivion' and to take a firm decision that its successor should be property-based. Labour's relatively unsuccessful attempt to give Mr Heseltine a rough ride was led by Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, who emphasised that the poll tax, with all its unfairness, would continue until 1993. To cheers from Labour colleagues, Mr Gould protested that the new local tax would be 'skewed' to protect the rich from paying their fair share. Mr Heseltine repeatedly underlined the government's determination to 'intensify the capping regimes' to ensure high-spending, Labour-controlled councils could not force up the new tax to unacceptable levels. Mr Gould suggested that the allocation of properties in England to seven different valuation bands reflected the 'seven strands' of opinion in Mr John Major's divided cabinet, which was too weak to kill the poll tax outright. While deploring the government's failure to say 'sorry', he interpreted Mr Heseltine's announcement as an admission that the poll tax had been a disastrous mistake, costing the taxpayer Pounds 18m a day. Mr Gould scoffed: 'The party that brought us the head tax now offers us a stand-on-your-heads tax, but whether it is heads or tails, the British people remain the losers.' The new local tax, he said, was the outcome of a disreputable union between the poll tax and political panic. Mr Gould argued that the only consultations about the new local tax that really mattered would take place through the local government elections on May 2 and the coming general election. Amid further Labour cheers, and Tory jeers, he forecast that the voters would 'kill off this Tory tax once and for all by electing a Labour government'. Mr Heseltine contrasted the 'certainty' of the government's proposals with Labour's 'fair rates' alternative, which he claimed would involve returning to the old rating system prior to a further upheaval leading to the introduction of a different tax a year later. He also insisted that a Labour government would not act to curb spendthrift councils. Sir Norman Fowler (C, Sutton Coldfield), another former cabinet minister, provided further reassurance for government supporters by likening the reaction of Labour MPs to a recognition that 'their fox has been shot'. For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Alan Beith said the product of Mr Heseltine's announcement was not 'the son of poll tax but the son of rates'.</p>

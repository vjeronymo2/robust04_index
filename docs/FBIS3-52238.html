"The recognition reflects allegiance by the Christian  spiritual leadership to zionist hegemony," the front said in a  statement received by AFP.    "It also reflects the zionist movement's success in  Judaizing  the western church and exploiting its leadership to achieve  zionist objectives," it said.    Israeli and Vatican officials said the agreement, which was  signed in Jerusalem on Thursday, avoided the status of East  Jerusalem which has yet to be determined in Israeli-PLO  negotiations.</p>

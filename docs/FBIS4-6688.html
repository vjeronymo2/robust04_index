			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- Nearly 70 percent of  Japanese and 50 percent of South Koreans polled say the United  States is the most important country in international relations,  a survey jointly conducted by Japanese and South Korean think  tanks said Thursday [21 April]. Both the Japanese and South  Koreans said Japan is the second most important country,  according to the poll, conducted last October among 300 people  in Tokyo and 300 people in Seoul, all aged 25 to 45.    The survey was jointly carried out by the Dentsu Institute  for Human Studies, affiliated with the Japanese advertising  agency Dentsu Inc., and the Hanbek Foundation, South Korea's  leading private think tank. It showed how citizens in the two  countries view each other in such fields as politics, economy,  society, culture, corporations and human relations.    Regarding a question on what was considered South Korea's  most famous company in Japan, 12 percent of the Japanese said  "Hyundai," followed by "Samsung" at 9 percent and "Lotte" at 8  percent.    Meanwhile, 40 percent of the South Koreans said "Sony" when  asked to choose the most famous Japanese firm in South Korea,  with 12 percent opting for "Mitsubishi" and 4 percent each  selecting "Toyota" and "Honda," the survey said.    The survey also asked, "Would you do overtime work even on a  wedding anniversary day?" Fifty percent of the Japanese said  they would stay at the office rather than go home, while 50  percent of the South Koreans answered, "It depends on the  situation."    Regarding AIDS as a social issue, 88 percent of the Japanese  and 64 percent of the South Koreans said it is "serious."    The survey was released for a symposium held Thursday in  Tokyo titled, "The Outlook for 2005 in East Asia."    Ten panelists from Japan, South Korea and China took part,  including Heita Kawakatsu, a professor at Waseda University and  Kim Yong-wun, president of Hanyang University of South Korea.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLORADO ROLLS PAST JAYHAWKS  </P> <P> Senior tailback J.J. Flannigan, substituting for injured starter Eric Bieniemy,  rushed for 178 yards in 10 carries and scored three touchdowns to lead  third-ranked Colorado past Kansas, 49-17, Saturday.  </P> <P> Quarterback Darian Hagan added 118 yards rushing and two more touchdowns as the  Buffaloes raised their Big Eight record to 3-0 and overall mark to 7-0 -- the  first time a Colorado team has won its first seven games since 1937.  </P> <P> Kansas, unable to score a touchdown until the fourth quarter, fell to 2-5  overall and 0-3 in the conference.  </P> <P> Flannigan, getting his first start of the season because leading-rusher  Bieniemy suffered a broken leg last week, had scoring runs of four, 41 and 64  yards to give the Buffaloes a 42-3 lead early in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Hagan put the Buffaloes ahead, 7-0, with a 13-yard run on Colorado's first  possession, and Flannigan's second-effort from four yards made it 14-0 with  5:44 left in the half.  </P> <P> After a Jayhawk fumble, Hagan and Flannigan combined on a 41-yard scoring play,  with Flannigan taking Hagan's delayed pitchout at the 25-yard line.  </P> <P> Kansas cut the deficit to 21-3 on the final play of the half when Brad Fleeman  kicked a 42-yard field goal.  </P> <P> Colorado then scored on three of its first four possessions of the second half,  highlighted by Flannigan's 64-yarder late in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Kansas got two touchdowns in the final period, on two-yard runs by John Henry  Johnson and Tony Sands.  </P></p>

According to Churkin, the meeting withdrew all remaining  ambiguities and questions as to Russia's joining "Partnership  for Peace." "The question was how to make the best use of the  cooperation with the North Atlantic alliance envisioned by the  program," Churkin was quoted as saying. Today Russia sees no  ambiguities and obstacles for the program to function at a  larger scale, Churkin added.    The deputy minister said it was necessary to sign a  framework  document and agree on specific areas of cooperation for Russia  to join "Partnership for Peace." "Now Russia needs to decide who  and when will sign the framework document," the Russian  diplomat said.    Commenting on the combat jets shot down this morning,  Churkin  said the Bosnian government had been in great amazement when the  Russian Foreign Ministry asked it for explanations. "Bosnian  planes had no need to bomb Travnik as it is an area of clashes  between Croatians and Moslems," Churkin was quoted as saying.  However, "whoever it was who flew above Bosnia, he violated a  resolution of the UN Security Council and bears the entire  responsibility for what happened," the deputy minister noted.</p>

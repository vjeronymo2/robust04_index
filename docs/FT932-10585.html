			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (15): Protectionism falls - Towards customs union IT HAS been a rude awakening. This spring, Turkish industry has suddenly realised that customs union with the European Community is no longer a political catch-phrase but an impending commercial reality. How are Turkish corporations handling this? When the 1993 import regime was being prepared, their traditional strategy - visiting their friends in the under-secretariat of treasury and foreign trade, and pleading their case for 50-100 per cent customs barriers - proved inadequate. True, a few industries, such as household electronics, were able to gain a temporary respite. But the average level of protectionism against EC industrial goods fell by over one quarter, from 21.6 per cent to 15.2 per cent, according to initial Community calculations. Industry now accepts that this was not a one-off blow, but part of an irreversible drift to full customs union. This is due in 1995, according to the Turks' interpretation of current treaties, and in 1996, according to Brussels. The response of Turkey's largest commercial group, Koc c has been to make a zero tariff regime a central assumption of its strategy, Koc 2000. The group has six main divisions: automotive (it produces 55 per cent of Turkey's cars), durable goods, consumer products, construction and mining, energy, and trade and tourism. Customs union could particularly hit its dominance of Turkey's white and brown goods market, each of which racked up turnover of around Dollars 2.5bn in 1992. It accounts for 52 per cent of the refrigerators produced in Turkey and 33 per cent of its television sets. If any company should have been able to plead its case while this year's tariff regime was being prepared, it was Koc. Overall group turnover of Dollars 11.3bn in 1992 was equivalent to a healthy 7.5 per cent of Turkey's GDP, and the then under-secretary of the treasury was its former financial co-ordinator. Indeed, where cars and brown goods were concerned, some respite was gained. But in the case of washing machines, the degree of protectionism fell from 33.5 per cent to 16.1 per cent. Koc says that its consumer durable division is working on the assumption that worse is to come. The group's white-goods company, Arcelik, is Europe's fifth largest producer of refrigerators and earns good margins - 10 per cent before tax on sales, compared with international levels of nearer 2 per cent. Executives responsible for these activities say that, when Turkey's white goods producers visited Ankara last November, they did not ask for higher tariffs. They see themselves as a sector which can stand on its own feet, and believe that Turkey's negotiators may make concessions to Brussels on white goods in order to gain ground on more fragile industries. What they are against are the costly surprises to which they, and other companies in Turkey, have often been exposed in the past. 'We asked for a schedule, not protection,' one executive says. Koc also asked that Turkish officials negotiate on non-tariff barriers. It complains of packaging requirements that are only applied to imported appliances and what it sees as suspiciously protracted national testing processes. If these arguments, which Turkish negotiators may be raising in the future, what is Arcelik doing today? Its strategy is fourfold: Developing licences with leading European companies to ensure their technology stays state of the art. Examples include its agreements with Bosch. Strengthening their production base by increasing investment from 5 per cent of turnover to 9 per cent. Building their presence in the European market. Koc has gained a foothold in the UK under its European brand name, Beko, and this year will begin to market in France, with Spain to follow. Seeking an alliance with a major European white goods player. In return for state-of-the-art technology and a chance to use the partner's distribution channels, Koc is offering a share of its 60 per cent hold on the Turkish market, as well as access to low-cost engineering talent and skilled labour. In short, Koc is both flowing with the tide toward customs union and making sure Turkey's negotiators are well prepared. Their strategy is of more recent date than that adopted a decade ago by Eczacibasi Holding, owner of Turkey's leading pharmaceutical company and of an industrial group with turnover in 1992 of Dollars 1.5bn. In the mid-1980s, the group decided that it would concentrate on the businesses it knew, and that it could no longer rely on protected markets. As Mr Toker Alban, deputy general manager at the Holding explains: 'We saw there were areas where we were strong in Turkey but weak internationally. In these, we believed that without a strong partner we could not survive.' Resulting from this are the various 50:50 joint ventures it has developed with Ja/Mont (itself a joint venture of James Rivers of the US, Feruzzi of Italy and Nokia of Finland) for tissue paper; with Procter &amp; Gamble for disposable diapers and sanitary napkins; with Marazzi of Italy for ceramic tiles; and with American Standard for perspex bathtubs. It also obtained its drug partners' help in making sure that it incorporated the latest technology in its new pharmaceutical plant, a Dollars 100m investment which opened last autumn. Eczacibasi has also put its emphasis on marketing, not just in Turkey but abroad. Last year, it set up a drug wholesaling operation in Russia and its first pharmacy in Moscow - 80 years after its first one in Izmir - with plans to franchise its name through the Commonwealth of Independent States. The Holding now produces 15.5 per cent of Turkey's pharmaceuticals (and accounts for half of the country's total drug exports), 80 per cent of serums, 70 per cent of toothpaste, 60 per cent of tissue papers, 80 per cent of sanitary napkins and over 40 per cent of its ceramics. The auther is general manager of IBS Research and Consultancy company, which helps international companies build their business in Turkey and publishes 'Doing in Business in Turkey', a 700-page update reference service.</p>

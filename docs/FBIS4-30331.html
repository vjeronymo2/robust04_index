			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 25 KYODO -- Outgoing Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata on Saturday briefed South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam on his resignation along with his cabinet ministers, a  Foreign Ministry official said.    Hata, who announced the resignation of his entire cabinet  Saturday morning, telephoned Kim and expressed his hope to visit  South Korea and meet with Kim some day, the official said.    During the 15-minute conversation, the premier expressed  confidence his departure would not hurt relations between Japan  and South Korea, the official said.    Hata disbanded his two-month-old minority government to  avoid  certain defeat in a no-confidence vote, as well as a snap  general election and political vacuum that would follow.    Kim, thanking Hata for his telephone call, was quoted as  saying he is willing to meet with Hata any time to compare notes  on a wide range of issues.    The South Korean president also reportedly voiced his desire  to further strengthen bilateral ties with Japan.    To defuse the standoff over North Korea's alleged push for  nuclear arms, Hata and Kim agreed on the need to realize a  summit meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea and  resume the third round of talks between North Korea and the  United States on Pyongyang's nuclear program, the official said.</p>

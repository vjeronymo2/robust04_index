			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Big names in City under fire: Maxwell advice rapped by MPs SOME OF the most famous names in City legal and accountancy circles have been criticised by the Commons social security committee, which is investigating the aftermath of the Maxwell pensions scandal. The committee was particularly critical of Buchler, Phillips, the insolvency practitioner responsible for liquidating the private interests of the late Mr Robert Maxwell. With its lawyers, Nabarro Nathanson, it has charged Pounds 1.1m in fees while claiming to have recovered Pounds 10m. Representatives of the firm are due to be recalled by the committee in the autumn. The committee's report said: 'We have particular misgivings about the work of Buchler Phillips as the receivers to the private estate and about some of the information they have provided for the committee.' The committee was also highly critical of the work of Robson Rhodes, administrators to Bishopsgate Investment Management, the Maxwell-owned fund management company which invested most of the combined pension fund assets. It, and its solicitors Stephenson Harwood, have incurred Pounds 6.1m in costs since their appointment in December 1991. The committee report notes that of Pounds 247.9m Robson Rhodes said it had 'recovered, located and secured' since its appointment, Pounds 103.5 was under its control on the date of its appointment. A further Pounds 135.3m was under the control of 'old external managers' to the pension schemes, many of whom would have returned the money with little hesitation. The committee believes the book value of recoveries was only Pounds 55.1m, of which Pounds 11.7m is contested by one of the pension schemes. In the period from October 1992 to May 1993 the value of monies recovered was only Pounds 3.9m. The report notes that in the judgment of Robson Rhodes' senior partner responsible for BIM it is likely that litigation will be needed for further significant recoveries because mediation is unlikely to produce satisfactory re-sults. No litigation has started although solicitors for one of the individual schemes filed a writ as long ago as June 1992. The report said: 'The committee is critical of the slowness with which Robson Rhodes are taking legal action against those who still hold pension fund assets.' None of the firms criticised responded to the committee's criticism yesterday.</p>

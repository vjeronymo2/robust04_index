			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 21 (YONHAP) -- Russia's state Duma  (house of representatives) held a meeting Monday to discuss the  Russian Government's position on possible international  sanctions against North Korea.    Russian Vice Foreign Minister Alexandr Panov explained the  government's position at the closed-door meeting,  unprecedentedly attended by North Korean Ambassador to Moscow  Son Song-pil.    Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the foreign affairs committee,  said Russia should cooperate closely with the United States on  sanctions against North Korea, adding that it is unclear if  Pyongyang plans to bargain for more favorable conditions or is  simply playing for time, diplomatic sources said.    Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Ministry officials support an  inter-Korean summit in principle. They welcomed the possible  continuation of dialogue as international sanctions against the  communist state are being discussed in detail.    But the current situation on the Korean peninsula has  neither  improved nor worsened, the officials added.</p>

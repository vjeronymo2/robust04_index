			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investment Offshore Centres (8): Ahead in insurance - Guernsey A LITTLE smaller than its neighbour Jersey, the other main Channel Island of Guernsey (population 60,000) has successfully cultivated an equally respectable image as a well-regulated UK offshore centre, and is now also seeking to develop its business with the Continent of Europe. It has the same territorial status as Jersey - it is a British Crown possession rather than a part of the UK, and is for most practical purposes  -certainly in respect of financial services - outside the European Community. But inevitably there is confusion about the two islands in the minds of many foreigners, and the debate in Guernsey is whether it should seek to differentiate itself from Jersey in some way, perhaps through a marketing campaign. The Guernsey authorities have been pondering the merits of a recent report prepared by the London advertising and public relations agency Streets. For example, should the leaders of Guernsey's financial community set out on a series of Continental road shows? A recent slackening of the momentum of financial business expansion may be concentrating minds. The influx of new 'managed' banks in the past 18 months has stopped for the moment, probably because in the face of the global recession banks around the world have shelved their expansion plans. Still, with 72 resident banking institutions Guernsey boasted bank deposits of Pounds 14.9bn at the end of 1990, up nearly Pounds 2bn on the year. As for investment funds, after a noticeably quiet winter, when the Gulf war choked off business, the rise in global stock markets appears to be producing a revival of activity. Some five new A class collective investment schemes are in the pipeline (A schemes are eligible for recognition by the Securities and Investments Board in the UK). At the end of December 1990 there were 156 authorised open-ended, 50 in class A and 106 in the offshore-only B class. These open-ended funds had assets of Pounds 3.07bn in aggregate last December, and there were also some 55 closed-ended schemes worth an additional Pounds 1.3bn-plus. One area in which Guernsey is distinct from Jersey is in offshore insurance. With some 190 captive insurance companies Guernsey is the European time zone market leader, albeit a long way behind Bermuda. However, Guernsey is under competitive pressure in captive insurance business at the moment from Dublin and the Isle of Man, and may need to respond by improving the incentives for new captives to set up in the island. In offshore life business, Guernsey hopes to follow Jersey by enacting offshore personal pensions legislation, probably later this year, though there have been disappointing delays. Guernsey plans will be capable of origination by local life companies: lacking insurance companies of its own, Jersey relies on plans marketed by mainland life companies through Jersey intermediaries. The offshore trust sector was braced for a blow in the UK Budget in March and it duly fell. But Mr John Roper, director-general of the Financial Services Commission (FSC), tries to make the best of a bad job. He argues that existing trusts are unlikely to be repatriated to the UK, even if new business stops coming. In any case, Guernsey's strategy is anyway to reduce the links with the UK. 'This is a blessing in disguise because it will stimulate our industry to find new sources of business,' he argues. Like his Jersey counterparts, Mr Roper is expecting a breakthrough after several years of negotiations with the Japanese Ministry of Finance over the eligibility of Channel Island investment funds for retail marketing in Japan. This could attract business which at present goes mostly through Luxembourg. Over several years, largely to cope with the consequences of the UK's Financial Services Act 1986, Guernsey has built up a substantial regulatory body in the FSC, staffed at senior levels mainly by ex-Bank of England officials. A point of debate now is whether the FSC should actually take part in the promotion of Guernsey's offshore finance industry, perhaps by funding all or part of a marketing exercise. But there are potential conflicts. Not only is it doubtful whether regulators should get mixed up in promotion, but the cost would presumably have to be met out of the fees charged to existing financial institutions. The latter might be happy to see this done to attract new business to the island, but less pleased if the emphasis were on bringing in new institutions which would increase competition for those already established. Still, Guernsey needs to address some of these issues if it is to make a serious impact in the European market place.</p>

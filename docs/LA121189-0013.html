			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LIMITED SERVICE MAKES SENSE FOR DEL MAR DEPOT;  </P> <P> TRAINS: THERE IS A FEELING THAT THE STATION IS BEING UNMERCIFULLY RIPPED OUT OF  THE FRAMEWORK OF THE COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL RAIL DESTINATION FOR  ALMOST 100 YEARS. BUT CITY OFFICIALS, MERCHANTS AND RESIDENTS BELIEVE LIMITED  SERVICE IS POSSIBLE AND WOULD BENEFIT NOT ONLY DEL MAR, BUT ALL OF SOUTHERN  CALIFORNIA.  </P> <P> With the selection of Solana Beach as a stop on the proposed North County  commuter rail line, government planners and transportation officials seem more  determined than ever to eliminate Amtrak service from Del Mar.  </P> <P> The North County Transit District, the San Diego Assn. of Governments and the  Los Angeles/San Diego Rail Corridor Agency consider the Del Mar station  inadequate for commuter rail needs, and the combination of Amtrak and commuter  service in Solana Beach the way to maximize efficiency.  </P> <P> Naturally in Del Mar, there is a feeling that the station is being unmercifully  ripped out of the framework of the community that has been a successful rail  destination for almost 100 years.  </P> <P> Del Mar has had rail service since its origin. The railroad right-of-way was  deeded by the South Coast Land Co. (original developers of Del Mar) to what is  now the Santa Fe Railway, and, according to local legend, the railway promised  that railroads would always service Del Mar, although written records of that  have not been found.  </P> <P> People all up and down the Southern California coast come to Del Mar by train,  especially during the horse-racing season. And many residents can walk to the  station, giving them easy access to the whole Amtrak system.  </P> <P> So Del Mar is concerned about losing the identity and, perhaps, even the heart  and soul of the community.  </P> <P> Merchants are also concerned about how the loss of pedestrian and tourist  traffic will affect their businesses. Without a train stop, visitors will most  likely arrive by car. Since Del Mar already has too little parking, a community  known for its pedestrian-oriented charm could quickly turn into one clogged  with traffic, much like Sausalito.  </P> <P> Del Mar is well aware that the station has limitations that prevent it from  being able to support full Amtrak service. But the solution doesn't have to be  closure. City officials, merchants and residents believe limited Amtrak service  is possible and would benefit not only Del Mar, but all of Southern California.  </P> <P> The concept of limited use is not new to Amtrak or to the Los Angeles/San Diego  Rail Corridor Agency (Lossan). Trains stop in San Clemente only twice in the  morning and once in the afternoon. The San Clemente station has no dedicated  parking, and passengers purchase their tickets on the train with no penalty.  Amtrak has served San Clemente this way for many years. And, although Lossan,  Sandag and NCTD maintain that limited use is confusing to rail passengers, San  Clemente city officials say the arrangement has not been a problem.  Furthermore, the concept of local and express trains is widely used across the  country, proving that passengers can understand differing schedules.  </P> <P> Limited service would be even easier at the Del Mar station, which has more  than 90 dedicated parking spaces plus 128 adjacent spaces, most of them unused  during weekday peak travel times.  </P> <P> Certainly these spaces could support more than the three stops in San Clemente.  </P> <P> Other limitations of the Del Mar station can be eliminated. The city plans to  improve access to the station this year and add a much-needed sidewalk. The  platform also needs to be lengthened and raised for handicapped access.  Adequate land is available north of the station to allow the expansion needed  for trains to visit the station without blocking the nearby intersection.  </P> <P> Funds for these projects would be available if Sandag would abandon its recent,  unrealistic proposal to add a seasonal platform near the exercise track at the  fairgrounds. Sandag itself rejected the concept just a year ago and its own  consultant has advised against it since riders would most likely still need to  be shuttled to the grandstand.  </P> <P> With a longer platform, handicapped access, existing parking and the  improvements being made by the city, there is no reason why limited service  should not be possible at Del Mar once the Solana Beach station opens, in late  1992 or early 1993.  </P> <P> And keeping the station could benefit Amtrak as well. Opponents of limited  service fail to take into account how the loss of the Del Mar destination will  affect ridership.  </P> <P> One overall fact remains: Del Mar is one of only three stops on the Amtrak line  (San Clemente and Santa Barbara are the others) where riders can step off the  train and be literally just a few feet from the beach, a fact regularly  publicized in Amtrak promotional literature.  </P> <P> Del Mar does welcome the Solana Beach station. But Amtrak, Lossan, NCTD and  Sandag have a responsibility to provide a rail system that serves all rail  riders in Southern California.  </P> <P> Two stations, a full-service one in Solana Beach and a limited-service one in  Del Mar, would do that better than one.  </P></p>

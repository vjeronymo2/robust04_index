			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> EMBATTLED COLLEGE TRUSTEE FACES INQUIRY;  </P> <P> AUDIT: TOM ELY, A SIMI VALLEY REPUBLICAN WHO IS A CANDIDATE FOR COUNTY  SUPERVISOR, IS THE TARGET OF A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INTO POSSIBLE  MISAPPROPRIATION OF COLLEGE DISTRICT FUNDS.  </P> <P> Ventura Community College District Trustee Tom Ely has become the target of a  county criminal probe into possible misappropriation of several thousand  dollars in district funds, Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Bradbury said his office received a copy Tuesday of an audit of Ely's district  expense records, which "raised sufficient concern for us to elevate the matter  from inquiry status to a criminal investigation."  </P> <P> Bradbury would not reveal details of the alleged misappropriations nor would he  discuss what criminal charges Ely might face.  </P> <P> "I don't intend to speculate on charges at this point," Bradbury said. "The  issue is the possibility of misappropriation of government funds, of college  district funds."  </P> <P> Ely laughed when The Times informed him of the criminal probe and replied: "Oh  really? Good."  </P> <P> The 54-year-old Simi Valley Republican, a candidate for the 4th District county  supervisor seat, said he is not concerned by the investigation. "It's typical  Mike Bradbury, trying to get public press coverage," he added.  </P> <P> Ely said he received a copy of the two-page audit and the financial records  supporting it from district Chancellor Barbara Derryberry on Friday.  </P> <P> "The fact is, there is not one implication of impropriety in the audit," said  Ely, a trustee since 1979. "There are questions relative to the existence of  receipts because the office of district administrative services either is doing  a poor job of keeping the records sent to them, or the auditor was not  understanding the effects and facts that were relative to the expenses."  </P> <P> However, Ely would not comment further on which expenses were cited by auditors  for the firm of Soares, Sandall, Bernacchi &amp; Petrovich.  </P> <P> Derryberry declined to comment Wednesday on the contents of the audit, saying,  "The trustees have not seen a copy yet. We're still in the process of doing the  investigation."  </P> <P> Derryberry said the trustees expect Ely to give them a written response to the  audit within two weeks. The audit and the response will then be forwarded to  the full board, she said.  </P> <P> The board commissioned the audit two weeks ago after learning of Ely's alleged  gambling activities and after a disclosure that he used district telephones to  call hotels and casinos in Nevada.  </P> <P> It was alleged that he owed $3,000 in gambling debts to the Edgewater Hotel and  Casino in Laughlin, Nev. In February, the Golden Nugget Casino in Las Vegas  sued Ely over alleged gambling debts of $8,000.  </P> <P> A law enforcement source has told The Times that Ely had incurred a total of  about $40,000 in gambling debts at a number of Las Vegas casinos and hotels.  </P></p>

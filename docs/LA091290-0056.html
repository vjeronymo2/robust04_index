			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARTLEY CAN'T BEAR TO WATCH AS PADRES STYMIE DODGERS, 4-0;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: HE GIVES UP A HOME RUN TO CLARK, AND L.A. FALLS INTO A TIE FOR SECOND  PLACE, SEVEN GAMES BEHIND THE REDS.  </P> <P> The moment the fly ball by Jack Clark hit the wall behind the left-field fence,  Mike Hartley made a decision probably shared by Dodger teammates and  supporters.  </P> <P> He decided he could no longer bear to watch.  </P> <P> Turning his back to home plate, Hartley stared into the sky. As Clark slowly  rounded the bases behind Tony Gwynn and then stomped on home plate to give the  San Diego Padres a 2-0 fourth-inning lead, Hartley continued to stare.  </P> <P> When Hartley finally turned to face home plate, it was as if the future of the  Dodgers had turned as dark as that sky. The Cincinnati Reds had already  defeated Houston, and soon the Dodgers would lose to Bruce Hurst's five-hitter,  4-0, before 13,758 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> What was once a single vision toward first place has become a backward glance  toward third. Besides falling seven games behind the National League  West-leading Reds with 20 games remaining, the Dodgers also fell into a  second-place tie with victorious San Francisco,  </P> <P> If the Reds go 11-11 in their final games, the Dodgers must go 17-3 to tie  them.  </P> <P> Tim Crews put the Dodgers' chances into simpler terms.  </P> <P> "The only possible way is for us to win here (today), then sweep them in  Cincinnati," he said. "Anything other than that, and I don't see anything  happening."  </P> <P> Crews paused. "But if we do sweep them and get three games back, you never  know," he said. "Panic could set in."  </P> <P> The Dodgers, who lost for the sixth time in their last nine games including two  consecutive games at San Diego, are not playing as if panicked. Rather, it is  as if they calmly awoke after last weekend's two emotional victories over the  Reds and realized that they have never been sound enough to win a championship.  </P> <P> On Tuesday they lost with a starting pitcher who is actually a reliever and  with reserves playing first base and center field because of injuries to  starters. In Monday's loss, they played with a backup catcher and two backup  outfielders. In both games, they used relief pitchers recently recalled from  the minor leagues.  </P> <P> "I don't know what it is, but they just looked flat to me the last two days,"  Gwynn said.  </P> <P> The Dodgers were stifled not just by Hurst, but by a poor encore to the best  game of rookie pitcher Hartley's pro career.  </P> <P> Five days after pitching a three-hit shutout against Atlanta, he did not last  past the fifth inning, giving up four runs and five hits in 4 2/3 innings. He  walked two, both of whom scored, and threw a wild pitch that also led to a run.  </P> <P> Hartley tried so hard, he strained his left side on his final pitch of the  game. Yet in two of his last three starts, Hartley has not lasted more than  five innings and now is 6-3 with a 2.95 earned-run average.  </P> <P> "I felt good, but I was on and off," Hartley said. "Right now, all we can do is  scratch or claw or whatever."  </P> <P> The Dodgers were shut out for only the fourth time since the All-Star break,  the eighth time this season. But then, they haven't had a stretch of games this  bad since the break.  </P> <P> They were forced to play without Eddie Murray, who was sidelined because of a  sore left hand, and Kal Daniels, who is still bothered by a strained muscle in  his side. Jose Offerman started at shortstop in place Alfredo Griffin, who has  six hits in his last 49 at-bats and is struggling again in the field.  </P> <P> Kirk Gibson, the one Dodger slugger who was healthy, struck out three times and  went hitless in four at-bats, making him hitless in his last 24.  </P> <P> Said Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda: "You know Eddie's wrist had to be killing him,  or he would be in there . . . and you know Kal has been hurting . . . and Gibby  just can't seem to buy a hit . . . so what can you do? It's just a damn shame  that we win two out of three against the Reds and then come down here and do  this. A damn shame."  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Surgeons removed a small piece of torn cartilage from Tim Belcher's right  shoulder, found no further damage and said chances are good that Belcher will  be ready for spring training in 1991. "The news is certainly good," said Fred  Claire, Dodger vice president. "I talked to Tim and I know he is very  relieved." . . . Ray Searage was activated from the disabled list, where he had  been since Aug. 18 because of a sore left elbow.  </P> <P> Although it was originally announced that Eddie Murray suffered an injured  wrist while scooping a ball out of the dirt Sept. 6, apparently Murray's wrist  had been sore before that, and he aggravated it on the play. . . . Kal Daniels  said doctors told him that only complete rest would cure his strained left  side, something which he will not get until after the season.  </P> <P> Claire said that "three or four" more players from triple-A Albuquerque will be  joining the Dodgers when they finish their Pacific Coast League finals series  against Edmonton, which could be as soon as tonight. Possible recalls include  pitcher John Wetteland, catcher Carlos Hernandez and third baseman Dave Hansen.  . . . Left-handed relief pitcher Pat Perry, who has not been in a game since  June 2, said he has received indications that he might not be kept on the  40-man roster, meaning he would become a free agent.  </P></p>

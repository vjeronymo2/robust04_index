			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Observer: Adventurous If 3i, Britain's biggest venture capitalist, was advising a customer on how to manage a successful stock market debut, it would not be counselling it to replace its chairman, chief executive and finance director only months before the flotation. This is what companies in trouble do. However, 3i does not seem to think there is anything unusual in the fact that it has yet to find a successor to its own chairman, Sir John Cuckney; and now chief executive David Marlow is retiring early. 3i's chief executives often retire early it seems, and anyway finance director Ewen Macpherson, the new ceo, has been with the firm for 22 years and Brian Larcombe, the new finance director, has been there almost as long. They should know the ropes. 3i prides itself on its management in depth, but this is part of its problem. It is a big and rather inbred animal whose managers are not well known in the City investment community. Tinkering with a trusted management team at this late stage is risky, particularly given the market's current nervousness about the unquoted investment trust sector.</p>

The improvement largely occurred in the earlier part of the financial year and was triggered by the effect of the withdrawal of sterling from the ERM on the trust's overseas portfolio. Net revenue improved to Pounds 7.66m (Pounds 7.17m) and earnings per share came out at 39.74p (37.22p). A final dividend of 26.5p (24.5p) makes a total for the year of 39p (36.5p).</p>

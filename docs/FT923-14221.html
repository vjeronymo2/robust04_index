			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Engineering workers reject 5% pay offer MORE than 1,300 engineering workers yesterday rejected a 5 per cent pay offer that involved the introduction of performance pay and the end of collective bargaining. Pay has been frozen for 18 months at the two British Timken engineering parts factories near Northampton, according to the AEEU engineering and electrical union, which represents the manual workforce. Performance pay has grown rapidly in the private sector for white-collar and professional workers, particularly in financial services, but is uncommon among manual workers. Members of the union voted to reject the proposed package by a majority of 70 per cent at British Timken's factory at Daventry and by a majority of 85 per cent at its Duston site. The union had not directed the workforce to reject the offer. Mr Duncan Simpson, AEEU divisional organiser, said the union would 'consider its position' should the company decide to impose the package.</p>

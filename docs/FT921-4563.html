			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Money Markets and Foreign Exchanges: Awaiting the Budget THE dollar is expected to continue strong this week, but Tuesday's UK Budget will focus attention on an uneasy trend in sterling, writes Neil Buckley. The dollar should open strongly, buoyed up by the 164,000 rise in US non-farm payrolls announced on Friday, while satisfactory news on retail sales figures next Thursday and on producer prices index on the following day could take it higher. It faces a technical barrier at DM1.6825, but if this is crossed, it could head for DM1.70. Some economists, however, see a possible change of tack by the market. 'People have wanted to buy dollars on strong US numbers. But if anything, the numbers we are seeing out of Germany are just as strong,' said Mr Nick Parsons, treasury adviser at CIBC. German factory orders have risen along with production, and unemployment has fallen. Mr Parsons predicts that the D-mark could receive a boost if this week's statistics on machinery orders, trade figures and wholesale prices are well received. In the UK, the market will be hoping that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, can balance prudence with a vote-winning Budget. Most estimates are for a tax-cut give-away of Pounds 2bn-Pounds 4bn. A base rate cut, however, looks unlikely following the weakness of sterling last week. If the Budget fails to please the markets and the electorate, then sterling could again come under pressure. Dealers say sterling is vulnerable on the downside, with technical support likely at DM2.8650, but a long drop to the next likely intervention level at DM2.8280. If the Budget is followed by the announcement of a general election, they warn of a period of great volatility, with sterling ready to tumble at any indication of weakening Conservative support.</p>

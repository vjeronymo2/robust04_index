			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / International Company News: BAA to build Pounds 60m operations centre BAA, the airport company, has announced plans to build a Pounds 60m operations centre for British Airways at Heathrow. BA has agreed to pay an annual rent of Pounds 5.2m on the 200,000 sq ft building, which will be completed in early 1994. The project, which will cost Pounds 45m to build, will be handled by Lynton, BAA's development arm. This is one of the largest pre-let property deals in the UK in the last two years. The new development will stand on a 10 acre site on the north side of the airport. The three-storey building with a curved glass facade has been designed by Nicholas Grimshaw &amp; Partners, architects. BA believes that the new building, which will replace 7 separate buildings, will save it Pounds 1m a year. BA's move will allow BAA to make better use of its central terminal buildings. Last year, BAA completed a 170,000 sq ft catering base for BA on the south side of the airport, which was also pre-let.</p>

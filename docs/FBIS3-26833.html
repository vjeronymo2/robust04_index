This is  a vast area of fertile land. Amid the great tides of reform,  opening up, and modernization construction, southern Jiangsu  presents us with a brand-new pattern for economic and social  development which is characterized by its distinctive local  feature. This is land on which tens of millions of hard-working  peasants are forging ahead along the road of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics.    As early as 1983, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, chief designer of  China's reform and opening up, spoke highly of the reform and  construction of southern Jiangsu during an inspection tour to  the region. At that time, the Suzhou area enjoyed a per capita  annual industrial and agricultural output volume of nearly $800,  taking the lead in the country in solving people's problems  concerning food, clothing, daily necessities, housing,  employment, education, culture, and other areas of public  welfare. Tremendous changes also took place in the mental  outlook of people there. Upon his return to Beijing from  inspection trips to Jiangsu and other places, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping pointed out in speeches -- which have been collected in  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping:  "Evidently, the realization of the four modernizations promises  high hopes of success." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping, p. 24) A year later, at a meeting held by  the central authorities, Comrade Deng Xiaoping again cited the  example of southern Jiangsu, saying: "Their creations alone are  amazing achievements!" "Material goods serve as a foundation.  When our people enjoy a better material life and an enhanced  cultural standard, their mental outlook surely will undergo  great changes." (op. cit., p. 89)    Today, southern Jiangsu has taken more strides along the  road  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. As soon as  they set their foot on this hot land, people will be infected by  the tremendous enthusiasm of the southern Jiangsu people engaged  in the socialist construction, and will be filled with  admiration at the remarkable results they have attained in the  building of two civilizations. Facts have proved  incontrovertibly that the success of southern Jiangsu is nothing  less than a great creation of the southern Jiangsu people under  the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics.  <H3>  Arduous Yet Successful Explorations Under the Guidance of  the Theory of Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics </H3>   Southern Jiangsu's successful practice can be attributed to  its superiorities in natural resources, geographic location, and  economic strength. However, superior objective natural  conditions cannot create social miracles. For a considerably  long period of time, the economic structure of southern Jiangsu  as a whole did not display any fundamental differences from the  economic structures of other areas in the country. The rural  reform, which features the contracted responsibility system with  remuneration linked to output, serves as an opportunity for  China's rural areas to change from stagnant growth to  prosperity. The vast numbers of cadres and masses in southern  Jiangsu have seized this opportunity firmly. Relying on the  immense energy released by the impact of reform and on their  advantages accumulated through the collective economy, they have  proceeded from realistic conditions and their own demands, put  into effect the contracted responsibility system on a household  basis with remuneration linked to output, and established  peasants' autonomy in production and management. They have  broken with egalitarism in distribution, and have allowed and  encouraged some people to get rich first, thus considerably  arousing the enthusiasm of the vast numbers of peasants to get  rich through hard work. They gradually have lifted controls on  the prices of agricultural and sideline products, eliminated a  series of obstacles set by the system of unified purchases and  distribution, and brought about great increases in the rural  commodity rate. What needs to be specially mentioned is their  vigorous effort to develop town and township industries; as a  result, they have opened a new field for transferring surplus  rural labor forces to nonagricultural industries, thus  accelerating the process of turning the natural economy of rural  areas into a commodity economy.    Town and township industries are a great creation of the  Chinese peasants, and the cadres and masses in southern Jiangsu  have made outstanding contributions to this creation. Like all  new things, town and township industries were not welcomed with  flowers and applause when they first made their appearance in  the historical arena; rather, they have experienced a winding  course of development. During the period dominated by the  planned economy, town and township enterprises had no planned  products, no planned supply of raw and supplementary materials  and energy, and no planned sales quotas or channels. What they  could do was to find "rice" to "cook" and borrow "hens" to "lay  eggs," and such practices invited all kinds of criticisms and  accusations, claiming that these industries "were pounding the  planned economy," "scrambling with state-owned enterprises for  raw materials and markets," "undermining socialism," and "giving  rise to unhealthy trends." In the face of such great pressure,  the cadres and masses of southern Jiangsu believed that the road  they were taking was the correct one, for the establishment of  town and township industries tallies with the economic and  social development rules in rural areas of southern Jiangsu, and  also conforms to the interests of the vast numbers of peasants,  as well as their hopes for extricating themselves from poverty  and bringing about common prosperity. In June 1987, Comrade  Deng Xiaoping set a high value on town and township enterprises:  Our biggest unexpected harvest is the development and rise of  town and township enterprises. He later stressed on many  occasions: "Town and township enterprises are very important,  and need to be further developed and enhanced." (op. cit., p.  355) The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have  issued many important documents and have called many important  meetings to reaffirm the value of town and township industries,  and to stress the need for giving them policy support and  guidance. All this has served as great encouragement to the  cadres and masses of southern Jiangsu, and also has provided a  fundamental guarantee for town and township industries to attain  rapid growth on a smooth road. Since then, peasants have  started to run industries, thus expediting the process of  industrialization, urbanization, agricultural mechanization, and  modernization in rural areas. This was the first great rise for  town and township enterprises in the 1980's. The second rise  started in 1992 and featured export-oriented high-tech  industries, thus bringing about a satisfying situation wherein  town and township enterprises are run in a large scale and can  produce high-grade and fine-quality products. At present, town  and township enterprises in southern Jiangsu have established  their position as a pillar of the entire rural economy. Relying  on the tremendous economic strength created by town and township  industries, the collective economy that depends mainly on the  public ownership has been consolidated constantly, the rural  modernization has begun to take off, and the construction of  small towns and townships has accelerated continuously. As a  result, tens of millions of peasants are leading a fairly  comfortable life. The success of southern Jiangsu in using its  distinctive features to explore a road of development has  sketched a brand-new portrait of socialist modern rural areas.    -- The economy of southern Jiangsu is growing at an  unprecedentedly high speed. During the period from 1979 to  1992, the GNP of southern Jiangsu grew at an average annual rate  of 16.5 percent, with the total value ten times higher than  before. Most of the counties (cities) in the rural areas of  southern Jiangsu have doubled once and again their annual total  industrial and agricultural output values, among which some  could double their output value in about five years. Take the  case of Wuxi County, which ranks first among China's 100 best  counties in comprehensive indexes. From 1978 to 1991, the  county's average GNP went up by 20.2 percent every year; the per  capita distribution level of peasants rose by 18.4 percent; and  its total financial income by 12.71 percent. Moreover, the  county attained the goal of quadrupling its industrial and  agricultural production ahead of schedule.    -- In the rural economic structure of southern  Jiangsu, the proportion of the nonagricultural sector  miraculously has surpassed that of the agricultural sector, and  definitely has become a pillar industry. By the year 1992,  the total industrial output value of town and township  industries in southern Jiangsu accounted for over two thirds of  the total economic value of society. The Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou  region, which has a population accounting for only 0.88 percent  of the country's total, attained a total town and township  industrial output value amounting to 16.8 percent of the  country's total.    -- The rural areas of southern Jiangsu have adopted  positive measures to coordinate relations between industry and  agriculture so as to stabilize and develop agricultural  production. Fine-quality and highly efficient agricultural  production bases have been set up to push forward the process of  putting into use machinery, chemicals, improved varieties, water  conservancy, and social services in agriculture. During the  Seventh Five-Year Plan, the agricultural aid funds provided by  the southern Jiangsu region reached a figure higher than 4  billion yuan, or five times higher than the state input during  the same period. Relying on the real strength of the collective  economy, Wuxi County has set up more than 600 small farms of all  types at all levels, and has ensured well-coordinated  development in primary, secondary, and tertiary industries in  rural areas.    -- The progress of rural economic development in  southern Jiangsu has brought about profound changes in the  economic and social structure of rural areas. A large  number of small towns and townships have emerged, and have  become commercially prosperous hubs that link urban and rural  areas on the basis of fairly complete facilities and functions,  and convenient transport conditions. In addition, they have  become hot spots for peasants to live and work. This move has  improved the conditions and quality of peasants' production and  life to a considerable extent, and has greatly accelerated the  process of turning the rural industrial structure into a  nonagricultural structure, as well as the process of urbanizing  the population mix.    -- With strong economic backing, all social  undertakings and the building of socialist spiritual  civilization in rural areas of southern Jiangsu have attained  remarkable progress. The rural areas of southern Jiangsu  have made great improvements in educational conditions, and rank  among the country's best in perfecting the educational system  and in good teaching facilities. Fairly rapid growth also has  been attained in all kinds of social undertakings, including  medical care and public health, culture and sports, press and  television, social insurance, public welfare, urban  afforestation, and family planning. The rural areas of southern  Jiangsu now have basically reached their goal of providing the  young with education, the old with old-age care, the sick with  proper medical treatment, and the victims of natural disasters  with sufficient relief. As a result, people in the region have  taken on an entirely new mental outlook, and public security  there is also quite satisfactory.  -- The glorious accomplishments achieved by the rural  areas of southern Jiangsu through their hard struggle have been  recognized unanimously by all sectors of society. Among  China's 100 best rural counties with strong comprehensive  economic strength in 1991, 11 counties (cities) among the 12 in  southern Jiangsu ranked among the first of the 100 counties.  According to an appraisal made by the Jiangsu Provincial  Statistics Bureau in 1992 of the comprehensive economic strength  of more than 2,000 towns and townships throughout the province,  the first 10 of the province's "100 best towns and townships"  were towns and townships in southern Jiangsu. The enhancement  of the region's real economic strength has given general  expression to the accomplishments attained in practice by  southern Jiangsu, and also to the region's success in practice.  <H3>  "Three Main Bodies," "Two Coordinations," and "One Common"  -- Southern Jiangsu's Distinctive Experience Gained Through  Practice </H3>   The rural areas of southern Jiangsu have opened up a road  for  development with special regional features, and have given shape  to a unique pattern for economic and social development: "The  Southern Jiangsu Pattern." The following are its salient  features:    "Three main bodies" -- Regard public ownership and the  collective economy as the main body of the ownership structure;  regard town and township industries as the main body of the  industrial structure; and regard market orientation as the main  body of the economic operational mechanism.    "Two coordinations" -- Bring about coordinated  development among the region's economic and social sectors, and  coordinated development between building the material and the  spiritual civilizations.    "One common" -- Uphold the principles of distribution  according to work and of more pay for more work; take into  account the interests of the state, the collective, and the  individual; and open up a road for gradually bringing common  prosperity to peasants within the community.    "The Southern Jiangsu Pattern" is one of the rural  development patterns that emerged in China during the process of  transforming traditional agriculture into modern agriculture,  and transforming a natural economy into a large-scale commodity  economy. In addition, the pattern is also a great achievement  attained by the peasants of southern Jiangsu who, proceeding  from realities, integrate the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics with the realistic conditions of  southern Jiangsu, take their own road, and build up the new  socialist countryside with the characteristics of southern  Jiangsu. Their success can been observed in the following  aspects:    First, They have consolidated and perfectd socialist  public ownership, integrated efforts to give play to the  advantages of the collective economy with efforts to mobilize  the enthusiasm of laborers, and enabled rural productive forces  to grow at a high speed.    Known for its very solid and powerful collective economy,  the  rural areas of southern Jiangsu persistently have regarded the  collective economy as the main body of the ownership structure.  In the process of effecting the contracted responsibility  system with remuneration linked to output, this region has paid  attention to stabilizing and reinforcing the foundation of the  collective economy, created a management mechanism whereby  unified management is combined with separate management, and  effectively integrated efforts to give play to the advantages of  the collective economy with efforts to mobilize the individual  enthusiasm of peasants. Of southern Jiangsu's total industrial  output value in 1992, the output value of industries under  collective ownership accounted for 80.52 percent, while the  proportion of production-oriented fixed assets owned by the  second-grade collective economy reached as high as 91.8 percent.  Facts have proved that the ownership structure of southern  Jiangsu, with the collective economy as its main body, can  entirely meet the development needs of productive forces at the  present stage, and not only can accommodate but also can greatly  push forward the development of productive forces. The endless  vitality and superiority of the collective economy have been  displayed by its powerful strength in coordinating economic  interests among all sectors in rural areas, and in pushing  forward the development of town and township industries,  agriculture, and other trades.    Second, They have readjusted the industrial structure,  regarded town and township industries as pillar industries, and  relied on their own resources to create the material conditions  for attaining well-coordinated development in all industries and  trades in rural areas.    It is another prominent sign of the comprehensive and  successful development of southern Jiangsu to rely on industries  for well-coordinated development among agriculture, sideline  production, industry, and commerce, and for all-round growth in  the rural economy. Relying on its natural links with urban  industries and commerce, the southern Jiangsu region entered the  industrial sphere earlier than other regions across the country.  In addition, it has continuously increased the proportion of  industries, increased the total quantity of industries,  reorganized the industrial structure of rural areas, and  gradually taken to the road of rural industrialization. In  southern Jiangsu, people already have reached this consensus:  Without strong town and township industries, there will be no  stable agriculture, no flourishing tertiary industries, no  blooming construction of small towns and townships, and no  comprehensive prosperity of the entire urban and rural economy.    Third, They have made full use of the market mechanism;  broken down barriers between regions, and between urban and  rural areas; and accelerated economic development according to  the needs of the market.    The market economy is a highly efficient economic means of  pushing forward the development of the socialist economy. The  secret of southern Jiangsu's rapid economic takeoff lies in its  persistence in carrying out market-oriented reform. An  enterprise has to face the market right from its birth, and then  grow and strengthen through the trials of the market. Its  production and management should rely entirely on the  orientation of the market and should suit the changes of the  market. Its main factors of production will not depend on the  distribution and supply of the state, but be determined by the  market. It should withstand the trials of market competition in  which only the superior can survive, and its fate will be  decided by its victory or failure in market competition. Led by  town and township enterprises, the entire economy of southern  Jiangsu will take positive steps to adapt itself to the demands  of the market and will make full use of the market operational  mechanism. This has been reflected mainly by the following:  Relying on the market to seek opportunities to expand  enterprises through many ways; opening up new markets, relying  on large and medium-sized cities and major industries, and  building up all-positioned multilevel domestic and overseas  market systems; making use of the market, extensively  assimilating and organizing social resources, and accelerating  the cultivation of markets for all major factors of production.  We can say without any exaggeration that southern Jiangsu,  especially town and township enterprises in southern Jiangsu,  are pioneers in the development of the socialist market economy.    Fourth, They have brought about well-coordinated  economic and social development, and paid attention to  strengthening the building of material civilization while  building up a high-degree of socialist spiritual  civilization.    The more we carry out reform and opening up, the more we  need  to strengthen the building of the socialist spiritual  civilization. This gradually has become a consensus among the  cadres and masses in the southern Jiangsu region. People in  southern Jiangsu have realized through practice that all work  should obey and serve the key task of economic construction, and  that failure to boost the economy will mean no accomplishment in  all other fields. Only when we uphold two civilizations can we  bring about and ensure healthy, stable, and rapid development  [jian kang, wen bu, xun su fa zhan 0256 1660 4489 2975 6598 6643  4099 1455] in economic construction; only when we strengthen the  building of spiritual civilization around the center of economic  construction can we attain well- coordinated development in the  building of the two civilizations. Through more than 10 years of  exploration and summarization, this region has accumulated the  following rich experiences: 1) Leaders at all levels have  attached great importance to building the two civilizations.  Principal leaders of party and government organizations in all  localities and departments persistently do two types of work  simultaneously, attaching equal importance to both; 2) Attention  has been paid to the "five major buildings" of ideology, moral  practice, culture, democracy and the legal system, and social  public utilities; 3) Efforts have been made to stress input and  infrastructure, to make full use of economic strength  accumulated in the course of high-speed economic growth, and to  reinforce the basics and hardware of spiritual civilization; 4)  Strides have been taken to place emphasis on planning and  implementation, to regard the building of the spiritual  civilization as an important part of creating a sound investment  environment, and to list this as one of their work targets; 5) A  series of effective mass activities has been carried out to  promote the building of the spiritual civilization and to guide  the masses to participate and receive education. Such  activities include systematic appraisals of outstanding  households with new social practices and civilized villages and  towns.    Fifth, They have upheld the principle of distribution  according to work, opposed egalitarianism while preventing  polarization, and guided the vast numbers of peasants onto the  road of common prosperity.    The practice in rural areas of the contracted responsibility  system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output  serves to break away from the production and distribution  patterns of the past, which featured "large-scale operation" and  "everybody eating from the same big pot." Relying on the  collective economy, governments and social organizations at all  levels in southern Jiangsu have set up a multi-element interest  distribution mechanism, which relies mainly on cooperative  economic organizations in towns and villages, so as to regulate  interest relations among all sectors of rural areas; to handle  correctly relations among the state, the collective, and the  laborers; to unify in an appropriate way the policy of allowing  some of the people to get rich first with the target of  attaining common prosperity; to uphold the principle of placing  the primary stress on efficiency, while giving fair  consideration to issues of secondary importance; to put into  effect within the collective economy a general practice of  "sharing profits gained from industrial production, shouldering  risks in agricultural production, and allowing each sideline  product to try its best"; and to rationalize the income gap of  labors in the community through a practice that relies mainly on  distribution according to work, makes allowance distribution  (such as encouraging the subsidization and development of  agriculture by industry) supplementary, and advocates common  consumption (such as community welfare undertakings). "With  neither nouveau riches nor poverty-stricken households, every  family is leading a fairly comfortable life" -- this is a vivid  depiction of how peasants in this region are taking to the road  of common prosperity.    "Three main bodies, two coordinations, and one common" is a  new road opened up by the rural areas of southern Jiangsu in the  process of reform, opening up, and modernization drive, as well  as an illustrative and concrete practice of the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics in this region.  From this successful practice, people can find strong evidence  to prove that Comrade Deng Xiaoping is correct in his definition  of the essence of socialism, that is, "to emancipate and develop  the productive forces, eliminate polarization, and bring about  common prosperity."  <H3>  Study New Situations, Solve New Problems, and Constantly  Deepen the Practice of Building Socialism With Chinese  Characteristics in Southern Jiangsu </H3>   The experience gained by southern Jiangsu is also a  successful experience that has passed the test of practice, and  has undergone constant improvement and attained new progress  alongside the development of practice. The most precious point  about southern Jiangsu's experience is that the region has never  rested content with what it has achieved, never relaxed its  efforts to forge ahead, and never stopped on the same spot.  This is because the concept of remaining at the same level  tallies neither with the Marxist outlook on development nor with  the nature of the southern Jiangsu people. At the initial stage  of the development of town and township industries, peasants in  the region created something by carrying out a practice whereby  peasants worked at factories in the daytime and in the fields at  night, "acted as both workers and peasants," "left the fields  without leaving their homeland," and "entered factories without  entering cities." Alongside the constant enhancement in the  level of productive forces and in economic strength, they have  created other brand-new experiences in exercising an appropriate  scale of land operation and running various kinds of farms  through the collectivization of agriculture and intensive  management, thus bringing about bright prospects for a second  takeoff since the adoption of the contracted responsibility  system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output.  Similar new creations can be seen in many fields in the  development of southern Jiangsu. Today, the experience of  southern Jiangsu has attracted public attention, yet the cadres  and masses of southern Jiangsu have a broader view, and are  always trying to correct their mistakes and put pressure on  themselves in order to attain greater results in the future.    The establishment of the socialist market economy system is  a  profound change. During this great change, southern Jiangsu  needs to explore and study many prominent problems and use new  methods to resolve them if it wants to push the economy onto a  new stage and achieve new aims in its practice.    -- Seek a more effective form of realization for the  public ownership and the collective economy. At present,  the form of realization adopted by town and township enterprises  under collective ownership in southern Jiangsu is primarily  community ownership featuring "townships and villages, each  owning what they run." Although it has apparent superiorities,  this form of ownership still gives rise to various degrees of  ambiguity in property rights relations. The joint-stock  cooperation system, which is on trial practice in southern  Jiangsu, can be described as a solution to this problem.  Possessing the strong points of both the joint-stock system and  the cooperation system, the joint-stock cooperation system is  more suited to the characteristics of the town and township  collective economy, which relies mainly on medium-sized and  small enterprises. Efforts should be taken to put the system  into trial use, and to spread correct and efficient methods  among the users. Conscientious studies also should be carried  out on relevant issues concerning the present implementation of  the joint-stock cooperation system, the establishment of a  modern enterprise system, and the cultivation of a new  microeconomic foundation.    -- Uphold public ownership as the main body of the  economy, and encourage and support other economic elements so as  to attain common development. At present, the individual  and private economies still occupy a relatively small proportion  in some localities in southern Jiangsu. To solve this problem,  positive measures should be drawn up to encourage the growth of  nonpublic economies. In addition, studies need to carried out  on how to encourage the common development of many other  economic elements while ensuring the dominant position of the  publicly owned economy.    -- Perfect the industrial structure and bring about  coordination among different industries. Southern Jiangsu  has more advanced secondary industries, yet its tertiary  industries are at a level lower than the average levels of the  country and the province, while its primary industries also are  faced with the question of how to enhance themselves on a  constant basis. Under such circumstances, strides should be  taken to study and implement relevant measures as soon as  possible so as to further readjust and perfect the economic and  industrial structures according to the needs of the new  situation, and to bring about well-coordinated development in  primary, secondary, and tertiary industries.    -- Accelerate the pace of opening to the outside  world, and vigorously enhance the level of foreign-oriented  practices. The southern Jiangsu region has always attached  great importance to and achieved real results in the aspect of  opening to the outside world. Yet generally speaking, it still  lags behind the Zhu Jiang Delta. The region should readjust its  opening-up strategy, and should move from domestic markets to  international markets, and from foreign-oriented practices to  internationalized practices with great strides. Efforts should  be made to make full use of the excellent opportunities brought  about by the opening and development of the Pudong District, to  formulate and implement an export-oriented economic development  strategy in accordance with customary international practices,  to set up large-scale enterprise groups and push them into the  world market, and to take an active part in the international  division of labor and in international cooperation.    -- Do better planning, reinforce ecological and  environmental protection, and bring about healthy development in  the urbanization of rural areas. While pushing forward  with rapid economic development, the industrialization of rural  areas in southern Jiangsu also has given rise to many problems  that should not be overlooked. The most prominent among these  are the irrational planning and pattern of urban construction,  the excessive occupancy of already infertile farmland, and the  adverse impact on ecology and environment. All these problems  have aroused the attention of leaders and relevant departments  in the southern Jiangsu region. We still need to make up our  minds and exert great efforts to seek strategies and measures to  solve these problems, so as to bring about healthy development  in the industrialization and urbanization of rural areas, and to  make the two supplement each other.    The arduous explorations carried out by the southern Jiangsu  people over the past 10 years or more are yielding fruitful  results, and the success of their practice is convincing. In  the face of the new situation and the opportunities for future  development, the cadres and masses of the southern Jiangsu  region are greeting the trials of this era with a brand-new  attitude. Surely they can constantly win new victories in  reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization drive as  long as they uphold the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, never  waver in carrying out the party's basic line, emancipate their  minds, seek truth from facts, carry out hard struggle, and have  the courage to forge ahead and open up new paths. A new,  socialist southern Jiangsu that enjoys "a prosperous economy,  advanced science and education, a fairly comfortable life, sound  social security, and civilized social practices" soon will  present itself once again with a magnificent posture before the  eyes of the people of the whole country!</p>

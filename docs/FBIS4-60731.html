			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 26 May (INA) -- National Assembly Speaker  Sa'di Mahdi Salih today received Masatu Okita, the higher  adviser of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], and the  accompanying delegation [name and title as received].    During the meeting, Salih stressed Iraq's desire to  establish  strong friendship and cooperation relations with Japan. He said  the return of Iraqi-Japanese relations to normal is necessary in  order to achieve the interests of both friendly peoples in a way  that benefits both countries.    Salih indicated the importance of promoting Iraqi-Japanese  relations in the current and coming phases. He said Japan can  play a greater role in this regard by making efforts to lift the  blockade imposed on the Iraqi people, especially since Japan  enjoys the international status entitling it to play such a role.    Okita emphasized the SDPJ's desire to promote Japanese-Iraqi  relations on the official and party levels in a way that would  achieve the interests of both friendly peoples. He said: We  are working to establish a just, comprehensive, and lasting  peace in the Arab region, avoiding the use of force.    Okita appreciated Iraq's peaceful positions and its call for  the establishment of such a peace, so general welfare can be  achieved for all regional states and also for friendly states.    The Japanese delegation arrived in Iraq yesterday on a visit  lasting several days.</p>

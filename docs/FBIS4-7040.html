			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- Yi In-mo, a former war  correspondent of the Korean People's Army [KPA], who is known as  an incarnation of faith and will, visited the Yim Chang-sun unit  of the Korean People's Army together with his family on April 23  to congratulate the soldiers on the 62nd founding anniversary of  the People's Army and present souvenirs to them.    Witnessing the great might of the People's Army which defies  comparison with that 40 odd years ago, Yi expressed deep  reverence for Comrade Kim Chong-il, supreme commander, who has  built an invincible army which no formidable enemy dare provoke.    Recalling that the enemy in South Korea put him to all sorts  of tortures to convert him, but could not bring him to his  knees, Yi said:    "I fought till victory with the conviction that I would win  surely, as there was for me the great General Kim Il-song.    "Touring different places of the socialist motherland, I was  charmed by the great idea and guidance of the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il for the country and the people.    "We will certainly win because the dear leader is with us.    "Let all of us defend general Kim Chong-il with our lives."    Yi In-mo wrote in the unit's combat register: "Let us be  rifles and bombs defending general Kim Chong-il, the greatest  general in the world, with death."</p>

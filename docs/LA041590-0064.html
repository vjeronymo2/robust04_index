			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEW BELIEVE IN 'POPULATION PROPHET'  </P> <P> Congratulations to The Times for running such an incisive, informative article  on Paul Ehrlich and his new book, "The Population Explosion." Thanks to The  Times, we know Ehrlich is one of the most dangerous men in America.  </P> <P> Ehrlich is a social engineer. His efforts to "reprogram consciousness," to  prescribe "politically correct" responses to people who have large families,  and to decry affluent people whose "children take a greater toll on the  environment than children of poor parents" smack of the old Stalinist  totalitarian nightmares Orwell described so pungently.  </P> <P> Ehrlich's theories were discredited years ago by the scientific community, as  well as the concept of "global warming" he stridently harps on. He is the  Trofim Lysenko of our time. Stanford University should be ashamed to have him  on its faculty.  </P> <P> Garry Abrams deserves praise for his even-handed treatment.  </P> <P> RICHARD GRACE  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

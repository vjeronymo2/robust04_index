			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Alvis edges ahead to Pounds 2.24m Alvis, the defence contractor, reported increased profits of Pounds 2.24m pre-tax for the six months to March 31, compared to Pounds 2.19m last time. The upturn was achieved despite a fall in turnover to Pounds 36.7m (Pounds 45.8m) reflecting, according to Mr John Robertshaw, chairman, reduced order books at the Alvis Coventry subsidiaries, which manufacture armoured vehicles. However, Mr Nick Prest, chief executive, said there were good prospects for further export and domestic orders in the medium term. Losses per share were 0.5p (earnings of 0.1p). This primarily resulted from the sale of military optical equipment subsidiaries to 51 per cent-owned Avimo Singapore in 1993. The sale allowed the group's optical businesses to co-operate more fully and released cash which Alvis is using for acquisitions. The interim dividend is unchanged at 0.5p. In the Avimo Singapore group, Helio, the maker of periscopes, turrets and other equipment for fighting vehicles performed well, as did Arab International Optronics, an associate. But contract delays hit the performance of Avimo Alvis Aerospace, which makes vehicle transmissions, and Avimo Electro-Optics. Higher interest income, following the sale to Avimo, was more than offset by higher interest charges at Alvis Vehicles, where borrowings rose as a result of the unwinding of customer advance payments on manufacturing contracts. Unipower, the manufacturer of specialist military vehicles acquired in February, did not make a material contribution to the figures. However, Mr Robertshaw said that the earnings benefits of the acquisition were expected to show through in the next financial year when the British Army BR90 bridge-builder contract comes on stream. The shares closed down 7p at 65p.</p>

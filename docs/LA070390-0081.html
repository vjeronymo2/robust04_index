			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREGNANT WOMEN WARNED ON ASPIRIN  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration on Monday announced stronger warnings against  the use of over-the-counter aspirin products by women in the last three months  of pregnancy unless directed by a physician.  </P> <P> The agency said the stronger warning on labels is being required because  aspirin can affect fetal circulation and uterine contraction.  </P> <P> The new warning must immediately follow a more general caution telling pregnant  women and nursing mothers to check with a health professional before using  aspirin or any other drug.  </P> <P> The FDA said manufacturers have 12 months to implement the label changes,  recommended by an advisory panel of non-government medical experts. The  regulation will be published Thursday in the Federal Register.  </P> <P> A similar warning is already required on non-prescription products containing  ibuprofen, another pain-relieving ingredient. Aspirin and ibuprofen have  similar pharmacologic effects.  </P> <P> The new warning must read:  </P> <P> "It is especially important not to use aspirin during the last three months of  pregnancy unless specifically directed to do so by a doctor because it may  cause problems in the unborn child or complications during delivery."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments of pears. Because this rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expected expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee met on June 3, 1994, and unanimously recommended total expenses of $6,835,926 for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year. In comparison, the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year expense amount was $6,933,615, which is $97,689 more than the amount recommended for the current fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.43 per standard box, or equivalent for winter pears. The Committee did not recommend a supplemental assessment rate for Anjou variety pears this fiscal year. In comparison, the 1993&hyph;94 winter pear assessment rate was $0.45 per standard box, or equivalent and $0.04 for the supplemental assessment rate on Anjou variety pears. This represents a $0.02 decrease in the assessment rate recommended for this fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rate, when applied to anticipated winter pear shipments of 13,817,000 boxes or equivalent, will yield a total of $5,941,310 in assessment income. Assessment income, along with $401,324 from other income sources, and $493,292 from the Committee's authorized reserve, will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. The $493,292 withdrawal of funds from the Committee's authorized reserve will result in no reserve remaining at the end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Major expense categories for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year include $5,572,500 for advertising, $276,340 for SOPP data research, $276,340 for winter pear improvement, $142,310 for salaries and benefits, and $612,442 for unshared contingency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule as hereinafter set forth will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) the fiscal year for the Committee began July 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal year apply to all assessable winter pears handled during the fiscal year; (3) handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committee at public meetings and which is similar to budgets issued in past years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 927  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing agreements and orders, Pears, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 927 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 927_WINTER PEARS GROWN IN OREGON, WASHINGTON, AND CALIFORNIA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

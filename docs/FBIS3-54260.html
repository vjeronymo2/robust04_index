			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kabul, 22 Jan (MENA)--Mohammad Yunus Qanooni, head  of the Afghan Defense Ministry's Political Department, has  announced that the Ettehad-e Eslami [Islamic Union] leader  'Abdol Rasul Sayyaf is making earnest efforts to conclude a  peace agreement between President Borhanoddin Rabbani and his  opponent Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar and establish a  cease-fire in the country.    In a statement to MENA's Kabul correspondent, Qanooni said  that President Rabbani has no objection to starting discussions  with Hekmatyar to resolve their dispute and that he is also  willing to begin immediately forming election committees for  elections to be held in six months.    The Afghan official described Hekmatyar's demand that the  president resign as "unacceptable and part of the political  maneuvering that Hekmatyar uses whenever he finds himself in a  weak position."    Qanooni added: We have become accustomed to such maneuvers.  Formerly Hekmatyar demanded the resignation of Defense Minister  Ahmad Shah Mas'ud as a condition for solving all disputes with  President Rabbani. President Rabbani was appointed by the Shura  Council.    Qanooni pointed out that Hekmatyar cannot set conditions,  because he cannot achieve a military victory.    The head of the Afghan Defense Ministry's Political  Department said that President Rabbani will not accept any good  offices to reach a cease-fire with the forces of the communist  General Abdol Rashid Dostam who is considered a remnant of the  former soviet rule of Afghanistan.    Qanooni added that the call to jihad which the Afghan  president made against Dostam and which was responded to by all  the country's mojahedin and ulema "must be implemented and  cannot be retracted."    Asked about the results of the military clashes between the  president's forces -- which include the forces of Ahmad Shah  Mas'ud, the forces of Isma'il Khan, and the Jami'at-e Eslami  [Islamic Society] forces -- on the one side and Dostam's forces  on the other, Qanooni said that Dostam has lost more than 75  percent of his positions inside and around Kabul. Additionally  250 of his troops were killed and 960 captured.    He pointed out that the success of President Rabbani's  forces  in capturing the Microryan area and purging it of Dostam's  forces had made it possible for them also to capture Miranjan  Hill and Bala Hesar. He explained that these two positions were  Dostam's last two positions around Kabul.    Asked to comment on international and regional attitudes to  the current events in Afghanistan, Qanooni said that according  to his own information, Moscow was seeking to replace the  country's Islamic system with a regime loyal to it. At the same  time, several regional powers believe that Hekmatyar was the  most suitable person to help them attain their objectives in  Afghanistan.    He added that Hekmatyar realized after the battles of Tagab  and Sorubi that he would not be able to face President Rabbani's  forces alone and therefore he sought an alliance with the  communist General Abdol Rashid Dostam.    The head of the Afghan Defense Ministry's Political  Department noted that the Western countries had adopted a  wait-and-see attitude awaiting the consequences of Hekmatyar's  and Dostam's "coup attempt". He pointed out, however, that they  realized after one day of fighting at the beginning of the year  that President Rabbani's regime was not an easy target.    On the current situation, Mohammad Yunus Qanooni said that  President Rabbani's forces have evident superiority in Kabul,  the areas surrounding it, and in northern Afghanistan.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] United Nations, March 14 (XINHUA) --  Secretary-General Butrus has recommended that the UN Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) be strengthened considerably in order to  demilitarize Sarajevo and keep the peace in central Bosnia.    In a report to the Security Council issued today, he said  UNPROFOR needed extra 8,250 troops, 150 military observers and  275 police monitors.    The council, in resolution 900 passed earlier this year, had  asked the secretary-general to appoint an official to help  restore normal life in Sarajevo, and to report on procedures to  extend UN protection to the towns of Maglaj, Mostar and Vitez.    The secretary-general said 2,200 of the extra troops would  be  needed in and around Sarajevo, 6,050 in central Bosnia,  including Mostar and Vitez, and further 1,500 would be needed if  the council were to extend the safe-area concept to Maglaj.    He warned that UNPROFOR currently lacked the military  resources to achieve its objectives and could lose the  initiative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, despite numerous  opportunities for progress.    The secretary-general said UNPROFOR's mandate would have to  be modified if member states did not provide the necessary  personnel.    "It would be a tragedy for the people of Bosnia and  Herzegovina if the present opportunity were lost for lack of  resources," he concluded.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / International Company News: Decline in profits slows at Banco Central Hispano Banco Central Hispano, Spain's largest bank in terms of assets, saw net group profits after minorities drop by 8 per cent last year to Pta48.4bn (Dollars 338m). The bank claimed it had turned round the balance sheet after sustaining a 22 per cent fall in group income in 1992. The results, which were ahead of analyst estimates, were the most keenly awaited among those of Spain's top financial groups following the intervention by the authorities at troubled rival bank Banesto at the end of last year. Pointing to the group's continued weakness in the basic lending business, BCH's net interest income shrunk by 4.8 per cent to Pta299bn, but its operating profit margin, including fee commissions and what the group called financial operations, rose by 11.8 per cent to Pta465bn. Financial operations, understood to be mainly foreign exchange and public debt dealings, earned the group Pta81.5bn, against Pta19.8bn in 1992. However, this is essentially a non-recurring item because it was realised in the exceptional circumstances of sharp falls in interest rates and of a rapidly weakening peseta during last year's European currency turmoils. Net profits at BCH, which is still absorbing the impact of the 1991 merger between Banco Central and Banco Hispano Americano that created the group, are not expected to recover until next year. The 1993 operating profit, however, showed a strong 26.2 per cent increase to Pta172bn which allowed BCH to set aside Pta110bn for non-performing loan provisions, up from a Pta86.4bn allocation for bad debts in 1992. Aside from provisioning, BCH's balance sheet was penalised by a 39.7 per cent fall in income to Pta7bn from the group's industrial assets, which include some of the recession-hit domestic economy's top companies, and by a 12 per cent fall to Pta41.6bn in extraordinary income through disposals.</p>

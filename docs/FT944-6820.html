			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Church not pervasive in Irish politics Sir, Your editorial, 'No bad thing for Ireland' (November 21), said the political crisis in Dublin exposed some vital questions, first among them whether Ireland can claim to be a secular state while the Roman Catholic Church continues to wield a pervasive influence in political life. You might care to read your correspondent, John Murray Brown's, reports of the crisis. Brown barely, if at all, mentions the Roman Catholic Church. The crisis was about politics and distrust between Mr Dick Spring and Mr Albert Reynolds, arising principally out of the beef tribunal report last August. Mr Spring's unexplained reservations about the former attorney general, promoted and then denounced by Mr Reynolds, had probably as much to do with the attorney's role in protecting Mr Reynolds in the course of that inquiry as with the style of the attorney's catholicism. The delay in the processing of the extradition warrant was the fuse, not the explosive, in Ireland's political explosion. The politics would have been the same, no matter what the profession of the child abuser. Despite the spreading of misleading rumours, no evidence of church interference in due process was found. It doesn't amount to pervasive influence in political life. Besides, Irish voters have long since reconciled church attendance with independent action as citizens. Few people, especially politicians, pay much attention to what bishops say about political questions, in Ireland as in England. Oliver O'Connor, 48 Stonepark Abbey, Rathfamham, Dublin 14, Ireland</p>

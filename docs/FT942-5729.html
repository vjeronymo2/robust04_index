			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Drugs revelations win Chuan a breather: Opposition disarray that plays into hands of Thai PM's coalition Few Thais were astonished when the government let it be known two weeks ago that 17 opposition politicians were suspected by the US of drug trafficking. Thai politics is not for the squeamish, and the corruption and unscrupulousness of many politicians have never been in doubt. But the latest round of drug revelations - which obliged the US to confirm that it had indeed blacklisted at least two opposition MPs already named in public - was adroitly timed to give the fragile coalition government a much-needed breathing space. In March, the opposition had joined forces with the military-dominated Senate and thrown out plans to make the constitution more democratic. Since these reforms were among the main aims of the 20-month-old administration, some government supporters believed Mr Chuan Leekpai, the prime minister, would be forced to dissolve parliament and call an election. So far he has avoided a dissolution. Government MPs have put a brave face on the defeat, saying that they can amend the opposition's own draft constitution enough to reach a satisfactory compromise, and they have simultaneously put the opposition on the defensive with a flurry of leaks about drug trafficking and other misdemeanours. Mr Thanong Siripreechapong, an MP for Chart Thai (Thai Nation), the largest opposition party, was forced to resign after being accused of earning more than Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m) by smuggling marijuana to the US. Another Chart Thai MP was found by police at an illegal gambling den, and the usual cover-up to protect his reputation failed to take place. Yet another opposition MP who was refused entry to the US on suspicion of drug smuggling tearfully declared his innocence in parliament and accused the government of 'a devilish and dirty tactic'. Government MPs have denied any campaign to discredit the opposition by leaking information on drug cases. 'I must deny it,' said Mr Akapol Sorasuchart, a government MP in Bangkok from Mr Chuan's Democrat party. But he added: 'The timing is on the government's side, we must admit.' The publicity surrounding the scandals has infuriated Mr Banharn Silapa-archa, who recently took over the leadership of the Chart Thai party and is regarded as a possible future prime minister. Mr Banharn is known as 'the mobile ATM' (automatic teller machine) because of his generosity and his expertise in the traditional patronage-politics of Thailand. He has good contacts in the armed forces and the bureaucracy. Suphanburi, his constituency, boasts plenty of new roads and new schools and is jokingly called Banharn-buri by Thais. But the scandals have been a setback for Mr Banharn's efforts to promote the opposition as a serious national alternative to the Chuan government, and he has vowed to avenge the Chart Thai party with 'eye-for-eye, tooth-for-tooth policies in dealing with the government'. Mr Chuan, seen as the inheritor of the 'angel' mantle of those who fought against the armed forces on the streets of Bangkok to restore democracy in 1992, is meanwhile under attack from the left as much as from the right. By Thai standards the upper levels of this government are remarkably free of corruption, but liberals are incensed that Mr Chuan has backed down on the constitution - he at first wanted, among other aims, to reduce the size and power of the appointed Senate - and has failed to spread democracy to local government. Mr Chalard Vorachat, a former Democrat MP, is staging a hunger strike outside parliament in Bangkok and says he will fast to death unless the constitution is thoroughly reformed. Mr Chuan can take little comfort from the fact that right-wingers have set up food-laden tables near Mr Chalard's tent and are mocking him by threatening to gorge themselves to death. At least Mr Chuan does not fear an imminent coup d'etat in a country once famous for them; the army's influence is declining. The prime minister and his supporters say the civilian government has made a start in promoting economic development in rural areas and is presiding over an economy growing at a healthy 8 per cent annually. But Mr Chuan's critics - including members of the Palang Dharma (Moral Force) party that is one of the five parties in the coalition - are uneasy about his willingness to compromise on the constitution and annoyed that he has yet to make a decision on how to solve Bangkok's notorious transport problems. Negotiations on the constitution, conducted in a parliamentary committee dominated by the opposition, are likely to drag on for two or more months. There is also bound to be plenty of information about the dubious activities of opposition MPs that has yet to be revealed. Neither the government nor the opposition parties seem confident at present about winning an election, although some political analysts believe MPs from both sides are manoeuvring for an election in September or October - a scant two years after the last one. No elected government in Thailand has survived its full four-year term. Mr Chuan would like his administration to be the first to do so, but it would be hard to find a Thai politician prepared to bet any money on the idea.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold market absorbs fund 'dishoarding' At least 880 tonnes of gold (28m troy ounces) was bought by hedge and commodity funds in 1993, according to estimates by the American Precious Metals Advisors consultancy organisation. It suggests that the funds then sold at least 520 tonnes (17m ounces) in the first half of 1994. Mr Jeffrey Nichols, APMA's president, says gold sales by the funds have undoubtedly continued in the second half of this year. 'What is quite remarkable is that the market has absorbed this incremental supply without much agony and the price of gold has remained mostly in the Dollars 375 to Dollars 395 (an ounce) range,' he says in the latest issue of APMA's MetalsFAX. 'This is testimony to the strength of investment and jewellery demand from Asia and the Middle East,' he states. 'The implication is that, when institutional dishoarding (of gold) has run its course, barring a resumption of large central bank sales, there will be insufficient supplies to satisfy market requirements.' Mr Nichols points out that most of the gold buying and selling by the funds was principally through derivative instruments such as exchange-traded futures; over-the-counter, or dealer, forwards; options; and warrants. Some other large-scale players in the gold market, particularly many European and Middle Eastern investors who years ago participated exclusively in the physical bullion market, are also now trading principally in derivative instruments. He argues that this change has obscured their activities to some analysts, 'resulting in a false picture of what's really going on in the gold investment arena'. Mr Nichols suggests that the markets for gold derivatives and bullion are not really separate and distinct markets, but are 'a seamless, interrelated, single market,' because every purchase or sale of gold derivatives translates into buying or selling of gold bullion in the physical market.

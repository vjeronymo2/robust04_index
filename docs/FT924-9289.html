			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Ex-minister questions DTI licence descriptions DESCRIPTIONS by manuf-acturers of the final use of their products are 'hardly relevant' when they apply to the Department of Trade and Industry for export licences, Mr Alan Clark, a former trade minister, told an Old Bailey court yesterday, John Mason writes. He was giving evidence in the trial of three former directors of Matrix Churchill, the Coventry machine tool maker, who deny breaching export regulations by telling the DTI that equipment to be exported to Iraq was for civilian not military use. 'Saying what it is for is hardly relevant,' Mr Clark said. 'The point is what can it do.' The trial continues today.</p>

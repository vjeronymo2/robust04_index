			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IMPRESSIVE LIST OF PLAYS PLANNED ON SAN DIEGO'S COLLEGE CIRCUIT  </P> <P> A world premiere musical that had a reading at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre  Center in Waterford, Conn., two world premiere dramas, a West Coast premiere of  a Eugene Ionesco play and a San Diego premiere by Canadian playwright George  Walker.  </P> <P> It sounds like an impressive season for any professional company, but these  shows actually are a composite of what is scheduled on the seasons of the  theater departments at UC San Diego, San Diego State University and United  States International University.  </P> <P> All these shows will be performed, and many will be directed, by graduate  students. Still, the quality can be high. "Strindberg Sonata," a production  last year at UCSD, picked up three San Diego Critics Circle nominations this  year -- best production, best direction (Anne Bogart) and best new play (by  Bogart, Jeff Halpern et. al).  </P> <P> More commonly, the season can be used as an opportunity to preview talent  before it goes professional.  </P> <P> Prominent San Diego State graduates in San Diego theater include Craig Noel,  executive director of the Old Globe Theatre, Kit Goldman, managing director of  the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre, Dianne Holly, a faculty member at San Diego State,  who is resident costume designer at the Gaslamp, and Kathy Najimy, co-star of  the San Diego-spawned Off-Broadway hit, "The Kathy and Mo Show."  </P> <P> UC San Diego, which works exclusively with the La Jolla Playhouse, most  recently gave us Jim Lewis, co-writer of "Dangerous Games," the Playhouse  production that is soon to open on Broadway. And USIU's latest undergraduate  success story is John Barrowman, who took a leave of absence to star in  "Anything Goes" in London's West End.  </P> <P> The world premiere musical "First Star" promises to be the star of the upcoming  SDSU season. Written by Steve Lutvak and Mitchell Ivers, it tells the true  story of America's first acting troupe, the Hallam Company, which came to  America from Great Britain in the late 18th Century. Theater department  chairwoman Alicia Annas has high hopes for the production, which was  commissioned by theater professor Robert Chapel. The contract stipulates that  San Diego State will be credited in  </P> <P> any commercial productions.  </P> <P> "First Star" will have a workshop production in November followed by a full  production May 4-12 at the Don Powell Theatre. It will finish a season at SDSU  that is already in progress with the the world premiere of a new translation by  Jeffrey Mason of the Alexandre Dumas fils story "Lady of the Camellias,"  through Oct. 7 at the Don Powell.  </P> <P> The rest of the SDSU season includes:  </P> <P> * "The Boys From Syracuse," the musical by Rodgers and Hart based on  Shakespeare's "The Comedy of Errors," Oct. 20-28 at the Experimental Theatre.  </P> <P> * The West Coast premiere of Ionesco's "Man With Bags," a story of cultural  estrangement in which a man returns to his nameless native country and conducts  a nightmarishly frustrating search for his family, friends and youth, Nov.  10-18 at the Don Powell.  </P> <P> * John Guare's "Landscape of the Body," about the struggles of a mother and son  to survive in Greenwich Village, Feb. 17-24 at the Experimental Theatre.  </P> <P> * William Shakespeare's "The Winter's Tale," the story of a jealous king,  (which may be changed for another Shakespeare play).  </P> <P> * "Zastrozzi: the Master of Discipline," a San Diego premiere about a cunning  European criminal by Canadian playwright George Walker, March 30-April 7 at the  Experimental Theatre.  </P> <P> One of the highlights of the UC San Diego season should be the work of  acclaimed theater artist Andrei Serban (known for his electric stagings at  Lincoln Center, La Mama Experimental Theatre, the New York Public Theatre and  the Los Angeles Music Center), who will direct a play of his choosing April  11-15 at the Mandell Weiss Theatre.  </P> <P> The other is "The Trials of Don Edwardo," a new play by graduate student  playwright Daniel Camacho, which will be the premiere production by the new  Hispanic-American Theatre program, May 9-13 at the Warren Theatre. The play,  which will be directed by Jorge Huerta, theater department faculty member and  head of the Hispanic-American Theatre program, will be presented in West  Germany as part of the "International Conference on Hispanics in the United  States" in July and continue to tour Europe.  </P> <P> These two shows will conclude a season that begins with the participation of  seven actors, three designers, two directors and one stage manager from the  UCSD theater department in the La Jolla Playhouse production of "Macbeth,"  directed by Playhouse artistic director Des McAnuff Oct. 15-Nov. 19 at the  Mandell Weiss Theatre. It continues with:  </P> <P> * "Fefu and Her Friends," by six-time Obie-award winner Maria Irene Fornes  about a group of women in the 1970s who look back at their idealism in the  1930s, Nov. 1-12 at the Warren Theatre.  </P> <P> * "Tartuffe," Moliere's classic about a scoundrel who worms his way into the  heart of a gullible aristocrat susceptible to his flattery, Nov. 29-Dec. 3, at  the Warren Theatre.  </P> <P> * "The Bacchae," Euripides' tragedy about how a king's rejection of Bacchus,  the god of wine and revelry, results in his own destruction, Jan. 31-Feb. 4 at  the Mandell Weiss Theatre.  </P> <P> * "Sweet Patria," a new play by graduate student William Reyes, tells the story  of a general in charge of the secret police in a small Latin American town who  is forced to confront a past that has come back to haunt him, Feb. 14-18 at the  Warren Theatre. It will be presented next summer as a workshop production by  Teatro de la Esperanza in San Francisco.  </P> <P> * "From Morn to Midnight," by Georg Kaiser, an Expressionist tale of an  Everyman who searches for an existence that affirms the significance of the  human spirit, Feb. 28-March 4 at the Mandell Weiss Theatre.  </P> <P> At USIU, musical theater usually dominates the season, and this year is no  exception, with four popular musicals and two non-musicals scheduled. All will  be at the Theatre in Old Town with the exception of "Hello Dolly!," the Michael  Stewart &amp; Jerry Herman musical based on Thornton Wilder's play about  busybody matchmaker Dolly Levi. "Hello Dolly!" will be presented at the Lyceum  Theatre in Horton Plaza Feb. 14-March 11 as part of a USIU festival at the  Lyceum, including presentations from the USIU ballet, orchestra and visual arts  department.  </P> <P> The highlight of the USIU season, though, may well be the USIU debut of film  producer and director Jack Ofield, winner of a Peabody, an Emmy and an American  Film Festival Blue Ribbon. Ofield, who also is a professor at San Diego State,  will be taking a departure from his recent productions for PBS to direct the  show of his choice -- "The Fantasticks." The Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt  musical, still running Off Broadway after 29 years, tells the sweet and sour  Romeo and Juliet story of two young lovers who meet despite a high garden wall  that separates their houses, Jan. 31-March 18.  </P> <P> Surrounding these selections are:  </P> <P> * "The Mikado, or The Town of Titipu," the Gilbert and Sullivan classic about  Nanki Poo's courtship of Yum-Yum who is sadly affianced to the Lord High  Executioner, Koko, set in ancient Japan, Oct. 4-29.  </P> <P> * "The Front Page," the Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur comedy about a tough  reporter who tries to leave the business just before the story that may prove  the biggest of his career begins to break, Nov. 15-Dec. 3.  </P> <P> * "Cyrano de Bergerac," Edmond Rostand's story of the poet whose great nose  stands between him and the woman he loves, April 11-29.  </P> <P> * "Carnival," Michael Stewart and Robert Merrill's musical about an embittered  carnival owner and his wandering troupe, May 16-June 10.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SDSU: The world premiere musical "First Star," written by Steve Lutvak and  Mitchell Ivers, should be the star of the season.  </P> <P> UCSD: Acclaimed theater artist Andrei Serban, known for his electric stagings  at Lincoln Center, will direct a play of his choosing.  </P> <P> USIU: Film producer Jack Ofield will be taking a departure from his productions  for PBS to direct "The Fantasticks."  </P></p>

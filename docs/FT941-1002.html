			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / World News in Brief: Eurofighter makes maiden flight after two-year delay The Eurofighter 2000 combat aircraft made a 40-minute maiden flight yesterday at Manching in Germany. Eurofighter, being developed by a consortium comprising British Aerospace in the UK, Alenia in Italy, Casa in Spain and Dasa in Germany, is two years behind schedule after a series of technical and political problems. Production is expected to begin in 1996 or 1997 and delivery to the RAF, which wants 250 aircraft, from 2000. Development and production costs are expected to reach Pounds 32bn, with Britain's share likely to be Pounds 12bn.</p>

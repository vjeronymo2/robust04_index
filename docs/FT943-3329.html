			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Winter crops hit by Australian drought A severe drought in Australia's eastern states has caused the country's Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics to cut its forecast for winter crop production to 16.6m tonnes, down from an estimated 28.2m tonnes in 1993-94. Wheat production alone is forecast to fall by 38 per cent to 10.4m tonnes. The bulk of this production will come from Western Australia, 'the third successive year that wheat production in WA will be around 6m tonnes, which is near-record production,' the bureau said. By contrast, the area sown to wheat in New South Wales is expected to be about half that planted in 1993-94. Total production in NSW is expected to be about 1m tonnes - less than 20 per cent of the 1993-94 figure. Queensland, where the drought is into its fourth year, is forecast to produce only 230,000 tonnes. In a 'normal' year, Queensland's wheat production is around 1.5m tonnes. The bureau acknowledged that the drought was likely to have 'an important impact on wheat exports', but said that the drop in production would not be reflected in the fall in exports because of stocks carried over from 1993-94. Wheat is not the only crop seriously affected by drought. In its latest quarterly crop forecast, the bureau predicts that barley production will halve from last year's record levels to 3.4m tonnes. Cotton production is also likely to be hit for the third year in a row. Plantings take place between September and December, but given meteorologists' forecasts, ABARE says it expects only 223,000 hectares to be planted to cotton, 42,000 hectares less than the area harvested in 1993-94. The bureau says yields will probably be down too because of a shortage of irrigation water.</p>

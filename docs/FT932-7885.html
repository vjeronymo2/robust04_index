			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour MPs split in Maastricht vote MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, was congratulated by cabinet colleagues in the Commons last night after the Maastricht bill secured its third reading in spite of a revolt by 41 Tory backbenchers. The bill now goes to the House of Lords. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, saw his party split three ways - with the majority following the official party line by abstaining. Former cabinet ministers Mr Tony Benn and Mr Peter Shore were among the 65 Labour backbenchers who went into the lobby against the bill while four Labour MPs voted for it. Mr Kenneth Baker, the former Conservative party chairman and home secretary, was among five government backbenchers who abstained. Closing the debate, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, underlined the prime minister's recent declaration that sterling would not rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism for several years. Stressing that it would be two or three years until the German economy adjusted fully to the massive strains of reunification, the chancellor said: 'Until it does, it would not be appropriate for us to contemplate rejoining the exchange rate mechanism'. To government cheers, he insisted: 'It would not be in our economic interests - and the government will not do it.' Opening the debate Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, sought to win over Tory doubters with a further assurance that Maastricht was not a blueprint for a European superstate. The foreign secretary used the 205th hour MPs have spent debating the measure in the past year to warn passionately of the dangers of eroding European competitiveness and to set out his vision of the Community's future. In a confident and relaxed address he assured Euro-sceptics that their fears of a 'lurch' towards a superstate were 'misguided.' He concluded with a clarion call to MPs before the bill moves to the Lords to 'find again' the decisive will to act together in the 'great matters' where there was a common European interest. On the eve of the first anniversary of the bill's second reading Mr Hurd devoted much of his speech to concerns that the costs imposed on employers by the social chapter could have serious consequences for European competitiveness. 'More and more people' were concerned about the high labour costs European companies were faced with compared with their international competitors. The social chapter could 'place in jeopardy many of the achievements of the last 14 years in freeing our labour market from restrictions which destroy jobs'. His views were rejected by Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, who said the government's decision to exclude the social chapter was 'fundamentally unacceptable.' Referring to the manoeuvring that had forced the government to remove the protocol containing Britain's social chapter opt-out, he said Labour had secured a 'valuable legal situation' that may yet allow British workers to use the European Court to gain access to the benefits of the chapter. Mr Cunningham said Labour could not support the bill because of the government's decision to exclude the social chapter. But since the party's efforts had procured for MPs an opportunity to vote on the chapter's principle, it would be 'obtuse' for Labour to vote against it. To do so would deny the social chapter to workers in Europe as well as Britain.</p>

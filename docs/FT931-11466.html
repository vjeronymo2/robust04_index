			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: LTV moves deeper into red LTV, the steel group which has been operating under US bankruptcy court protection since 1986, yesterday reported a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 129m, compared with a net loss of Dollars 8.5m in the same period of 1991. The increased loss was partly due to a Dollars 140m extraordinary charge for LTV's estimated liability under a new law relating to retiree health benefits in the coal industry. This was partly offset by a Dollars 60m special credit. Sales totalled Dollars 947m, against Dollars 924m. Fourth-quarter operating income was Dollars 13.4m, compared with a loss of Dollars 70.3m in the same period of last year, with its steel business losing Dollars 49.1m, against Dollars 54m a year ago. For 1992 as a whole, LTV reported net income of Dollars 598.7m, compared with Dollars 74.1m in 1991, thanks to a Dollars 737m gain on the sale of its aerospace and defence business.</p>

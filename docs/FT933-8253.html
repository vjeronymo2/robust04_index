			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Arts: The Brecon jazz festival jumps with talent into the early hours - Garry Booth enjoys the Golden Men and much more in the Welsh hills The glorious contrasts and incongruities of the Brecon Jazz Festival set it apart from the more urbane, metropolitan happenings of summer. Trad mayhem, swing and bebop permeate the comfortably fraying fabric of the Welsh market town, running together happily. While a samba army rattles the sash windows of The Bulwark, a street-corner barber's-shop quartet holds its own against the spiky young fusionists in the museum car park bandstand. In the main square, two apprehensive Chet Baker soundalikes are scattered from their busking pitch by a weighty New Orleans marching band advancing noisily from the top of the town. Hastily regrouping before their audience is carried along in the band's wake, they turn to find a second, bigger band bearing down on them, at full steam, from the other end of town. This year's contrasts were carried into the concert hall programming: at midnight on Friday, pianist Hank Jones' Trio could be found dispensing sweet standards in the tranquil setting of Christ College's school hall, while Julian Joseph and his quartet drowned out the late-night boozers in the Guildhall with their energetic British neo-bop. Earlier, in the cavernous market hall, which smelled less of sheep this 10th anniversary year, Lionel Hampton swung his Golden Men of Jazz with the kind of vim you would not reasonably expect of any 85-year-old other than Hamp (except maybe Stephane Grappelli, who climbed on to the same stand on Sunday). Helped in his directing by trombonist Al Grey, splendid in pith helmet and wing collar, Golden Men, such as trumpeters Harry 'Sweets' Edison and a languid Clark Terry were pushed along by the vamping piano of Junior Mance, Arvell Shaw on bass fiddle, and the singing drummer, Grady Tate. If Hamp looks frail negotiating the stairs to the stand, he is rejuvenated when reunited with the vibes. More than that, he is difficult to dislodge once the swinging starts. 'We'll be back,' he said as Grey tried to prise his sticks from him for the interval, 'we gonna feed the sheep.' As Hampton was reluctantly leaving the stand, a sprint across town was needed to catch Hank Jones meshing neatly with drummer Idris Muhammad and bassist Heyn van der Geyn. Romantic but fleet pianist, moving from Weill to Kern via Joe Henderson, the equilateral sound of the trio is both tight and soothing. McCoy Tyner, in a rare solo performance, later filled the same space with torrential originals and supercharged standards. Gathering up fistfuls of notes with the right and throwing down clumps of chords with the left, Tyner burns with ideas: even when the musical firework is not exploding, the shapes and hues in each hiatus are hypnotic. Trumpet players at either end of the gravitas spectrum were well represented. Australian multi-instrumentalist, James Morrison, comes over like a ribald Muppet but plays the horn like Gabriel. His self-deprecating wit - 'we don't do requests . . . unless we're asked' - and unstinting mickey-taking of brother John, the drummer, belie an indecent mastery of trumpet, flugel, trombone and euphonium. 'Things Aint What They Used To Be' featured Morrison duetting by himself, trombone multiphonics in one hand and searing trumpet in the other. If it were not for the brother mugging furiously behind, it could almost be too much of a good thing. Trumpet virtuoso, Wynton Marsalis, is sometimes criticised for being too good at too much. The control and purity of tone required for the concerto have no place in jazz, say the unconverted. Jazz favours a flawed beauty, according to conventional wisdom, and although Marsalis is steeped in the New Orleans tradition, he has insufficient demons to progress the genre, they say. But with these six young men around him, he convinces me: wailing through a marching blues, alongside the caustic clarinet of Walter Blanding, swaying in a funereal dirge with Wycliffe 'Pine Cone' Gordon on plunger-muted trombone, or zipping through a bebop piece with the full ensemble in tight harmony, he is hard to fault in any department. The superstars do not steal the show entirely at Brecon, however. And the pubs, hotels and temporary stands around town jump with talent until the early hours. Flying ants, intrusive BBC crews and the ubiquitous pavement pizza aside, Brecon remains nigh-on jazz heaven.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Lyubov Tsukanova commentary: "Uncontrolled Sovereignty Is </F> Unpredictable. But This Is Better Than Standing Still"]    [Text] During his visit to Tatarstan, President Yeltsin  drew the conclusion that he had been right in the first place to  offer republics within the Russian Federation as much  sovereignty as "they could swallow." The basis for this  conclusion is a bilateral treaty recently signed between Russia  and the Republic of Tatarstan, which determines the volume of  republic powers on the one hand and federal powers on the other  hand. As Boris Yeltsin noted, the treaty has enshrined the real  volume of powers which the republic is in a position to digest.  However, judging by the worried face of Mintimer Shaymiyev, the  process of "digestion" is proceeding with difficulty, and he  briefly outlined the reason for this in his reply: "Mechanisms  are needed..." Following on from this by association, what this  means is that anything can be swallowed, but in order to avoid  indigestion, sovereignty must be "chewed" properly. That is,  totally specific organizational mechanisms of interaction  between the center and the component of the Federation must be  thought out and elaborated. As usual, this is difficult. And  as extremely long discussions went on at one time about the  mechanism of the implementation of the Federation Treaty, which  was not elaborated in the end anyway, so now there is --  evidently on Tatarstan's part, first and foremost -- strong  concern about ensuring that the bilateral treaty does not remain  a political declaration only.    The meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Mintimer Shaymiyev  should be a guarantee of the fact that steps to regulate  economic problems will follow on from the political achievements  of the treaty (and these are real: Elections to the Russian  Federation Federal Assembly have been held in Tatarstan). The  economic problems are no less real and alarming: Mutual tax  relations have not been established, which is worrying the  federal government first and foremost, as it is not receiving  the full complement of taxes from Tatarstan; the republic, for  its part, is not satisfied with the fact that the center has so  far done nothing to ensure that the demarcation of powers has  moved from "paper" to practical deeds.    Admittedly, the creation of a bilateral commission to  monitor  the implementation of the treaty has been announced. But no  commission in our country has ever been a guarantee that things  will get moving. In a specific case, perhaps only direct  support to a given problem on the part of Russian Government  Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray, who, as we know, promoted the  treaty on the center's side, may serve as a guarantee.    The Russian Federation president expressed the hope that the  outline for mutual relations between Moscow and Kazan will  constitute the basis for settling problems between the center  and other components of the Federation which are aspiring to  autonomy. He has Chechnya primarily in mind. But today,  Bashkiria, Tuva, and a number of "self-sufficient" krays and  oblasts are aspiring to the Tatarstan model. Evidently, the  process of formulating bilateral treaties will be widened,  although it has a lot of opponents, according to whom this will  mean a transition from a constitutional federation to a  treaty-based one. This problem has not been solved on a  theoretical level, and will most likely not be solved in the  near future. The construction of the federation, like a lot of  other things, is proceeding by the method of "feeling your way."  "The digestion of sovereignty" by the republics is proceeding in  an uncontrolled way, with a multitude of negative side-effects  which no one is analyzing properly at state level. Krays and  oblasts, which have recently been pinning more and more hopes on  regional unification within historically established economic  areas, are moving along the experimental path toward greater  independence. What this will turn into, no one can say today.  The only thing that is clear is that the more the federal  powers, both executive and legislative, delay in settling  regional problems, the fewer the chances are that the  construction of the federation will proceed along a normal,  constructive path, without any nasty surprises for Moscow.</p>

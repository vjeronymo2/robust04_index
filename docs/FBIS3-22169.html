			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Amon Antachai, governor of Chanthaburi Province,  disclosed that the Interior Ministry on 4 February issued an  order instructing provincial administrations along the border  with Cambodia to open for 24 hours per day temporary crossing  points for Thai logging companies to transport timber left  stranded in Cambodia. The opening of the crossing points will  last until 31 March.    The Cambodian Government earlier announced a relaxation of  the timber export ban for Thai loggers to transport their timber  to Thailand before the 31 March deadline.    The temporary opening of the border crossing points by the  Interior Ministry is a great relief for Thai loggers because  their timber has been inside Cambodia since 31 December 1992  when the Thai Government ordered the closure of the crossing  points in compliance with UN resolutions. Some 100,000 to  200,000 cubic meters of timber worth several hundred million  baht of Thai logging companies will be sent across the border to  Thailand. Before the general election and formation of the  Cambodian coalition government, the Thai logging companies were  lobbying with the then Cambodian regime for permission to ship  their timber out of the country to no avail.

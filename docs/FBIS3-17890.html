Last year  the figure was around $2 Bn.    In a Tuesday interview with Interfax Samoylov said that  Russia did not lose the arms markets of the former Soviet Union  and is ready to expand cooperation in this sphere with  traditional partners: Arab countries, India, China, African and  East European nations.    According to Samoylov, the volume of sales has been falling  due to the form of payments. Since 1991 Russia has been  demanding immediate payment and has stopped giving credits to  countries for importing its armaments.    He said that last year the U.S. sold approximately the same  amount of weapons at the same terms as Russia. "The $30 Bn  volume of trade the Americans speak of is credited," he said.    Samoylov added that the USSR offered credits for 7 to 40  years for the purchase of its weaponry. He also said that  Russia lost between 10 and 15 billion dollars because of UN  sanctions against its old partners: Libya and Iraq. He said  Western states received compensation from the United Nations and  the IMF for breaking off economic ties with the two countries.  According to the head of Rosvooruzhenie, only Russia was left  without compensation.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Wrong attitude to human rights: The debate on renewal of China's MFN status has sparked a covert discussion about political reform President Bill Clinton has described his decision on the renewal of China's privileged trade access to the US market as one of the most critical of his administration. In China itself, the Most Favoured Nation status issue is regarded as hardly less important. Both the US and Chinese leaderships appear to sense that the ruling on MFN renewal due by June 3 will mark something of a watershed in Sino-US relations: that much more is at stake than simply two-way trade running at about Dollars 40bn annually. Not least of the vexed questions facing the Clinton administration is how, in the longer term, it might deal with human rights and China. Unless a way is found to cope with the issue within the broader relationship, it will continue to fester, threatening an increasingly important commercial and strategic partnership. While the White House has conducted a high-profile and sometimes agonising debate with itself over MFN renewal, Chinese officials have appeared at one in their determination to secure an extension without making significant concessions to western pressures on human rights. Mr Clinton in granting MFN last year called for 'overall significant improvement' in China's human rights behaviour, including greater respect for the universal declaration on human rights. But China's appearance of unyielding unity of purpose on MFN tells only part of the story. No less than in the outside world, MFN renewal has encouraged fairly widespread discussion in China about questions such as relations with the west, economic liberalisation and political change, and most crucially about the best means of harnessing western pressures to achieve desirable political reform. This debate, because of China's lack of open discussion, is furtive. It is certainly not ventilated in the official press, but among scholars, dissidents and even some of the more liberal members of the Communist party these are lively issues and ones that go to the heart of how Chinese society might evolve. Mr Clinton and his advisers may not fully appreciate the implications for China's internal development and its relations with the west. But many Chinese intellectuals antipathetic to the Communist regime hope that MFN is granted and moreover that trade and human rights issues are de-linked. They are frankly critical of what they regard as the US use of the blunt trade instrument in its well-meaning efforts to achieve progress on human rights. Typical of those who hold such views is Mr Cui Wenhua, an historian and television scriptwriter, who lost his job over his involvement in the June 1989 pro-democracy protests and who professes no love for the communist rulers. 'If the world seeks to isolate China, it will only slow down the process of liberalisation,' he says. 'Since the world cannot totally ignore China, it should try to engage it more fully.' These may appear naive views given that the Communist party shows little sign of yielding any ground to its opponents and indeed has recently been cracking down even harder on dissidents; but it is also true that China is in the middle of a process of economic liberalisation and opening to the outside world unprecedented in its history. This opening, which differs markedly from past contact with foreign influences in that it has not been forced on China, is introducing western ideas and values to a receptive audience among an urban elite, an increasing number of whom have travelled and lived abroad. Notions of individual rights, democracy and basic freedoms which are taken for granted in the west have tremendous appeal for younger Chinese intellectuals, but inevitably this embrace of western ideas leads to conflict with an older generation of scholars who believe that Confucian ideals of filial obedience and respect for authority should prevail. Yang Dongping, a researcher at the Beijing Polytechnic and commentator on changes in Chinese society, says that both sides of the debate look to Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan to prove their point. The younger generation attributes the success of these south-east Asian tigers to market economics and relative democratic freedoms, while older scholars choose to believe that Confucianism has underpinned their advancement. Where the views of the two sides converge is on the pace of desirable change in China to avoid what an albeit thin veneer of politically literate Chinese fear most: chaos. 'Most people, including the younger generation, understand it will take more than a day to adapt western ideas and values,' says Mr Yang. This ill-defined majority among the politically aware would in turn part company with hard-core dissidents such as Wei Jingsheng, the pro-democracy activist recently detained for questioning in connection with unspecified 'new crimes'. Mr Wei believes, according to his friends, in 'making haste' in pursuit of political change. He also favours, as he made clear in a conversation early this year with an official US human rights envoy, continued and even increased western pressure on China to bring about such change. In his contacts with Mr John Shattuck, the US assistant secretary of state for human rights, Mr Wei was committing what in the eyes of the regime was a virtually unpardonable sin known as li tong waiguo, literally maintaining illicit relations with a foreign country, or to employ the colloquial western description, washing one's dirty linen in public. Other leaders of the 1989 protests such as Liu Xiaobo, the philosopher and writer, also advocate continued western pressure on questions such as MFN, though Mr Liu is in favour of renewal. 'Without pressure from the international community,' he observes, 'the Chinese government would be rampant (in its treatment of dissidents),' he says. Among international human rights activists, who are frustrated by what they perceive as the Clinton administration's cynical handling of the MFN issue and a drift away from sanctions, a similar view prevails. Robin Munro of the Human Rights Watch/Asia believes that 'pressure is the only thing that works' when it comes to forcing the Chinese to recognise western concerns over human rights. Mr Munro, whose organisation compiles the most comprehensive dossier of China's human rights transgressions, dismisses what he describes as a 'mantra' argument that economic change will inevitably spawn political reform. 'This is a pious hope,' he says. 'It does not connect with reality.' In contrast, even those critics with the gloomiest perspective would concede that profound change is afoot, although they would differ on where it is leading. While there has been a significant improvement in Chinese living standards in many areas, the country's rulers continue to discourage thoughts of political liberalisation. The historian Mr Cui has no doubt that quite apart from impressive material advances, a more important change is that of the 'heart'. 'Chinese citizens have emerged from being slaves of the dark ages to citizens with some modern thoughts, and this should be the springboard for greater change in the future,' he says. He cites by way of example of changes afoot, the Communist party decision to embrace what it describes as a 'socialist market economy'. 'In reality the word 'socialist' does not mean anything,' Mr Cui observes. 'A market economy is a market economy. As long as you allow the market to exist this will produce changes of ownership and interest that will eventually lead to political diversification.' This latter development is one that disturbs China's communist rulers. They understand that having embarked on a far-reaching programme of economic reform they are riding a tiger whose behaviour will be far from predictable, and that economic and social change is, in any case, loosening central control. But the leadership also appreciates that as far as economic reform is concerned there is no turning back without risking the fate that has befallen the Communist party of the former Soviet Union, which failed to adapt to change and paid the price. Chinese officials are fond of the bicycle metaphor when describing China's current circumstances: if you stop pedalling, they say, you will fall over. This in turn raises the question of whether China's leaders are pedalling fast enough to cope with the demands of a restive population at a time of rapid economic and social change. These worries about the unknown - China in its economic reform has entered uncharted waters - are in turn prompting a re-emphasis on political stability, a crackdown on dissent such as the recent arrest of prominent dissident Wei Jingsheng, and restrictions on the media's ability to ventilate conflicting political viewpoints. Since the Communist party's policymaking central committee approved an adventurous package of economic reforms last November, China's leaders, including premier Li Peng, have laid heavy emphasis on the need to maintain stability as the fifth anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen massacre looms. They have sought this while navigating their way through a testing phase involving a painful rationalisation of overmanned and loss-making state enterprises. In this difficult period Beijing is grappling with twin threats: workers laid off from state industries, and a peasantry - surplus rural labour numbers between 100m and 200m - made anxious and angry by a widening gap between rich and poor, country and city. Compared with these challenges, dissident activity, while it might be eye-catching in the west, is hardly the problem that looms largest in Beijing's concerns. Among China's rulers there is always the residual fear that dissidents will make common cause with disaffected elements in the cities and countryside - as the Communist revolutionaries did in the 1920s. Permeating Chinese official concerns at almost all levels at present is also the failing health of senior leader Deng Xiaoping and worries about a potentially difficult transition to a new generation of leaders. Preparation for an uncertain future without Deng is one of the factors prompting the present crackdown on dissent by a nervous leadership. These uncertain times present challenges as well as opportunities for the west in the management of its fractious relationship with a modernising China. The Clinton administration, because of its growing economic and strategic relationship with China, is in a unique position to influence developments, but constructive engagement will not be easy and conflict over human rights issues is certain to persist. The west's patience is certain to be tested not only over human rights but also over problems such as trade liberalisation, copyright infringements and disagreement over arms sales. But for the US, there would seem to be little alternative to seeking a more predictable relationship with China - one that does not become hostage to the annual politicking involved in MFN renewal. While the US is poised to extend China's priviledged trade access to the American market for another year, it will be doing so in the knowledge that Beijing has hardly fulfilled requirements laid down by Mr Clinton for improvements in human rights. China will have won this round but what is important for the west, notably the US, is that it seeks other avenues in future that are not so potentially disruptive to the broader commercial relationship.</p>

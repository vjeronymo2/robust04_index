			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Jockey International, Inc. (``Jockey''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final the agreement's proposed order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jockey is a large, privately owned corporation headquartered in Kenosha, Wisconsin, that uses the mail to sell clothing and other textile products. The complaint alleges that Jockey, in selling textile clothing products through mail order catalogs, did not tell customers whether the products were made in the United States or imported. Further, the complaint alleges that Jockey did not use the generic name ``spandex'' with the trademark ``Lycra'' to describe the type of textile fibers used in goods it sold, but instead only used the trademark ``Lycra.'' The complaint alleges that these actions by Jockey violated the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act (``Textile Act'') and the Commission's implementing rules, and constituted unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts and practices in violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Textile Act and the Commission's rules, among other things, require companies that sell textile products by mail order catalogs or mail order promotional materials, such as coupons, to state clearly and conspicuously whether the textile products are made in the United States, or imported, or both. If fiber content is mentioned or implied in a written advertisement, the Textile Act requires disclosure of the generic name of the fiber. Additionally, if a fiber trademark is used in advertising textile products, the Textile Act requires that the generic name of the fiber appear next to the trademark. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed order requires Jockey, in compliance with the Textile Act and the Commission's rules, to inform its customers whether the textile products it sells by mail are made in the United States, or imported, or both, and to use the generic fiber names of such textile products if it mentions or implies fiber content. Jockey does not admit that it violated the law, but agrees to provide the information in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donald S.

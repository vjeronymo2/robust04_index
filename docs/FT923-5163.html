			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Salomon names general counsel SALOMON, the parent group of Wall Street securities house Salomon Brothers and oil trading and refining firm Phibro Energy, yesterday appointed Mr Robert Mundheim as its new general counsel. He succeeds Mr Robert Denham, who became chairman of Salomon in June. Mr Mundheim, 59, is co-chairman of the New York law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson, and has extensive legal experience in the world of finance and securities markets. During the 1960s he was special counsel to the Securities and Exchange Commission, between 1977 and 1980 he was general counsel to the US Treasury department, and he is currently chairman of the international committee of the National Association of Securities Dealers. The appointment of Mr Mundheim marks the end of a turbulent period for Salomon's legal and compliance department. Last year government regulators discovered that Salomon Brothers' bond trading desk had submitted false bids in US Treasury auctions. The scandal led to the resignation of the then chief counsel, Mr Donald Feuerstein, along with three senior executives.</p>

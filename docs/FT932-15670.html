			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Markets: Tesco lays an egg in the City - The Bottom Line LIKE THE frustrated buyer played by Dudley Moore in its TV advertisements, constantly chasing chickens without ever catching them, Tesco, the supermarket chain, must be wondering just what it has to do to please the City. For most other companies, a 6.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 580.9m during a recession - the figures reported by Tesco this week - would be impressive. Moreover, the operating margin rose from 7.1 to 7.6 per cent, while operating profits were up 14 per cent, reflecting its ever-increasing efficiency. But after nine years of pre-tax profit increases of between 19 and 43 per cent, the latest figure represented a significant slow-down and did little to boost Tesco's shares which are about 60p below the 293p they reached a year ago. Tesco has undergone quite a transformation since the 1970s, when it was a sprawling mass of mainly small shops. In the 1980s, it moved towards value-added retailing from large superstores. Profits leapt from Pounds 176m in 1986 to Pounds 545.5m in 1991, and Tesco was established, together with J Sainsbury and Argyll, owner of Safeway, as one of the UK's most powerful and sophisticated food retailers. Then, last year, things started to go slightly awry. Food retailing shares were hit by the realisation they were not immune from recession. Tesco suffered particularly from rumours that its newly-opened stores were trading below expectations. With store developments costing up to Pounds 35m, and high fixed operating costs, any shortfall in the computer-projected sales volumes can have serious consequences. Tesco strongly denied those rumours again this week. David Reid, finance director, said that its newest stores were exceeding their targets, and many had already reached a creditable Pounds 14.50 of weekly sales per square foot. Most important, Tesco was still making a return on investment of about 19 per cent from new stores. But analysts point out that that compares with the 24 or 25 per cent return achieved by Safeway, whose developments tend to be smaller and cheaper. More recently, the City began to worry about poor sales growth in Tesco's older stores. That was something this week's figures could not hide. Subtract the 7.5 per cent accounted for by new stores, and the 2.4 per cent by food price inflation, from the total sales increase of 9 per cent, and it turns out that 'like-for-like' sales - those at existing stores - fell by 0.9 per cent. That compares with small increases in like-for-like sales at Sainsbury and Safeway. Sir Ian MacLaurin, Tesco chairman, says the poor performance is due to 'trading down' by its customers, who, as mainly younger people in metropolitan areas, have been hit harder by the recession than those of its rivals. The big question is whether they will ever trade back up again. Some analysts fear Tesco customers are the most susceptible to the growing discount sector - cut-price stores such as Kwik Save, Aldi and Netto. That may be why Sir Ian was keen to stress that Tesco would launch tactical price promotions in areas where it competes against discounters, and would continue to offer lesser-known 'tertiary' brands of 70 to 100 of the most popular products at prices that match those of the discounters. Tesco's expansion efforts are no longer going solely into superstores. It is experimenting with a smaller city-centre format, Metro. It has also dipped its toe into the water in Europe, with the Pounds 175m acquisition of Catteau, a 90-store supermarket chain in northern France. But such experiments have been seen by some, perhaps uncharitably, as further evidence that all is not well with Tesco's superstore programme. As Paul Smiddy, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, put it: 'The City will need to see a sustained period of like-for-like sales growth before it alters its view on Tesco.' If a consumer upturn does occur, Tesco should be a recovery stock, but the City prefers Argyll, whose store portfolio and customer base are seen as the safest of the three majors. In spite of its strength, it may be some time before Tesco catches its chickens.</p>

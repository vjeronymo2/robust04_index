			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 13 (XINHUA) -- The Federal Yugoslav  government today decided, for the first time, to restrict the  movements of the UN peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia  as of April 20.    The government said the peacekeeping forces must get visas  before entering and staying in the Federal Yugoslavia and their  vehicles must get approval before driving into the republic.    The Yugoslav government, which met today to discuss the  question of cooperation with the UN peacekeeping forces,  denounced them for calling in NATO war planes to launch air  strikes against Bosnian Serb positions.    The government said that the UN peacekeeping forces ignored  the Muslim forces' attempt to make use of the UN-designated  "safe area" of Gorazde to attack the Serb positions.    It accused the UN peacekeeping forces of siding with the  Muslims and being completely involved in the Bosnia civil war.    The government stressed that the UN and NATO actions will  directly threaten the Bosnian peace process and could lead to  escalation of the war.</p>

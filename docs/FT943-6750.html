			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Police chief quits in law enforcement shake-up Mr Vincenzo Parisi yesterday stepped down as Italy's chief of police as part of a wide-ranging reshuffle of the country's top law enforcement posts, writes Andrew Hill in Milan. Mr Parisi, a former head of the Sisde secret services, was replaced by Rome's police commissioner, Mr Ferdinando Masone, who will be supported by three new deputy police chiefs. Announcing the changes, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, and Mr Roberto Maroni, the interior minister, praised Mr Parisi's contribution to the service. Mr Maroni added that, by beefing up the police hierarchy, the five-month-old coalition government was showing its determination to continue the fight against organised crime in Italy. In a letter to the Italian head of state, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Mr Parisi explained that he had decided to bring forward his retirement, due next year, because the 'difficult problems to be tackled in the near future required a strong presence'. Mr Parisi, 63, was appointed police chief in 1984 by Mr Scalfaro, who was then the interior minister. In the last year, both he and Mr Scalfaro had been accused by discredited former chiefs of Sisde of having received covert funds from the secret services - claims that they have both firmly rejected.</p>

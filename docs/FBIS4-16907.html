			<p>BFN     [Text] On Monday, 18 April, Supreme Council Chairman Ivan  Plyushch met in Kiev with U.S. ambassador to Ukraine William  Miller at the latter's request, the Supreme Council press center  reported. The Ukrainian parliament speaker informed Mr. Miller  about the parliamentary elections' outcome and returns. As Mr.  Plyushch stated, the 338 newly elected MP's have thus secured  the parliament's constitutional majority necessary for its legal  functioning. Repeated voting will soon be held in those  electoral districts where no deputies were elected as a result  of the [word indistinct] elections.    As Mr. Plyushch noted, the new parliament reflects the worst  political forces in Ukraine, but yet there is a hope that in the  final analysis their actions will not be ruinous to Ukraine's  sovereign statehood and that their concerted efforts will  promote democratic political and radical economic reforms in  Ukraine. To make out his case the Ukrainian Supreme Council  chairman referred to his meetings and talks with the freshly  elected leftists, communists included, who reiterated their  commitment to construction of a really independent, democratic  and prosperous Ukraine. During the meeting issues of  U.S.-Ukrainian relations as well as some international problems  were touched upon. The two officials were unanimous in  expressing the dire necessity to promote global and regional  peace, extinguish armed conflict, and preserve intact European  borders. The Supreme Council chairman thanked the U.S.  ambassador for his concern over U.S.-Ukrainian economic  relations, for helping alleviate the aftermath of Chernobyl, and  U.S. humanitarian aid to Ukraine.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Calm in the storm It looks as though calm has returned to the equity market. The FT-SE 100 has proved reluctant to fall much below 3,100 and, despite the alarm that followed Good Friday's US employment data, it actually managed a 34-point gain in a shortened Easter week. A boost has come from hints that the Federal Reserve may be reluctant to push up US interest rates again while financial markets are nervous. With the gilt/equity yield ratio again well over two, equities have a comfortable relationship to conventional gilts. The differential with index-linked gilts remains narrow at a quarter point, but strong real dividend growth could eventually help on that score. A certain fragility remains, just the same. Even if the Fed has become more cautious, it would be foolish to presume that the rate rises will stop at a mere half point. With long-term rates of over 7 per cent, the Federal Funds rate could in theory move to 5 per cent without upsetting the bond market again. The optimists must hope this point sinks in so that by the time rates do rise again equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic are clearly focused on a relatively positive earnings story. The trouble is that scares on interest rates could return at any time. There will be plenty of opportunity next week when a raft of data on US inflation and industrial output is due. Moreover the bulk of the selling so far has come from leveraged speculative investors. Mutual fund investors which pumped so much liquidity into world markets last year are slower to react to higher rates. There could still be storms ahead.</p>

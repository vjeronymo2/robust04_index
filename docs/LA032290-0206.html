			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS;  </P> <P> ONLY ARMAS' ABSENCE PREVENTS FULL HOUSE AT TRAINING CAMP  </P> <P> Five of the six players who missed Tuesday's opening workout reported to Mesa  Wednesday, leaving only non-roster player Tony Armas still out of camp.  </P> <P> Angel officials said they had not heard from Armas, who spends the off-season  in Venezuela, but assumed that he was having travel problems.  </P> <P> Johnny Ray, Claudell Washington, Chuck Finley, Brian Downing and Chili Davis,  who were absent Tuesday, worked out with their teammates Wednesday. Finley said  he was spending the holiday in New Orleans and didn't discover the lockout had  ended until late Monday.  </P> <P> Holiday?  </P> <P> "It was St. Patrick's Day," he said. "So I didn't find out until late and then  I didn't know they were working out (Tuesday.)"  </P> <P> To make the most of their shortened spring training, the Angels have added two  split-squad games and one B-squad game to their schedule, and might add another  B-squad game in Palm Springs.  </P> <P> That will give them 14 exhibition games, still well short of the usual spring  quotient. Their pre-lockout plan included 14 games in Arizona, 12 in Palm  Springs and the three-game Freeway Series against the Dodgers.  </P> <P> Under the re-revised schedule, the Angels will play split-squad games on March  30 against the Chicago Cubs in Mesa and the Giants in Scottsdale, Ariz., and on  March 31 against the Cleveland Indians in Tucson and the Athletics in Phoenix.  </P> <P> A B-squad game has been added on March 27, when the Angels will be in Yuma to  play the Padres, and another B-squad game is tentatively planned for April 3 in  Palm Springs against the Padres' B-squad team.  </P> <P> Although Kirk McCaskill can pad his victory total in the first three weeks of  the season, when starting pitchers need to pitch three innings to earn a  victory instead of the normal five, right-hander objected to the rule change.  </P> <P> "I don't think it should have been done," said McCaskill, who had six complete  games last season and pitched into the seventh or later 21 times. "It means you  can't compare stats from this season to other seasons. And reality says that if  you're breezing in the third, they're going to leave you in for the fourth and  fifth.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's going to change my role. I'm not going to be looking to the  bullpen in the fourth inning -- unless I'm really struggling."  </P> <P> Another lockout-related change got a "no" vote from Angel Manager Doug Rader.  Rather than make up the first week's canceled games as doubleheaders later in  the season or by adding a week of play in October, Rader would leave the  schedule as it is.  </P> <P> "I personally think a shortened season would be appropriate," he said.  "Doubleheaders at the end of the season are potentially very dangerous (because  of fatigue) . . . And postseason play drags on so long after the season, I'd  hate to see it go even longer."  </P> <P> Mike Smithson, who pitched for Rader in Texas in 1983, said Rader has mellowed  out since they last teamed up. "He's changed for the better," Smithson said,  recalling Rader's once-notorious escapades.  </P> <P> Rader, who prefers to forget his bad old days, didn't smile at Smithson's  remark.  </P> <P> "Good," Rader said. "I hope he has (changed), too."  </P> <P> The aches and pains that plague players during the season are forgotten over  the long winter, but with spring training comes spring straining.  </P> <P> It took only two workouts for first baseman Wally Joyner to realize that the  season has started again.  </P> <P> "I'm a little tired and tight," he said. "You kind of forget the soreness  coming into spring training. But you get a quick reminder."  </P> <P> Reliever Bob McClure says he hasn't been hurt by the lockout.  </P> <P> "It's different for relievers. I'm ready," he said. "I'm not saying I'll get  anybody out, but I'm ready."  </P></p>

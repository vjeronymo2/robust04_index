			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MALTA SUMMIT;  </P> <P> BUSH'S VOYAGE: THE PRESIDENCY STRANDED AT SEA  </P> <P> In the end, it was a pier-side summit. Only George Bush went to sea, and at the  height of a fierce gale on a cold and Gothic night, the President of the United  States became the sea's prisoner.  </P> <P> From around 6 p.m. Saturday until well after dawn Sunday, Bush and his queasy  brain trust were as helplessly stranded aboard the U.S. cruiser Belknap as  marooned sailors on a desert island. There was literally no place they could  go, accounts of one of the most extraordinary nights in the history of the  modern presidency made plain Sunday.  </P> <P> Bush made light of the experience Sunday, and the White House version of it  read like an updated "Captains Courageous," but neither account obscured the  concern of American officials alarmed by the sea's captivity of their commander  in chief.  </P> <P> At one point, it was decided to move the presidential party to a hotel on  Malta. Guests were rousted from their rooms to make way, but by then it was too  late.  </P> <P> "I don't think anyone can say that the saltwater get-together was anything  other than an adventure, at least not in the harbor here," Bush said Sunday.  </P> <P> Said Mikhail S. Gorbachev after Sunday's summit schedule was modified yet again  by a savage storm from the northeast: "This shows we can adjust to changing  circumstances very well."  </P> <P> The issue was not Bush's safety aboard the big cruiser anchored in Marsaxlokk  Bay on Malta's south coast, planners said Sunday after Air Force One had left  for Brussels, but rather his inability to move if there was need to.  </P> <P> At the height of the gale Saturday night, with winds gusting above 45 m.p.h. in  rough seas, planners had run out of contingencies, they conceded Sunday.  </P> <P> The presidential party could see land on three sides from the pitching cruiser.  They could talk instantly to the ends of the Earth. There was ample backup for  a ship-to-shore telephone cable snapped by the storm. But there was no way  anybody could leave the Belknap, and no place the ship could easily go.  </P> <P> "The President had his doctor aboard, and the ship's medical facilities are  good, but in the case of really serious trauma, I don't know what we'd have  done," said one planner.  </P> <P> With winds far too high for safe helicopter operations, the best of bad options  for getting the President off the ship would have been for the Belknap to sail  around Malta and attempt to enter Grand Harbor on its north side, one planner  said. That would have required sailing into the teeth of the gale and counting  on the skill of a Maltese harbor pilot in a nasty following sea.  </P> <P> Capt. John F. Sigler, skipper of the Belknap, described Saturday's gale as the  worst in-port storm he had seen in 24 years.  </P> <P> On the summit's opening day Saturday, after sleeping aboard the Belknap, Bush  was to have begun talks with Gorbachev on the Soviet cruiser Slava, anchored  about 400 yards away. Gorbachev never went to his cruiser at all, remaining  snug on the docked cruise ship Maxim Gorky.  </P> <P> With seas too rough for him to safely board the Slava, Bush went by admiral's  barge to the Gorky around 10 a.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> As the two leaders talked for five hours, the storm worsened. By one account,  the U.S. Navy advised Bush not to return to the Belknap in rising seas. He  decided to go.  </P> <P> The accommodation ladder on the Belknap's lee side broke on the barge's first  attempt to board the President. On the second pass at the ladder, he boarded  safely.  </P> <P> When an American official told Gorbachev of the broken ladder, he replied with  some asperity: "Better teach your Navy how to repair." By then, the original  schedule had been modified to a second round of talks on the Gorky, followed by  dinner there rather than on the American cruiser.  </P> <P> The sea kept rising. The Navy decided to swap the admiral's barge for a Maltese  tugboat for the return to the Gorky. A longstanding contingency plan went into  operation: Nobody wanted to risk a late-night return to the Belknap.  </P> <P> Under the plan, after dinner Bush and his party would ride -- by limousine --  from the Soviet liner to the Holiday Inn on the north side of the island.  </P> <P> Frenzy descended on the third floor of the hotel in a cloud of vacuum cleaners.  While battalions of housekeepers attacked the third floor, official American  guests, who had been earlier warned that it might happen, were doubled up in  other rooms.  </P> <P> No, said the sea.  </P> <P> At 6:45 p.m. Saturday, American officials said, Gorbachev was pacing the Gorky,  impatiently awaiting Bush's return.  </P> <P> The President wanted to go, but he couldn't.  </P> <P> The White House waited until the last minute, then canceled: no talks, no  dinner.  </P> <P> By 7:30 p.m. Saturday, the President and his retinue, including a seasick  secretary of state, were settling in for a long night as sea-enforced guests of  the Belknap.  </P> <P> Ashore, Administration officials fretted.  </P> <P> Aboard, by official accounts, former naval officer Bush was enjoying himself.  Sliding plates made a presidential dinner with his staff "a little shaky,"  Bush's spokesman said Sunday, but afterward the President wandered fore and aft  speaking with the Belknap's captain and crew about handling a ship in storm  conditions.  </P> <P> "The President is in excellent spirits. He loves the sea," a White House  communique said Sunday morning. "The President seemed energized by the  intensity of the storm."  </P> <P> He was the only one.  </P> <P> The wind fell Sunday, and seas moderated, but Marsaxlokk Bay was still no place  for a landlubber. Bush decided to attend church services aboard the Belknap  instead of on the island.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, the schedule said, would come to the American cruiser for Sunday's  talks. He didn't even try. Bush offered to make a courtesy call on the Slava.  The Soviets said no.  </P> <P> An American planner said that Gorbachev, a son of the soil, refused to leave  the rock-steady, firmly moored Gorky to go to any location on water, on advice  from an admiral on the Slava, who told him it was unsafe to try.  </P> <P> "The Soviet delegation notified us this morning that they were unwilling to  attempt to go to the Slava or to Belknap. Therefore we have agreed to continue  the meetings on the Gorky," said an American communique, finally and officially  taking the sea out of a seaborne summit that never was.  </P> <P> When someone asked him why Gorbachev hadn't gone to the Belknap, White House  spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, a Kansan survivor of a stormy night in Malta, never  missed a beat: "He doesn't share our love for the sea."  </P></p>

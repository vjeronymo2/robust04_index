			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Greencore advances 13% to IPounds 16.2m GREENCORE, the Irish sugar and food group privatised in April last year, reported a 13 per cent increase, from IPounds 14.4m to IPounds 16.2m (Pounds 14.8m), in pre-tax profits for the half-year to March 27. Turnover advanced 11 per cent to IPounds 189.3m (Pounds 171.3m), largely reflecting an initial contribution from Food Industries, the grain trading and malting business bought for IPounds 58.5m last November from the Goodman group. The result was achieved despite increased interest charges of IPounds 4.74m (IPounds 2.91m) resulting from the purchase. Sugar sales of IPounds 59.6m were down by 7 per cent, largely due to lower C quota exports this year - non-subsidised exports outside of the EC and sold at near-cost. Sugar operating profits advanced by 24 per cent to IPounds 11.9m. However, Mr Kevin O'Sullivan, chief financial officer, said higher C quota sales later this year would result in lower profits growth in the second half. Agribusiness provided the largest contribution to turnover with IPounds 71.7m (IPounds 60.3m) but operating profits in the generally difficult climate were IPounds 5.56m (IPounds 4.61m). Food division operating profits were IPounds 3.43m (IPounds 3.07m) on turnover of IPounds 58.1m (IPounds 47.1m). Mr O'Sullivan said 'there is a strong underlying profit improvement due to greater efficiency and new investment'. Over the past few years IPounds 20m has been invested each year in new plant and equipment. A further IPounds 20m will be invested in the current year, half of it in the sugar sector. 'This will be the last year at these levels as most of the investment programme in sugar production will have then been completed. It is a very cash generative sector so we expect improved profits performance as a result', he said. Sugar contributed 31 per cent of group turnover and 57 per cent of operating profits. A new payment formula with beet growers was worked out earlier this year, but is not reflected in the first half figures. Mr O'Sullivan said that it may result in additional revenue of between IPounds 1m and IPounds 1.5m for growers during the next harvest. Greencore was in the market for a large acquisition 'in the UK or Europe' in its core businesses of bulk food processing of sugar, malt or flour, Mr O'Sullivan said. Earnings per share dipped to 16p (17.3p) as a result of dilution in the flotation. As forecast, the interim dividend is 3p.</p>

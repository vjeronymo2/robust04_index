			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: On the right track WHAT ARE private investors to make of the Financial Times' new 'total return' indices? The indices, which appear daily, have been designed largely with professional investors in mind. Professional managers who provide index-tracking services - that is, portfolios designed to mirror returns from an index such as the FT-A All Share - need to know exactly how that index is to be measured. The two independent performance measurement services have used slightly different methods of calculating the FT-A. Thus, depending on which service is used, pension fund trustees may come to believe their manager is not coming up to scratch. But while the new indices offer greater clarity for professionals, they may muddy the waters for private investors. Those who own index-tracking unit trusts are likely to find even greater deviations from the index than previously. Barry Holman, director of index-tracking funds at insurer Legal and General, says distortions are likely to occur in several areas. First, the total return index uses stock prices at the close of business, whereas most unit trusts use midday prices. Also the new computation assumes re-investment gross of tax on the dividend payment date, regardless of when funds are actually received. While pension funds may mitigate against slow payments, many unit trusts are constrained from doing so. Also, pension funds are tax-exempt so it is sensible to calculate returns without deducting tax. Unit trust holders, however, enjoy no such exemption. Holman says, though, that he does not expect significant confusion among individuals who own index tracking unit trusts. 'People who buy these things tend to be pretty sophisticated,' he added.</p>

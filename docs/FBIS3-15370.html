The most prominent are the efforts of Russia, which  representative V. Kazimirov recently visited Stepanakert,  Yerevan and Baku, and presented the new Russian initiative to  the sides. What are the peculiarities of this project? Which  topics of the initiative are particularly acceptable for the RMK  [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh]? Are there topics which  raise worries and may cause trouble in the future?    [Gukasyan] This is a very broad question which is rather  difficult to answer at once. We can't state that there are too  great differences between the initiatives of the CSCE and  Russia. The most important difference for us is in the security  mechanism presented in the Russian version. The unacceptable to  us topics are those concerning Lachin and Shusha. Azerbaijan  and Armenia didn't have the chance of working over the project.  Such a meeting will be carried out in Moscow, but only after  Kazimirov meets all the parties. We will meet in Moscow and  will then start working on the text.    We are going to present our remarks and disagreements to V.  Kazimirov before this meeting. Since Azerbaijan had more  remarks (Azerbaijan wasn't prepared to this project and they in  fact refused it), Russia suggested to stop the military  operations for 2 weeks to work out the text of the agreement.  Nevertheless, Azerbaijan refused this proposal too.    [Correspondent] Such a categorical position of Azerbaijan  lets us suppose that we shouldn't expect too many changes and  this may be a dead end.    [Gukasyan] No, I wouldn't say so. Azerbaijan only hoped to  achieve military success during these two months, and this would  have created favorable conditions for them during the  negotiations. But Azerbaijan was unable to reach this goal and  is now trying to save time again. If the Azeri leaders accept  the Russian initiative and agree to cease the fire, they must  account to their people since they lost some 7-8 thousand  fighters during these two months with no results. It seems to  me, this is a military measure. But if Azerbaijan was  successful, nothing could stop them anymore.    [Correspondent] Maybe such a position of Azerbaijan could be  explained by certain guarantees they receive from several  countries? Do you think to be a mere chance that mercenaries  from a number of countries are serving in the Azeri Army, the  army is armed by Turkish and Chinese weapons? Several reports  appeared in British press regarding military support to  Azerbaijan. Participation of Afghan mojahedins is well  documented. This means internationalization of the problem.    [Gukasyan] Surely, participation of other countries is not a  secret, and we have facts. Regarding the internationalization  of the conflict--to say frankly, I doubt if Azerbaijan is  currently interested in this, but a moment will come when they  will take this step. We are fighting against a coalition today.  Turks, Afghans, Russians, Ukrainians etc. are fighting in the  Azeri Army.    [Correspondent] Do you think, that in the conditions when  the  Azeri attacks failed in fact, the cease fire is appropriate for  us? Are there mechanisms which will disallow Azerbaijan to use  this cease fire for preparing a new even more powerful attack?    [Gukasyan] There are no and there could be no 100 percent  guarantees. We are always worried by this. We support the  peace course but we worry for Azerbaijan may be using the cease  fire for war preparations indeed. Nobody is giving any  guarantees to us. Everybody understands, there is a risk  factor. Unfortunately there are no such guarantee mechanisms.  The best mechanism would be to recognize the independence of  the RMK, and we would become a subject of the international law.  This is not quite possible today. The other possibility is:  the peace keeping forces of the United Nations or Russia could  serve as such a mechanism. But this is dangerous too. We have  seen the Safonov's [military commandant in Karabakh in early  1990] regime. On the other hand, we should not allow this war  to last, not to turn into a war of resources.    [Correspondent] What about the position of the RA President,  according to which the only acceptable version of the conflict's  peaceful regulation is an immediate stop of military operations  without verification of the RMK status, followed by long-lasting  negotiations which may last for decades, probably? To what  extent does this concern the interests and the external policy  of the RMK?    [Gukasyan] There are different approaches to this freezing  of  military operations. In our opinion, it would be more correct  if the military operations were frozen at the current  conditions. This means freezing the military operations without  any preconditions. Freezing followed by negotiations--even maybe  long-lasting ones. This will be very difficult to implement  though, since all the mediators are suggesting the condition of  withdrawing the troops from all the territories as the next  step. This is a very dangerous precondition for us, since we  can't see the perspective. Say, we withdrew the forces, and  what then?    [Correspondent] Can we possibly use the version "territories  against the peace and status", which was widely used in the  world history?    [Gukasyan] We have been always suggesting this version. This  is our main demand. But the world doesn't accept this. They  say "we can understand when you say `peace against territories',  but we can't understand when you demand the status". We tried  to explain that we also mean the status when talking peace,  since there will be no peace otherwise. In other words, what  peace can we expect if there are no other guarantees? We have  always stressed, that our goal is not the temporary fire  cessation. We need guarantees for this to result in a lasting  peace. It's not too easy to talk on this now, as Azerbaijan  talks not only about the Fizuli but also Shusha and Lachin as  well. This is not acceptable for us. Remarkably, Azeri demands  rise when they hope to break our defense by means of force.    [Correspondent] You represented the RMK in almost all  official and unofficial meetings concerning the Artsakh problem.  In your personal opinion, do you think there is a shift in the  understanding of the problem by international community and the  mediators?    [Gukasyan] Surely, there are changes. We are working within  the CSCE framework for more than a year and a half. And many  things changed during this period. Everybody is admitting  Karabakh as a conflicting side now. We were considered just as  the representatives of an organization at the beginning, but now  we are considered quite seriously and no proposals are made  without consulting with us.    [Correspondent] Can we state that the representatives of RMK  are no more considered as the representatives of the Armenian  community of Mountainous Karabakh in international organizations?    [Gukasyan] Yes, of course. Everybody understands this way,  and we are admitted as the leaders of Mountainous Karabakh, in  spite of Turkish and Azeri struggle against this notion.    [Correspondent] Do you think, that recognition of the RMK by  Armenia now or at an earlier stage could support the  international recognition of the RMK independence?    [Gukasyan] This is hard to tell. Armenia will recognize  the RMK soon or late. May be it's not the proper moment now. I  don't believe that recognition of the RMK by Armenia now will  immediately bring political dividends, or something will change  today resulting from that. This might even make the situation  worse. I am not sure.    [Correspondent] The world politics seems to be searching for  common edges in Karabakh, Abkhazian and Bosnian conflicts. The  world seemingly tends to be looking for a universal solution.  In your opinion, in what extent are these conflicts similar?    [Gukasyan] They are similar and they are not at the same  time. I don't think a universal solution may be found for these.  A universal approach is possible though these are quite  different problems. We should find a model for resolving these  problems...    [Correspondent] One of the discussed suggestions is the  model  of a confederative state. This model is based on mutual  concessions and satisfies the right for independence and  inviolability of borders both. In this regard, is the  RMK-Azerbaijan confederation acceptable for the RMK? Does this  meet the interests of Artsakh?    [Gukasyan] It's too early to talk on this now. I don't  believe if there could be found a single Karabakh citizen, who  would agree for Karabakh to remain within Azerbaijan by any  means. But it seems to me, if serious work starts in this  direction, we'll participate in it. Only cultural independence  is meant now. If confederative problems start being discussed,  we may start working on such a project. But Azerbaijan is not  willing to talk even on creating a federation, and the world  (the CSCE or Russia) is not ready to talk even on Azeri  federation. They talk on confederation in Bosnia, on federation  in Georgia but nothing is said regarding the Karabakh problem.    [Correspondent] Is there any increased activity after the  new  CSCE Chairman was assigned?    [Gukasyan] Yes, in some sense. The style of their search for  a solution of the conflict has changed at least. The CSCE  course in fact didn't advance at all in 2 years. They now  decided, as far as I understand, to carry out the works in  Karabakh, Armenia and Azerbaijan instead of working in Rome,  Paris, Vienna and other European cities as formerly.    [Correspondent] What about the placement of the CSCE  observers at the RMK-Azeri and Armenian-Azeri borders? Can this  be the guarantee for a stable fire cessation?    [Gukasyan] I don't believe that the observers may guarantee  the cease fire without the peace-keeping forces. But the  presence of the observers is very important. This is a part of  the guarantees, but the observers should not be from Turkey.  They must be from a neutral country. The Russian troops can  play role of peace-keeping forces.</p>

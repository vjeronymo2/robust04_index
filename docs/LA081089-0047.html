			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> SOME WON'T BE GETTING MUCH WORK SUNDAY  </P> <P> While Coach Dan Henning has yet to reveal the answer to the big question  involving the Chargers' first exhibition game -- Who will start at quarterback?  -- he did answer some smaller ones Wednesday at UC San Diego.  </P> <P> Henning said he planned to play only about 48 of the 80 Chargers under contract  in Sunday's noon game against Dallas at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> "You can't play with 80 guys, or it would be a mess," Henning said. "They won't  get anything out of it. Rather than give bits and pieces, we're going to give  extensive time to certain people."  </P> <P> Henning also said he planned to use no more than five of the seven running  backs who are in camp and that he planned to separate them depending on the  situation. He said he likely would use two or three of the backs on first down,  two others on third down and have two sets of backs for short-yardage and goal  line situations.  </P> <P> Henning said he would not decide on which backs he will use in which situations  until Thursday night.  </P> <P> But he did rule three players out of the game because of injuries -- center Don  Macek (ankle sprain), inside linebacker Gary Plummer (sore leg) and running  back Timmy Smith (ankle sprain).  </P> <P> Dennis McKnight, who was moved to center from guard in mini-camp in the May,  likely will start in place of Macek. His backup, rookie Courtney Hall, is  recovering from an ankle sprain, so guard Dan Rosado could also play there.  </P> <P> Cedric Figaro, who started the final five games as a rookie last season after  recovering from a back injury, should start in Plummer's place.  </P> <P> As for his choice of quarterbacks, Henning has said he will reserve that  decision until Thursday night or Friday.  </P> <P> The choices are David Archer, the free agent who started for Henning with the  Atlanta Falcons in 1985 and 1986; incumbent Mark Malone, who started eight  games last year, and rookie Billy Joe Tolliver, the second-round draft pick  from Texas Tech.  </P> <P> Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson also is undecided about which quarterback he will  start against the Chargers.  </P> <P> "We haven't structured anything as of yet," Johnson said in a conference call  from the Dallas training camp in Thousand Oaks. "All three will play. We really  won't identify who start at quarterback until right at game time.  </P> <P> Johnson's choices are a little more high-profile than the Chargers': Troy  Aikman, the former UCLA star and first player selected in the draft; Steve  Walsh, Johnson's quarterback at the University of Miami for the past two season  and the first player taken in the supplemental draft last month, and Babe  Laufenberg, the fourth-year journeyman who started the Chargers' 1988  regular-season opener.  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Dana Brinson, eighth-round draft choice from Nebraska, sustained a hip pointer  in the morning practice and did not participate in the afternoon workout. Coach  Dan Henning said he did know when Brinson would return. Brinson, who was  drafted as a wide receiver, is being looked at as a running back in third-down  situations, Henning said. . . . Steve Ortmayer, Charger director of football  operations, said he has talked in the past two days with representatives of the  team's three holdouts -- rookie defensive end Burt Grossman and veterans Gary  Anderson and Joe Phillips. Grossman, the first-round draft choice from Pitt,  said he has been playing a lot of golf around Pittsburgh and looking forward to  watching the Chargers' nationally televised exhibition with Dallas Sunday. "I'd  prefer to be there," Grossman said. "But don't hold your breath." . . . At  least a half-dozen players and Chet Franklin, the director of player personnel,  left after the morning practice to attend memorial services in Los Angeles for  Stacey Toran, the Raider safety killed in an automobile accident Saturday  night. Most of the players were former teammates of Toran's with the Raiders.  Franklin is a former Raider defensive backfield coach. They returned in time  for the afternoon workout.  </P></p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Gore to hunt down waste and fraud in government agencies VICE-PRESIDENT Al Gore is to take charge of a six-month review of every government agency to find ways of cutting waste and fraud. He promised 'significant savings' from the review, which he said would start 'a revolution in government right here and now'. President Bill Clinton, announcing the review, said elimination of waste would be 'a breath of fresh air for American taxpayers', who would be treated in future as customers by government agencies. Bureaucratic waste has been a favourite target for US political candidates, and Mr Clinton promised in his campaign last year to cut 100,000 unnecessary federal government jobs and to achieve 3 per cent administrative savings in every government agency. The Gore audit is modelled on a state government performance review carried out in Texas in 1991. That came up with 975 suggestions on ways to save up to Dollars 4.2bn from a state budget of around Dollars 30bn. The state legislature adopted Dollars 2.4bn of these savings, helping to fill a budget deficit and avert the introduction of a state income tax for the first time in Texan history. Some of the suggested cuts, however, aimed at programmes that were not necessarily unadulterated waste. One idea was to double the cost of tuition at state colleges. Like the Texas review, the Gore audit will set up a toll-free telephone number to gather suggestions from the public. It will provide an important task for Mr Gore, who has taken the lead in discussions of the administration's environmental and technology policies but who, like many vice-presidents before him, runs the risk of appearing under-employed.</p>

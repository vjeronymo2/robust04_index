On 7  October 1993, the first meeting was held, with attendees  representing various research institutes under the jurisdiction  of AIST and administrative personnel from MITI and AIST. At this  meeting, university researchers gave lectures on liquid  crystalline molecular building blocks and the science of  super-molecules, which were followed by discussion. With an eye  to ferreting out futuristic research ideas and seeking project  topics, the Forum plans to hold roughly four meetings by the  spring of 1994.    AIST says its previous projects concerning material  development primarily pursued improvement of performances and  functions of existing materials, i.e., they were not meant to  develop new materials in a true sense. Therefore, AIST  established the New Material Research Forum for the purpose of  discovering technical seeds that will eventually lead to the  creation of new materials, such as nylon, which began the  historical material revolution.    The Forum is organized with members from MITI and related  institutions, although the policy is to maintain a flexible  membership structure, since research targets could be  wide-ranging; i.e., the best qualified researcher for a given  topic will be asked to join the Forum, regardless of affiliation.    The first meeting was attended by 11 researchers from the  National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research (NIMC) and  the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, in addition to  administrative personnel from MITI and AIST. Assistant Professor  Takashi Kato of the Production Technology Research Institute of  Tokyo University and Assistant Professor Akihiko Ueno of the  Tokyo Institute of Technology lectured on ``liquid crystalline  molecular building blocks'' and ``the science of  super-molecules,'' respectively, and research activities and  trends under these topics were discussed after the lectures.</p>

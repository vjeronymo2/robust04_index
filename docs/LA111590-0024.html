			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DIFFERENT DAY, DIFFERENT BIRD FOR THE CELTICS  </P> <P> Most players and teams dislike playing on successive nights in different  cities. In fact, Cleveland protested about playing back-to-back 26 times this  season.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers were sent a revised schedule, and now they play 27 times on  consecutive nights.  </P> <P> But Boston's Larry Bird was grateful for the chance to play the night after one  of the worst games of his career.  </P> <P> Bird, who scored only five points in 28 minutes when the Boston Celtics were  overwhelmed in Milwaukee Tuesday night, made amends in spectacular fashion  Wednesday night at Boston.  </P> <P> Bird scored 45 points in 44 minutes to lead the Celtics to a 135-126 victory  over the Charlotte Hornets. Bird, who was 18 for 28, also had eight assists,  eight rebounds and blocked five shots.  </P> <P> Bird may have relished back-to-back games, but the Hornets didn't. They didn't  really have time to enjoy Tuesday's romp over Washington.  </P> <P> Bird didn't seem to impress himself. "I took a lot of shots and that's why I  got a lot of points," he explained. "I haven't been taking many shots  recently."  </P> <P> He shot only seven times in his five-point effort against Milwaukee.  </P> <P> Coach Chris Ford was unhappy with the Celtic defense. "Fortunately," he said,  "Larry brought us through."  </P> <P> New Jersey 112, Milwaukee 95 -- The Bucks didn't think much of back-to-back  games, either. They were flat in East Rutherford, N.J., after having trounced  the Celtics.  </P> <P> Derrick Coleman, No. 1 pick in the draft last summer, sparked the Nets to an  impressive victory.  </P> <P> Coleman scored four of his 20 points in a 6-0 run that gave the Nets the lead  for good late in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Cleveland 113, Indiana 95 -- The Cavaliers, who will play 16 of their first 18  games in back-to-back sets, are adjusting to the difficulty.  </P> <P> With Danny Ferry scoring two quick baskets and setting up another to trigger a  24-5 run in the second quarter, the Cavaliers won their third in a row.  </P> <P> It has been mostly downhill for the Cavaliers after opening the season at  Boston and playing at Detroit the next night.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 112, Atlanta 104 -- After getting 23 points and 13 rebounds in a  victory at Indiana on Tuesday, Charles Barkley was even better at home.  </P> <P> Barkley scored 34 points and grabbed 13 rebounds to lead the 76ers to their  second victory in a row.  </P> <P> Miami 105, Dallas 93 -- Rony Seikaly carried the Heat to victory at Miami with  30 points and 21 rebounds. It was the Heat's first victory over the Mavericks.  DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

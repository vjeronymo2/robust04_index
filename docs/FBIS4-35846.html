			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said  she is disappointed to learn that the leader of the opposition  is unable to accept her invitation for June 5 to take him into  confidence about the current economic situation and the measures  needed to give economic stability to the country. In a letter  to Mr. Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister said she had made the  invitation in good faith and in the greater national interests.  In her letter, she said a democratic government always works  within constitutional framework. The last elections were the  fairest since 1977 and its verdict has been acceptable to all.  As regards your concerns about the NWFP [North-West Frontier  Province] assembly and other matters, she hoped you will seek  relief through the courts of law or other constitutional  mechanism available. It would be best for both of us to accept  constitutional realities which cannot be subjected to political  pressures. In view of your inability, I have directed the  minister for finance to hold a meeting with your representative  tomorrow at 0500 at the Q Block for this purpose.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Jobseeker's Allowance prompts Labour attack The government yesterday unveiled details of its Jobseeker's Allowance, describing it as 'a major step forward in the reform of the benefit system and in the help given to the jobless'. Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, said the government estimated the scheme would mean a Pounds 100m net cut in its spending on unemployment in 1996-97, the first year, and would then save Pounds 200m every following year. But he was unable to say what impact the allowance would have in reducing the number of registered unemployed. Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, said an estimated 150,000 unemployed people a year should benefit from the introduction of the back-to-work bonus, an accumulated credit of up to Pounds 1,000 for part-time work done while unemployed, paid after moving into full-time employment. He told the Commons the allowance would 'help Britain generate more jobs and give better value for taxpayers' money'. Labour attacked the proposal to impose a cut on those who have paid National Insurance contributions by limiting the period of their entitlement to the new allowance to a maximum of six months. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, stressed that people in this category were now entitled to unemployment benefit for 12 months. He accused the government of seeking to make a unilateral departure from its obligations, and asked: 'What insurance company would get away with an increase in premiums and a reduction in benefit of this kind?' The allowance was also attacked by Mr John Monks, Trades Union Congress general secretary, who said it was 'mean-spirited and irrelevant'.</p>

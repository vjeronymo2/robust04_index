			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Flagship fund steers steady course - Unit Trusts / James Capel Income THE Income fund is the flagship of James Capel's unit trust range. Indeed, it has been one of the top 20 performing unit trusts over the past 10 years. The trust was started in 1975 as a vehicle for private clients whose portfolios were not large enough to be invested directly in equities. It was a fairly small fund until 1988 when James Capel decided to make big efforts to promote its unit trust expertise; since then the Income fund has grown from Pounds 13m to Pounds 230m. The aim of the trust is to have a portfolio which performs roughly in line with the FT All-Share Index but with a higher yield. As the graph shows, the trust has been pretty successful in keeping up with the All-Share. Manager John Knight, who took over full responsibility for the Income fund in 1990, says he follows a yield discipline - if a share rises so that its yield is close to that on the market, it will normally be sold. Maintaining payout levels has been difficult for many income funds during the recession. Capel's interim distribution was cut by 5.4 per cent in 1992 and the final payout also suffered a 0.3 per cent reduction. Knight said the fund has yet to declare an interim distribution for this year, but it will not be higher than last year's. The yield on the fund is currently 3.8 per cent. Knight says four factors have been taking a bite out of the fund's income. The first is dividend cuts by UK companies. A second problem is that the management charge goes up in line with assets, but is taken from the income account. In the stock market's recent rally, share prices have risen while dividends have not. Accordingly the management charge is taking a bigger chunk of the fund's income. Third, lower interest rates have reduced the return on the fund's cash holdings. Finally, there are now fewer partly paid privatisation stocks in the market. These provided a high dividend yield but as they have become fully paid, the yield has inevitably dropped. At the moment, Knight says 58 per cent of the portfolio is in FT-SE 100 stocks, 28 per cent is in the second 100 largest stocks (sometimes known as Tootsie), 13 per cent in other (ie smaller) stocks and 1 per cent in cash. In terms of sectors, Knight says that the fund is overweight in the financials with a holding of 25 per cent, as opposed to market weighting of 16 per cent. 'We like the financials, because we are reasonably positive about the economic cycle,' he says. 'They will benefit from lower interest rates and the falling away of the bad debt problem. Overall, the financial sector has an above average yield and, we believe, better dividend growth potential.' In contrast, the fund is underweight in consumer goods - with a 24 per cent holding as opposed to the market weighting of 33 per cent. 'We tend normally to be underweight in the consumer sector because it is hard to find stocks on a decent yield,' says Knight. The ten largest stocks in the portfolio are: Shell, BAT, BT, British Gas, Hanson, Provident Financial, MAI, Midlands Electricity, Severn Trent Water and Ocean Group. Over the 10 years to August 1, an investment in James Capel's fund would have grown 500 per cent (offer-to-bid with income reinvested, according to Micropal). That record makes it the third best performing fund (out of 52) in the equity income sector. The fund's record also looks good over five years (where it is 5th out of 96) and over three years (26th out of 107). Only over the past year has performance slipped, leaving the fund placed 78th out of 110, with growth of 26.3 per cent. 'Over the past year,' says Knight, 'other funds in the equity income fund have focused on the recovery in the capital goods sector. I'm not running a recovery fund so I should not be buying shares like British Steel which don't pay the right level of dividend.' Knight says he also has a more limited exposure to smaller companies funds (which have performed well in the first half) than some other equity income trusts. He says he is currently pretty bullish about UK equities, although he acknowledges that the forthcoming results season may be 'somewhat difficult'. Non-trading items, such as pension holidays, which have bolstered profits through the recession, may reduce, thereby obscuring the genuine growth in trading profits. But he believes earnings growth next year may be 20 per cent and that is not factored into share prices. Charges. The annual charge is 1.25 per cent and the initial charge is 5.25 per cent. The current bid-offer spread is about 6.3 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 40 per month via the savings scheme. The fund is Pepable at no extra charge, although the minimum monthly investment is higher, at Pounds 100.</p>

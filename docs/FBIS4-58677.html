			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 5 May (MENA) -- A number of former Yemeni  ministers and officials have called on President Muhammad Husni  Mubarak to exert more efforts to save the Yemeni people of the  current infighting.    Addressing their plea also to the leaders of Syria, Saudi  Arabia, Jordan, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as  the Arab League secretary general, the former officials said  that the strife in Yemen is a result of misjudgment,  miscalculation, and ill-advised policies.    'Abdallah al-Asnaj, former Yemeni foreign minister; Qasim  Bin- 'Ali al-Wazir, former member of the Advisory Council; Major  General 'Abdallah Juzaylan, former deputy prime minister; a  former finance minister; a former agriculture minister; and a  member of the Ta'izz Popular Congress, all of whom are currently  in Cairo, signed the plea.    The Yemeni officials pointed out that Yemen is sinking in a  bloodbath and that prudent intervention is needed to contain the  crisis.</p>

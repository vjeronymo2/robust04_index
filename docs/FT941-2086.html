			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Pro-Europe MPs warn of Tory party civil war Leading pro-Europeans on the Conservative back benches warned of the threat of renewed civil war in the party last night after the fierce anti-Brussels outburst in the House of Commons by Mr John Major. Conservative MPs on the party's centre and left have been told not to engage in public debate with rightwing Eurosceptic colleagues as part of an effort to suppress divisions before June's European elections. The instruction - delivered by the Tory whips at Westminster but said to have come from Mr Major - has until now met with grudging acquiescence from members of the party's Positive Europe Group. But the anti-European tone of the prime minister's comments enraged many of the enthusiasts. They warned that if the row with Britain's partners over voting rights in an enlarged Union was used an excuse to appease Tory sceptics, the present truce on the back benches would disintegrate. Ministers said Mr Major's comments were no more than an attempt to persuade Britain's European partners of the seriousness of its resolve not to accept a dilution of the ability of governments to block decisions. Many backbenchers, however, interpreted his characterisation of Labour party leader, Mr John Smith, as a 'poodle' of Brussels as a clear precursor to an overtly nationalistic stance in the run-up to the June elections. There is a strong suspicion Mr Major has decided that appeasing the Euro-sceptic right offers the best chance of heading off a challenge to his leadership later in the year. Members of the Positive Europe group have told party managers they will not accept a 'bashing Brussels' platform in the campaign for the European Parliament. They believe that by bowing to the right of the party the prime minister is underestimating a potentially far more dangerous threat to his leadership from the centre-left. The pro-Europeans fear Mr Major's approach could degenerate into a repeat of the disastrous European campaign of 1989 when the Thatcher government suffered heavy losses. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, has sought to reassure the enthusiasts that Conservatives will not attack EU institutions but focus instead on the dangers of the Socialists securing control of those institutions. A draft manifesto prepared by Mr Hurd has drawn a careful line between emphasising Britain's role in Europe and its ambitions for a more open, decentralised Union.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Indonesian engineering group to go public Bukaka Teknik Utama, an Indonesian engineering company, is to sell 40m shares at Rp3,500 each in an initial public offering (IPO) this month. Bukaka said half the capital raised would finance expansion and the rest to repay debts. To date, 80 per cent of the company's products and services, which include power transmission towers, passenger boarding bridges for airports and coal-handling systems, are sold to Indonesia's public sector. In 1992 Bukaka exported its first passenger boarding bridge and since then it has sold bridges to airports in Japan, Thailand and Singapore. Mr Sadel Muhammad, president and chief executive officer, said that Bukaka would continue to target Asia-Pacific economies and step up exports of oil and gas equipment, transmission towers and bulk-handling systems. Bukaka's net profit last year was Rp9.1bn (Dollars 4.2m) on sales of Rp151bn. This year the company expects a net profit of Rp15.4bn.</p>

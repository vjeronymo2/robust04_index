			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NFL, NETWORKS SAY OUTCRY WON'T HALT SCRAMBLING  </P> <P> Officials for the NFL and the major television networks said Thursday that they  were stunned by the response of sports-bar owners angered over the scrambling  of NFL telecasts.  </P> <P> But league and network officials also said that, despite the national outcry,  scrambling would not be reversed and no option to "de-scramble" would be made  available.  </P> <P> "This story has been picked up all over America, and indeed, the response has  been surprising . . . overwhelming," said Val Pinchbeck, the NFL's vice  president in charge of broadcasting. "But we're not going to change what we  started. We and the networks agreed we would move toward scrambling, and that  we have done."  </P> <P> Pinchbeck said National Football Conference games carried on CBS would be  "fully scrambled" by the start of the season Sept. 9. He said scrambling of NBC  telecasts involving the American Football Conference would be complete "at  least by mid-season."  </P> <P> Unlike Home Box Office, ESPN, TNT and cable outlets offering "de-scrambling"  packages, in which subscribers buy a decoder and also pay a fee, the NFL plans  no such option "at any point in the future," Pinchbeck said, adding that only  local affiliates would have the ability to receive network games.  </P> <P> Sports-bar owners have in the past attracted customers with rooting interests  in NFL teams in other parts of the country by showing games not available  through local affiliates.  </P> <P> In San Diego, Norman Lebovitz, the owner of Sluggo's, a family-oriented  restaurant that prides itself on its Chicago sports theme, said he had been  named chairman of a Southern California organization called the Assn. for  Sports Fans' Rights. The group held its first meeting in Hillcrest Monday  night, and more than 40 people -- including eight lawyers -- attended.  </P> <P> Lebovitz said his group had joined forces with Sports Fans of America, a  Miami-based organization that has waged war in the courtroom over the showing  of Dolphins games "blacked out" in Southern Florida.  </P> <P> "We've heard from organizations in Philadelphia, Phoenix, Los Angeles, New  Orleans, San Francisco . . . These people are outraged," said Lebovitz, who  operates Sluggo's in three San Diego locations and has traditionally drawn  large crowds for telecasts of regional NFL games involving the Bears. "I'm  talking to hundreds who represent thousands. It seems grass-roots America is  taking this as a personal offense."  </P> <P> Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) said he had heard from constituents outraged over  the NFL's decision. As a member of the House Committee of Energy and Commerce,  Bates said he planned to ask the subcommittee on telecommunications to  investigate NFL scrambling and decide whether it was legally appropriate.  </P> <P> "I have real reservations about it," Bates said. "So I'm considering  legislation to prevent the league from doing it. At this point, it depends on  public reaction. If it continues to come down soundly against the NFL, I think  the bill can pass. It seems to me the NFL got hysterical and is going against  the majority and the needs of consumers."  </P> <P> Susan Kerr, a spokeswoman for CBS Sports, said from New York that scrambling  was done at the request of the NFL.  </P> <P> "The NFL asks us to do it, because it protects the interests of the home team,"  Kerr said. "If you're with the Rams organization and somebody in Southern  California has the capability of sitting home or going to a sports bar and  watching multiple games, that threatens attendance of Rams' home games.  Scrambling protects the popularity of local teams."  </P> <P> But Pinchbeck says the opposite, that scrambling was a "condition" spelled out  by the networks in the four-year, $3.6-billion agreement that takes effect this  season.  </P> <P> And Jay Rosenstein, vice president for sports programming at CBS, said that  scrambling had been the "mandate" of local affiliates to the networks since  negotiations for the new agreement began.  </P> <P> "The NFL has its own reasons for wanting to protect its copyright," Rosenstein  said from New York. "We have a number of issues vis a vis the network-affiliate  relationship. When you spend that kind of money ($1.5 billion by CBS alone) to  provide football to local affiliates, you expect the games to be watched. The  opportunity to sell commercials in those games is a way of getting back our  rather substantial investment."  </P> <P> Rooftop "dishes" that pick up signals beamed from satellites receive only  network feeds, and not the broadcasts of local stations. Thus, users of such  technology don't see local and regional commercials. (National, network  commercials are fed via satellite.)  </P> <P> A senior official at NBC, requesting anonymity, said the networks demanded  scrambling because of the threat represented by dish owners and patrons of  sports bars to the Nielsen ratings.  </P> <P> "If every football fan in America went to sports bars to watch the games, there  would be nobody at home watching games," the official said from New York.  "That's what we want, that's what we live by -- people at home watching games.  </P> <P> "Advertisers don't pay the dish owner. They pay the networks and the local  affiliates. If you're not watching at home, you represent an audience that  can't be measured -- by the Nielsen ratings or any other survey I know of."  </P> <P> Lebovitz, the San Diego restaurateur, said attorneys for the Assn. of Sports  Fans' Rights are "exploring the possibility" of obtaining an injunction to  prevent scrambling on Sept. 9. He said that the "1,000 or so" sports bars  across America would "simply go out of business" if scrambling is enforced.  </P> <P> "We believe the NFL is vulnerable in the antitrust area."  </P></p>

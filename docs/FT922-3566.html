			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Economic uncertainty leaves equities lower Wall Street UNCERTAINTY among investors about the economic outlook and concern regarding overvalued equity markets sent share prices into a brief tailspin yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 34.21 at 3,369.92. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 3.30 at 410.06, as did the Amex composite, down 3.37 at 393.06, and the Nasdaq composite, down 8.21 at 573.80. Turnover on the NYSE was 192m shares, and declines outpaced rises by a ratio of more than two to one. The market has moved little in the past three weeks, reflecting confusion among investors about the short-term direction of share prices. Although most recent economic data suggests that the recovery is advancing, albeit very slowly, the pace of economic activity has been insufficient to generate much fresh demand for equities. Barring another interest rate cut, therefore, the market lacks strong fundamental support, and it has become increasingly exposed to sudden sell-offs spread across a range of cyclical and growth stocks. Leading the way lower were classic cyclicals like Interna tional Paper, down Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 64 7/8 , and Aluminum Company of America, down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 77 3/4 . The former was not helped by a downgrade from analysts at the broking house, Salomon Brothers, who cut their earnings estimates for several paper and forest products companies to reflect pressures in the linerboard market. Other stocks to suffer from the Salomon move were Georgia-Pacific, down Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 60 7/8 , Temple Inland, Dollars 1 1/4 lower at Dollars 47 5/8 , and Stone Container, Dollars 1 weaker at Dollars 22 5/8 At the same time, Salomon also downgraded its ratings of several newspaper groups. Knight-Ridder fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 56 1/2 , Washington Post gave up Dollars 3&gt; at Dollars 235 1/2 and Gannett slipped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 44 5/8 . In the same sector, Tribune Co dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 40 5/8 after Smith Barney Harris Upham reduced its 1992 estimate for the company from Dollars 2.05 a share to Dollars 2.25. Among other stocks to post losses were IBM, down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 90 1/2 , Walt Disney, Dollars  1/2 lower at Dollars 36 5/8 , Goodyear, down Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 68 1/2 and Philip Morris, Dollars 2 weaker at Dollars 74 1/8 . Aetna Life bucked the trend, climbing Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 41 1/4 in active trading after the company entered into a pact to sell its American Re unit to a company formed by the reinsurance subsidiary's management and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the buy-out specialists. Super Valu firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 25 1/2 and Wetterau soared Dollars 6 3/8 to Dollars 30 3/8 on the news that the two companies, which are among the biggest food distributors in the US, will merge in a deal said to be worth Dollars 1.1bn. Gencorp rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 14 1/8 after reporting second quarter net income of 43 cents a share, up from 39 cents a share a year ago. On the Nasdaq market, MCI Communications eased Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 32 3/4 as investors continued to digest the implications of the death of Mr William McGowan, the longtime chairman of the telecoms group. Canada TORONTO prices closed lower in moderate activity which was boosted by three large block trades. Based on preliminary data, the TSE 300 index fell 8.39 points, or 0.25 per cent, to 3,386.09. Declining issues led advances 321 to 256. Volume was 35.9m shares, up sharply from the previous 20.8m, and trading value was CDollars 397.3m against CDollars 254.2m. Tuesday's volume included three blocks - two in Mackenzie Financial totalling about 7m shares, and one in Investors Group at 3.3m shares. Among the sub-indices, ten of the 14 were lower. Financial services, mining, energy and consumer products were all down somewhat and industrial products group ended flat.</p>

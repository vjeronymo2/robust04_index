			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 26 Mar (EFE) -- Manuel Camacho Solis,  the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas,  reported in a press release today, Saturday, that the Mexican  Government and Army support the political negotiations and the  peace process in resolving the armed conflict.    Camacho replied to charges made by the Zapatist National  Liberation Army (EZLN) that the government was preparing an  imminent attack against EZLN positions and had bombed an area  close to the southern city of Comitan, approximately 1,200 km  from Mexico City.    Camacho said he had sent a confidential communique to the  EZLN on its main military concerns to clarify the current  situation in the Chiapas conflict zone.    The peace commissioner asserted that despite the tense  situation in Chiapas over the past weeks, both the Mexican Army  and the EZLN had respected the truce and had complied with the  agreed upon cease-fire.    The document signed by Manuel Camacho stated: "The dialogue  and political negotiations halted the war and opened  possibilities for an agreement, and this continues to be the  only way to find a dignified peace in Chiapas."    The murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential  candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI),  prompted a situation of political uncertainty regarding the  peace process and presidential succession. The EZLN said the  PRI candidate's murder was a cowardly act and announced that its  forces would be on red alert to counter an imminent attack from  government forces, which it accused of increasing their military  presence and preparing a military offensive.    The Zapatists accused the hard-line sectors and supporters  of  the military for the bloodshed in the country, Colosio's murder,  and attempts to annul all peaceful efforts to democratize Mexico.</p>

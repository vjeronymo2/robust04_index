She was  responding to the speech made by the leader of the opposition,  Mr. Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, in the National Assembly this  afternoon during the debate on the current political situation  in the country with a particular reference to the situation  prevailing in NWFP [North-West Frontier Province]. The leader of  the opposition in his speech had criticized the prime minister  on her interview with the BBC. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said she  stood by her interview as Pakistan did not interfere in the  internal affairs of India nor do we intend to interfere in  future. Kashmir she emphasized is not an integral part of  India. It is a disputed territory recognized by the UN and even  by the former Indian prime minister, late Jawaharlal Nehru. The  prime minister declared that Pakistan under the leadership of  PPP has put India on the defensive and on the run. The Indian  leadership is so desperate that it has indulged in attacking the  person of the prime minister of Pakistan. It is a tragedy that  when the Indian president and their leadership have launched a  slanderous campaign against her setting aside all diplomatic  norms, the opposition joined hands with the Indian Government  against the prime minister of Pakistan. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said  she is not deterred by such attacks and tactics as she has never  committed any laxity in discharging duties while serving the  motherland. The PPP government, she said, is steering the  country out of the international isolation and enhanced  Pakistan's prestige in the comity of nations. Ms. Benazir  Bhutto said India is now embarrassed and worried due to  Pakistan's effective strategy on Kashmir while the situation was  quite different during Mr. Nawaz Sharif's tenure.    Referring to the allegations leveled by the leader of the  opposition that the PPP has abducted the MPA's [members of  provincial assembly] of NWFP assembly, she said the leader of  the opposition is painting a wrong picture in this regard. She  challenged the opposition to present a solid proof in favor of  their claim about the abduction of MPA's like we had provided  evidence of the kidnapping of the PPP MPA's [by Sharif's party]  at the time of Senate election during the previous regime. She  said nobody in the immediate families of the MPA's of NWFP  assembly has claimed that their relatives have been abducted by  the government. This is an ample proof that the claim of the  opposition is false and baseless.    Participating in the debate, the leader of the opposition,  Mr. Nawaz Sharif, said the government should have provided a  leadership for strengthening political culture in the country.  But he alleged the government is creating political crisis. He  said the government should have taken initiative both in and out  of the house in curbing the horse trading. Mr. Nawaz Sharif  said the opposition has the right to move a no-confidence motion  against the government, but horse trading and keeping MPA's  hostage is contrary to the Constitution.    Earlier, the law and justice minister, Syed Iqbal Haider,  moved a motion for debate on the current political situation in  the country, with particular reference to situation in NWFP.  Initiating the debate, Syed Iqbal Haider said the government  has voluntarily agreed to hold discussion on the NWFP situation  because it wants to discuss everything in the house. However,  the minister criciticized the requisitioning of the session by  the opposition. He said it has been done to sabotage the  government endeavor to mobilize the world opinion on Kashmir.</p>

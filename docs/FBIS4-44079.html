			<p>BFN     [Text] Corfu, Greece, June 25 (AFP) -- Dutch Prime Minister  Ruud Lubbers and British EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan  have withdrawn from the race to become European Commission  president, diplomats said here Saturday [25 June].    The only remaining official candidate for the post is  Belgian  Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, but Britain is maintaining its  veto on his candidacy, the diplomats added.    Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino announced Lubber's  withdrawal on the second day of a two-day EU summit.    He said the decision made it probable that Dehaene would  replace Jacques Delors as head of the EU executive on January 5  next year.</p>

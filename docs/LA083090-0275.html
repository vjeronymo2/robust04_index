			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE CLAIMS HE'S THE BRAINS BEHIND BRAINS  </P> <P> Gilbert Hyatt is a slender, bearded engineer who says he would never shoot the  guns that are mounted over the fireplace in his modest, two-story home on a  quiet La Palma cul de sac.  </P> <P> But he is not afraid to take steady aim when necessary to get what is  rightfully his.  </P> <P> "I'm a little guy up against the big guys," Hyatt, 52, said in an interview  Wednesday.  </P> <P> And this David landed a Goliath of a blow when it was revealed Tuesday that he  had been awarded a U.S. patent in July for inventing the technology to create  the microprocessor, or computer on a chip. Hyatt had sought the patent for 20  years.  </P> <P> The news could turn the computer industry topsy-turvy and make Hyatt wealthy if  he is able to collect millions of dollars in royalties from the world's  computer chip makers. It could also earn him a spot as an inventor whose  innovation changed the world.  </P> <P> "I am happy that my invention was used to advance technology in so many ways,"  he said, bearing a permanent blush from the recent media attention. "But it was  frustrating without the recognition. This patent has settled everything in my  mind."  </P> <P> But the dispute is still far from being resolved.  </P> <P> The invention of the microprocessor, which has made possible most consumer  electronic products including pocket calculators and personal computers, is  frequently credited to a team of Intel Corp. engineers that included Ted Hoff,  Federico Faggin and Stan Mazor.  </P> <P> They began working on the idea to help a Japanese calculator company in 1969,  although Intel's chip was not shipped until 1971. Texas Instruments also  entered the market in the early 1970s.  </P> <P> But Hyatt, who has a stubborn streak that has been honed by two decades of  legal battles and skepticism, says he is prepared to defend his claims against  pretenders and deep-pocket companies that have until now been credited with the  microprocessor's development.  </P> <P> Hyatt said he makes a living as an aerospace consultant and hasn't worked for a  big company for 25 years because he fears the environment would "stifle  creativity."  </P> <P> When he worked to develop the microprocessor, it was for a company that he  founded and ran himself. Micro Computer Inc., the start-up company, was funded  by Hambrecht &amp; Quist, a venture capital firm in San Francisco.  </P> <P> It grew to 25 employees between 1968 and 1971, but Hyatt said it folded in the  midst of a dispute over rights to the technology. To his chagrin, rivals Intel  and Texas Instruments received patents in the 1970s and developed millions of  applications for microprocessors.  </P> <P> At the time, Hyatt could be faulted for being stubborn in refusing to share his  patent rights, said Stuart Lubitz, a Los Angeles patent attorney who  represented Micro Computer until it folded in 1971. Lubitz said Micro Computer  fell apart because Hyatt resisted imparting the rights to his inventions.  </P> <P> "You can't put Hyatt in the same boat with (chip pioneer Robert) Noyce or Jack  Kilby," the Texas Instruments engineer who co-invented the integrated circuit  and the hand-held calculator. "They were far more successful at advancing the  state of the art and were not as obsessed with paper rights."  </P> <P> Hyatt acknowledged some stubbornness in his style, but he said he fought hard  to have his patent approved because he believed that it was far more important  than other inventions.  </P> <P> During the late 1970s, he continued to innovate but nearly soured on the  inventing business after he was sued by Mattel Inc. for two electronics-related  patents. He lost the suit to have his patents enforced, but a law firm in  Washington saved him by picking up his legal costs.  </P> <P> The soft-spoken but spunky engineer has collected a patent for every year of  his life. Much of his work in recent years has involved liquid crystal display  technology.  </P> <P> "Some inventors just invent, but I try to be broad in my areas of interest," he  said. "I consider myself a scientist, an engineer and in some ways an  entrepreneur."  </P></p>

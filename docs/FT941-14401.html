			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Tokyo forex trade at five-year low Trading on the Tokyo foreign exchange market dropped to a five-year low last year, raising doubts over the viability of Tokyo's role as the leading financial market in the far east. Spot and swap volume traded through forex brokers last year fell 3.4 per cent compared with 1992, to Dollars 5,963bn, the lowest level since 1988. Trading volume has fallen steadily since the peak in 1990. Derivatives trading also declined. Some big US and European houses, the leading participants, moved their operations to Hong Kong and Singapore as a result of high costs. Slow deregulation by the ministry of finance, limiting the number of instruments traded in Tokyo, has also discouraged some traders. The ministry has yet to lift its ban on forward rate agreements, originally expected last year. Similar trends have occurred in the stock market, where investors trading the Nikkei stock futures index have shifted trade to Singapore, The Japanese financial authorities need to make a concerted effort in making Tokyo a more attractive financial market, says Mr Kazuo Fujii, senior managing director of forex brokers Nittan AP.</p>

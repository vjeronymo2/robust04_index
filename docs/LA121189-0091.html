Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> DELTA 2 PUTS 'NAVSTAR' INTO ORBIT  </P> <P> An Air Force Delta 2 rocket knifed through a blue sky today and successfully  boosted into orbit a $65-million "Navstar" satellite, the fifth in a  globe-spanning network of military navigation beacons.  </P> <P> Running 24 hours behind schedule, the $30-million Delta 2, equipped with nine  strap-on boosters for extra power, thundered to life at 1:10 p.m., 16 minutes  late because of concern about high winds aloft, and quickly vaulted away from  Launch Pad 17 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.  </P> <P> Housed inside a protective nose cone at the top of the 126-foot rocket was the  fifth of 21 new Global Positioning System -- GPS -- navigation satellites  designed to tell military units their locations to within 53 feet anywhere in  the world.  </P></p>

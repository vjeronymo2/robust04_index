			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Arts: Noble unveils his first season at the Royal Shakespeare Company An upbeat Adrian Noble unveiled yesterday his first full programme as artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Sir Peter Hall returning to Stratford after twenty four years to direct All's Well That Ends Well at the Swan; Terry Hands returning after 24 months to direct Antony Sher in Marlowe's Tamburlaine the Great, also at the Swan; and Kenneth Branagh playing Hamlet, again, at the Barbican in Adrian Noble's first production of the play, are among the highlights. The five Shakespeare plays opening at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford include Antony and Cleopatra for the first time since 1978, with Richard Johnson and Clare Higgins in the title roles. Also on offer are The Taming of the Shrew, As You Like It, The Winter's Tale, and Merry Wives of Windsor. The Swan, which had a very successful 1991, presents its first musical, The Beggar's Opera, and a revival of A Jovial Crew, written in 1641 and last revived in 1724. It marks the Stratford directorial debut of Max Stafford-Clark. The Other Place has a production of Richard III, with Simon Russell Beale as the King, which will tour the country when a sponsor can be found, plus two new works, The Odyssey, a reworking of the Greek myth by the Caribbean poet Derek Walcott, and The School of Night, by Peter Whelan, which is set in the London of Christopher Marlowe. Apart from Hamlet the Barbican has transfers from last year's Stratford season, with the exception of Julius Caesar and Twelfth Night which were not reckoned to be worth the trip. There are also two premieres, Columbus by Richard Nelson and a play, not yet titled, by Peter Shaffer, which will also be directed by Sir Peter Hall. Despite the Pounds 3m deficit which hangs over the RSC, Adrian Noble was in bullish mood. Audiences were up in 1991, when the Company played to over one million people, and the year will show a small profit. Noble is making minor innovations both in opening a Shakespeare play - Hamlet - in London and then transferring it to Stratford in 1993, and by building up successes from last year's season at the Swan, such as The Two Gentlemen of Verona and The Alchemist, for the big stage at the Barbican rather than condemning them to the Pit.</p>

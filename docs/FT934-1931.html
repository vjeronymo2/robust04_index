			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Leading Article: A well-judged declaration It is too soon to say whether yesterday's remarkable joint declaration by Mr Albert Reynolds and Mr John Major will lead to peace in Northern Ireland. The prime ministers have produced a document which demonstrates that there is no valid reason for a continuation of violence. The effectiveness of their carefully-constructed argument will now be put to the test. It will succeed if the IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries are amenable to reason, but fail if they continue to behave like mindless terrorists. This was clear to everyone in both the British and Irish parliaments yesterday. As Mr Major told the House, he cannot force the IRA to lay down its arms; he can only urge it to do so. The Irish view is that, since the loyalists say that their own violence is retaliatory, an IRA ceasefire should lead to general peace. The initial reaction from Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, was 'disappointment', but it should study the document further. With Mr Reynolds, Mr Major has produced in a single declaration a summation of the positions taken by both the British and Irish governments. The right to self-determination of the inhabitants of the island, expressed separately in the north and the south, is acknowledged. Irish nationalists have an undertaking that if they manage to persuade a majority of Northern Ireland's inhabitants to choose a united Ireland, the British government will accept that. Exploratory talks Three months after disavowing violence as a means of struggle, and persuading the IRA to lay down its arms, Sinn Fein would be invited to join exploratory talks. As part of an overall political settlement Mr Reynolds is ready to renounce his government's constitutional claim to the north. The Ulster unionists are promised, for the umpteenth time, that no change in the constitutional status of the province will be made without the consent of its voters. These propositions, wrapped in layers of reassuring phraseology, should in all sanity constitute a helpful step towards peace. No entrenched position is compromised, but a democratic path to the settlement of disputes is laid down. The sense of hope that this engendered yesterday was reflected in the House of Commons. The Labour leader, Mr John Smith, welcomed the document 'with enthusiasm'. Most backbench responses to Mr Major's statement were congratulatory or friendly, give or take one or two doubting Tories. Studied neutrality Of particular significance is the fact that the most important unionist leader, Mr James Molyneaux, was helpfully non-committal. Without his studied neutrality, there could be no progress. The most recalcitrant unionist, the Rev Ian Paisley, was predictably outraged. On the nationalist side, Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said that the Major-Reynolds paper was 'one of the most comprehensive declarations that has been made about British-Irish relations in the past 70 years'. This broad welcome should give the IRA much to ponder. The very reasonableness of the Downing Street declaration, as yesterday's document will probably be called, could further isolate the proponents of violence within the republicans' natural constituency. Those in the US and continental Europe who have expressed sympathy with Sinn Fein in its struggle against British 'imperialists' should note Mr Reynolds's signature alongside Mr Major's. As Mr Smith said yesterday, there was no excuse for the bombing and shooting in the first place. Any shred of justification that some might have clung to has now been stripped away. Whether or not yesterday's initiative leads to a cessation of hostilities, the two prime ministers fully deserve the praise that has been heaped upon them. Both took a political risk when, in Dublin as in London, each assumed responsibility for seeking peace in Northern Ireland. As Mr Major observed, in a sharp response to Mr Paisley, this would be expected of any prime minister. In doing his job, Mr Major has on this matter risen above the mundane. He has shown persistence, courage and a fine grasp of detail. Presenting the result to the House yesterday, he displayed these qualities at their best.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / World Trade News: Japan lifts quotas on US orange juice JAPAN lifted its long-standing quotas on orange juice imports yesterday, and Florida citrus officials were on hand to extend their congratulations - and sales pitches, AP reports from Tokyo. Japan abolished the quotas under a 1988 trade agreement with the US, opening the way for free competition in a fast-growing market that Florida officials estimate will be worth Dollars 1bn by the year 2000. Japan already is the largest importer of US agricultural products. American orange juice, most of which comes from Florida, now accounts for about one-fourth of the Japanese import market, with lower-priced Brazilian juice accounting for most of the rest. But Florida citrus officials say the quality of Florida juice is higher, and this will help them capture a greater share of the market. Florida juice is in a better position to compete on the basis of quality rather than price because of a growing preference in Japan for premium 100 per cent juice.</p>

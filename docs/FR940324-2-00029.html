Box 1160, Owensboro, Kentucky 42302, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;265&hyph;000 an application pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for authorization to increase the certificated horsepower of its Haughton Compressor Station located in Bossier Parish, Louisiana, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas Gas states that the compressor unit installed at Haughton has a full nameplate capability of 2,250 horsepower, but has been programmed to a 2,000 horsepower capability to meet the station requirements existing at the time of its installation. Texas Gas states further that because its firm shippers have requested increased volumes, it is now necessary to uprate the compressor to its 2,250 horsepower maximum capability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is stated that because the uprating can be accomplished by simply rewriting the control software, there is no cost associated with the alteration. It is further stated that the proposed uprating would increase the capacity available in the winter on Texas Gas' North Louisiana system by approximately 5.3 Mmcf per day, but would not increase the summer ambient capability of the Haughton compressor. Thus, it is said, there would be no increase in Texas Gas' annual available capacity along this system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> March 30, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

Columbia estimates that the quantities of gas to be delivered at the new delivery point will be 20,000 Dth per day and 7,300,000 Dth annually.

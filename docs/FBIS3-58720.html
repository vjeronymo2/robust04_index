			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jonathan Eyal, director of studies at the Royal </F> United Services Institute, London: "This Affair Will End in  Tears"]    [Text] NATO, argued Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary,  this week, is not ready to expand into Eastern Europe, for to do  so would entail excluding Russia and moving the dividing line of  the continent to the river Vistula. And the Vistula, as Mr Hurd  reminded his audience, is both a Polish and a Russian river.  This argument shows how outdated is the Foreign Secretary's  knowledge of East European geography: the last time the Vistula  crossed Russian territory was before the First World War.    Yet there is a sense in which Mr Hurd is correct. The Soviet  empire may have followed its Russian predecessor into oblivion,  but it lives on in the minds of most Western leaders. And, as  Bill Clinton starts his summit in Moscow, the West's policy  towards Russia remains nonsense, wrapped in hope, inside a great  deal of pious talk.    This policy may not yet amount to outright appeasement of  Russia: after all, appeasement in the Thirties was applied to  existing dictators, while Western governments today are  sustaining Boris Yeltsin precisely in order to prevent a  dictator assuming power in the Kremlin. Nevertheless, in  pursuing its love affair with the Russian president at all  costs, the West has put in place all the elements for future  appeasement. As in the Thirties, military preparedness is being  reduced as the security risks are mounting. As then, a series of  self-serving justifications shroud unpleasant realities.    "A constitutional democracy governs Russia," Mr Clinton  declared on arriving in Brussels this week. Far from it: the  West's hope today is that a strong constitution, hastily drafted  by a cabal of Kremlin advisers and forced down the throats of  ordinary Russians, will enable Mr Yeltsin to ignore the results  of the parliamentary elections. This is a curious understanding  of what democracy is all about, even if there is a good case for  saying that, given the country's history, nothing better could  have been expected. The aim at the moment, Western politicians  argue, is to isolate Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the nationalist  rabble-rouser, and this entails more, not less, support for Mr  Yeltsin.    In an effort to deflect accusations that he is obsessed with  supporting Yeltsin alone, Mr Clinton is meeting most of Russia's  other political leaders in Moscow, including the Communists and  the Agrarian party, their closest allies. Yet Mr Zhirinovskiy,  leader of the biggest opposition party in the Russian  parliament, is not on Mr Clinton's guest list. There is  something strange about a "constitutional democracy" in which  one of the biggest players is considered ineligible for dialogue  with the West.    The West dismisses Mr Zhirinovskiy as an accident rather  than  a product of Russia's democracy. In the cliches so dear to the  present U.S. administration, he is merely a "wake-up" call to  Russia's democrats. Far from it: the feeling of national  humiliation on which Mr Zhirinovskiy feeds is unlikely to  disappear soon, almost regardless of what the West does. This  is largely because the Soviet empire was not defeated in battle;  it simply disintegrated, in circumstances that remain  inexplicable to most ordinary Russians. To isolate Mr  Zhirinovskiy, Mr Yeltsin must redefine Russian nationalism,  while steering clear of its most chauvinist manifestations.  This was never going to be easy, but Mr Yeltsin shows no  inclination even to understand the problem, and the West has no  interest in helping either.    Every Western government knows that Russia has been involved  in fomenting many of the conflicts in former Soviet republics.  Instead of confronting the problem, though, the West has  pretended that nothing has happened. With a particularly bad  sense of timing, Mr Hurd and Andrey Kozyrev, his Russian  counterpart, published a joint article in British and Russian  newspapers, ostensibly seeking to place Russian "peace-keeping"  operations in the former empire within strict legal limits.  Stripped of its niceties, the article carried two important  messages: that there is a need for Russian intervention in  neighbouring republics, and that the West is in no mood to do  anything about it. The former empire has effectively been  surrendered to Moscow without a whimper.    The West deludes itself if it believes that this will help  Russian democracy. Allowing Russia to recreate its empire will  doom any chance of economic reform. The recently concluded  merger between the Russian and Belarus economies, for instance,  makes a mockery of attempts to control inflation: at a stroke,  the Russian budget deficit will increase by an amount similar to  that of the immediate aid the Kremlin is negotiating with the  International Monetary Fund.    Accepting Moscow's right to "defend" ethnic Russians  everywhere is dangerous for all Europe. The Kremlin has never  referred just to "ethnic Russians," but has always used the term  "Russian speakers," a considerably larger category of people.  More important, this "right" has wider implications. If Russia  can defend its kinsmen everywhere, why should Hungary, for  instance, be denied the right to defend Hungarians in Romania  and Slovakia? Is Serbia's policy of uniting all Serbs under one  state any different?    In practice, Mr Yeltsin is now competing with Mr  Zhirinovskiy  to see who is the better Russian nationalist, a competition from  which the West has nothing to gain. But the very same Western  governments that continue to claim that Mr Yeltsin is strong  enough to push through economic reform, also assert that he is  too weak to resist nationalist pressure at home. Logic, it  seems, has drowned somewhere in the Vistula.    The contradictions go much deeper even than this. The West  is keen to handle Russia as a equal partner, a surviving  superpower. But the only claim Russia has to superpower status  now is its military might -- precisely what the West wants to  see reduced. And, far from treating Mr Yeltsin as a partner,  the West has often subjected the Russian leader to petty  pressures when its interests were perceived to be at stake.    While continuing to sell weapons all over the world, the  West  has forced Russia to slim down its arms exports, cancel a deal  with India and accept a UN package of sanctions on Libya that  was carefully designed to protect only Western economic  interests. The result is a partnership that is perceived as  servitude by the Russian military and large sections of the  population.    In postponing NATO's eastward expansion, the West argues  that  it is accommodating Russia's historic fear of encirclement.  This is nonsense on a grand scale. Apart from a sliver of land  on the Baltic, Russia does not have borders with any East  European state. Accepting Mr Yeltsin's protests assumes that the  Russian president can speak for Ukraine and Belarus as well. It  is also a disservice to Russia's future security needs. If the  East Europeans are rebuffed in their efforts to join NATO, they  will most probably seek to form local security alliances by  drawing in Ukraine as well.    Such an inherently unstable situation is bound to implicate  both Germany and Russia. Indeed, in a recent interview with a  German newspaper, Mr Kozyrev hinted heavily that Moscow was  considering precisely such a tie with Bonn with a view to  handling Eastern Europe's future problems. Germany has not yet  been tempted by such an offer, but if NATO cannot expand, the  pressures on Bonn will grow. Dreams about a Russian-German axis  are Europe's way to perdition.    The West tends to assume that if Russia turns nasty, it will  be able to reverse policies forthwith and include Eastern Europe  in its security structures. But if the argument against the  expansion of NATO is its potential to annoy Russia, this surely  will be more compelling if Moscow becomes more assertive. And,  given that the West has ignored all the current threats from  Moscow -- the refusal to withdraw from other republics, the  unilateral cancellation of proposed military cuts and the  admonitions to Eastern Europe -- at what point does it decide  that Russia has turned "nasty" enough to warrant a response?    A policy based on the belief that nothing should be done to  rattle Russia can lead only to appeasement: in political terms,  the time to confront an aggressive Russia will come only when  more of the independent countries fall into Moscow's sphere of  influence. But it is the awareness of this that fuels  instability in Eastern Europe. Instead of offering the media  more photo-opportunities in Moscow, Bill Clinton would be well  advised to take Douglas Hurd and other Western ministers on a  cruise down the Vistula.</p>

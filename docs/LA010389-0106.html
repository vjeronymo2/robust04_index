			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CHRYSLER PLANS 10-CYLINDER ENGINE  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. said today that it plans to introduce a 10-cylinder engine in  the early 1990s, the first built by a U.S. auto maker. A version of the engine  will be shown later this week at the North American Automobile Show in Detroit  on the Dodge Viper RT-10 concept car, said Vice President of Product Design  Thomas Gale.  </P> <P> While the engine is not yet available on production models, Gale said he  expects to see it used on Formula One racing cars soon.  </P> <P> Trade publications have previously reported speculation about the V-10 engine  program, but Chrysler had not confirmed the reports.  </P> <P> Gale said the engine probably will be introduced on Chrysler truck models in  the early 1990s but he declined to be more specific. Ronald Glantz, an  automotive analyst with Montgomery Securities, said the engine will be used  "mainly in motor homes and medium trucks, and they will probably make a version  of it for Lamborghini." Chrysler bought the Italian sports car manufacturer in  1987.  </P></p>

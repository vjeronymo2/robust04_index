			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: GEC expected to acquire choicest parts of Ferranti Even though GEC yesterday abandoned its 1p a share rescue bid for Ferranti, Britain's biggest manufacturing group is still expected to pick up the best of what remains of Ferranti's defence electronics businesses. Indeed GEC could well save money by buing those Ferranti operations it wants from the receiver instead of footing an Pounds 11.4m acquisition bill and assuming responsibility of Ferranti's net debts, contingent liabilities and overdue creditors' payments totalling about Pounds 155m. The dismantling of Ferranti actually began in 1989 following the discovery of huge fraud in International Signal and Control, the US subsidiary which Ferranti acquired in 1987. The ISC fraud blew a massive hole in Ferranti's balance sheet and forced Ferranti's management, led by Mr Eugene Anderson, chairman, to embark on a Pounds 500m asset sale programme to try to keep Ferranti afloat. In the process its workforce was cut from 22,000 to less than 3,700 and bank debts were reduced from Pounds 689m in 1989 to about Pounds 100m at the end of September. GEC picked the prize fruit of the Ferranti empire after the ISC debacle, paying Pounds 310m in 1990 for its radar division. The business included the project leadership for the radar to equip the European Fighter Aircraft. Last year, GEC-Marconi bought the company's missile business for Pounds 38m. In its offer document for Ferranti issued at the start of November, GEC identified four other areas where a combination of both group's operations would result in business units 'better placed to win orders for defence equipment at home and overseas.' These are combat management systems for surface ships and submarines; air defence command, control and communications systems; ship and submarine sonars; simulation and training products. It is assumed that these are the businesses which GEC might be interested in acquiring from the receivers. Among these assets Ferranti's sonar operations were folded into a joint venture with Thomson-CSF, the French defence group, in 1990 and its investment was valued at Pounds 25.7m in the latest accounts. Putting a value on Ferranti's other assets is difficult, particularly since much of the potential value to a purchaser probably lay in the experience of its workforce which may now be dissipated.</p>

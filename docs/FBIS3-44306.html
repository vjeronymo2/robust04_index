In his speech, Kim Yong-nam mentioned the relationship  between Korea and the United Nations, and said: The United  Nations should adopt concrete measures to replace the truce  agreement with a peace agreement; this has become the demand of  the times that brooks no delay. Only such practice can be  commensurate with the new situation in which Korea has become a  member of the United Nations, and only thus can contributions be  made to guaranteeing peace and security in the Northeast Asian  region. He once again stressed the DPRK position on reunifying  the country in the form of the federal system.    Kim Yong-nam reiterated that peacefully resolving the  nuclear  problem on the Korean Peninsula by means of dialogue and  consultations is Korea's constant position. He said: However,  if the United States disregards Korea's sincerity and continues  to pursue a hostile policy toward Korea and follow the course of  exerting pressure, then Korea will have no alternative but to  adopt resolute measures for safeguarding its state sovereignty.    In his speech, Butrus-Ghali said: "I sincerely hope that the  DPRK and the ROK will have a one-seat representative in the  United Nations." He said: Realizing permanent peace on the  Korean peninsula in place of the truce agreement signed in 1953  is an important matter of concern to the international  community. If such peace is realized on the Korean peninsula,  the United Nations will disband the "UN Force Headquarters" on  the Korean peninsula.    Butrus-Ghali finally said that he believed the DPRK  Government and people will make positive contributions to  international cooperation through the United Nations.</p>

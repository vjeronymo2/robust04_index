			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Tanzanian minister 'must go' The International Monetary Fund and World Bank have told Tanzania's government its finance minister should be removed, officials in Dar es Salaam said yesterday. They said IMF and World Bank representatives said the scheduling of a new meeting of Paris Club creditor countries and the resumption of aid by Norway and Sweden depended on Mr Kigoma Malima's departure. President Ali Hassan Mwinyi last week appealed to donors and international agencies to keep giving his government aid during an official investigation into rampant tax evasion, which cost an estimated Dollars 125m (Pounds 76.2m) in lost revenues last year. Sweden and Norway froze a total of Dollars 28.5m in aid to Tanzania last week, citing concern at the evasion. The officials said foreign donors had reserved the right to commission an independent audit on the report on the tax evasion investigation being carried out by the controller and auditor general. Other donors could suspend aid as Norway and Sweden have done if the president ignored this condition, they added.</p>

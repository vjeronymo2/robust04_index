			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Buthelezi 'sorry' for TV fracas South African Home Affairs Minister Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who is also leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, offered an unconditional apology for having burst into a television studio on Sunday night to confront a political rival during a live broadcast, Mark Suzman reports from Johannesburg. The uncharacteristic apology by the combative minister, which came after he had been formally censured by the cabinet for 'a serious violation of the right to freedom of speech and freedom of the press,' appears to have defused the controversy over the incident for the time being. However, Chief Buthelezi remains under continued political pressure over his relationship with Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini who last week broke off relations with the Chief. Speaking at a joint press conference with President Mandela in Pretoria, Chief Buthelezi said that he had apologised to the President and the nation as a whole for the incident.</p>

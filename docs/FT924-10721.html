			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / New Central Bank head MR Gustavo Loyola, a 39-year-old economist, has been nominated as the new governor of the Brazilian Central Bank, completing the formation of the government of Acting-President Itamar Franco, Christina Lamb reports. Mr Loyola has spent the last 15 years in the Central Bank. He succeeds Mr Francisco Gros, an internationally respected banker, who many were hoping would remain. Despite lobbying for Mr Gros by the economy and planning ministers, Mr Franco insisted that he was too closely associated with the previous government's policy of high interest rates. The departure of Mr Gros could signal a relaxation of monetary policy.</p>

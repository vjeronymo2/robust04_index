			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: CME expands pit as trading soars THE CHICAGO Mercantile Exchange is celebrating record trading volume as it opens its second trading floor, making this the fourth time in two decades that the futures exchange has had to expand to accommodate new business. Nearly 74m futures and futures options contracts changed hands at the exchange between January and June, and if this sort of pace can be maintained the exchange will finish with a record year. The CME still ranks second in outright futures trading volume to its neighbour, the Chicago Board of Trade but because of its vast Eurodollar contracts, it is the world's largest exchange in terms of underlying notional value of contracts traded. Last year the CME traded Dollars 85,000bn. The London International Financial Futures Exchange traded Dollars 27,000bn while the CBOT had turnover valued at Dollars 13,000bn. This compares with Dollars 2,000bn in notional value of stocks traded at the New York Stock Exchange last year. The CME, unlike some of its competitors, has planned for this expansion in business, building and mothballing a second trading floor when it built in 1982 its existing Wacker Drive office towers in Chicago's financial district. The new 30,000 sq ft space sits one level above the existing trading floor, and brings trading room at the exchange to 70,000 sq ft. The Dollars 27m outfitting of the floor was completed last month and currency futures traders moved in last weekend. Eurodollar futures and options will open on the floor on July 26. Like the world's other big futures exchanges, the CME's products are growing in tandem with the off-exchange swaps and derivatives markets in a general movement toward financial risk management. This growth belies predictions that open outcry trading would fade as electronic transactions became fashionable. Mr Jack Sandner, CME chairman, says the expansion will allow product innovation held back for lack of space. The CME plans to extend its rolling spot foreign exchange futures to D-Marks soon. The old trading floor will remain home to the CME's agricultural products and its expanding menu of stock index contracts. While action in the exchange's meat and livestock sector is lacklustre, equity derivatives volume is growing. The CME has the benchmark S&amp;P 500 stock index contract, and four less successful indices, including futures on the FTSE-100 and the Nikkei 225. Later this year it expects to add Major Market Index futures to that list.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Loan fraud feared at Hafnia group THE DANISH Finance Inspectorate, the banking system watchdog, has asked the police fraud department to investigate transactions in the Hafnia Insurance Group with a view to bringing charges against members of the Hafnia board, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The action is the result of loans made to Hafnia Holding, the parent company, from its insurance subsidiaries. Such loans are illegal under Danish law. The existence of the loans - for a total of about Dkr470m (USDollars 76m) - became known in April. The loans have all been repaid, Mr Ebbe Christensen, chairman of Hafnia's supervisory board, told the annual meeting of shareholders yesterday. Police will investigate the circumstances which led to the loans being made. The loans to Hafnia Holding were made to bolster the parent company's finances, which came under pressure when Hafnia and Norway's UNI Storbrand tried last winter to stage a takeover of Skandia, the Swedish insurance group.</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A tax on telephone customers to subsidize service for low-income households in  California is being cut by the state Public Utilities Commission. Effective  July 1, the tax will fall to 2.5% of a customer's charges for in-state toll  calls, down from 4%. The tax is used to reduce charges for the 1.3 million  customers receiving what is known as Lifeline service to half the normal rate.  The tax reduction was prompted by a surplus in the fund that pays for Lifeline  service.  </P></p>

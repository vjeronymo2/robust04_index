			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Lithuanian Land Workers' Union Council </F> Presidium "On the Privatization of Personal Land"]    [Text] Lithuania's rural areas are experiencing an  extremely difficult period. Therefore, following its principle  of defending the interests of land workers, the Lithuanian Land  Workers' Union can no longer bear with the voluntaristic  gibberish concerning the process of land reform, and the rules  of restoring land and the right to real estate, which recently  has come from the particularly vigorous Landowners' Union, as  well as parties, nationalistic groups, and separate social  activists who support it.    Pursuing political goals, they are trying, in particular, to  stir and paint with different colors the issue of privatizing  personal land. Appealing to justice and the sacred feeling of  ownership, the ideologists of this union and parties want to  return to the distant past, forgetting that it is impossible to  divide our rural settlements into detached farmhouses, parcel  out reclaimed farmland as plots, and move the urban population  to rural areas. We understand that the commotion that is being  raised around this issue is not casual, the more so that the  current law regulating land reform states that personal land  cannot be restored to other persons, and one is allowed to  acquire it in the same manner as land plots for private housing.  The forces which are interested in this commotion want to  deprive the rural people of the right to produce themselves the  amount of food and animal feed necessary for their families and  personal farms.    Since the very beginning of its activities, the Lithuanian  Land Workers' Union has tried to implement its program principle  -- "to legalize land ownership for those who work it, and former  owners and their children who are returning to farming in rural  areas." This formulation of the problem has been unequivocal in  all Land Workers' Union documents over its three-year  activities. Currently, we have a real chance of resolving this  issue, which would allow to stabilize the situation of landless  countrymen and remove social tension.    Considering these circumstances, the Presidium of the  Lithuanian Land Workers' Union Council states and proposes the  following:    1. People who live and work in the country have never lost  their link with the land, and they have preserved farm buildings  and kept animals. Their personal farms are a guarantor of rural  stability and a condition for training future farmers and  imparting a master's feeling in young people. At the same time,  they are the principal source of income for rural pensioners and  other persons who require social support. Therefore, the  ownership right to this land must not depend on landowner's  goodwill -- it must be guaranteed by the state which takes care  of its nation's existence.    2. World experience and the laws of a market economy require  free ownership of land by the user. Therefore, personal land  must be legalized as private property that can be restored  instead of formerly possessed land in other places or sold to  families which have no land to reclaim. This would be more just  than to restore the land cultivated over decades to former  owners' children and grandchildren who will never work it and  will take part of annual profits earned by workers who lease  this land.    3. Personal land must be situated in places where it is more  convenient for workers to farm it, despite the fact who owned it  according to prewar reform. Users themselves, in cooperation  with specialists in land development, must decide how to use the  land situated near settlements. Land plots in common use must  also be privatized by the general right of ownership, if there  is overall agreement. This would create more favorable  conditions for cooperation, mechanized farming, fertilizing,  caring for crops, harvesting, renewing cultured grassland, and  coordinating this work through crop rotation with the land owned  by large agrarian companies or individual farmers.    4. Considering the difficult economic situation of land  workers, the latter must have the right to buy land not only for  money but also for single state payments. The state rather than  new owners must pay former owners in line with the law, whose  land has been ascribed as repurchased by the state and  non-restorable. Since compensation must be paid from the funds  accumulated from the sale of land in state possession, it is  necessary to legalize the payment for land acquired for private  ownership before the final arrangement of agreements on land  sale and purchase.    5. It is on personal land alone that food production has not  dropped under the difficult and complicated conditions of  agrarian reform, and this proves the economic expediency of such  land. After vital economic structures become established in  rural areas (large or specialized cooperatives or stock  companies with intensive farming), personal land will either  naturally transform itself into them or remain the source of  guaranteed food and income for rural families who are unable to  work or who are forced to search for work in other sectors.  Thus, there can be no restraints for workers to acquire this  land, regardless of its demand for other purposes. This is the  undisputable right of all people who did not abandon farming in  the former difficult period.    6. We appeal to the Government of the Republic of Lithuania  to consider our proposals and promptly resolve the issue of  privatizing personal land.

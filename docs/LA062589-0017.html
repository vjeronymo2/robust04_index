			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE AND SAVING WHALES  </P> <P> Culture: What a wonderful word. It means different things to different people.  And what a handy word. Particularly for "friends of the United States" such as  the Japanese. They constantly preach that because we don't understand their  culture we are unable to trade goods with them.  </P> <P> This clever excuse for one-sided relations has now been refined. Now the  Japanese line is that they kill whales and need to continue to do so because  their culture is different from the rest of the world. (And the survival of  their culture is obviously more important than the survival of the whale as  species!)  </P> <P> So let's take them up on it! How? By restricting their access to Western  technology, by denying them favored nation trading privileges, by officially  proclaiming their outlaw behavior with ocean life and by publicly examining the  issue of ethics with every aspect of their relations with us.  </P> <P> Short of this, I fear nothing will stop their senseless killing of the whales.  </P> <P> PAUL I. BECKER  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

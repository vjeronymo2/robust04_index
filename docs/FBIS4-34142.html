			<p>BFN     [Text] The Carlos Manuel de Cespedes Thermoelectric Plant  in Cienfuegos has begun tests to start its machinery after  almost 60 days of extensive repairs to Unit No. 2. Specialists  from the Carlos Manuel de Cespedes Thermoelectric Plant reported  that the work was satisfactorily carried out, which consisted of  mainly a complete overhaul to the boiler, auxiliary equipment,  and the pump. The most complex work carried out at the plant  involved cleaning the sea water intake canal for treatment of  the Czech units.    Once maintenance work has ended at the Carlos Manuel de  Cespedes Thermoelectric Plant in Cienfuegos Province, all  efforts will be entirely dedicated to repairs at Unit No.1 --  currently underway -- for its subsequent synchronization with  the system by year end.</p>

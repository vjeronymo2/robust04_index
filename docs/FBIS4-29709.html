			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Confession of Nuclear Criminal" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- Japanese Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata told reporters at the Diet on June 17 that "Japan  surely has the capacity to possess nuclear weapons," a report  from Tokyo says.    In this connection, the chief secretary of the cabinet,  Kumagai, revised the remarks of Hata at a press conference in  the evening, saying that "the prime minister did not use a  proper expression."    Upset by the reaction within the government, Hata hurriedly  called reporters together that evening and "withdrew" his  remarks, saying "Did I say so really? I do not remember that."    Although Hata cancelled his remarks, he cannot conceal the  nuclear design of Japan he had revealed of his own accord.    His remarks that Japan has the capacity to possess nuclear  weapons were a confession of the nuclear ambition of Japan and  admission of the moves to convert Japan into a nuclear power,  the moves which have gone beyond the danger line.    In fact, the world knows Japan is capable of possessing  nuclear weapons. Japan, however, had categorically denied it  till Hata admitted it.    As a result, Japan's veil of "three non-nuclear principles"  has been thrown off, and it has been made crystal clear that  the Japanese Government's argument that "Japan's use of atomic  energy is limited to peaceful purposes" is a sheer lie to  mislead public opinion.    It is disgusting that this nuclear criminal is zealously  conducting the anti-DPRK campaign in conspiracy with  international reactionaries, raising a hue and cry over the  "nuclear issue" of the DPRK which has neither the will nor the  capacity to develop nuclear weapons.    Japan must refrain from rash acts, clearly mindful that its  moves to become a nuclear power will bring nothing good to it  and will cause irrevocable catastrophic consequences.</p>

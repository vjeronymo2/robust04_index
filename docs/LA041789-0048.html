			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LINER LOST IN '98 FOUND OFF MASSACHUSETTS  </P> <P> The steamer Portland, which disappeared in a storm 91 years ago with perhaps  200 passengers, has been found at the bottom of the Atlantic off Massachusetts,  an oceanographer said Sunday.  </P> <P> "There's no doubt; we've got it," said John Fish of the Historical Maritime  Group of New England. Fish worked with Arnold Carr and William McElroy for 13  years to solve the mystery of the Portland.  </P> <P> "The find is particularly significant, not only because the Portland was one of  the worst maritime disasters in the Northeast, but because it remained shrouded  in mystery," Paul Johnston of the Smithsonian Institution said.  </P> <P> Fish said it appears that the hull was rent lengthwise when the ship went down  in 1898. "We expected something weather-beaten," Fish said. "We found something  that appeared to have exploded."  </P></p>

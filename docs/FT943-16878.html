			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Weak bonds push Dow sharply lower Wall Street US stocks suffered a sharp setback yesterday as nervous investors watched long-term bond yields push higher, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 42.09 down at 3,624.96, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 3.36 to 444.27. The secondary markets showed more resilience, with the American SE composite edging forward 0.60 to 424.08 and the Nasdaq composite firming 1.95 to 705.96. The morning brought a barrage of fresh economic indicators, none of which had any direct bearing on the outlook for corporate earnings. Nevertheless, stocks were derailed by the bond market's bearish reaction to the data. In particular, fixed-rate investors were put off by a jump in the prices paid by Chicago-area manufacturers last month. The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said its May prices-paid index climbed to 69.7 per cent, against 63.7 per cent the previous month. The data was a red flag for the inflation-sensitive government securities market. In response, the yield on the benchmark 30-year security moved over the pivotal 7.60 per cent level, sending a shiver through the stock market. After a positive opening, share prices retreated steadily throughout the session, which brought the second quarter to a close. Some 293m shares were exchanged on the Big Board, even though the approach of the long Independence Day weekend had thinned the ranks on Wall Street. There were also many investors who preferred to stay on the sidelines pending the outcome of next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy- setting arm. The dollar's plight remained an unpleasant sideshow, further encouraging restraint. However, two headline acquisition stories provided the session with a touch of spice. CBS surged ahead Dollars 47, or 17.9 per cent, to Dollars 310 on news that the media group was in the final stages of negotiating a merger agreement with QVC. Shares in the home-shopping network jumped Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 38. Trading in both issues had been halted until mid-afternoon. The second deal involved the more staid railway sector, in which mergers have been rare in recent years. Burlington Northern dipped Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 53 3/8 and Santa Fe Pacific appreciated Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 20 7/8 after agreeing to combine their operations. The move was anticipated. Caterpillar continued to feel the effect of a week long strike. The issue led the Dow indust-rials in decline, dropping Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 100. After an early gain, UAL, parent of United Airlines, retreated to end a net Dollars 1 1/8 off at Dollars 126 1/4 . The company modified terms of a plan which would result in an employee buy-out of the carrier if approved by shareholders. Health maintenance organisations were marked down in activity which followed the approval of a health care reform proposal by the House ways and means committee. United Healthcare dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 45 7/8 and US Healthcare Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 37 amid fears of a federal move to control the cost of insurance premiums. Canada After staging a further improvement, the Toronto market slipped back. leaving the TSE 300 index ending a net 2.9 points off at 4,025.2. Advances still led declines, however, by 466 to 309 after moderate volume of 59.5m shares valued at CDollars 638m. On the shortened week, the composite index has gained about 65 points. Canadian markets are closed today for the Canada Day holiday. Brazil Equities closed 5.36 per cent down in local currency terms after profit-taking and speculation that the government might take measures that were expected to keep foreigners out of the market. The Bovespa index lost 2,052 at 36,232 in volume of Cr476.2bn (Dollars 173.1m. Brokers said there was speculation that the government may increase taxes on incoming capital and maintain a high spread between bid and ask prices on certain dollar exchange rates. But a trader said he did not think the government would lift taxes on incoming capital because it would hurt the market and the share prices of blue chip state companies. Traders added that investors were also taking advantage of the market's rise over the last three sessions to take profits ahead of today's introduction of the real. Inflation in Brazil was 45.2 per cent in June, a rise of 2.63 per cent from May, agencies report from Rio de Janeiro.</p>

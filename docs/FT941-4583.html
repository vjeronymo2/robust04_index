			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Skandia proposes SKr3bn rights issue Skandia, the Swedish insurer, yesterday reported record profits for 1993 and announced plans for a SKr3bn (Dollars 375.5m) rights issue to back expansion. The group said it had rebounded to an operating profit in 1993 of SKr2.01bn  -the best in its history - from an operating loss in 1992 of SKr3.24bn. An even more dramatic swing occured in the so-called management operating result, which includes changes in the value of the group's bond, equity and property portfolio. This surged to a profit of SKr4.07bn from a loss of SKr3.72bn in 1992. Skandia is to pay a dividend of SKr2.00 per share after suspending a payout last year. Details of the share issue will not be given until later this month. The issue will lift Skandia's solvency ratio from 84 per cent at the end of 1993 to around 100 per cent. Mr Bjorn Wolrath, chief executive, said the new capital was needed chiefly to fund Skandia's plans to expand organically in the Nordic area. 'We have a substantial market share of non-life business in the Nordic countries, and now we would like to increase our share in the life business and in different savings businesses. That means setting up a lot of new companies.' He said Skandia wanted to strengthen its international credit rating from the BBB status it holds to the AA rating it enjoyed in the early 1990s. Mr Wolrath denied speculation that the rights issue was part of preparations for acquisitions. Skandia two years ago discussed a merger with Baltica, the Danish insurer that is now for sale. However, Mr Wolrath said the group had 'no plans for that at the moment'. He said the results overall reflected Skandia's shift in emphasis towards life insurance and savings products, as well as favourable movements in financial markets.</p>

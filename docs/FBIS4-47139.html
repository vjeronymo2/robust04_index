			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report of the Lvov Oblast Statistical Administration: "The </F> Year Began Badly. We Have To Save Ourselves!"]    [Text] In the first quarter of 1994, social  production declined, labor productivity decreased as the number  of people holding jobs fell, and the rise in price increases was  slowed down but not halted.  <H5>  The Decline Continues </H5>   Compared with last year's first quarter, industrial output  in  Lvov Oblast fell by 43.3 percent as against a 1.9-percent drop  in the first quarter of 1993 and a total decrease of 15.9  percent for 1993 as a whole. Although the decline in industrial  production was even greater in some regions (output in Kherson,  Luhansk, and Volyn Oblasts fell to less than half the previous  level), this rate was lower for Ukraine as a whole, averaging  38.4 percent.    Industrial output fell at 389 enterprises, which accounts  for  82.8 percent of all the oblast's enterprises. Only Radekhiv and  Sambir rayons managed to maintain the same production volumes as  in the first quarter of 1993. Labor productivity in the oblast  fell by 38.5 percent.    The main reason for this unsatisfactory state of industrial  production is the nonpayments crisis, which makes it difficult  for enterprises to obtain the necessary raw materials and  material and technical supplies on the one hand and, on the  other hand, to sell their output.    The largest drops in output occurred in the fuel industry,  at  enterprises of the chemical and petrochemical industries, and in  machinebuilding and metalworking. Among the principal kinds of  machinebuilding products, only the production of woodworking  machine tools rose. The output of metalworking tools and  agricultural machinery fell by 80 to 90 percent, that of  automatic loaders, buses, and gas ranges to one-third of their  previous level, and production of forging and pressing  equipment, medical equipment, and pipeline fittings to less than  half. The production of all kinds of building materials  decreased: cement, bricks, precast reinforced concrete  constructions and components, ceramic tiles, soft roofing  materials, window glass, and ceramic plumbing fixtures. The  output of the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry  fell substantially.    The worst aspect of this is that industrial enterprises are  unable to introduce the latest scientific-technical advances  into production, which restricts their ability to increase labor  productivity. Thus, only 27 new technological processes  (including three low-waste, resource-conserving, and waste-free  processes) were introduced in the first quarter. This is a  decrease of nearly 50 percent as compared with the same period  in 1993. The production of 247 new kinds of industrial products  has been set up, which constitutes a drop of 36 percent, as  compared with last year.  <H5>  Things Are Also Bad in the Social Sector </H5>   The sale of livestock and poultry for slaughter fell by 34  percent as against the first quarter of last year, milk  production--7 percent, eggs--26 percent. Average milk yield per  cow amounted to 465 kg, or 6 kg less than in January-March of  last year, in contrast to a rise of 11 kg in Ukraine as a whole.  Average egg yield per chicken totalled 34 eggs--a decrease of  eight eggs per chicken, as compared with last year.    At the beginning of April of this year, the number of head  of  meat cattle (including cows) at agricultural enterprises  totalled 533,300, which is 9 percent less than on the same date  last year. The number of cows, hogs, and poultry dropped. During  the first three months of this year, the oblast's agroindustrial  entities sold the population 26,400 piglets and 45,800 head of  poultry--a 15-percent increase over the same period last year.    Since the beginning of the year, agricultural producers,  including those with subsidiary plots and private farms, sold  the state 20,800 metric tons of cattle and poultry in  liveweight, 50,400 metric tons of milk and milk products, and  26.1 million eggs. These figures are also lower than last year's.  <H5>  There Is Less Fuel, but Sowing Is Progressing at a Faster </H5> Pace    In the period between January and March of this year,  collective and state agricultural enterprises received 20,600  metric tons of diesel fuel, or 8 percent less than during the  corresponding period last year, and 8,400 metric tons of  gasoline (44 percent less than last year). The amount of  available diesel fuel on the date of this report was 6,900  metric tons, or 27 percent less than last year, and of  gasoline--2,600 metric tons, or 52 percent less.    The oblast's farms are sowing spring crops at a much faster  pace than last year. By 25 April, they had sown 174,900 hectares  of land, including 88,300 hectares of grain and pulse crops  (excluding corn), 34,500 hectares of sugar beets, 7,600 hectares  of fiber flax, and 3,900 hectares of potatoes.  <H5>  There Is Too Little Investment </H5>   Capital stock valued at 162 billion karbovantsy has been put  into operation in the oblast. Capital investments amounted to  671 billion karbovantsy, which is 29 percent less than during  the same period last year. State capital investments account for  four-fifths of the total sum. Spending on construction has  increased nearly 60 percent as against the relevant period last  year.    Only 9 percent of the state funds were channeled into the  creation of the active portion of fixed capital, which attests  to the low degree of effectiveness with which these funds were  used. Almost half the funds were spent on the construction of  social and consumer facilities and housing. This indicator for  Ukraine as a whole averages 45 percent.    The share of capital investments derived from centralized  sources of financing, which make up 17 percent of the total  volume, is continuing to fall. Building organizations using  their own resources performed jobs under contract at agreed-to  prices in the total amount of 546 billion karbovantsy. Compared  with the same period last year, the volume of work has decreased  by 33.3 percent. The rate of housing construction is falling.  <H5>  Transport Is Laid Up </H5>   The main territorial enterprise of the Lvov Railroad system  shipped 3.3 million metric tons of freight during the first  quarter, or 31.9 percent less than during the same period last  year. The amount of freight shipped was 7.5 million metric tons,  or 38.1 percent less than last year. The amount of freight  dispatched by all railroad transport in Ukraine dropped 35  percent. Less freight (by 35.9 percent) was also unloaded.    Motor transport carried only half as much freight as during  the first quarter of the preceding year, while passenger traffic  did not drop substantially. The main reason for a rise in motor  transport stoppages was a lack of fuel and freight.    Air transport has become almost inaccessible: 54.5 percent  fewer passengers were transported and 82.4 percent less freight.    During the first quarter of this year, pipelines carried  1,739,000 metric tons of oil. Of this amount, 1,700,000 metric  tons was oil that passed in transit through the oblast on its  way to West European countries.    Communications enterprises earned 118.7 billion karbovantsy  from their principal activity, including 21.3 billion  karbovantsy from the sale of services to consumers.  <H5>  But Wages Are Rising </H5>   Compared with the first quarter of last year, the total  amount of nominal personal monetary income in the oblast  increased 29.9-fold (24.5-fold in 1993, as against 1992). Wages  and other income from enterprises and organizations accounted  for nearly 67 percent of the total sum of personal monetary  income (as compared with 58 percent in the first quarter of  1993). The reason for this is that the growth of funds channeled  into consumption at enterprises in the state sector of the  economy outstripped other sources of monetary income. Average  monthly per capita income in the first quarter of this year was  713,900 karbovantsy, and the average monthly wage was 668,900  karbovantsy. These amounts were 40 and 39 times greater,  respectively, than in the first quarter of last year.    However, the cost of consumer goods and paid services has  increased 54.7-fold. Still, the growth of prices and rates of  goods and services has slowed down somewhat for the first time  in the past two years: in January (as against the preceding  month), prices and rates rose by 17.7 percent, in February--by  13.6 percent, and in March--by 3.2 percent.    Prices of agricultural products as a whole fell at Lvov  markets by 3.2 percent. Livestock product prices dropped by 6.1  percent, while produce prices rose by 30.7 percent.  <H5>  And There Is Something Left To Put Away in a Sock </H5>   The total amount of money spent by the oblast's population  during the first quarter, as recorded by the financial system,  increased 27-fold, as compared with the relevant period of last  year. This sum was lower by 276 billion karbovantsy, or 9.1  percent, than the total amount of monetary income. The total  volume of retail goods turnover also rose, although the supply  of goods fell by 40.9 percent, including by 67.5 percent in the  consumer cooperatives. (The total volume of retail goods  turnover in Ukraine as a whole fell during this period by 47.6  percent.)    Consumers bought more food products and fewer nonfood  consumer items. They economized on oil, margarine, confectionary  and sausage products, meat and poultry, canned fish, butter, and  even bread. Only half as much bread was sold as before; it is  obviously not being used to feed pigs.    Revenues from paid services amounted to 474.4 billion  karbovantsy. The volume of these services exceeded the volume  sold during the corresponding period of last year by a factor of  54.1, but dropped by 7.7 percent in comparable prices. (The  volume of paid services in Ukraine as a whole fell by 17 percent  during this period.)  <H5>  The Industry of Prosperity Is Losing Ground </H5>   Local production of consumer goods is largely responsible  for  the critical situation in the consumer market. The volume of  consumer goods produced in the first quarter of 1994 (in  wholesale factory prices) was valued at 3.3 billion karbovantsy,  or 4,365 percent less than during the same period last year. In  Ukraine as a whole, the output of consumer goods decreased an  average of 3,962 percent. Lvov Oblast, which until quite  recently ranked first [in consumer goods production], has now  dropped to fifth place (following Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya, and  Kharkiv Oblasts and the city of Kiev).    Production in all groups of goods has fallen, especially  woolen and silk fabrics, nonwoven materials, knitted underwear  and other knitted apparel, sown products, leather footwear,  hosiery, textile haberdashery products. The output of children's  products decreased three- to eightfold.    There has been a significant drop in the output of  television  sets--threefold; mopeds--6.9-fold; children's  bicycles--2.1-fold; jewelry products--3.8-fold; household  chemical agents--2.2-fold; and furniture--1.8-fold.    The output of almost all principal food products has  dropped,  except for high-fat cheeses and baking yeast. There has been a  significant decrease in the production of meat (37.1 percent),  canned fruits (42.3 percent), cereals (29.7 percent), macaroni  products (49.4 percent), margarine products (49.7 percent),  nonalcoholic beverages (46.2 percent), confectionary products  (32.6 percent).  <H5>  Privatization Is Being Stepped Up... </H5>   By 1 January 1994, 322 state and municipal objects had been  privatized, while, just in the first three months of this year,  162 objects were privatized. Of this last group, 27 passed into  full private ownership, 134 are now collectively owned, and one  has a mixed form of ownership. The privatization of the state  housing fund is being conducted at a faster pace. During 1993  and the first quarter of this year, more than 41,000 state-owned  apartments and single-residence buildings passed into private  ownership (11.1 percent of the total number of apartments in the  state housing fund). Nearly 95 percent of these apartments  (38,900) were privatized without payment, on preferential terms,  or with compensation with vouchers for insufficient floor space.  <H5>  ...As Is Unemployment and Crime </H5>   On 1 April 1994, the number of registered jobless reached  13,800 individuals, of whom 12,000 had unemployed status. Women  account for more than 64 percent of those without work. Hidden  unemployment--that is, those in the work force that are not  fully employed--is not decreasing. In the oblast's industry  alone, 87,000 persons did not work every day during the first  quarter as a result of production stoppages.    In the first quarter of 1994, there were 5,800 reported  crimes, or 21 percent more than in the first quarter of 1993.  The crime rate rose in all regions of Ukraine, with the  exception of Kirovohrad Oblast. The highest rises occurred in  Volyn, Zhytomyr, Cherkasy, Dnipropetrovsk, and Poltava  Oblasts--by 40-23 percent. For Ukraine as a whole, the rate rose  16 percent.    In Lvov Oblast, the crime rate increased in 18 rayons (with  the exception of Kamyanka-Buzka and Peremyshlyany rayons) and in  all cities under oblast jurisdiction, expect Boryslav. The rise  has been especially significant in Drohobych (98 percent),  Sambir (96 percent), Busk (95.5), Radekhiv (88.9 percent),  Staryy Sambir (66 percent), and Zhovkva (63 percent) rayons.  Every second crime falls into the serious category. There were  427 group crimes, which is 33 percent more than during the  preceding period. The authorities caught 2,213 individuals who  committed crimes, or 24 percent more than last year. Among those  charged, nearly half are able-bodied but unemployed and not  attending any educational institution, every sixth is a minor,  and every seventh was drunk at the time of committing the crime.</p>

Objectively, this is real progress compared with the  establishment of NACC (North Atlantic Cooperation Council),  whose creation aimed to fill the political and military gap  created by the disappearance of the Warsaw Pact and the collapse  of communism.    We can, therefore, now be certain that real cooperation will  be established on the European Continent, even if the prospects  offered by the Partnership remain vague. The terms of the final  communique leave no room for doubt: The expansion of the  alliance is within the realm of possiblity and has been  announced, although no timetable has been established. Compared  with the intentions expressed in autumn, this is considerable  progress.    Of course, some people rightly think that this development  is  not rapid enough. The Central European countries in particular,  whose heads of state will meet with Bill Clinton in Prague this  Wednesday [12 January], will probably regret that the alliance  has not taken more account of their hopes. But the choices made  in Washington at the initiative of Strobe Talbott, the new  assistant secretary of state (a former journalist who was posted  to Moscow), show that the White House's European policy is  determined to do nothing which could jeopardize Boris Yeltsin's  reforms.    On the other hand -- diplomatic circles make no secret of  this -- if things turn out badly in Russia, it seems obvious  that the Central or even East European countries would receive  their membership without delay. In such conditions, the Western  countries would no longer allow themselves to give in to the  amoral temptation of isolationism: They would have to provide  the security guarantees which Prague, Warsaw, and Budapest are  asking of them.    Paradoxically, as an expert stressed, the worst thing to  happen -- which nobody wants -- would favor the aspirations of  the members of the Visegrad group....    In short, the U.S. Administration is taking a kind of  gamble.  It wishes to play on two stages at once. Assured of the  rapprochement of the countries naturally attracted by the  Western world and which have no choice but to accept the  Partnership formula, it would like to establish (if not  maintain) the best possible relations with the Kremlin at the  same time. But, in politics, it can also prove tricky to keep  two pots on boil. In addition, the historical precedents of  this century certainly should not encourage the Visegrad group  leaders into thinking that the Western countries would give them  aid worthy of the name if their relationship with Moscow were to  deteriorate.</p>

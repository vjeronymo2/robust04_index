			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Calling whistle-blowers "public servants of the highest order," President Bush  signed legislation to give more protection to federal employees who expose  waste, fraud and abuse in government. At a ceremony in the auditorium of the  Executive Office Building, Bush signed into law the Whistle-blowers Protection  Act of 1989, which he said is free of the "constitutional flaws" that led  former President Ronald Reagan to pocket veto a similar bill last October. The  bill's key features, fundamentally unchanged from the vetoed version, would  establish a simpler and fairer standard for whistle-blowers to prove  retaliation by their bosses and would give them the right to appeal their cases  to the Merit Systems Protection Board if the government's Office of Special  Counsel fails to do so.  </P></p>

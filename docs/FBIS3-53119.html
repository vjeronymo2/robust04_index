			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Pope Shanudah, pastor of the Coptic Church </F> in Egypt, by Sana' al-Sa'id; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Al-Sa'id] How do you view the Vatican's  establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel, which means a  historic reconciliation between Christianity and Judaism?    [Shanudah] Do not forget that the Vatican represents a  state,  not just a church. The Vatican pope is a head of state and head  of a church, and he has ambassadors in foreign countries. This,  therefore, is not a reconciliation between Christians and Jews.  The Vatican pope represents only the Catholics. All the others  -- Orthodox, Protestant, and Anglican churches -- are not  associated with this policy and have nothing to do with it. As  for us, our dispute with the Jews is known. [passage omitted]    [Al-Sa'id] What about reports that Coptic tourists have  begun  visiting Jerusalem? This contradicts your declared position  that there will be no pilgrimage to Jerusalem before peace  prevails and Israel pulls out of the occupied Arab territories.    [Shanudah] We still adhere to our declared position. We will  not go to Jerusalem unless we all go together. Reports about  Coptic pilgrims in Jerusalem are untrue and merely propaganda.  We still ban travel to Jerusalem. [passage omitted]    [Al-Sa'id] Do you fear the growing extremism and violence by  some individuals in the country?    [Shanudah] We fear no one but God. And we even want to move  from fearing God to loving Him. When we love God, we will not  be linked to Him with feelings of fear. We want all people to  be religious, but not extremists or fanatics.    [Al-Sa'id] In light of the current call for a national  dialogue, is there a real possibility for an Islamic-Christian  dialogue?    [Shanudah] The Islamic-Christian dialogue should keep away  from creeds and focus on cooperation between Muslims and  Christians in all fields without discussing differences of faith  and creed. This will help people keep their love for each other.    [Al-Sa'id] What is the truth in saying that the Coptic  Church  is emotionally inclined toward the West, especially the United  State, perhaps because they have the same religion?    [Shanudah] Common religion does not mean common policy.  There are many Islamic countries, each with its own policy, and  the same applies to Christian states. [passage omitted]    Another point: You may speak of a common religion, but there  is more than one sect. While the Copts are orthodox, the  majority of Westerners are either Protestants or Catholics. So,  there is a sectarian difference that may cause a conflict  between the two sides, especially since we know that foreign  missionaries have come to Egypt and tried to convert the Copts  by various means and ways. I wonder what emotional inclination  you mean in your question, and toward which Western countries?    [Al-Sa'id] The United States. This may be because it is the  most powerful.    [Shanudah] It is known that the United States supports the  Jews, and our policy toward the Jews is known. Support for the  Jews is something no one accepts at all. This support in itself  indicates that differences in religion do not affect  policymaking. The Americans and the Jews have different  religions, but they are politically in agreement.

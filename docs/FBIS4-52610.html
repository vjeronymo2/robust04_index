			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Japanese Trade Minister  Eijiro Hata and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale on  Thursday [12 May] agreed that Japan and the United States will  try to resume the stalled trade "framework" talks at an early  time, a ministry official said.    The accord was reached when Mondale paid a courtesy call on  Hata, chief of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI), at the latter's office for the first time since the  cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was formed in late April.    Neither Mondale nor Hata, however, made reference to  specific  issues of the framework talks, the official told reporters.  Hata and Mondale agreed to have continued dialogue for an early  breakthrough in the talks, the official said.    The talks on a proposed new framework for bilateral trade  broke down in February at the summit of then Japanese Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton.</p>

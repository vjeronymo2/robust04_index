			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (5): Realities of the trade links - The prospects for the colony's economy It is a measure of the changing realities of Hong Kong that the possibility of economic slowdown in China, rather than the political uncertainty which still surrounds the impending transfer of sovereignty in 1997, casts a bigger shadow over economic prospects . Last year, despite the breakdown of Sino-British co-operation, Hong Kong's economy picked up speed with gross domestic product growth of 5.5 per cent, the highest rate of increase since 1988. Per capita GDP increased by 4 per cent to reach Dollars 18,500, a level that exceeds that of the UK. Heavy government spending on the new airport at Lantau Island, which is designed to safeguard Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre, was one of the reasons. Irrespective of diplomatic spats over the airport's financing, public spending on building and construction increased by 54 per cent last year, contributing to a 5.5 per cent rise in domestic capital formation. 'Considering it is a dead project, there's a hell of lot of work going on,' said one senior executive with one of Hong Kong's largest trading companies, glancing towards Victoria harbour where half of the world's dredging fleet is engaged in reclaiming land for what is the world's largest construction project. The overwhelming impetus has come from China, with China-linked trade and capital flows offsetting lower demand in some of Hong Kong's traditional export markets. Both local businessmen and foreign investors regard the prospect of Chinese rule with equanimity. Any political risks associated with the transfer of power in 1997 are outweighed by the promise and opportunity created by even deeper integration with the world's fastest-growing economy. Mr Anthony Bellingan, regional research director at Peregrine, a local securities house, says that international sentiment towards Hong Kong shifted decisively in the second half of 1993 when the scale of overseas investment interest simply 'drowned out worries about politics. The economic realities hit everyone in the face.' Those economic realities revolve around the fit between China's cheap land and labour and plentiful natural resources and Hong Kong's expertise in services, communications, marketing and finance. Since China adopted economic reform and its open door policies in 1978, Hong Kong's relations with it have become closer. The local business cycle has become more and more synchronised with that of China since 1986, replacing the territory's traditional dependence on the US and Europe. But Hong Kong's economic performance last year indicates that a decisive shift has taken place. Both Hong Kong investment in China and Chinese investment in Hong Kong have seen a qualitative increase. Hong Kong is now China's largest external investor, accounting for around two-thirds of its total foreign direct investment value. As much as 70 per cent of Hong Kong's manufacturing industry - textiles, electronics, toys and watches - has moved away from Hong Kong itself to Guangdong and other southern Chinese provinces, where average wage levels are less than a fifth of those in Hong Kong. Mr Michael Cartland, Hong Kong's secretary for financial services, estimates that as many as 3m Chinese are now employed in China by interests owned or controlled from Hong Kong. Yet most of these companies continue to rely on Hong Kong as a source of management expertise, financial services and marketing support, and help stimulate the growth of the colony's service sectors. Mr Cartland says Hong Kong companies increasingly specialise in 'both upstream and downstream activities, such as product design, production management, technical support, marketing and material sourcing'. Statistically, this linkage is most apparent on the trade front, especially in the growing importance of re-exports, goods processed in China and exported through Hong Hong to third countries, or goods imported through Hong Kong and then sold to China. Last year, re-exports grew by 20 per cent in real terms, following an increase of 29 per cent in 1992. The rise reflected rapid growth of the China trade - re-exports to China rose by 29 per cent, re-exports from China by 17 per cent, while those not involving China rose by only 1 per cent. And it was sufficiently strong to offset entirely a 5 per cent reduction in Hong Kong's own domestic exports which declined by 5 per cent, mainly because of slack demand in the most important overseas markets. Trade relations with Guangdong are particularly close - Hong Kong takes up about 80 per cent of Guangdong's external trade. Overall, the proportion of Hong Kong's trade involving China has increased from 17 per cent in 1980 to 56 per cent in 1993. At the same time, Chinese investment in Hong Kong has grown apace. Mr Cartland loosely estimates Chinese investment in Hong Kong at between USDollars 12bn and USDollars 20bn, an amount which is 'probably larger in value than that from the US and Japan'. There is little doubt that Chinese interest in property is one of the factors fuelling last year's 50 per cent plus increase in property prices. Mr Cartland says trade patterns were 'broadened and deepened' with Hong Kong's connections extended beyond the southern China. One fact reflecting the 'permeability' of this relationship is that a quarter of Hong Kong dollars are already circulating in China. That amount could increase, especially after May this year when the Bank of China becomes the third authorised note issuer. The negative aspect of this integration is that Hong Kong's future prospects might now hinge to a much greater extent on China's own economic prospects. The abolition of China's most favoured nation status by the US administration would have a decisive impact on the re-export trade, possibly wiping off two to three percentage points off the growth rate. Most forecasters regard this as unlikely but a tightening in China's austerity measures, as the country's leaders seek to control inflation, could lead to some slowdown in the re-export business and some repatriation of capital. The one certainty is that the local business community seems set to spend more and more time examining the Chinese - rather than Hong Kong's economic performance.</p>

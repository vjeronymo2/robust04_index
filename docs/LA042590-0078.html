			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHURCH'S LEADER DEFENDS SEX RITUALS AS  RELIGIOUS  </P> <P> The self-proclaimed high priest of a church that professes to incorporate sex  into its rituals told a federal judge Tuesday that his organization's doctrines  are expressions of religious "dedication," not prostitution.  </P> <P> In opening statements in a civil suit against the city of Los Angeles and its  Police Department, Will Tracy said he established his church in Canyon Country  after seeing visions in which he was visited by a 6-foot man with flowing white  hair and a transparent white robe.  </P> <P> "His eyes were extremely brilliant and flashing" and "he was also well-built,"  Tracy said of the April, 1984, vision.  </P> <P> Tracy, 51, and his wife, Mary Ellen, 47, were convicted Sept. 8 of operating a  house of prostitution and other related charges. They were sentenced to jail  but their terms were put off pending appeal.  </P></p>

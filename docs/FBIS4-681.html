			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- The international  mediation process collapsed in disarray on Thursday [14 April]  afternoon with the mediatiors saying they could not continue  without agreement on the terms of reference.    Mediator Dr Henry Kissinger said the mediators had dropped  everything to come to South Africa on the understanding that the  parties had agreed to the terms of reference. "We met the  parties but made no proposals because our mediation could begin  only after the terms of reference had been agreed.    "I wish the parties all the best," Dr Kissinger told a media  briefing.    The mediation collapsed in spite of intense efforts  involving the ANC, Inkatha Freedom Party and government  negotiators to agree on the terms of reference.    The dispute arose from the IFP's insistence that the  election  date be part of the mediation process.    Another mediator, former British Foreign Secretary Lord  Carrington said the mediators had not thought that they would  have an easy task. "The fact that it has failed fills me with  sadness," Lord Carrington said.    Dr Kissinger said the mediators understood that it would be  difficult for the parties to resolve historic differences in  such a short period. He said the mediators had urged the parties  to see whether they could bridge the gaps between themselves.    Dr Kissinger said the terms of reference had been faxed to  him on Sunday, which reflected agreement among the parties.    "When we came here we found that the terms of reference had  either been reopened or were not fully agreed as we had  understood."    The mediation was to have begun on Tuesday morning. The  seven  mediators were now making arrangements to leave the country.</p>

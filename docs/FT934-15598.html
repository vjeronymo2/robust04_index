			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: British Gas The Monopolies and Mergers Commission produced a cogent and coherent view of the future of the gas industry when it proposed splitting up British Gas. Yet it must be questionable whether the academic purity of the MMC's view will survive the political realities of the government's needs. The main thrust of the MMC's view - that sustainable competition in the domestic gas market required British Gas to be broken up - runs counter to the government's thoughts. So far, the Department of Trade and Industry has encouraged competition by the simple expedient of allowing entrants in. British Gas has argued, however, that safety considerations prevent the rapid further opening of the domestic gas market. Both the DTI and the MMC are, at least, agreed that competition cannot be extended and British Gas broken up at the same time. It may be tempting for the DTI to avoid break-up if it is keen on more competition. Yet that course is equally fraught with difficulty. Rapid deregulation would lead to differential pricing between users. Then there is the question of who should pay for the extra overheads and meters needed in a competitive market. The MMC recommended that customers should bear the costs, since they were the ultimate beneficiaries. Both would be politically embarrassing for the government at the time when VAT is being applied to fuel. The government might suggest introducing domestic competition conveniently after the next election. But that would leave British Gas still bound hip and thigh to its beloved regulator.</p>

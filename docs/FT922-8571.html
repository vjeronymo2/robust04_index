			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Bid hints drive Footsie to new record THE LONDON market began the new three-week trading account in excellent fashion, with a renewed flurry of takeover speculation plus another sizeable bought deal, and the FT-SE 100-share Index climbed to its fourth consecutive closing record peak. It was finally 12.1 higher at 2,737.8. Takeover speculation sprang from the intense activity after the market closed last Friday, when it was revealed that Hanson had sold its 2.82 per cent equity holding in ICI, some 20m shares, to Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, via a bought deal. The game in the market at the opening yesterday was to 'spot the new Hanson bid target', with a fistful of big names getting the takeover target treatment. Towards the close there were also stories that a big takeover, unconnected with Hanson, could be in the making. Asda, the supermarket group, was one name put forward as a possible bid candidate. Turnover in Asda shares has rocketed during recent sessions. Bid speculation was spiced by another strong performance from the futures market and the latest in a series of confidence-boosting showings by sterling against the dollar and the D-Mark. There was momentary confusion in the equity market at the outset of trading, when it was abundantly clear that a series of marketmaker input errors had distorted the Footsie, which was initially shown as 180 points up. Swift technical adjustment ensued and the Footsie was subsequently indicated as being some five points ahead minutes after trading commenced. The early running among the leading issues was taken up by stocks viewed in the market as potential bid targets for a re-armed Hanson. Dealers said Allied-Lyons, Trafalgar House, Blue Circle, Tarmac and a host of others had been given an early shot in the arm by the bid suggestions. By mid-morning the market had accelerated to a new intraday all-time high of 2,744.5, up 18.8. From then on, profit-takers began to gain the upper hand. A couple of programme trades were reported during the morning, with at least one weighted to the sell side. A quiet opening by Wall Street saw the Footsie slip further to show a net gain of eight points in mid-afternoon, before staging a late rise as the US market began to move ahead. BTR provided the market with the latest in a long line of bought deals by selling its 4.1 per cent stake (some 31m shares) in Pilkington, among the world's leading glass makers, to BZW, the investment bank. Ironically, Pilkington has been one of the market's strong takeover favourites. Last Friday's sale by Hanson of its ICI stake remained a big talking point. Goldman Sachs, which bought the shares from Hanson, was said to be still carrying a large block of the shares on its trading book. Equity turnover continued to please, reaching 651.6m shares yesterday. The value of customer business last Friday jumped to Pounds 1.88bn, boosted by the ICI bought deal. Senior dealers were not unduly concerned at the latest surge by the equity market, although some expect a correction in the near term.</p>

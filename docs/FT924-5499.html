			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Associates help Caledonia to Pounds 19.3m CALEDONIA Investments, in which the Cayzer family holds a 48 per cent stake, increased pre-tax profits by 11 per cent in the half year to September 30 on the back of strong performances from associate companies. Group profits rose to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 17.4m) reflecting the increase in operating profits from trading activities to Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 1.6m). This included first time contributions from the group's 27.3 per cent stake in Exco International and 45 per cent stake in Bristow Helicopter Group. The two companies used to be part of British and Commonwealth Holdings, which Caledonia once effectively controlled before the financial services group collapsed more than two years ago. Income from investments fell from Pounds 7.7m (Pounds 9.5m) because there was no longer any contribution from the holding of British and Commonwealth preference shares. The last instalment was repaid under the bank guarantee arrangements on April 3. Interest receivable declined to Pounds 7m (Pounds 7.7m) because of lower UK interest rates. The group has net cash of some Pounds 140m. Earnings per share increased to 14p (12.4p). The interim dividend is 5p (4.8p). Sterling Industries, in which Caledonia has a 21 per cent stake, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.87m (Pounds 1.59m), after an exceptional gain of Pounds 238,000, on increased sales of Pounds 18.5m (Pounds 16.8m). Earnings per share improved to 4.37p (3.75p); the interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p. Amber Industrial Holdings raised pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 1.47m in the half-year to September 30. The speciality chemicals company is 75 per cent-owned by Caledonia. Sales rose 26 per cent to Pounds 9.48m. The interim dividend is raised by 1p to 5.5p on earnings per share of 20p (16.8p).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Police say the killing of 28-year-old Yosi  Zandani in Bene 'Ayish near Gedera was apparently a terrorist  attack. Zandani was found strangled and stabbed to death early  yesterday morning. A police spokesman said a letter in Arabic  claimed the murder had been carried out to avenge the death of a  Gaza Arab.    Yitzhaq Rottenberg, who died after being wounded in a  terrorist attack on Tuesday, will be laid to rest this  afternoon. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Wen (6392 2429)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 9 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Eighteen  chairmen of Hong Kong's district board are now extensively  collecting signatures from among board members to support their  bid to urge Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten to withdraw the  partial electoral draft bill he has submitted to the Legislative  Council [Legco] and retain a certain proportion of appointed  seats in the composition of the 1994 district boards.    In an interview with this reporter, Wen Han-chang, chairman  of the Sai Kung District Board, said: The main role of a  district board is to extensively consult public opinion, thus  enabling residents to get involved more effectively in district  affairs. It is a local consultative organ whose main role is to  serve as a bridge between residents and the local administrative  organs of the Hong Kong Government. He pointed out that all  board members being elected by voters is the development  direction of a democratic political system. This is of no  doubt. However, in Hong Kong, which has long been under British  rule, the general public has a very poor sense of democracy and  inadequate enthusiasm about participating in district affairs.  Moreover, the voter turnout rate in every previous election has  been low. This being the case, retaining a certain proportion  of appointed seats will ensure that board members will have  broader representation and the interests and opinions of  residents in different trades and social strata can be balanced  and taken into account. This way of doing things is still  necessary.    Wen Han-chang suggested: As far as the composition of  district boards is concerned, the Legco model can be adopted;  that is, the number of appointed seats can gradually be cut and  in the end all seats will be elected by the voters. As for the  composition of the 1994 district boards, the number of appointed  seats could be cut from the current one-third to about  one-fourth. For the following term, the government of the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region could decide whether  appointed seats will be cut further or if all seats will be  elected by voters.    Wen Han-chang said: Of the 19 district board chairmen, 18  have clearly expressed their demand for Hong Kong Governor  Patten to retain a certain proportion of appointed seats in the  composition of the 1994 district boards. Moreover, numerous  members of the district boards in Hong Kong have also submitted  a joint letter to the Governor to voice the above-mentioned  demand, but he has paid no heed. This is indeed a perfect irony  of the so-called principle of "being open, fair, and acceptable  to the people of Hong Kong," which he has asserted again and  again.    Wen Han-chang hoped that the current extensive collection of  board members' signatures of support would help urge Governor  Patten to withdraw the partial electoral bill he has submitted  to Legco and retain a certain proportion of appointed seats in  the composition of the 1994 district boards.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Markets: It is all go for the Superbowl predictor - Wall Street THE WASHINGTON Redskins will defeat the Buffalo Bills in the Superbowl tomorrow, and US stock markets will remain bullish all year. No, a combination of the cold weather and Superbowl hype has not gone to my head. I am only paying heed to one of Wall Street's most effective forecasting tools: the Superbowl Predictor. The theory is simple. Victory for a team from the old National Football League forecasts a year of rising stock prices, while victory for a team from the old American Football League (the two leagues merged in 1970) heralds a year of falling prices. The Redskins are favoured to win in Minneapolis tomorrow, and because they are an old NFL team, Wall Street believes it is in for a good year. You may scoff, but since the first Superbowl in 1967, the Predictor has worked 22 out of 25 times, a success rate of 88 per cent. There is no other leading indicator that comes close to matching it. The theory can also work in reverse. The stock markets have started 1992 in buoyant mood, and should continue to enjoy solid gains throughout the year, if you believe the consensus. Thus, the bulls predict the Bills will lose and the Skins win. Confused? Investors certainly are. This was a difficult week for the markets, which posted some of the first significant losses since the rally began in mid-December. There was a 32-point gain midweek, but that owed more to late-session program trading than it did to renewed demand from investors. Profit-taking was the dominant factor, with traders and investors taking the opportunity to book some of the gains earned in the month-long rally. At the same time, buyers have been scanning the market for sectors that could offer a good ride over the next few weeks. Technical trading aside, investors appear uncertain as to what to do next. A vast amount of money has flooded into the market since the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates at the end of last year, most of it from lower-yielding short-term assets such as bank certificates of deposit and money market funds. That initial energy is probably now spent. Since the last rate cut on December 20, the Dow has risen more than 10 per cent and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 8.6 per cent, and it is difficult to justify adding to those gains until some fresh stimulus other than lower interest rates materialises. This means any advance in the market from now on must come either from better economic fundamentals or an improvement in the outlook for corporate earnings. On the economic front, the news has remained gloomy. This week contained little that pointed to a brighter future, while one set of backward-looking figures, the final count for housing starts in 1991, testified to the depth of the recession last year. Despite a modest rebound in housing starts in December (they rose 2.6 per cent), over the full year they posted a 1.1 per cent decline, the worst showing since 1945. Although stock markets should only pay attention to leading economic indicators, the housing numbers for 1991 show just how much ground one of a key sector of the economy has to reclaim before the recovery can be classified healthy. As for corporate earnings, the quarterly reporting season continues to produce an unappetising diet of the good, the bad and the ugly. For United Technologies, the fourth quarter loss of Dollars 1.22bn was about as ugly as it gets. In its defence, United Tech's loss was the product of a Dollars 1.275bn charge to cover the cost of a huge restructuring, which the aerospace and building group hopes will go toward restoring its good looks. There is a price for the economy to pay, however, in the loss of almost 14,000 jobs and the closure of a host of United Tech facilities. Delta Air Lines was another to report an unattractive loss for the final quarter of the year. The Dollars 237m shortfall was partly a hangover from Delta's purchase of the failed Pan Am's east coast shuttle operations and transatlantic routes. The figures were not warmly received by investors who had been keen buyers of the stocks until recently. Having peaked at over Dollars 75, Delta ran into heavy selling in the latter half of the week and by yesterday lunchtime had settled at Dollars 71. The best corporate news of the week came from a most unlikely source - a computer manufacturer. Unisys recorded fourth quarter profits of Dollars 80.5m, and reported that orders booked during the last three months of 1991 were the heaviest for five years. The market loved it, and the shares bounced from Dollars 5 1/2 at the start of the week to Dollars 7 1/2 at the end, a handsome 36 per cent gain.  -------------------------- Monday     3254.03 - 10.95 Tuesday    3223.39 - 30.64 Wednesday  3255.50 + 32.42 Thursday   3226.74 - 29.07 Friday     3232.78 +  6.04  --------------------------</p>

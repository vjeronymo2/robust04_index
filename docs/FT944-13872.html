			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: Enemy camp aids Hamlet of the Hudson  -Cuomo's battle to win a fourth term as New York state's governor There is no patented single method of rising to the top of politics in New York, city and state. Name and money help (FDR, Harriman and Rockefeller were all governors) as do sheer chutzpah (exemplified by La Guardia and Koch as mayors) and brains (Senator Daniel Moynihan). But most of the time there is no substitute for a sheer sense of larger-than-life drama. Not for nothing is Mr Mario Cuomo, the Democratic governor in pursuit of a fourth term, known as the Hamlet of the Hudson for his musings on the meaning of life and his own career. There is now, indisputably, a pretender to that title and a new leading man on the state stage. The only question is whether Mr Rudolph Giuliani, the popular Republican mayor of New York City who endorsed the unpopular Mr Cuomo on Monday afternoon, will come to be seen as a Fortinbras, who inherited Denmark after Hamlet, or as a scheming Iago with his own agenda. There are two important sub-plots in Mr Giuliani's decision. The most obvious centres on the bitter emnity between the mayor and Mr Al D'Amato, the Republican senator from New York whose hand-picked candidate, the hitherto obscure Mr George Pataki, is ahead of Mr Cuomo in the governor's race. In 1989, Mr Guiliani blamed his narrow defeat for mayor by Mr David Dinkins on the senator's backing of another conservative candidate. Stemming from that, and advanced both by Mr Giuliani and by a relieved New York Times editorial yesterday, is the mayor's calculation his perennially financially strapped city would receive more sympathetic treatment from Mr Cuomo than it would from a Governor Pataki whose campaign message is to lower both taxes and spending. The Giuliani assessment was concisely expressed. He said Mr Cuomo, who has increased state funding for the city, loved and understood it and did not make promises he could not fulfil. In contrast Mr Pataki had 'almost uniformly voted against the interests of the city and often the metropolitan region.' But most telling, and most aimed at Senator D'Amato and Mr Pataki, sometimes scathingly labelled Gepetto and Pinocchio, were the words: 'Mario Cuomo is his own man. I prefer dealing with someone who is his own man, even if we disagree on some important issues.' Democratic joy at the Giuliani endorsement knew no bounds. Mr Cuomo described his decision, naturally, as 'extremely intelligent and courageous.' President Bill Clinton called the mayor from Cleveland to express his appreciation. Republican fury, replete with allegations of treachery, was of a comparable scale. Mr D'Amato declared: 'Rudy Giuliani is wrong.' Clearly, much depends on whether or not the Giuliani seal of approval rescues Mr Cuomo. The New York Post poll yesterday gave Mr Pataki a 44-36 point lead, with 11 per cent undecided and nearly 7 per cent going for Mr Thomas Golisano, a conservative pro-life independent candidate. The rough rule of thumb is the governor needs about two-thirds of the city vote to offset the Pataki advantage in conservative upstate areas. Mr Giuliani's popularity in his bailiwick should help. One poll found 11 per cent of the city inclined to follow his recommendation. The mayor has seemed for some time to be edging towards a Cuomo endorsement, frequently appearing with him at notionally non-political events. He had met the Republican candidate only once in the campaign, and reported coolly on their discussion, yet he was more complimentary after longer sessions with Mr Golisano, who is competing for the same votes on the right as Mr Pataki. On the other hand, Mr Cuomo, along with Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachussetts the nation's most prominent liberal Democrat, has appeared very vulnerable. Not only was the conservative anti-incumbent tide washing against him, but the length of his tenure and his persistent refusal to take a national job on the Supreme Court or in the Clinton cabinet left many New Yorkers with the impression he would have to be winkled out of office. But the inevitable, though not necessarily accurate, talk of the town yesterday was as much on the mayor's ambitions beyond his city. With Senator Moynihan certain of re-election on November 8, the next state-wide openings are 4 years away in the next governorship race and Mr D'Amato's seat. It would be easier for the mayor to succeed Mr Cuomo after 16 years than Mr Pataki after four. A race against Mr D'Amato would whet every appetite for political blood, but the Senator's control of the state Republican party is such that challenging him in a primary would be tough. But the trend of the times favours independent candidates and the mayor has, at a stroke, shown independence from his own party. No mayor of New York this century has won higher elective office, though several have tried. Thus Mr Giuliani's statement on Monday can also be taken at face value - that he was not thinking about himself but following his own intuitions and sense of what was best for New York.</p>

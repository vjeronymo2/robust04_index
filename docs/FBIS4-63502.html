			<p>BFN     [Text] The Crimean legislature is ready to hold talks with  Ukraine's parliament, but it will not accept conditions set by  Kiev, the head of the Russia parliamentary faction, Sergey  Nikulin, who leads the parliamentary commission on legislation,  law, order and national development, told Interfax-Ukraina on  Saturday [21 May].    A Crimean parliamentary delegation led by the Speaker,  Sergey  Tsekov, is expected to meet with a Ukrainian parliamentary  delegation in Kiev on Tuesday.    As we already reported, on Friday Ukraine's parliament urged  the Crimean parliament to cancel its Thursday's resolution  issued to revert to the Crimean Constitution adopted on 6 May  1992.    Besides, Ukraine's parliament suspended the bill adopted to  restore the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992. Under that  Constitution all relations between the Crimea and Ukraine are  built on the basis of agreement, and the people of the Crimea  are entitled to "dual citizenship."    Ukraine's parliament adopted a resolution suggesting that  the  Crimean parliament should annul its decision within 10 days.</p>

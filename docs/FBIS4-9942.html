			<p>BFN     [Text] A bilateral antidrug agreement for cooperation  between Cuba and Argentina was signed this afternoon at the  Foreign Ministry. The agreement was signed by Cuban Justice  Minister Carlos Amat and Argentine Secretary of State [title as  heard] Alberto Lestelle. Lestelle told the press that this  agreement will trigger the development of relations between the  two countries within a very short term.    [Begin Lestelle recording] The signing of this agreement  implies, first of all, something very significant for the two  countries. This agreement extends far beyond the regions, far  beyond government decisions, and far beyond other problems. It  will become the main gate between Argentina and Cuba for the  treatment of other problems, which perhaps could be even more  important than the drug issue.    During a week of work in the areas of health, education, and  the police, each group will meet independently and prepare a  program. This program will determine how we will be able to  provide assistance to Cuba, and how Cuba can provide us with  assistance as well. We are going to analyze this further on a  later date, but I also think that Argentine Health Ministry  officials must visit Cuba to see the development of the family  doctor program. We have only a brief sketch of this in  Argentina, nothing else. By virtue of these meetings, we must  establish what we can do here and what you can do in Argentina.  So this possibility must remain open. [end recording]    I wish to add that Dr. Lestelle heads an Argentine  delegation  that has been visiting Cuba for several days, seeking the  signing of this cooperation agreement for the antidrug fight. I  would also like to tell our listeners that Cuba is a signatory  of the UN convention for the fight against international drug  trafficking and has agreed to sign bilateral agreements with  many countries of the region.</p>

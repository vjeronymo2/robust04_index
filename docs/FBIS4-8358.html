			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tana Ardeleanu and Elena Tumulescu: "Moldovan </F> Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli Attacks -- Romania Has Not Given  Us Even a Pencil for Free"]    [Text] Moldova's Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli made a  shocking declaration on Radio Chisinau that is meant to put an  end to the misunderstandings regarding the possible association  of Moldova with Romania. Mr. Sangheli stated: "No matter how  strange it would seem to you, we are fed up with the misery and  intrigues published by the press, which keep telling us that  Romania has allegedly granted us disinterested aid. In the past  two years, Romania has not given us even a pencil for free. I  would like to tell you that, in fact, Romania did not respect  its commitments and is not a correct economic partner for  Moldova. As far as political aspects are concerned, I do not  even want to talk about them." The declaration was made in the  Russian language, shortly after Andrei Sangheli chaired a  government meeting devoted to the issue of relations with the  CIS. The government spokesman, Ion Rosca, refused to comment on  the Moldovan prime minister's statements.    [Romanian Presidency Spokesman] Traian Chebeleu rejected  Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli's declarations and noted that  "the affirmations do not correspond with reality and I hope  that, through the Romanian Embassy in Chisinau, we will receive  the necessary clarifications on the viewpoints expressed."</p>

No  reason was offered for Han's last-minute withdrawal from the  traveling party, but ministry sources noted that it is likely  related to the increasingly tense situation on the Korean  peninsula.    Han's meeting with his Japanese counterpart Tsutomu Hata,  also scheduled for Thursday, was also canceled, the ministry  said.    Kim will be in Tokyo for a three-day visit beginning  Thursday  to meet with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and then will  travel to China for meetings with Beijing leaders. Talks with  Hosokawa and Chinese leaders are expected to focus on resolving  North Korea's refusal to permit adequate inspections of its  nuclear facilities.</p>

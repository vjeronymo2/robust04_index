			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> RELIEF WORKER KIDNAPED  </P> <P> U.S. officials confirmed that 37-year-old Chris George, of the Westport,  Conn.-based Save the Children Federation, was taken by unknown kidnapers in  Israel's occupied Gaza Strip. The kidnapers apparently demanded Israel release  Palestinian prisoners in exchange for his freedom, Arab reports in Jerusalem  said. Several hours after George's disappearance, the office of the Red Cross  in Gaza received a ransom demand, Palestinian reports said. Some reports said  it came in the form of a written letter in which the kidnapers demanded Israel  release Palestinian detainees.  </P></p>

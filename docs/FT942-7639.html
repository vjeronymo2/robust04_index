			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Moscow plans to cut duties on oil exports by half Russia plans to halve duties on oil exports following Monday's removal of oil export quotas, Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for economics, announced yesterday, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. President Boris Yeltsin is also on the verge of issuing a new decree with detailed instructions enabling the state to sell off bankrupt state-owned enterprises. 'Now we are in a transitional stage when it has become obvious that there are no extravagant measures for stimulating economic growth,' Mr Shokhin said, explaining the flurry of activity after four months of government inaction. 'Now we need painstaking work to create market mechanisms.' The impact of the various measures is likely to be uneven. Foreign oil companies, which have been complaining about high taxation, say that congestion of Russian pipelines and ports means that exports are unlikely to increase substantially in the near future despite a drop in export duties from Ecu30 (Pounds 23) a tonne to Ecu15. But in an area of great importance for ordinary Russians, Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister for privatisation, said separate decrees ushering in measures to regulate financial markets, as well as to combat dishonest advertising by banks and financial companies, were imminent. Mr Shokhin said they might go as far as banning any advertising promising specific dividend payments to small investors, who have been the main victims of extravagant promises in aggressive advertising campaigns. As evidence, however, of the government's tendency for contradictory action, it announced last week that it would tax banks' profits on treasury bill sales at a time when the government is trying to widen their use to cover the budget deficit by non-inflationary methods.</p>

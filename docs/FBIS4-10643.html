			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rafael Nunez] </F>   [Text] About 6,000 members of Democratic Action [AD] have  been expelled from the party after the Sectional Executive  Committees reviewed their cases because they were nominated for  office by other political parties in the last elections held in  December 1993. These former members had publicly criticized the  presidential candidate and the party.    This information was confirmed by official AD sources who  explained that persons who were members of the parliamentary  boards of other political groups were automatically suspended  from membership.    The cases of other persons who campaigned against AD, either  because they were opposed to the present, national leaders of  the party or for other reasons, were turned over to the AD  disciplinary tribunal, with the recommendation that they be  expelled, as agreed to by the National Executive Council early  in 1994.    It was stated on 4 March that, in addition to national AD  leaders affected by this strong action, among whom were Juan  Jose Delpino, Enrique Tejera Paris, Orlando Elbittar, Humberto  D'Ascoli, and Roberto Pocaterra, the extensive list also  included regional AD leaders such as Lucia Barrios de Miraglia,  niece of Gonzalo Barrios, who had been president for life of AD,  and in her own right was former governor of the State of  Portuguesa for AD. The list also included Jose Ignacio Casal,  former minister of development and a former AD senator, and  Marcos Garzon Bolivar, a member of the Legislative Assembly of  the State of Sucre.</p>

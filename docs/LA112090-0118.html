			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPLE GROWERS TO FILE LAWSUIT IN ALAR DISPUTE;  </P> <P> AGRICULTURE: ELEVEN FARMERS WILL SEEK $250 MILLION FROM '60 MINUTES' AND AN  ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP. THEY CHARGE 'PRODUCT DISPARAGEMENT.'  </P> <P> Washington state apple growers said they intend to seek $250 million in damages  from CBS-TV's "60 Minutes" program and the Natural Resources Defense Council,  an environmental group, for "product disparagement" stemming from last year's  controversy over the use of Alar, a growth enhancement chemical, on apples.  </P> <P> The Alar Class Action Committee, a coalition of growers, said it will file a  lawsuit in Yakima County Superior Court on or before Nov. 30 charging that the  NRDC used "bogus" information to create a hysteria about red apples last year.  </P> <P> The NRDC published a study last year entitled "Intolerable Risk: Pesticides in  Our Children's Food." In publicizing the report, the NRDC and a  Washington-based public relations firm, Fenton Communications Inc., focused on  the use of Alar, which in some cases is a suspected carcinogen.  </P> <P> News of the study, which claimed that children are at a heightened risk of  cancer from pesticide residues in produce, first aired on "60 Minutes" in  February, 1989.  </P> <P> "As apple growers, we suffered tremendous losses (because of) unscientific and  unfounded information," said Robert Brody, a Wenatchee, Wash., apple grower who  is one of 11 plaintiffs in the planned suit. "Extremists such as NRDC . . . are  telling the American public that the farmer today is poisoning the food supply.  We want to stop that crap."  </P> <P> Industry estimates place 1989 losses to growers from consumer resistance to  fresh apples at $150 million. Processors of juice and other apple products also  lost another $100 million, the growers claim.  </P> <P> Roy Burnett, a press representative for "60 Minutes" in New York, said: "We  stand by our report." He declined to discuss the growers' specific complaints.  Al Meyerhoff, a San Francisco-based attorney for the NRDC, said that the group  had little to say until the growers' suit is actually filed.  </P> <P> Food industry scientists charged that the NRDC study was not scrutinized by  outside experts before publication and that it exaggerated cancer risks and  embellished worst-case scenarios.  </P> <P> David Fenton, president of Fenton Communications Inc., said that the NRDC  report did undergo a peer review process and that "apple growers knew for years  that Alar was dangerous."  </P> <P> Alar was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 1989 by its manufacturer,  Uniroyal Chemical Co. Inc., after the federal Environmental Protection Agency  announced a proposed ban of the compound.  </P></p>

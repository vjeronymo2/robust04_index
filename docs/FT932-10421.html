			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Test case decision gives guidance to trustees - A ruling with wide ramifications THE LEGAL system and ICI have shown just how adroit they can be in the face of law which, if left unchanged, would produce results having little relation to common sense. The problem arose from the demerger of ICI and a subsidiary called Zeneca - a deal which gave trustees everywhere headaches (as I reported on March 6). ICI funded a test case which was started by originating summons on April 8. A decision was given on Friday April 30, distinguishing the ICI de-merger from previous cases. As a result, the Zeneca shares are now to be treated as capital, not income. This has particular relevance for trustees who are obliged under the terms of their trust to pay out all income to income beneficiaries. This decision is sensible, both for trust and tax reasons. It has been based on what the judge called a 'highly formalistic' distinction between previous cases involving distribution of profits by way of a dividend in specie, and the proposed ICI/Zeneca demerger, which is to be regarded as a 'hybrid' involving a dividend in specie and a capitalisation. The details of this hybrid demerger are these. ICI is planning to separate its bio-science activities from its traditional chemical operations. At the moment, all the bio-science activities are concentrated in a subsidiary of ICI called Zeneca Ltd. Assuming the demerger is approved by shareholders, ICI will declare a substantial dividend, which will be satisfied by the transfer of the shares in Zeneca Ltd to a new company called Zeneca Group Plc. The latter will then issue shares in itself to all the ICI shareholders. The value of the ICI shares will drop by about half, but will be compensated-for by the issue of shares in Zeneca equal to the difference. In the case of trustees, where one set of beneficiaries is entitled to the income of the trust and another is ultimately entitled to the capital, the fall in value of ICI shares (which are part of the capital of the trust fund) would not be compensated-for by the issue of shares in Zeneca if the shares in the latter had to be treated as income and paid out to the income beneficiary. The only way trustees could protect themselves in such a case from a potential claim for breach of trust would be for them to sell their ICI shares before demerger. The sale proceeds could be retained as capital, although it might trigger an unwanted tax charge. Not only would the requirement to pass Zeneca shares to the income beneficiary seem ludicrous from a common sense point of view, it would also result in some very peculiar tax consequences as outlined in my earlier article. For these reasons, the judge has bent over backwards, despite a long line of decided cases, to decide that the issue of the Zeneca Group Plc shares to the ICI shareholders will be treated as capital and, therefore, must be added to the trust fund and not paid out as income to the income beneficiary. The case before the courts concerned Dora Lee, who died in 1966. She left her shareholding in a family company to her husband, William, for his lifetime and thereafter to her son, Michael. In 1972, the shareholding was acquired by ICI in exchange for ICI shares. The trustees never sold or diversified away from their ICI holding, and the trust fund stake in ICI was worth about Pounds 500,000 in April 1993. So, it was of great importance to the trustees of Mrs Lee's will trust to know if they should distribute the Zeneca shares (expected to be worth around Pounds 250,000) to William Lee; keep them as part of the trust fund for Michael; or sell them. It was obviously not Mrs Lee's intention to give her husband half the value of her share portfolio. She wanted her husband to have only the income - eg, normal dividends - from the trust for his life, and the share portfolio preserved intact for her son. There have been many cases, dating back to the 19th century, which have decided that all distributions, including dividends in specie, are income unless the distribution is part of an authorised reduction in capital or the company is in liquidation. But the judge distinguished this case from these earlier ones on the basis that this was a more complicated demerger involving a third party, Zeneca, and not a straightforward de-merger with a dividend in specie. He appreciated that the corporate distinction was absurd and 'not an attractive basis on which to place any reliance. It is highly formalistic . . . but to regard the ICI transaction as a distribution of profits akin to payment of a dividend in specie - and, hence, income - would be to exalt company form over commercial substance to an unacceptable extent.' This is good news for the trustee shareholders of ICI shares, but whether it can be applied to other 'hybrid' de-mergers is debatable. It certainly does not help straightforward demergers by dividend in specie. We are, therefore, left with a technical distinction between two types of demerger - at least until such time as a judge in a higher court is able to overturn some of the more out-moded judgments.

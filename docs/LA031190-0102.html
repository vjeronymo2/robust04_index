			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EQUITY SHARING ADVICE  </P> <P> The article by Robert J. Bruss, "Home Equity Sharing Benefits Owner, Renter"  (Feb. 25), was excellent, with one notable exception: the negative statement  about the problem arising when the resident co-owner stops making the monthly  payments.  </P> <P> In the real estate investors program, we call the co-owners the "buyer" and  "investor."  </P> <P> The buyers start with no equity and earn their 50% share of the equity increase  over five years or 60 payments. If they default or have to move before five  years, their share is prorated. Therefore, even in a default the buyers don't  lose everything.  </P> <P> We establish an open holding escrow to collect the monthly payments including a  requirement of depositing one month payment in advance. The holding escrow also  retains a signed grant deed from the buyer to the investor. If a problem is  developing, the escrow officer will know one month before that payment is due.  </P> <P> HERMAN W.

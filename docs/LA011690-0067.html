			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAPITALS FIRE MURRAY AS COACH, REPLACE HIM WITH HIS BROTHER  </P> <P> Bryan Murray, who had the longest tenure of any current coach in the NHL, was  fired Monday by the Washington Capitals and replaced by his brother, Terry  Murray.  </P> <P> Capital General Manager David Poile said there was a long pause on the  telephone when he offered the job to Terry Murray.  </P> <P> "I'm sure he was hoping for a better time or better circumstances for when he  was going to get the job," Poile said. "But he said to me, 'This is what I've  been preparing my hockey career for and yes, I'll accept the job.' I know he is  disappointed that he is replacing his brother. But I didn't get rid of Bryan  because he was a bad person or a bad coach. I did it because the team needs a  change."  </P> <P> Terry Murray, 39, has been coach of the Capitals' American Hockey League  affiliate Baltimore Skipjacks for the past two seasons. He was with the  Skipjacks in Ontario Monday night, but Poile said Terry would travel back to  Maryland in time for the Capitals' practice today. Washington plays host to New  Jersey tonight.  </P> <P> Bryan Murray had coached the Capitals since November of 1981, leading them to  the playoffs seven times. The Capitals finished first in the Patrick Division  last season with 92 points, but lost to Philadelphia in the division  semifinals.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed for myself," Bryan Murray said, "but I'm happy for Terry."  </P> <P> Poile said he told Bryan Murray of the decision at practice.  </P> <P> "The contributions of Bryan Murray to this organization have been as much or as  many as any other person or player who has ever played or been a part of this  organization," Poile said.  </P> <P> "There's no doubt in my mind that Bryan Murray will be a coach in the National  Hockey League, and probably very soon," Poile said.  </P> <P> Bryan Murray's career record is 343-246-83. This season, the Capitals (18-24-4)  have lost eight consecutive games and are last place in the Patrick Division.  </P></p>

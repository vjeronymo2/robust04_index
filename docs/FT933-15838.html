			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Date set for Christchurch by-election THE GOVERNMENT is today expected to set July 29 as the date for the Christchurch by-election, ending speculation they could seek to delay the poll until September. The main focus of the contest - caused by the death of Mr Robert Adley, the veteran Tory rail rebel - will be Mr Robert Hayward's efforts to defend a Conservative majority of 23,000 against a strong Liberal Democrat challenge. The former Tory MP for Kingswood, who lost his seat in last year's general election, was selected as the Tory candidate last month.</p>

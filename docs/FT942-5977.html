			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Strike vote by Railtrack union Signal staff members of the Rail Maritime Transport union employed by Railtrack voted four-to-one yesterday in favour of strike action in a dispute over pay. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said that he would seek urgent talks with Railtrack management in an effort to resolve the dispute. He said: 'Railtrack need to sit up and take notice of the long-standing crisis of low pay within the signalling grades.' Railtrack said last night that it was 'very disappointed' by the ballot result.</p>

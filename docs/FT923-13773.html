			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Dollars 160m Saudi sale savages silver THE NATIONAL Commercial Bank of Jeddah has once again stolen the headlines in the London bullion market - this time with a huge sale of silver. The private Saudi Arabian bank, which has close links with the royal family, is thought by some traders to have sold between 40m and 50m troy ounces, or 1,244 tonnes, worth Dollars 160m in two hours on Tuesday. Only such an amount could have knocked the price from Dollars 4.06 an ounce down to the year's low of Dollars 3.82, they argue. The bank itself denies that it sold so much. An NCB official told Reuters on Wednesday that the sale was less than 20m ounces and was 'a purely commercial transaction' on behalf of big Saudi clients. However, traders immediately linked the sale with the announcement of the resignation of Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, the bank's deputy general manager and chief operating officer. He was indicted in the US last week on charges related to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Sheikh Khalid has described the charges as 'completely unwarranted and without justification.' Separately, it emerged on Thursday that he had been fined Dollars 170m by the US Federal Reserve Board for violations of US banking law. Dealers were quick to point out that, as one put it, this week's sale 'fits the fine.' Analysts believe the market will take some time to absorb such an amount of silver, which is equivalent to more than 10 per cent of annual worldwide demand. The metal closed yesterday at 3.94 a troy ounce, down 11 cents on the week having recovered about 50 per cent of Tuesday's fall. Some dealers were surprised yesterday when the price hit a high of Dollars 3.98, pointing out that the Dollars 4 mark was likely to make a tough near-term target. Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, pointed out that the NCB hit the gold market in a similar way in March 1990, selling 100 tonnes and driving the price down by Dollars 20 to Dollars 368 a troy ounce in a few hours. Then the market had reacted similarly, quickly recovering about 50 per cent of the fall as it searched for direction. Gold yesterday moved above Dollars 350 on the London market as speculators tried to push Comex up ahead of yesterday's expiry of August options with a put price at that level. But the London afternoon fix was Dollars 348.70, and the market closed at Dollars 348.45 - still a rise of Dollars 2.45 on the week. Most of that rise was accounted for on Wednesday on relief that the NCB had not sold gold again. Sentiment remains bullish, however, and another test of Dollars 350 cannot be ruled out next week. On the London Metal Exchange most attention has been directed towards the copper market, where the justification for high prices (three-month metal has been trading above Dollars 2,500 a tonne) has been questioned. Sir Derek Birkin, chairman of the RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining group, said in Tokyo on Wednesday that he was surprised by some copper price forecasts as there was no evidence of the recession ending and he thought it unlikely that the metal would reach Dollars 1.50 a lb. Mr Paul Hansen, president of the Highland Valley Copper company in Canada, said there was not enough underlying demand for the market to maintain its momentum. 'North America and Japan are still mired in recession and we really don't see the fundamentals in place at this point.' This week's upward move peaked on Thursday with cash metal closing at Pounds 1,332.50 a tonne in spite of the completion of a new labour contract by Asarco, one of the big US producers, and in spite of the widely expected news of a strike from July 20 at Poland's giant KGHM combine. Yesterday the reaction set in, and cash copper shed Pounds 38 to close at Pounds 1,294.50, down Pounds 18 on the week. Both London's robusta coffee and cocoa prices have moved ahead this week, September coffee closing up Dollars 69 on the week at Dollars 776 a tonne yesterday, and September cocoa up Pounds 24 at a two-month high of Pounds 614 a tonne. Cocoa has risen mainly on the continued absence of sales from countries of origin, particularly the Ivory Coast, which appears to be waiting for the outcome of the Geneva talks on a new international pact. The improvement in coffee appears to be mainly technical, and dealers expect a limited trading range ahead of the next talks on a new coffee pact in London at the end of the month.  ---------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close)  ---------------------------------- tonnes Aluminium  +575  to 1,301,125 Copper     -350  to   262,400 Lead       -200  to   145,400 Nickel     -360  to    25,608 Zinc     +2,050  to   335,300 Tin        +455  to    13,865  ----------------------------------</p>

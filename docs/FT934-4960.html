			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / International Company News: Poland's exporters find a new lease of life - A game plan that plans to create strong Polish-run groups Poland's privatisation process is giving foreign trade companies, a dying breed elsewhere in eastern Europe, a new lease of life. Several of these relics of the former planned economy are beginning to purchase industrial plants and turn themselves into holding companies strong enough to challenge competition from abroad. Elektrim, privatised early last year and performing well on the Warsaw stock exchange (WSE) specialising in power, telecommunications and electrical equipment, is leading the way. Rolimpex, a grain and sugar trader, and Stalexport, which once concentrated on iron ore and steel products, are to be privatised in the new year. They plan to purchase the companies whose foreign trade they once handled. Meanwhile Ciech, the country's oil and chemical products trader with a turnover of 38,500bn zlotys (Dollars 1.9bn) last year and profits of 631.5bn zlotys, has teamed up with private sector partners to establish Chemico, a holding company which plans to buy up important companies in the chemical sector. 'Ciech's financial clout means that integrating its operations with producers should lead to the formation of a very powerful company indeed,' notes a western banker. But he cautions that the skills needed to conduct export and import deals and those needed to restructure and manage production units are very different. 'Failure to recognise that could end in tears,' he adds. For the moment, Mr Andrzej Skowronski, Elektrim's managing director is at the stage of purchasing companies. 'When we were privatised we drew up a shopping list of plants which are important to us and we are acting on that.' Funding is coming from bank loans and cash flow. Elektrim's net profits last year were 317bn zlotys, on sales of 6,421bn zlotys, while for the first nine months of 1993 net earnings totalled 286bn zlotys. Recently, Elektrim, in alliance with the privately owned Export Development Bank (BRE) agreed to pay Dollars 16.8m for an 80 per cent share in the Slaska Fabryka Kabli, beating off a bid for the cable maker from Siemens of Germany. Before that, Elektrim bought a 51 per cent share in the Opolwap lime producer for 51bn zlotys. It is committed to buying the Zalom cable producer in Szczecin. Among Elektrim's sources of funds is the sale of share stakes in companies it owns. Last month, a 15 per cent share of Mostostal SA, purchased in 1991, was sold through the WSE and another tranche is due for sale in the new year. 'As long as we maintain a controlling share I'm happy to sell stock in the companies we own,' Mr Skowronski says. Elektrim is showing interest in Poland's planned Dollars 4bn motorway building programme, which will need cables and lighting equipment, and is ready to support plans by other companies to purchase cement plants. Another route to diversification and expansion has opened up through its telecommunications interests. These have led the company into consortia preparing to bid for Poland's first private television channel. 'They come to us because they need a strong stock market listed company in their ranks,' says Mr Skowronski. The trading companies' motivation to buy state sector plants flowed from a desire to preserve their client base. Elektrim has seen a number of telecommunications plants for which it once conducted foreign trade transactions sold to foreign companies such as AT&amp;T, Siemens and Alcatel. However, Mr Marian Malecki, the managing director at Ciech, recognises that the foreign trade companies building up their holdings must have a strategy which transcends the need to preserve the status quo. Mr Marek Dochnal, a management consultant who is to head Chemico, says the aim is to 'organise Polish companies in such a way as to enable them to compete'. He notes that only the foreign trade companies, with their high earnings and minimal investment needs, are in a position to invest in this way. The game plan is to create strong Polish-run companies, but not to the exclusion of foreign partners. ABB, the Swedish-Swiss group, owns 10 per cent of Elektrim through subsidiaries in Poland and another 10 per cent is held by Italian and Turkish companies.</p>

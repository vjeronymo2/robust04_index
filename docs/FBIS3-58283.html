			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Herbert Kremp commentary: "NATO's Arthur's Round Closes the </F> Window"]    [Text] "We await and welcome the expansion of NATO." This  will be the key phrase at the forthcoming Atlantic alliance  summit in Brussels. But even this phrase, which indicates the  alliance's possible opening toward the East, is not undisputed.  It was not the French or the Germans who voiced doubts, but the  British. During the marathon talks on the communique, which  always precede important conferences, London was worried that  the gradual inclusion of "interested" East European countries  could turn into a slide leading to incalculable risks.    This is, of course, something everybody wants to avoid,  including the U.S., who coined the phrase quoted above. The  Partnership for Peace model, envisaged as a number of bilateral  agreements with the former frontline states of the Warsaw Pact,  is double-edged. It provides for military cooperation that  remains below the threshold of the NATO guarantee for mutual  assistance and does not exclude consultations in the event of a  threat to political independence and security. The states will  not be under the "roof," but under its shadow.    The heads of state and government are highly interested in  including Russia in a comprehensive security structure -- but  not in this specific partnership model. The school of thought  trying to achieve this as well will not succeed. On the other  hand, any signs indicating that Russia is actively excluded from  the European security framework are to be avoided. It is  doubtful whether this will succeed. Russian politics thinks in  conspiratorial ways as a matter of principle -- the changes have  left this unaltered. The fear of being isolated spreads  quickly, and it can be spread quickly -- refusing a visa can be  enough. Following Lithuania's formal application for membership,  Yeltsin once again explicitly warned NATO against "expansion."  His Brussels statement that he would have to "build a Berlin  Wall" on the Russian border, if necessary, has never been denied.    The question, discussed since Travemuende, as to whether the  Partnership for Peace model with bilateral agreements and  operative measures is the final or the starting point for NATO  expansion will not be answered after the summit either. For the  alliance, this process, which goes far beyond the club-like  character of the Cooperation Council, is a great achievement.  But on the other hand, the countries of East Europe know that  there is no alternative to a formal integration into the  alliance and its guarantee of assistance.    The terminally ill Hungarian [Prime Minister] Antall summed  it all up like this: "Yeltsin is ill, Zhirinovksiy is healthy."  Speaking in Brussels in December, Ukraine Chief of Staff Lopata  described Moscow's policy of trying to destabilize his country.  He quoted a proverb: "When it gets cold in Moscow, Kiev  freezes over."    The East Europeans cannot help but be dissatisfied. The  worst thing that could happen to these states is that the past  is continued in a new "intermediate Europe." In Warsaw, Prague,  and Budapest, where all sorts of crises have led to a high level  of clear-sightedness, one speaks of the West's historical and  moral failure. This is also said with a view to the Balkans.  And this has had its effects. Lopata said there are two  schools of thought in Ukraine: One wants to orient itself  toward the West, the other toward Moscow. All the countries in  our eastern vicinity will get to this crossroads tomorrow or the  day after. These states are looking for support from West  Europe and the United States. But their aspirations could well  end in a repetition of old tragedies.    Germany would be involved in this tragedy. For, unless  partnership with NATO can be turned into membership, that is, if  NATO's opening up remains limited and does not offer any real  security, Germany will lose the historic opportunity of being  "surrounded by friends" -- as Volker Ruehe put it -- for the  first time since it became a nation state. Germany would not be  able to push through this vision against its partners' will in  NATO's Arthur's Round. But even Germany does not vehemently  speak out for this opportunity, which is dependent on the given  times and situations, and which, like the "window" with which it  is compared, is already closing again.</p>

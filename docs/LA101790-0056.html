			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CASITAS SPRINGS;  </P> <P> WATER DISTRICT MAY START OWN PROGRAM  </P> <P> County budget cuts that slashed $42,000 from the Ventura County Water  Conservation Management Program have prompted one key water wholesaler to  question whether it should continue to pour money into the program.  </P> <P> Casitas Municipal Water District officials are debating whether to mount a  conservation program for their own customers instead of continuing to  contribute $25,000 to $35,000 annually to the countywide program.  </P> <P> "We only provide 5% of the water in the county, and to fund 25% of the program  seems unfair," said Al Aviles, a Casitas board member.  </P> <P> A meeting will be held Nov. 3 to evaluate the program's goals in light of a  reduced budget that has left it, among other things, one person short of its  expected staff level this year, said Nancy Settle, county Resource Management  Agency planning manager.  </P> <P> "We'll continue, but there are some things we won't be able to do," Settle  said. "Due to the drought condition, it's become even more critical to have an  effective program."  </P> <P> Casitas, Calleguas Municipal Water District and United Water Conservation  District have shared the cost of the public information program with the county  since 1984, although about 30 agencies such as cities and farming organizations  participate in its services.  </P> <P> However, due to the county's inability to put in $42,000 this year, Casitas and  Calleguas have reduced their funding levels from the $35,000 each had  originally budgeted to $28,750. United's officials had already decided not to  put in the full $35,000 because they run their own conservation program.  </P> <P> The county program came out of a 1983 water management plan required by the  state for an $8-million grant to prevent seawater intrusion under the Oxnard  Plain. It meets the state's legal requirements for water purveyors to carry out  such programs by providing water conservation literature, school programs, a  speakers bureau, water efficiency seminars for farmers, landscape water audits  and other services.

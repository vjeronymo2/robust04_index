			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper boosted to 13-month peak Speculative buyers boosted the copper price to a fresh 13-month peak in late London trading yesterday. Copper for delivery in three months touched Dollars 2,078 a tonne, nearly 10 per cent ahead of the price only a week ago. The market also moved into a modest backwardation, where a premium has to be paid for metal for immediate delivery - evidence, according to some analysts, that physical metal is not as freely available as present high stock levels would suggest. Three-month copper earlier closed in London at Dollars 2,056.50 a tonne, up Dollars 29. Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at Merrill Lynch, says in his latest Weekly Futures Report that, 'everyone we speak to wants to buy (copper) at 85 cents a pound (Dollars 1,874 a tonne) which means in reality that prices are most unlikely to move that low'. He says there is evidence that some consumers are giving up just-in-time policies and building modest stocks. And one week of stock held by American and European semi-fabricators would be equivalent to 180,000 tonnes of copper. If end-users also added a week's stock, that would be another 180,000 tonnes. However, Mr Stephen Briggs at Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services, said today's copper price could not be justified by the fundamentals. MMRS forecast a supply deficit of 75,000 tonnes this year following a surplus of 200,000 tonnes in 1993. Next year there would be big increases in copper mine output, a legacy from the last recession when prices also held up reasonably well and encouraged new production. With 456,400 tonnes still in LME stocks, 'consumers don't have to panic'.</p>

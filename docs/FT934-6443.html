			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Benefit fraud 'costs at least Pounds 1bn a year' Fraud is costing the social security system at least Pounds 1bn a year, the Commons public accounts committee said in a report yesterday. Although the number of staff countering crime in the system has increased, the committee says some cases are not being detected and pursued early enough. Criminals engaged in social security fraud make multiple claims for benefit, use false or stolen identity documents, counterfeit them, and break into Post Offices to steal documents. Fraudulent encashment of missing order books alone amounted to Pounds 85m last year. The Department of Social Security calculates that fraud costs the benefits system at least Pounds 1bn a year, while other estimates put the loss at Pounds 2bn or more. But individual fraud by claimants misrepresenting their circumstances accounts for the greater part of the loss. Over the past six years staff fighting organised fraud have increased from 78 to 250. The committee was concerned that, although the cost-effectiveness of the staff could be demonstrated, no further increase was proposed. It urged the department to 'consider the degree of priority they are giving to this work'. The committee said fraud prevention measures had been delayed by difficulties in co-ordinating the large number of social security branches. Mr Michael Bichard, chief executive of the Benefits Agency, said its measures against fraud had saved Pounds 558m last year and led to the prosecution of 6,000 people. He said order books had been redesigned with improved anti-fraud measures and trials of a barcoding system to prevent books being cashed fraudulently were being conducted. 'We are increasingly using information technology to identify criminal activities, prevent fraud and target the available resources more efficiently.' Public Accounts Committee.

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Open season on energy tax SENATORS and lobbyists yesterday jostled to push their preferred form of energy tax after the Clinton administration admitted that its plans to levy a tax on the thermal content of fuels was dead. Suggestions ranged from a transport fuel levy, to a general energy tax based on value, to a far-reaching consumption or value-added tax. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, said the tax details would be worked out with the Senate finance committee. 'I'm confident it will not be based on the British thermal unit,' he said, as the administration had originally proposed. Mr Bentsen, who as former senator for Texas is no stranger to the ways of the petroleum industry, sharply criticised the big oil companies for a lobbying campaign that turned senators from energy states against the BTU tax. 'Special interests did quite a job. . . They had some hired guns that frankly presented some quite distorted figures,' he said in a television interview yesterday. One leading participant in the energy tax debate is Senator John Breaux from the oil-producing state of Louisiana, who yesterday suggested a 7 cents a gallon levy on all transport fuels. The administration has been reluctant to adopt a tax focus-ed purely on transport because of its uneven impact on plains and western states where much longer distances often have to be driven than in the more densely populated east.</p>

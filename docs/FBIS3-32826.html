			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Last night, the IMF exerted pressure on the new  government to eliminate some subsidies, including transportation  subsidies, and it also demanded the establishment of tolls and  an increase in electricity and water rates. The Economic Cabinet  met with IMF representatives last night at the Central Bank of  Honduras offices to compare figures, in what would be a preamble  to the letter of intent that will be signed in March.    On 7 February, the Economic Cabinet announced it would  immediately eliminate all investment, transfer, and current  expenses to reduce the fiscal deficit.    IMF representatives argue, however, this is not enough and  that it is necessary, among other measures, to eliminate  transportation and kerosene subsidies which the government is  absorbing.    The IMF also says tolls should be permanently established to  collect revenues, and the National Enterprise for Electric Power  (ENEE) and the National Autonomous Water and Sewage Service  (SANAA) should increase their rates.    In this give and take situation, the government has said it  would rather seek other revenue sources than to eliminate  transportation subsidies because the people would suffer the  most by having to pay more than one lempira in transportation  fares if these demands were met.    Certain businessmen and economists also believe it is not  appropriate to increase public service rates such as  electricity, first of all because ENEE does not even have the  capacity to meet current energy demands. In fact, electricity is  rationed because of the very low water levels at its main source  of energy, the "Francisco Morazan" or "El Cajon" Hydroelectric  Project.    Regarding the international credit organization's demands,  perhaps the only feasible one right now is that of establishing  tolls.</p>

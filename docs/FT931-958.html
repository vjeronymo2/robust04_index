			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Technology: Some like it very very hot - Worth Watching Scientific experiments do not always produce the expected results. When plant geneticists at Clemson University in South Carolina decided to develop a pepper plant that was resistant to root knot, they also produced pepper that is at least twice as strong as tabasco. But the Charleston Hot, seeds of which will go on sale in the US from Foundation Seeds Incorporated from the autumn, is not the hottest pepper developed, says Philip Dukes, one of the developers of the plant. That dubious claim to fame is held by a Japanese pepper. Foundation Seeds: US, 803 656 2520.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CINEPLEX VEXES MOVIEGOERS WITH PRICE HIKE  </P> <P> Cineplex Odeon Theatres in Los Angeles has raised its ticket prices to $7.50  and ushers may have to ask for combat pay because moviegoers aren't happy about  it.  </P> <P> The financially troubled chain said that increased expenses forced the 50-cent  hike, which began two weeks ago.  </P> <P> The new price has arrived just as patrons are rushing to see summer releases.  </P> <P> "Fifty percent of the people complain. Some of them get angry and ask to see  the manager," said Victor Hahn, who works in the ticket window at the Cineplex  in Universal City. "I'm sure the manager can tell you some pretty unique  stories about it."  </P> <P> Hahn's manager declined to share any war stories. Patrons, however, were quick  to speak up.  </P> <P> "I'm astounded," said Marlene Halsey, who was visiting from Oregon and wanted  to see "Back to the Future Part III." "Where I come from, it's still $5 to go  to the movies."  </P> <P> Other theater chains, which still charge between $5 and $7 in major cities,  said they had no plans to increase ticket prices this summer.  </P> <P> At Cineplex's Universal City and Century City theaters, customers pay the  highest price in town and an additional $2.50 to $3 for parking, making an  evening at the cinema nearly as expensive as box seats at a Dodger game.  </P></p>

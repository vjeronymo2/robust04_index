			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Consumer spending up in November Consumer spending through credit cards was stronger in November than in the same month a year ago, figures from a leading credit card group suggested yesterday, Gillian Tett writes. Data from Barclaycard showed that total spending, in real cash terms, on its cards was 9 per cent higher in November than a year ago, when adjusted for the number of processing days in the month. Spending processed between November 21 and December 2, which is regarded by most retailers as the first two weeks of the crucial pre-Christmas period, was at least 7 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year ago. Total spending through Barclaycard credit cards, which represents slightly more than one-third of total credit card spending, was Pounds 516m between November 21 and December 2 this year, the figures showed. Although the growth may partly reflect an increase in the use of credit cards for making payments, it also suggests that consumer spending last month may have been slightly better than some retailers had expected. In recent months the rate of annual growth in retail spending has slowed slightly.</p>

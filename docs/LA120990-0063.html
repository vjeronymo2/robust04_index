			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SKI THE WORLD'S HIGHEST SLOPE ONLY IF YOU MUST  </P> <P> It's inevitable. Somewhere along the way, every skier is touched by a yearning  to ski the world's highest ski area. Perhaps because there is a love of  superlatives that goes hand in hand with skiing -- the longest run, the  steepest run, the fastest time, the best skiing . . . and the highest ski area.  </P> <P> Though the word highest is terribly overused in the ski world, experts agree  that the true "world's highest ski area" is Chacaltaya, about 35 miles  northeast of La Paz in Bolivia.  </P> <P> Now before you say, "All right, I'm off to add the Chacaltaya patch to my  collection," I'd best explain two things. First, Chacaltaya does not offer the  type of skiing to merit a $900 plane ticket, especially when you think of the  skiing that $900 will buy in the North American Rockies. And second, you must  be a confirmed masochist to want to battle the rarefied air that makes physical  activity difficult and eye-popping headaches a big part of the ski day.  </P> <P> Chacaltaya seems best suited for skiers so obsessed with the unconventional  that they'll put up with any kind of discomfort or inconvenience to find it.  </P> <P> Consider these "qualifications": a summit at about 18,000 feet, 1,000 vertical  feet of ski run, one lift (but no crowds) and a season stretching from December  to March.  </P> <P> If you've ever felt light-headed in the Rockies, imagine how you might feel a  mile higher at 18,000 feet. My ears buzzed. I puffed like a Kenworth going up  the Continental Divide, and I kept popping aspirina to relieve the throbbing  behind my eyes -- the first symptoms of soroche (altitude sickness).  </P> <P> The 1,000-foot ski run actually seemed to be at best 600 feet, though maybe the  altitude or the Coriolis effect skews one's perception of distance. Whatever  the true vertical measurement, it's more than enough to get a good bit of  skiing and also test one's grip on the thin cable tow.  </P> <P> Oddly, the ski season is the same as ours, which is the South American summer.  This is because the run, actually a glacier, is too icy to ski the rest of the  year. Only from December to March does it become soft enough to welcome skiers.  </P> <P> The crown of the area is a chalet, set upon a dizzying ledge. A rock thrown  from there could roll all the way to La Paz. In fact, it's so frightening and  looks so shaky that some skiers refuse to enter. Then again, some skiers don't  even put their skis on when they reach Chacaltaya, asking instead to be taken  immediately back to La Paz. Club Andino, which manages the area, has a truck  ready for this contingency.  </P> <P> Since there are no accommodations at the mountain, the city of La Paz serves as  the resort base. It's something like skiing Alta or Snowbird from Salt Lake  City.  </P> <P> "Is that La Paz down there in that big ditch?" another American asked as we  flew over the city to make our landing.  </P> <P> Yes, that was La Paz. It's a strange sight -- large white buildings and  highways fill the bottom of the canyon. Wretched little shacks attempt to climb  the walls. At nearly 12,000 feet, the city is the second-highest capital in the  world.  </P> <P> The views from Chacaltaya are first-rate. In the south, La Paz can be seen  peaking up from its burrow, white and sparkling. In the north, the Cordillera  Real Mountains cut the stratosphere. You see teardrop lakes hung among the  sharp-edged peaks. To the west, the hazy outline of Lake Titicaca looks  something like a puddle on the gigantic altiplano that stretches for hundreds  of miles between Bolivia and Peru.  </P> <P> The altiplano fills almost all of the mountains' western stage. At 13,000 feet,  it is so dusty and hot-cold that it could probably serve as one of Dante's  circles of hell. Only the toughest Indians live on it. From Chacaltaya, it  looks like a flat raceway for cloud shadows.  </P> <P> The east holds less stark vistas than the altiplano. On clear days, you can see  all the way across the Andean Cordillera to the Amazon Basin. That verdant  horizon is where the country's notorious cocaine industry flourishes.  </P> <P> Club Andino offers daily bus service to Chacaltaya, leaving at 8:30 a.m. from  the club office at Avenida Mexico 1638 in La Paz. The office opens at 8 a.m.  </P> <P> On our way to Chacaltaya in the Club Andino microbus, the trip leader talked  about the skiing to come. He said that the run would be frozen solid when we  arrived in the morning, but would soften to a very pleasant consistency by  noon.  </P> <P> First we had to get to the area, though, and at the rate we were going, it  seemed like our group of eight, most of us foreigners, would be lucky to arrive  by noon.  </P> <P> Once out of the La Paz canyon, the road goes from asphalt to dust -- that's  dust, not dirt. In one place it came up to the wheel hubs. This continued until  the final ascent up Mt. Chacaltaya, where the dust changed to rocks the size of  bowling balls. I felt sorry for the straining vehicle.  </P> <P> When we finally reached the chalet, after a road trip of 1 1/2 hours that  seemed more like 3 1/2, the first thing we did was shake some of the dirt out  of our clothes.  </P> <P> After that I walked into the shaky chalet, examined the Zermatt and Davos ski  posters and searched out water to wash down two aspirin. Our trip leader  inquired about cranking up the cable tow.  </P> <P> The run is close by the chalet. It's a slightly doglegged swath of snow that is  narrowest at the top and widest in the middle, where it bends to the left. It  ends abruptly in a stack of brown rocks. The run is lined with similar rocks  from top to bottom. No enchanted forests up there.  </P> <P> The first step on the slope revealed the unusual nature of Bolivian snow. It  was like a big carpet of Styrofoam, decorated with the little ripples and lumps  that are God-given parts of glaciers. Slope grooming is an unknown practice  here.  </P> <P> I couldn't tell whether it was just me or the dull Club Andino rental skis, but  I couldn't carve a turn on that styrosnow. It's comparable to skiing what is  called "breakable crust" at other ski venues. I had a hard time controlling my  direction and speed, both vital on a rock-lined run. In time, I learned that it  was best to hold a tight line down the middle, where the two dozen weekly  skiers had etched a fairly hospitable path.  </P> <P> It must be reported that the run never reached the soft, pleasant condition  that the trip leader had promised.  </P> <P> Then again, maybe we didn't stay long enough. After two hours, most everyone  had had their fill. I had a painful soroche headache and was more than willing  to stop.  </P> <P> The group sentiment was unanimous: "Vamos a La Paz ahorita!"  </P> <P> The descending microbus was quickly transformed into an ambulance for sick and  exhausted skiers. Few words were spoken. I thought of the old saying about ski  areas: "You have to ski it to believe it." This does not quite apply to  Chacaltaya. After skiing it, I still couldn't believe it.  </P></p>

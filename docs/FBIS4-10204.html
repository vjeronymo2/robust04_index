			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 7 Apr (AFP) -- This Thursday, Fabio  Herrera, Dominican deputy secretary of state of foreign  relations, described the letter by 48 U.S. legislators urging  President Joaquin Balaguer to prevent the UN and OAS embargo  against the Haitian military regime from being violated as a  "verbal threat." The Dominican Republic and Haiti share the  Caribbean island of Hispaniola.    Herrera "categorically" rejected the terms used in the  letter  and suggested that "Dominican political sectors" whom he did not  identify could be behind the note. He did clarify, however,  that the opposition candidates preparing to participate in the  10 May elections are not behind the letter. He indicated that  the language used in the note "seems to be more political  because these are not diplomats making the demand but pressure  groups resorting to any language."    The deputy foreign minister indicated that the letter's tone  "is not that which is normally used in diplomatic relations  between the Dominican Republic and the United States, which are  generally conveyed through the U.S. Embassy." The letter said  "it would be tragic if our productive and friendly relations  were undermined by your government's lack of willingness or  inability to fully implement the embargo against Haiti."    The U.S. legislators stated contraband gasoline is moving  from the Dominican Republic to Haiti, and they said that "fuel  is being taken across the border by hand and in boats and  trucks." The legislators' note also states that amount of fuel  crossing the border has increased "despite the embargo."    This Thursday in Caracas, Claudette Werleigh, foreign  minister of deposed President Jean Bertrand Aristide, stated  nearly 2,000 gallons of gasoline cross the Dominican-Haitian  land border every day. The gasoline is later sold on the  Haitian "black market" at prices ranging from $15 to $18 per  liter. The Dominican press has consistently reported, even with  photographs, this fuel operation shows coordinated activity  between both countries' militaries.    In one of the note's most aggressive passages, the U.S.  legislators indicate that "this flagrant, massive violation of  the embargo cannot be condoned." They stress to Balaguer that it  is "imperative that your country end the Haitian embargo  violation. These violations undermine international efforts to  isolate the coupist regime and pressure it into reestablishing  President Aristide's elected civilian government." The  signatories are all members of President Bill Clinton's  Democratic party. Heading the list is Joseph Kennedy II, a  member of the famous U.S. dynasty.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Siegmar Schelling, Heinz Vielain report: "New Dispute in </F> the SPD Over Scharping and Election Program"]    [Text] Bonn -- Following the withdrawal of Christoph  Zoepel, a member of the Presidium of the Social Democratic Party  of Germany [SPD], from the election campaign team, SPD Chairman  Rudolf Scharping and the party leadership are facing serious  conflicts.    On Monday [2 May] the draft of the SPD government program  was  to have been finally adopted by the party's Executive Committee.  According to information received by WELT AM SONNTAG, it is  doubtful following Zoepel's departure whether a final decision  can be made.    An SPD spokesman told WELT AM SONNTAG on Saturday: "The  meeting is scheduled to start at 1300. What will happen then is  not clear." A member of the Executive Committee stated: "A  quarrel with a great deal of saber rattling is threatening to  erupt." It has also become known that a meeting of the  Presidium is to be convened. The SPD government program is to  be officially adopted at the federal conference in Halle on 22  June.    SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping, who was in Paris over the  weekend, stressed that, after the resignation of Zoepel, who was  responsible for transportation and housing in the shadow  cabinet, Scharping sees "no reason whatsoever for changing our  position." Concerning Zoepel's departure from the commission,  which has ended its work, "no reasons referring to the contents  are discernible." "There has never been a single contentious  issue" within the commission regarding environmental policies.    Zoepel naturally sees things differently. In a personal  letter to Scharping on Friday, he cited "differing views on the  work style and the task of the commission responsible for the  government program," which have led to "misunderstandings  between you and me that cannot be settled" as the reason for his  step. Moreover, there is apparently a conflict between the  position advocated by Scharping on traffic issues and the  "credibility of the work that I have done so far, which makes it  impossible for me to represent the SPD."    According to information received by WELT AM SONNTAG,  Scharping and Zoepel quarreled vehemently as early as last  Monday at the Presidium session. The cause of the dispute was a  speed limit demanded by Zoepel. Scharping, however, only agreed  to a speed limit without a specific ceiling. Also, Zoepel  criticized Scharping's style of leadership.    The manager of the SPD Bundestag Group, Struck, called for  party unity on Saturday. The public debate about the government  program was "annoying." He described Zoepel's step as  "regrettable" and an "overreaction."    WELT AM SONNTAG learned that the presentation of the spring  report by the economic research institutes, which predicted a  growth of 1.5 percent, had caused considerable unease among the  party's left wing. They insist on the inclusion of more  specific social regulations in the SPD government program, which  should be financed through additional burdens on the top third  of tax-payers -- in the form of higher energy taxes, a surcharge  on the financial assets of private households, and higher  taxation of the increase in the value of immovable property.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie climbs away from 3,000 LONDON joined in the strong rebound in European stock markets yesterday, which welcomed the calmer news from Russia, and the Footsie ended convincingly above 3,000 for the first time in a fortnight. Calls for interest rate cuts from Sir Leon Brittan, chief EC trade negotiator, found a ready response in the stock market, and a strong opening to the new Wall Street session gave further encouragement. Equities were easier at first and the Footsie 3,000 mark came in for another testing in early trade. But once the December futures contract on the Footsie opened at a strong premium, the direction of the stock market was never in doubt. The pace of the advance was dictated throughout by the December contract but its premium of 36 against the underlying equity market ensured a sound stock market. Dealers in both equities and futures agreed that it was the strength of the German stock market which lay behind London's rise. At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index was 21.1 up at 3,026.3, just under the best of the day. Trading volume was slow at first but picked up as investors gained confidence. The day's Seaq total of 540.9m shares compared with 527.3m on Friday, when retail business worth Pounds 1.46bn maintained the improvement in turnover volumes achieved this year. Arbitraging between the December future and the underlying stocks returned the focus to the blue chip issues. Consequently, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, up 5.2 at 3,437.1, saw less activity than in recent sessions. Firmness in government bonds ahead of tomorrow's auction of Pounds 3.25bn securities and also in sterling fuelled hopes of a cut in domestic base rates, perhaps around the time of the annual conference of the governing Conservative party. Optimistic views on the outlook for corporate profits from two leading UK securities houses also helped sentiment. Shares in Grand Metropolitan, the brewery and hotels group, closed higher despite the market's slightly cautious reception of its latest trading statement. The Footsie Index benefited from strong gains in leading oil shares as the meeting of Opec ministers in Geneva got under way. But the pharmaceuticals sector lagged behind both London and New York as the less positive trend in the US dollar helped unsettle share prices. The renewed hopes that base rate cuts might not be too far away brought firmness in bank shares, where lower interest rates would ease the burden of bad debts. Similar factors helped the consumer retail sector, which will be featured this week by boardroom statements from two leading names. Some building and construction stocks also responded to base rate optimism. Traders noted that trading volume in the futures market, where the big securities firms often re-position themselves before buying the underlying stocks, had been high yesterday. If the institutions have turned more optimistic towards UK equities, then traders would expect to see this reflected in higher Seaq trading figures later this week. Equity strategists, favourably impressed by the stock market's resilience in the face of the potentially disturbing developments in Russia, now hope for an improvement in the trend of corporate results from British companies.</p>

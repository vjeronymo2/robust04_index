EPA is adopting this policy to concentrate on food additive regulations currently in force which are inconsistent with the Delaney Clause and to avoid expending EPA resources on action which may be revised once various policy issues are resolved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  April 6, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Tina E.

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> EPA's regulations regarding FIFRA registration in 40 CFR 152.112(g) require that all needed tolerances for pesticide residues in food be in place prior to the approval of a FIFRA registration for the use of a pesticide which will result in such residues. Raw food tolerances for pesticides are established under section 408 of FFDCA, 21 U.S.C. 346a, and tolerances for certain processed foods and for feed additives (``food additive regulations'') for pesticides are established under FFDCA section 409, 21 U.S.C. 348. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's current policy is that a food additive regulation is needed when there is a possibility that the processing of a raw food containing pesticide residues would result in residues in the processed food or in animal feed at a level greater than the raw food tolerance. EPA determines whether there is such a possibility based on the review of processing data supplied by the applicant for registration purposes or the petitioner for a tolerance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 409, a food additive regulation for a pesticide residue may not be promulgated if EPA concludes that the pesticide ``induces cancer'' in man or animal as specified in the Delaney Clause. 21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3). In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Les v. Reilly <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the Delaney Clause barred the establishment of a food additive regulation for any pesticide that meets the induce-cancer standard no matter how infinitesimal the risk, 968 F.2d 985 (9th Cir. 1992),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> cert. denied <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 113 S. Ct. 1361 (1993). The court overturned EPA's interpretation of the Delaney Clause as subject to an exception for pesticide residues which pose a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  risk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIFRA and section 408 of the FFDCA contain no Delaney Clause and instead require consideration of both risks and benefits in making regulatory decisions. Thus, pesticide uses which might qualify under the standards for registration and a section 408 tolerance could still fail to meet the standard for a food additive regulation under section 409. Where that is the case, and a section 409 food additive regulation is needed, EPA regulations state that a FIFRA registration may not be granted, and it is EPA policy not to approve a section 408 tolerance for such a use either.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the wake of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Les v. Reilly <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the National Food Processors Association (NFPA) and other food processing and production groups have petitioned EPA to change its policy linking actions under section 408 (raw food) and section 409 (processed food). Such a change in policy would require EPA to amend its regulations concerning the registration requirement that all needed section 409 food additive regulations be in place. Additionally, the NFPA petition challenges the factual basis for EPA's conclusion that processing studies are an accurate measure of whether processed foods will contain pesticide residues greater than the section 408 tolerance and thus need a section 409 tolerance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the NFPA petition, EPA has published for public comment a notice (``NFPA petition notice'') summarizing the petition and current EPA policies and procedures that are potentially affected by issues raised in the NFPA petition, including EPA's procedures for determining when a 409 food additive regulation is needed and EPA's policy of coordinating the decision on the 408 tolerance and registration with the 409 food additive regulation (58 FR 7473, Feb. 5, 1993). Further, EPA also has released, on Febrary 2, 1993, a list of 32 pesticides that either have or need section 409 food additive regulations under EPA's policy and that also appear to induce cancer within the meaning of the Delaney Clause. EPA intends to update this list periodically. Although EPA has not made a formal ``induces cancer'' finding for many of these pesticides, EPA currently believes that most, if not all, of the pesticides classified in Group A, B, or C according to EPA's Cancer Assessment Guidelines will come within the Delaney Clause standard. EPA places a high priority on responding to the legal, policy, science, and factual issues raised by the NFPA petition and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Les v. Reilly <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision. However, these issues are both complex and interrelated and cannot be addressed quickly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Reasons for Policy on Tolerance Petitions and Registration Actions Affected by Delaney Clause <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is adopting this policy at the present time as part of the priorities it has established following the decision in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Les v. Reilly <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Les v. Reilly <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision clearly established that the Delaney Clause bars the existence of a food additive regulation for any pesticide that induces cancer in man or animal. EPA has determined that there presently exist as many as 50 food additive regulations for pesticides that may meet the induce-cancer standard. EPA's first priority, thus, following the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Les v. Reilly <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision is to determine which of these regulations must be revoked and to do so promptly. Because food additive regulations are only established in situations where EPA believes they are needed to prevent the adulteration of food, EPA's second priority will be to determine what action should be taken, if any, against the FIFRA registrations and section 408 tolerances which are associated with the food additive regulations to be revoked. This issue has been made more complex, as explained above, by the NFPA petition which challenges EPA's existing policies on this matter. Finally, EPA's third priority is to address the many petitions for establishing food additive regulations which raise Delaney Clause problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ideally, EPA would prefer to address simultaneously all pending petitions to establish food additive regulations and all existing food additive regulations which are inconsistent with the Delaney Clause. EPA, however, has limited resources. EPA estimates that in the next several months it will initiate revocation actions against over 25 food additive regulations based on the Delaney Clause. EPA will also have to resolve what policy to follow on the associated section 408 tolerances and registrations and implement those actions as well. This could result in EPA action against 80 or more pesticide uses. Aggressively moving to deny pending applications which raise Delaney Clause problems could exhaust EPA's limited resources on pesticide uses not on the market while tolerances inconsistent with the statute remain in place. Finally, EPA also must take into account that it receives thousands of registration and tolerance actions each year. Devoting substantial resources to petitions raising Delaney Clause issues will delay action on the more routine actions. This is especially the case where EPA has not yet resolved the important policy issues relating to the interrelationship of section 409 food additive regulations and section 408 tolerances and FIFRA registrations because actions taken today might have to be revised if EPA policies are altered. EPA will reexamine this policy once it has resolved the policy issues raised by the NFPA petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA will temporarily stop all review and processing work related to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> establishing <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a registration and/or tolerance(s) for any chemical/crop combination in which: (1) either the chemical has been found to induce cancer in man or animal or the chemical has shown evidence of carcinogenicity in animals or humans; and (2) the pesticide residue in or on a raw agricultural commodity concentrates when that commodity is processed or EPA otherwise determines that a food additive regulation is needed for the use. This will include any work on registrations under FIFRA section 3, experimental use permits under FIFRA section 5, associated tolerances under section 408 of the FFDCA, as well as food additive regulations under section 409 of the FFDCA. Work on tolerances and registrations for other uses of the chemical, where a food additive regulation is not needed, may continue. However, EPA approves or denies tolerance petitions in toto. Therefore, if a petition seeks a tolerance for any residue that appears subject to the Delaney Clause, that petition cannot be approved and work on all tolerances in that petition will temporarily stop. The Agency advises any person who has submitted a pending tolerance petition containing a tolerance that appears to be subject to the Delaney Clause to amend the petition to separate the tolerances not affected by the Delaney Clause so that work on these tolerances may resume.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will also disapprove any State registrations approved under section 24 of FIFRA if the registration depends on the existence of a food additive regulation that is subject to revocation under the Delaney Clause. The basis of such disapproval would be that the registration is ``inconsistent with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,'' FIFRA sec. 24(c)(3). States are urged not to approve such section 24(c) registrations, since State approval followed within 90 days by EPA disapproval will be disruptive and cause unncessary economic burdens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Implementation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Once the determination has been made that a pesticide use may result in a residue that appears to be subject to the Delaney Clause, the PM will notify the applicant or petitioner in writing of the status of the tolerance petition and associated application(s), i.e., that all review and processing work has been stopped and the reason for this action. These registrations and petitions will continue to be considered pending; EPA is not denying these registrations and petitions. If a registrant wishes to amend the tolerance petition after such notification to allow work to continue on uses not affected by the Delaney Clause, such an amendment may be submitted to the PM by the usual procedure. The tolerance petitions or registration applications will not be returned to the registrant or subject to any ``abandoned petition'' policy unless EPA, in the future, prescribes some further action that registrants must respond to affirmatively within a set time period. EPA will notify applicants and petitioners if and when the the Agency resumes review and processing of a petition and associated registration applications on which review was stopped under this policy. Such notice may be by letter, or by issuance of a policy notice or rule in which implementation is addressed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes its limited resources are best directed at first removing regulations inconsistent with the statute and EPA policies and then making final determinations on petitions which, because they meet the above criteria, are likely to be denied. To the extent, however, that a petitioner believes that EPA has wrongly characterized its petition as meeting the criteria or that there exists some other basis for granting the petition, EPA will, on a case-by-case basis, consistent with its obligation to protect the public health, adjust its priorities so that a formal action can be taken on the petition. In addition, EPA will give any petitioner a denial, if that is requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 60 actions currently in review that EPA believes are subject to this policy. EPA will begin sending individual notices to registrants and petitioners within 30 days of this notice and expects to complete notification within 90 days. A registrant who receives no notification may assume that petitions and application actions continue in active review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This policy does not affect the registration of new products or new uses which have an associated 409 tolerance that has already been established even if, under the Delaney Clause, that tolerance would not now be granted. However, EPA intends to revoke such tolerances in the future, and will, after revocation, immediately stop review and processing of additional pending actions dependent on the tolerance at that time. Registrants who intend to submit new registration applications under these circumstances may wish to await further Agency action before submitting applications that may be affected by such revocations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A final decision on whether to approve or deny the tolerance petitions and associated FIFRA applications that appear to be subject to the Delaney Clause must await resolution of the complex, interrelated issues raised in the NFPA petition and summarized above and will be staggered in such a manner so as to conserve resources for addressing currently approved food additive regulations, tolerances, and registrations. Some of these issues may be addressed by pending legislation. In the absence of such legislative changes, EPA does not believe that most of the issues will be addressed until later this year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Agricultural commodities, Food and feed additives, Pesticides and pests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: March 21, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Susan H.

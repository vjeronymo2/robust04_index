			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marta Stolarova: "It Is Possible To Capitalize </F> Russian Debts"]    [Text] "We have worked out all of the possible  alternatives, with the proviso that, if a solution in the form  of deliveries of goods, capitalization, or barter operations  fails, we would, in any case, pay our debt in freely convertible  currency. The Czech side is thus being offered a wide range of  promising opportunities, and we have naturally pledged our  support to the accepted projects in every way." That is what  the deputy finance minister of the Russian Federation, who had  dealings in Prague regarding the repayment of the Russian debt  to the Czech Republic, said yesterday in an exclusive interview  for HOSPODARSKE NOVINY and Russian Television. "The Russian side  has kept all of its promises. I have been empowered to sign the  treaty in Prague. However, the treaty still has to undergo a  certain approval procedure," he added.    When asked what portion of the liabilities could be  capitalized, A. Vavilov replied that a large part of the debt  qualifies for this solution, such as balance in transferable  rubles and a part of other types of debt. "We assume that  mainly the part of the debt that arose during trade exchange  could be resolved in this form, but there is nothing on our side  to prevent us from compensating the debt we have in free [volny]  currencies in this way, too."    We were interested in whether there was already a list of  appropriate enterprises. On this subject, Vavilov said that the  State Property Committee of the Russian Federation  (Goskomimushchestvo) was engaged in great activity in  cooperation with Czech partners. "Works continue, but we would  like to see them progress faster," he said.    In connection with the planned capitalization of claims, he  pointed to Russia's efforts to create more favorable conditions  for foreign investments. He mentioned the set of President  Yeltsin's decrees on profit taxing in enterprises with foreign  property participation. If the foreign capital share exceeds 30  percent and the overall investment exceeds 200 million rubles,  the enterprise does not have to pay taxes for two years and pays  only 25 percent of taxes in the third year and one-half in the  fourth; only in the fifth year does it pay a full federal rate.  According to the deputy minister, it is possible to expect that  regional authorities, too, will adopt similar conditions to  attract foreign capital.    When asked by Russian television for which side the  initialed  treaty was more advantageous, Vavilov replied that "if it is  initialed, it is anticipated that it is mutually beneficial;  however, in case of debts, the situation is complicated." He  admitted that, in any case, both the creditor and the debtor  will get a clearer idea from the schedule of installments. "All  of the agreements on restructuring its debt signed by the  Russian Federation in the two most recent years are being  precisely met. Debts of the former USSR are an exception and are  the subject of regular discussion with the Paris Club, the  London Club, and other creditors."    Russia is also an important creditor of a number of  developing countries. The overall sum of its claims is  difficult to determine precisely (estimate runs over $100  billion) and realizing these assets is very difficult," Deputy  Minister Vavilov said. "Specifically, in the agreement (with the  Czech Republic), we are counting on the possibility of barter  operations--that is, with swapping Russian assets in certain  countries for the debt in the Czech Republic, which is currently  negotiating its claims with, for instance, Asian debtor  countries. Here, too, it is likely that we will find mutually  acceptable alternative solutions," the Russian representative  said.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> TINLEY WINS TRIATHLON AT MISSION VIEJO  </P> <P> One way to win a race is to make sure the only race is behind you, which is  what Scott Tinley did Sunday in the Orange County Performing Arts Center  Triathlon.  </P> <P> "My whole tactic was out of sight, out of mind," Tinley said.  </P> <P> Tinley of Encinitas came out of the water of Lake Mission Viejo in third place  after the 1,500-meter swim, bolted to the lead in a pack of three in the first  mile of the 40-kilometer bike ride and pulled away by the midway point.  </P> <P> He was soon out of sight, and on the way to victory in 1 hour 54 minutes 14  seconds, finishing more than three minutes ahead of Emilio DeSoto of San Diego  for his third victory in the triathlon's four-year history. His only loss was  last year, to Scott Molina of Boulder, Colo.  </P> <P> In the women's race, Laurie Samuelson, 33, of Carlsbad, opened up a lead of as  much as a mile on the bike ride, and never let up, winning in 2:13.37, 49  seconds ahead of Sue Latshaw, 28, a plant pathologist from Berkeley who won the  first triathlon she entered in 1986. Melissa Mantak, 27, of Denver was third,  31 seconds behind Latshaw.  </P> <P> In Tinley's wake, 43-year-old Bill Leach of Irvine dueled Peter Kain, 25, of  Los Gatos. After negotiating the hills and turns of a course he called his  "home-court," Leach pulled into the transition area, second among more than  1,500 entrants.  </P> <P> Bryan Murchison, 27, of Denver, ran down Kain for third. Kain finished fifth,  and Leach finished eighth, one place and 51 seconds out of the money.  </P></p>

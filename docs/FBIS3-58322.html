			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Rowan Dore and Alison Little, PRESS ASSOCIATION </F> parliamentary staff]    [Text] The Government today insisted Britain will continue  to provide support for the United Nations Bosnia relief  operation throughout the winter, just hours after Nato adopted a  new plan for selective air strikes against Serbs.    Armed Forces Minister Jeremy Hanley also said at Commons  question time that he foresaw no role change when the new  commander of the UN protection force, Sir Michael Rose, takes up  the post at the end of this month.    Sir Michael was formerly commander of the SAS [Special Air  Service] in the Falklands war.    Labour's Kate Hoey (Vauxhall) said there was a "credibility  gap" undermining both NATO's and the UN's roles because of  failure to "take action against Serbian aggression."    She demanded "immediate, selective air strikes" to get the  airport at Tuzla reopened and a lifting of the siege of  Sarajevo.    Mr Hanley said that so far British troops had escorted 1,675  convoys carrying over 80,000 tons of aid. There had also been  over 1,000 flights.    "They will continue to provide support for relief operation  throughout the winter."    He added: "It is not fair to say there is a credibility gap.  What we are doing is helping countless thousands of lives.  Countless thousands of people are being kept alive by our  efforts."    He added: "We are doing a great job and I am proud of what  we  are doing."    John Wilkinson (C Ruislip and Northwood) asked if Sir  Michael  would go out with any new "political instructions" from Britain  or the UN.    Mr Hanley told him: "He will carry our his task superbly, he  is a magnificent soldier. But there is no change in role  foreseen."    Later Commons Leader Tony Newton, deputising for Mr Major at  question time, set out the Nato proposals, stressing Britain's  willingness to use air strikes if necessary.    Mr Newton said: "After some very fruitful meetings in  Brussels this morning, the Prime Minister speaking there has  made clear that we will be drawing up plans to help UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] bring in a Netherlands contingent to replace  the Canadians in Srebrenica, and has also agreed to examine how  Tuzla airport can be opened, with the intention that it should  serve as a conduit for humanitarian relief.    "He has also made it clear that if it is necessary to use  air  power to achieve these objectives, then we would be willing to  do so."    Tory Matthew Banks (Southport) said: "Britain, until  recently, has been entirely right to resist premature calls for  air strikes in the region which would have led to extreme danger  for our troops on the ground who were sent there to police a UN  ceasefire, not take part in guerilla warfare."    He urged that "Britain continues to maintain a flexible and  responsive approach to military action in Bosnia."    Miss Hoey told the Government to apply Back to Basics to  foreign policy: "Part of that should be a basic understanding  that aggression should not be rewarded. It is crucial that the  siege of Sarajevo is lifted and that your Government calls for  immediate air strikes to take out the artillery which surrounds  that city."    Mr Newton urged her to study full reports of agreements  reached in Brussels today.</p>

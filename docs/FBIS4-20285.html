			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The discussion regarding the name and  intentions of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM)  continued to attract the attention of the Greek press.  <H5>  `Collective Neurosis' on FYROM Criticized </H5>   Writing in the 5 April Athens daily I KATHIMERINI, Thanos  Lipovats, professor of political psychology at Pandios  University, remarks that "the nationalistic, anti-European, and  anti-American hysteria of the last few weeks--led by part of the  press, the mass media, the parties, and the Orthodox  Church--with regard to the present clash of interests with the  FYROM resembles the symptoms of a collective neurosis." Seeking  the reasons for such "hysteria," Lipovats notes that FYROM is a  "small, new country of people with little historical background  that has tried too hastily to acquire an identity by abusing the  symbols of a neighbor [Greece] with an ancient history."  Lipovats argues that the "Slavo-Macedonian majority" in the  FYROM is not politically homogeneous, with only part of it being  "chauvinistic and anti-Greek" while the majority still views  Greece favorably. The Greek Government's "feckless" policy  toward the Macedonia issue in the last four years has reinforced  the intransigence of certain elements of the FYROM's population;  in addition, what Lipovats terms the "foolish" talk about an  "Islamic arc" and an opposing "Orthodox arc" has led to Greece's  isolation within the European Union (EU) and pushed the FYROM to  seek support from Turkey. Contending that the resulting  confusion has encouraged "backward, conservative, and  anti-European forces" in Greece, Lipovats writes that the  "so-called national consensus" on the FYROM has created an  "unholy alliance between church and state based on the abuse of  both history and religion." The violence of the Greek attitude  on FYROM, manifested through newspaper articles, rallies, and  political pronouncements, is unrelated to the reality of the  FYROM issue, which is of "limited and undramatic" importance,  Lipovats concludes.  <H5>  Andrianopoulos Accepts `Macedonia' as Geographic Unit </H5>   A brief commentary in the 10 April Athens weekly KIRIAKATIKI  ELEVTHEROTIPIA states that New Democracy (ND) luminary Andreas  Andrianopoulos praised Bulgaria for recognizing FYROM as the  "Republic of Macedonia" based on the argument that this "is a  mere geographical term and, moreover, its inhabitants are not  Macedonians but Bulgarians." Andrianopoulos is reported as  saying that Greece "could have taken the same tack, remaining  unconcerned about the name issue and recognizing Skopje's  geographical entity, but reserving the right to take action in  response to possible future talk about the `unredeemed nation of  Macedonians.'" "It is not coincidental," Andrianopoulos is  quoted as saying, that the Macedonians "have not uttered a word  about Bulgaria."  <H5>  Deal Advocated on Macedonia Name Issue </H5>   An article in the 9 April Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA cites  ND deputy and former Minister of Education Yeoryios Souflias as  saying that Greece should negotiate with the FYROM on a  composite name that would include the term "Macedonia" followed  by a geographical definition. The article reports that at a  recent speech in Salonica, Souflias said that "instead of  aspiring to the most desirable, it is time to move in the  direction of the most achievable."</p>

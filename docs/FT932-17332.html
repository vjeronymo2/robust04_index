			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / The Lex Column: CarnaudMetalbox Europe's largest packaging company is being gripped by a two-way pull, as its annual results make clear. CarnaudMetalbox is not deriving much sustenance from difficult markets but it is capable of living off its own fat. Greater operating efficiencies stemming from extensive cost cutting, combined with lower interest and tax charges, produced a 15 per cent gain in net income despite a 3 per cent fall in sales. Mr Jurgen Hintz, chief executive, believes there are more internally-generated improvements to come, likening the packaging industry's stage of evolution to that of automotive parts manufacturers in the mid-1970s. Modernising manufacturing methods and squeezing excessive working capital should yield substantial benefits. But softening European economies and severe overcapacity in the beverage can market will hamper the company's best efforts. CarnaudMetalbox's two largest shareholders seem divided about its prospects. MB-Caradon's preparations to sell its 25.3 per cent stake suggest an element of doubt. But CGIP is aiming to raise its stake by another 7 per cent. In truth, this divergence of opinion may reflect little more than the differing time horizons of British and French investors. Other shareholders should perhaps also balance the likelihood of short-term share price softness with longer-term appreciation.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Lasmo cuts dividend after Pounds 385m deficit: Chief executive describes 'very hard' decision to reduce payout to 3.3p from 8 1/2 p LASMO, the oil exploration and production company, slashed its dividend by more than expected and reported an after-tax loss of Pounds 385m for last year. The company's share price tumbled by 19p to 173p as it announced it had cut its dividend to 3.3p for last year from 8 1/2 p the year before. 'This is a disastrous set of results and the outlook is not good,' said Ms Irene Himona, analyst at Strauss Turnbull, the UK securities house. Mr Joe Darby, who took over as chief executive at Lasmo in January, said: 'The dividend cut was a very hard decision, but we took a long look at the business and decided to reduce the dividend to a level that is sustainable.' The company also announced it would sell its share of the Markham gas field in the North Sea. Analysts have estimated it might fetch Pounds 100m. Mr Darby said he is looking at re-focusing Lasmo, strengthening its balance sheet and putting a drive on core exploration while divesting much of its peripheral interests. But some analysts suggest the company could be jeopardising future growth. 'You've got to differentiate between fat and muscle and Markham is more muscle than we've recently got rid of, but there is not huge upside potential there,' said Mr Darby. Lasmo made an operating profit before exceptional items of Pounds 112m compared with a loss of Pounds 9m the year before. But the company was hit hard by exceptional items of Pounds 426m. These included a writedown of Pounds 232m as it revalued its assets based on lower price expectations and more conservative reserve estimates for some of its fields. Lasmo is now testing all of its oil projects against a flat oil price of Dollars 19 a barrel. Production is planned to rise 40 per cent during the next five years to 220,000 barrels a day. The company also changed its accounting procedures and the loss for 1991 was restated to Pounds 4m. Its debt-to-equity ratio rose to 111 per cent at the end of the year and once the benefit from disposals made last year feeds through, gearing will fall to 88 per cent. Earnings per share before exceptional items were 4.6p and after exceptionals, the company incurred a loss of 52.2p a share compared with a loss of 2.8p in 1991. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AETNA PRAISES $18-MILLION HEALTH-CARE FRAUD JUDGMENT  </P> <P> Aetna Life Insurance Co. says the $18 million that a federal judge awarded to  it and two other health insurance carriers on Thursday was the largest  health-care fraud judgment ever secured under the federal Racketeer Influenced  and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).  </P> <P> But Aetna acknowledged that the hard part will be getting its hands on the  money.  </P> <P> The award came in a civil lawsuit that accused two brothers of operating a  string of Los Angeles-based mobile medical diagnostic laboratories that filed  fraudulent claims totaling more than $100 million.  </P> <P> One of the brothers, David Smushkevich, was found guilty in 1987 of criminal  violations of the anti-kickback provisions of federal laws governing the  Medicare program. He served time in prison. He and his brother Michael -- also  named in the suit -- left the country after the insurers' suit was filed.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors also tried and convicted several others who were said to  have been involved in various schemes to refer patients to the Smushkevichs'  labs in exchange for payments. In the criminal proceedings, witnesses claimed  that the labs not only filed exorbitant bills with Medicare and private  insurers, but often didn't give patients test results.  </P> <P> The Smushkevich brothers operated about 240 labs under a variety of names,  including American Diagnostics Inc., Alpha Medical and American Cardiology  Diagnostic Clinic, according to the civil suit. Aetna claimed that the brothers  were engaged in the most massive health-care fraud in the history of the United  States.  </P> <P> Judith Hyfield-Starr, an Aetna spokeswoman, said the insurance companies  realize that they will have difficulty collecting the default judgment. The  Smushkevichs filed bankruptcy and liquidated their companies before they left  the country, she said. One of the brothers is in Russia and the other -- it  isn't certain which of the two -- is believed to be in Mexico, she said. The  Smushkevichs were Russian emigres in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Hyfield-Starr said the company believes that it may be able to collect some of  the judgment if it traces the brother in Mexico. "I imagine it's going to be  quite difficult," she said.  </P> <P> However, Aetna said it was still pleased with the court judgment. "One reason  health costs are going up is fraud and Aetna wants to send a clear message that  it is aggressively pursuing fraud claims," said James L. Garcia, director of  fraud investigations for Aetna's Employee Benefits division. "Health insurance  fraud in this country is an over $60-billion-a-year problem that every one of  us pays for in higher health-care costs."  </P> <P> Garcia said Aetna wants the federal government to enact laws specifically for  health-care fraud so that insurance scam operators would be more readily  subject to criminal prosecution. Hyfield-Starr said most health insurance  criminal fraud cases are brought under mail fraud statutes because claims are  processed through the postal service. But, she said, there are so many other  crimes that come under the postal laws and RICO that "white collar" crimes like  health insurance fraud get pushed to "the bottom of the list."  </P> <P> "Although we feel good about the civil judgment, health-care fraud continues to  grow and the public should be aware of this. Copy-cat scams are springing up in  other states," Garcia said.  </P> <P> Blue Shield of California said recently that "rolling lab" operations still  engage in fraud in California. The insurer said it discovered $1.5 million in  fraudulent claims in 1989. "One of the biggest rip-offs has been the vast  number of falsely filed claims from shady 'rolling lab' operators that continue  to bilk the public," said Harry S. Miller, Blue Shield vice president for  consumer affairs.  </P> <P> Miller said Blue Shield is working closely with the Internal Revenue Service,  the postal service and law enforcement agencies to prosecute fraudulent  operators.  </P></p>

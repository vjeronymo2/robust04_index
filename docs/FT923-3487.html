			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc surprises with profits warning RHONE-POULENC, the French state-owned chemical group, surprised the Paris market yesterday when it warned it would not achieve its operating profits target for the third quarter this year. The group's prefered investment certificates fell 13 per cent from FFr600 to FFr530 on the news. Analysts said the warning, after assurances four weeks ago that the target was achievable, had undermined Rhone-Poulenc's credibility, effectively scuppering short-term possibilities of privatisation or changes in capital structure. The company, France's largest chemicals group, estimated growth in the third quarter of between 10 and 15 per cent. In February, Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chief executive, promised that in spite of recession, earnings growth in 1992 and 1993 would be at least 20 per cent. The group said it had not been aware of the full extent of the shortfall until after its half-year results in August. One analyst said this suggested either a sudden downturn, or the company's reporting systems needed improvement. The company blamed several factors for the under-performance, but stressed the weakness of the US dollar. It said although its US healthcare operations reached its targets, the dollar's depreciation below FFr4.80 had affected results of its US businesses. Last year about 23 per cent of Rhone-Poulenc's turnover was in the US. Its US operations made trading profits of about FFr1.2bn (Dollars 240m) against group profits of FFr6.2bn. The dollar's depreciation also hit the group's organic chemical intermediates operations. The relative strength of the franc made its products increasingly uncompetitive in America, while cheap US imports were undermining prices in European markets. Rhone-Poulenc net income rose 38 per cent to FFr1.55bn in the first half from FFr1.12bn in the same period last year.</p>

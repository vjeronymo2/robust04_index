			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Accountancy Column: Irish institute plays the game at both ends - The lessons to be learned from a professional body spanning either side of the border Among the handful of issues on which those on both sides of the Irish border see eye-to-eye is a holy trinity of rugby, the Catholic church and - most surprisingly - accountancy. Like the sport and the religious hierarchy, the profession pre-dates partition in 1922. With barriers since going up to divide north from south on so many topics, there is a strong case for those from outside the region to pay a little more attention to its experiences. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, the largest body in the region, bears the highly unusual responsibility of representing the profession in two countries. It is an arrangement that requires regular commuting, with offices in both Dublin and Belfast and the council rotating its meetings between the two cities. Ask Mr Joe Gannon, a partner in Gilroy Gannon, a practice based in Sligo and the newly appointed president of the institute, what distinguishes it from its rivals in the UK, and he pauses briefly for thought. Then a proud list begins of differences and precedents that have since trickled across the Irish sea. Take training in industry, a programme designed to allow chartered accountants to train outside public practice. Begun in 1983, the scheme currently operates for more than 60 students in an equivalent number of companies and government bodies. The idea has since been copied much more recently by the UK's chartered accountancy institutes, where it still remains proportionately far smaller. Take, as a more recent example, finances, given that the institute managed to generate a surplus in its latest accounts to December 1993, compared with deficits at some of its leading competitor bodies. However, one of the most important and often over-looked contributions of the institute was a small green document published in January 1992, 11 months before the Cadbury report on the financial aspects of corporate governance captured the headlines when it was launched in London. The report by the commission of inquiry into the expectations of users of published financial statements - commonly known as the Ryan commission after its chairman - deserves a wider readership. Its remit was far wider than Cadbury, its recommendations more radical and its work more prompt in response to criticisms of the quality of published financial information. The commission suggested that accounts should contain a statement of auditors' and directors' responsibilities (something since introduced in the UK by the Auditing Practices Board) which would include commentary on the state of internal financial controls (a topic still under debate following similar recommendations in Cadbury). It called for the creation wherever possible of audit committees - ideally composed solely of non-executive directors - charged with overseeing financial reporting and internal controls, and (going further than Cadbury) ensuring the external auditors act independently of management. The report called for full disclosure of directors' remuneration in the annual report, and for a detailed commentary in the chief executive's review of trends, uncertainties and plans (now endorsed in the operating and financial review guidelines issued last year by the Accounting Standards Board). One area in which it borrowed from the UK was the suggestion that Ireland should set up its own Financial Reporting Review Panel, in line with the equivalent watchdog of the accounts of public limited companies in the UK. This is still being pursued by a committee of the Irish government created to examine revisions to company law. A disappointment of the institute is the slow or neglected implementation of the Ryan Commission. The report recommended that the review panel publish a report on cases of companies whose accounting it investigated (rather than the brief public statement on companies found guilty as in the UK). It called for the auditors to comment explicitly on the company's solvency at the balance sheet date, and for publication of their report to the audit committee if the company collapsed within 12 months after the date of an unqualified audit report. It also wanted preliminary and interim statements to be audited (a proposal being examined in the UK), and a reduction of the maximum gross fees payable to a firm from 15 per cent to 5 per cent of total income. None of these radical ideas has since been introduced. Perhaps an even more significant Irish invention now finding resonances in the UK has been 'practice review'. While the UK bodies began to respond to the need for audit regulation following the 1989 Companies Act, the Irish opted to begin a voluntary system of visiting all 1,200 accountancy practitioners every five years back in 1987. It drew on the experiences of the Ontario Institute's approach in Canada. Since then it used this approach, which has since also been more reflected by the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants than the Joint Monitoring Unit, which covers the chartered bodies. 'Inspection is a bad word,' says Mr Eugene MacMahon, head of the unit of three staff. 'We consider ourselves educational and supportive. Members voted us in. This wasn't supposed to be a crusade to nail people to the cross, but a road to Damascus.' Although the figures have not been made public, it is believed that something like one-third of practitioners initially required a follow-up visit after staff identified flaws in their auditing that needed improvement  -most typically a failure to document partners' decisions. However, only six practitioners have been disciplined, and those firms requiring follow-up visits during the second round of inspections - now under way for two years - have roughly halved. It is a softly-softly approach that has been since endorsed in a recent report on UK audit regulation commissioned by the Department of Trade and Industry, and one which the Irish government has decided is well-suited to EU requirements for monitoring of the profession. Looking forward, one of the top issues on Mr Gannon's agenda during the coming year in office is the consolidation of the profession, the most recent manifestation of which is the report of the working party chaired by Mr David Bishop of KPMG Peat Marwick, which earlier this year recommended an amalgamation of the six leading bodies. 'There is a perception that it is an English battle fought on Irish soil,' says Mr Roger Hussey, the chief executive of the institute. 'The last example of that was the battle of the Boyne and we don't want a repeat of that.' In Ireland, by contrast, Mr Gannon says the debate is less heated and there is a mood in favour of consolidation. 'Bishop has given us the opportunity to talk in a calm atmosphere,' he says. This harmony comes in spite of the fact that the challenge should be greater, given not only the cross-border issues but also the presence of an additional professional body. All are co-ordinated by an Irish equivalent of the UK's consultative committee of accountancy bodies (which Mr Hussey was restrained from dubbing 'mini-CCAB'). Overall, it is too bad that there are not more examples in the broader political sphere of the innovative thought and co-operation between the UK and Ireland as accountancy seems to have fostered.</p>

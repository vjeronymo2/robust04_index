			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Eurotunnel weak Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel tumbled another 15 to 288p, in heavy trade of 1.6m, as selling pressure overwhelmed buying orders from clients of the company broker S G Warburg's. In spite of continuous bidding for stock from Warburg, market watchers continued to suggest that large institutions were unlikely to take up their rights in the company's Pounds 858m issue. They also warned that the continuing slide in the share price had begun to undermine the confidence of the small shareholders in one of the UK's biggest cash calls ahead of its close on Wednesday. One broker said: 'There is little appetite for small holders to take up the issue.' Sentiment was further weakened when UBS yesterday reiterated its long-standing sell recommendation. UBS said: 'We believe the shares are fundamentally overvalued even at the rights price of 265p.' Food retailers continued strong yesterday with J Sainsbury leading the charge amid talk of prospective US support. Britain's biggest grocer confirmed it is to visit institutional shareholders in New York and Boston to host meetings with US fund managers, although it denied market talk in London that it will apply for a 'big board', or full, listing in New York to facilitate greater US liquidity in its shares. Sainsbury shares are already traded in ADR form on Wall Street. Back in London, dealers said that pent-up demand for the leading food retail stocks, which have been slowly creeping back into favour in recent weeks, has been causing stock shortages and pushing up prices. Some more longer-term investors have also been spurred by renewed speculation that food price inflation will return to the system by the year-end. Sentiment has also been helped by broker research - notably from NatWest Securities - which forecasts a continuing lean time for food manufacturers as food retailers maintain pressure on margins. Sainsbury shares motored 12 1/2 to 416 1/2 p on 6m traded, Tesco gained 5 1/2 to 229 1/2 p with 6.1m turned over, while Argyll's good run faltered and stayed steady at 252p. Northern Ireland Electricity was a lone bright spot in the electricity/power generation area of the market after Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, highlighted the short-, medium- and long-term attractions of the stock. The shares rose 7 to 221p. Hoare's utilities team pointed out that the stock's recent underperformance against the sector was because of the impending and final 120p call on the shares, due on June 28. The shares trade in fully paid form from Monday. Property developer Greycoat, which underwent a financial restructuring last year, unveiled a three-for-eight rights issue at 13p a share to raise Pounds 47m. The shares slipped 1 1/2 to 15 1/2 p. There was speculative buying among both television and radio stocks yesterday. In the former, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, which has been highlighted by Granada as a potential bid target, advanced 5 to 315p. The latter added 4 1/2 to 533 1/2 p. Among radio stocks, Capital Radio added 5 to 399p and Metro Radio 13 to 393p. A stock overhang left Caradon trailing 11 at 300p. Lucas Industries shed 3 to 175p after Strauss Turnbull was said to have downgraded profit expectations. In the transport sector, yield buyers were seen for Ocean Group, and the shares improved 8 to 263p.</p>

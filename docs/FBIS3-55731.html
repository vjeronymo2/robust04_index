			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Rustam Arifdzhanov report: "Government's First Resolution: </F> Build a New Parliament Center"]    [Text] Decree No. 1 of the Russian Federation Government  was signed by its chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin on 6 January  1994. It is the document "On the Construction of a Complex of  Buildings for the Parliament Center -- Official Residence of the  Federal Assembly."    We wrote in the last issue of the newspaper about the  proposed construction of a new administrative complex for  parliament in Moscow. The initiative for building it came from  the president's administration, and according to Pavel Borodin,  the president's administrator of affairs, as quoted by INTERFAX,  it is proposed to earmark about half a billion dollars for the  purpose.    However, the report was denied almost immediately by  government First Vice Premier Yegor Gaydar. He stated that no  such decision is in preparation, or at least he is not aware of  it.    Nonetheless, apparently at the very same time as Yegor  Timurovich was refuting the report, Viktor Stepanovich was  signing the first decree of the year. According to this decree,  it is planned to carry out work on the erection of a complex of  buildings for the new Parliament Center in 1994-1995. The  government of Moscow is instructed, in conjunction with the  president's administration of affairs, to identify a plot for  the construction of the complex in the central section of Moscow  within a month. A competition is announced among Russian and  foreign firms for the best design. It is planned to commission  the new Parliament Center in the first half of 1995.    The figure of half a billion dollars does not appear in the  decree. Nonetheless, the sum total of expenditure on an  imposing new construction project is expected to be equally  vast. The Ministry of the Economy is instructed to allocate the  necessary quotas of state capital investments, including hard  currency resources. Yet meanwhile Gaydar, who runs that  ministry, knows nothing about the preparation of the decree. He  simply was not informed.    Boris Fedorov, the other vice premier and minister of  finance, only learned of the decree "from the newspapers" on 10  January. Prior to that, he too had stated that no government  decision exists as far as he knows -- "at any event, I have  signed nothing and authorized nothing."    After the decree's existence became known not only to the  country's ordinary taxpayers, who were not expecting their money  to be used in quite this way, but also to the vice premiers,  IZVESTIYA's correspondent asked the finance minister some  questions. According to the minister, he really had not been in  the know. No session of the government or the government  presidium had been convened on this subject. As for Boris  Fedorov's personal opinion, he thinks: We cannot at the present  day permit ourselves a construction project of $500 million or  thereabouts. Such a sum is simply not available in reality, or  even in the plans. Furthermore the finance minister does not  consider the government's removal to the White House to be  justified.    Maybe the construction will be financed out of the funds of  the president's administration of affairs? Not likely. The  president's administration of affairs does have what is known as  a separate line in the budget, but it seems that no such sums  are envisaged there.    The new construction project will be a heavy burden on the  country's already unenviable budget. Is it really necessary  today? Especially since there does not appear to have been any  special pressure from the newly fledged deputies along the lines  of "build us a new house immediately."    Obviously we are not so rich as to allow ourselves to buy  things on the cheap. But nor are we so poor as to create new  administrative palaces in the shortest possible time "for show."    I admit we were waiting with considerable interest to see  how  the government would begin the new year and what, in the changed  situation, would be its first step. So now we know.</p>

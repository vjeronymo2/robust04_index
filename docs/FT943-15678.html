			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / French growth set to top target France is likely to have economic growth this year which is nearer 2 per cent than the 1.4 per cent originally forecast by the government, Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, said yesterday. In the second quarter this year, gross domestic product would rise 1 per cent after rising 0.5 per cent in the first-quarter, Mr Alphandery told French radio. This meant that by the end of June, France would already have achieved its official forecast of 1.4 per cent growth this year. 'I have good reason to hope that in 1994 we will be nearer to 2 per cent (growth) than 1.4 per cent,' he said. Several ministers had already said that France would beat its official forecast, made in the 1994 Finance Act, of 1.4 per cent growth this year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 23 (CNA) -- Five navy admirals have  denied being members of mysterious, decades-old secret society,  according to the task force formed to investigate the murder of  Navy Capt. Yin Ching-feng and the arms-purchasing scandal  surrounding his death.    Military authorities discovered the activity of the  underground society in the probe into the death of Yin, which  began last December. Some suspected members of the organization  are believed to have been deeply involved in the scandal, but  the five unnamed admirals have not been charged with any crime.    Vice Admiral Shih Tzuo-nhing, the convenor of the ad-hoc  investigative group, told the Legislative Yuan Saturday [23  April] morning that the military prosecutor had interviewed 41  Navy sailors and officers who are suspected of being members of  the "Ching Pang," or "Blue Gang," and 16 had admitted to the  links.    The Blue Gang reportedly had its start in the early Ching  Dynasty, which ran from 1644 to 1911, and while little is known  about the group's activities, it did play a prominent role in  the establishment of central government powers over the warlords  in the 1920's and 30's.    Investigators said Yin was killed because he threatened to  expose a pattern of bribery in which arms dealers and retired  military officers representing European companies paid  active-duty officers for help in winning weapons contracts.    Shih stressed he remains confident that the case will be  cracked even though there is a lack of substantial evidence.</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Arts: Dazzled by the Magician - The opening work in the new Almeida Opera season THERE ARE several reasons for cheering the arrival of Almeida Opera, the first collaboration between English National Opera's Contemporary Opera Studio and the Almeida Theatre Company. What this amounts to is a summer opera-festival offering two new operas, a double bill containing a third new opera, and a thematically linked scheme of chamber concerts; and what it promises is the revival of at least a portion of the contemporary music-theatre excitements regularly tasted in the small Islington theatre when the much-missed Almeida Festival was in full spate. It was launched on Thursday, with the strongest possible form of advocacy for the venture - a dazzling piece of modern music-drama, dazzlingly executed. Stephen Oliver's Mario and the Magician was first shown at the 1988 Musica Nel Chiostro Festival at Batignano; it receives here its British first performances. Oliver, who died two months ago at the age of 42, was a complete theatre-man. This adaptation of the 1929 Thomas Mann novella, for which  - as was the usual Oliver practice - he wrote both words and music, supplies still another cause to lament his horribly early death. Yet this small, sharp, vital opera comes at exactly the right moment to provide a perfect example of his rare gifts, and so celebration is also in order. Several previous operatic approaches have already been made to Mario und der Zauberer; last month Andrew Porter reviewed on this page the Toronto premiere of the most recent - Harry Somers's three-hour version for large cast and orchestra. Oliver's 75-minute one-acter is expertly planned and paced, effective in all the good senses of the word; in it he has preserved Mann's short-story scale, the picaresque atmosphere of the Italian seaside resort, the hints of growing Mussolini-era intolerance beneath the surface. He does this as only a real opera-creator can: by means of compression and juxtaposition of incident, alteration of a few of Mann's narrative details and excision of many, and above all a gift for making his music expand the subject matter. The opera is basically a chamber scherzo with sinister edges and allegorical undercurrents, shaped in unequal halves separated by a short instrumental interlude. In brief, accurate scene-setting detail the first 'half' touches in the holiday sojourn of the German narrator and family (here changed to a widow and daughter); the second unfolds the conjuring show of the Cavaliere Cipolla and its violently dramatic conclusion. Skilfully inflected 'tones of voice' rich in many-layered irony are achieved in the musical styles that carry the scheme forward: principally a concentrated, uneasily late-Romantic lyricism (big melodic phrases underpinned with piano accompaniment directly influenced by Britten's Death in Venice), a perky burlesque-Stravinsky evoking the magic-show conventions, and a vein of half-serious chromatic spookery limning Cipolla's hypnotic tricks. When Mario and the Magician was first shown at Batignano, the reviewer in Opera deemed it a 'smart little shocker' and praised Oliver's Puccini-like confidence in building toward a coup de theatre. The praise deserves repetition but also amplification: for the experience is more substantial than the word 'shocker' may suggest, depending for its fullness on a light-fingered treatment of subject and symbol (Cipolla's unnatural power compared to Mussolini's), an acute balance of comedy and melodrama. The opera delights, grips, disturbs; it never hectors or stuns its audience into submission. Oliver's exactness of aim and achievement has been exactly mirrored in the playing of Almeida Ensemble under Nicholas Kok, and in Tim Hopkins's production. A tilted circular ramp (designer: Nigel Lowery) serves excellently as springboard for the scenic transformations, and for the intensely physical activities of the 14-strong cast. The economy of the staging carries its own potent magic, which (of course) is also Oliver's; the intimacy of the Almeida offers an ideal setting. Cipolla (baritone) affords Richard Jackson endless opportunities for slimy smiles and sidling motions, pregnant moments of stillness, myriad vocal and verbal half-lights. He seizes every one with the unarguable authority of a virtuoso (and a neat conjuror to boot). The other significant roles in what is essentially, and outstandingly, a tight-knit ensemble show go to Paul Nilon, Lynne Davies, Annemarie Sand, Garry Magee and the actor Jonathan Burrell (in the non-speaking part of the waiter Mario, Cipolla's final victim). I predict long queues at the box office for the remaining four performances: this Mario and the Magician scores a palpable hit.

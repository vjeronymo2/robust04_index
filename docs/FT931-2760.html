			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Observer: Rolling road Paul Keating's newly re-elected Australian government has decided to give a rough ride not only to royalty, but to visiting VIPs of all kinds. It is selling the fleet of plush cars used to chauffeur them, on grounds that they are inadequately attack-proof as well as too costly to maintain, and buying armoured Fords and Holdens instead. The unwanted wheels include seven Rolls-Royces - three black 1958 Silver Wraiths, two black 1965 Phantom Vs and, fittingly, two 'royal claret' 1964 Silver Cloud IIIs - besides two 1954 Land Rovers in mere ordinary claret although specially built for conveying crowned heads. Offers direct to the Australian government, please.</p>

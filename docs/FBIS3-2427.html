Wang said after the incident that he had been mentally prepared  for all sorts of misfortunes, including being arrested and  sentenced. This was the fourth summons for interrogation over  the last two months.    China has detained and summoned for interrogation many  dissidents over the last few days. This has elicited a strong  reaction from the United States. U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, who is to visit China soon, warned that such a move  may force Washington to apply trade sanctions against China.    In an interview through the trunk-line exchange after his  release, Wang Dan told this newspaper's reporter that he was  taken away by three plainclothes public security officers  yesterday while having supper at his home, and was released  after an hour of interrogation.    Wang also disclosed that the public security officers gave  him five "strongly worded" warnings during the interrogation:    1. His words and deeds have overstepped the limit set by  rules and regulations for a socialist citizen.    2. The rules and regulations require every socialist citizen  to uphold the socialist system and no citizens or organizations  are allowed to oppose the socialist system.    3. Some of his words were groundless and sheer fabrication.  He must pay the price if what he says tarnishes the country's  image.    4. China is a sovereign country and no interference in its  internal affairs is allowed.    5. He has violated the criminal law. If he does it again,  he will be punished without leniency.    To the public security officer's "stern warnings" he  responded: "I will hold to my own views and to the behavior I  consider lawful. If I violate the law, I will accept the  consequences," according to Wang.    Wang also told this reporter that nothing will compel him to  give up his efforts to promote democracy in China and his belief  in the cause, adding that he is mentally prepared for any  consequences, including being arrested and sentenced. [passage  omitted]    In another development, Ma Wendu, who has participated the  1989 democratic movement, was also taken away by public security  officers two days ago and was released yesterday after being  detained and interrogated for one day. Ma told his friends that  the public security authorities had asked him about the "peace  charter" and warned him watch his behavior.</p>

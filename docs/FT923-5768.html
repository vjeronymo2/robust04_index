			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Pretoria purges police leadership THE South African government yesterday announced sweeping changes in its police, including purging top ranks, introducing civilian review of police actions, retraining officers in community policing and appointing blacks to senior posts. The measures represent Pretoria's most determined effort yet to reduce the township violence which has left 7,000 people dead since 1990, and has been exacerbated by poor policing. They could help smooth the way to resumption of talks on a post-apartheid constitution, suspended by the African National Congress (ANC) two months ago in protest at the violence. An ANC spokesman described the moves as 'window dressing' saying that the ANC opposed any measures to restructure the police before an interim government is in place. 'What Kriel has announced is a facelift, not a substantial change,' the ANC said. The movement said none of the generals named in allegations of police excesses and assassination squads was among those due to retire. Mr Hernus Kriel, minister of law and order, yesterday announced that 13 police generals were to be retired, nearly a quarter of the general staff, to try to restore the force's damaged credibility. An independent body is to be set up to investigate 'serious crimes allegedly committed by members of the South African police', he said. This body, which would be headed by a judge, would have 35 inspectors including attorneys general, lawyers, policemen and possibly 'foreign experts'. It would give South African civilians the right of review over police actions for the first time, introducing a principle of accountability never before respected by the police. Mr Kriel, who is the minister responsible for the police, said the force had discriminated against blacks in the past and would now adopt an affirmative action policy aimed at promoting non-whites quickly to top ranks. There would be further retirements at lower levels of the force, and officers would be retrained to 'sensitise all serving members on an urgent basis about the changed environment in which policing must take place'. The measures appear to have been prompted by international criticism, including a report by British experts last month which found the force to be incompetent. It is understood that the leader of the British team, Mr Peter Waddington, director of criminal justice studies at Reading University, had privately urged Mr de Klerk to carry out the purge.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> "Stay tuned" has a new meaning to a 19-year-old late-night disc jockey in Iowa  City, Iowa. When Daryl Berryhill stepped outside to get a snack from his car  about 2:40 a.m. Monday, the station door locked behind him. The last song ended  . . . followed by 45 minutes of silence. . . . Berryhill broke glass in a back  door and pried open a security cage, but was unable to open a second set of  doors leading to the studio. Deputy sheriffs finally arrived to assist in the  re-entry.

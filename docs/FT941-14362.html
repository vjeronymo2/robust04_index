			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Roche moves up to third place in FT500 as Shell keeps lead Roche, the Swiss drugs group, is the big winner in this year's FT500 ranking of Europe's top companies, rising to third place from sixth. Roche's market capitalisation - the value of all its shares when the survey was taken - is not far behind that of British Telecommunications. Both are still well behind Royal Dutch/Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, which again ranks first. In general, drugs companies did poorly in this year's rankings, making Roche's rise the more striking. Glaxo of the UK came second last year, but has now dropped to seventh place. The FT500, published as a special section today, compares European quoted companies by market capitalisation. A second ranking, the FT UK 500, highlights the leading UK companies. The top 100 companies from the US and Japan are also included. This year's survey also shows: Swedish banks made a striking recovery. Scandinaviska Enskilda Banken, which had dropped out of the ranking, reappeared at 199th. Svenska Handelsbanken was the biggest gainer, rising 242 places to 223rd. Other big winners included British Aerospace, up 233 places to 231st; Finland's Repola, up 132 places to 255th; and Spain's Fomentos de Construcciones, up 128 to 312nd. Big losers were Montedison, the Italian chemicals company, which fell 235 places to 468th; Racal, the UK electronics group, down 192 places to 480th; and Delhaize, the Netherlands chemicals company, down 152 to 327th. Courtaulds Textiles of the UK and Club Mediterranee of France dropped out of the European 500. The rankings include several companies formed by mergers, such as Reed Elsevier (41st), the Netherlands-British publishing group; and Matra Hachette (235th), France's publishing and defence group. Other new entrants are former state-owned companies: Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals company, joins at 79th; Argentaria, the Spanish bank, enters at 107th. Omission: LWT should have been included in the UK 500 at 205th, with a market capitalisation of Pounds 517m.</p>

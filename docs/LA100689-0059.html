			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Greek Prime Minister Tzannis Tzannetakis, saying he has fulfilled his mandate  to clean up national politics, announced that his government will resign within  four days, opening the way for a caretaker government to oversee new elections  Nov. 5. He said a caretaker government should be formed within a week of his  resignation. The prime minister, who heads a coalition of the conservative New  Democracy Party and the Communist-led Leftist Alliance, said his government has  achieved what it pledged to do when it took office -- clean up Greek political  life from the scandals that brought down the last administration.  </P></p>

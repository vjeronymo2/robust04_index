			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Haiti awaits Aristide's resurrection: Why the former president may be back THE likelihood of the safe return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to lead Haiti appears to have increased over the last week. Violence and intimidation by supporters of the military leadership which ousted the president two years ago last week looked likely to jeopardise the implementation of an accord aimed at his safe return. But the violence - at least in the capital, Port-au-Prince - appears to have subsided and a weekend decision to boost the UN presence in the country has raised hopes that Mr Aristide can return safely. Around 600 US troops begin to arrive in Haiti next week in a 'non-confrontational' role as part of a 1,650-member UN mission in Haiti to help in the restoration of democracy. The contingent is expected to contain more than 500 police. The agreement between military leaders and Mr Aristide envisaging the latter's return, was sponsored by the UN and the governments of the US, France, Canada and Venezuela and signed on July 3. The accord contemplated the appointment of a new Prime Minister by Mr Aristide and his return on October 30. But since Mr Robert Malval took office as Prime Minister on September 2, he and his cabinet have been obstructed and intimidated by government employees appointed after the coup, who do not want to give up their posts. The employees have been helped by bands of civilian police auxiliaries known as 'attaches' who have attacked government ministers and the mayor of Port-au-Prince, Mr Evans Paul. According to human rights groups, the 'attaches' are also responsible for this month's violence against Aristide supporters, in which dozens of people have been killed or have disappeared, including an important backer of the President, Mr Antoine Izmery, who was pulled out of a church service and shot dead. The prosecutor in charge of investigating some of these killings, Mr Wilson Ciceron, has resigned after receiving death threats. Ministers have been subjected to intimidation which, in some cases, has prevented them going to work. Mr Malval and his government cannot go anywhere without heavy police protection. The man whose job it is to provide it, the police chief, Lt Col Michel Francois, has been accused by Mr Dante Caputo, special envoy of the Organisation of American States and the United Nations, of being responsible for Mr Izmery's murder. Mr Malval's government has invited exiled Haitians to return to the country, but there is no evidence that any of those returning are Aristide supporters. Most appear to be supporters of the former Duvalier dictatorship, which ruled the country for three decades. In an apparent attempt to keep the activities of the Duvalier supporters above board, Mr Malval has legalised a Duvalierist party. In spite of the violence, Mr Aristide is adamant that he will return to Port-au-Prince next month. He is planning to arrive with a number of prominent international personalities, including the Nobel Peace Prize winner Ms Rigoberta Menchu and possibly former US president Mr Jimmy Carter. If he does, he will find mountains of refuse blocking the streets of the capital, hunger and disease throughout the country, and an economy almost in ruins. His first priority, nevertheless, will be to stay alive and to try to stem the violence. His task will not be helped by a new organisation calling itself the 'September 30 Group' after the date of the 1991 coup. It has been distributing leaflets in the streets of Port-au-Prince threatening to 'eradicate' Aristide's activists before his return. 'The days to come must be red with blood' they warn. They also pledge to intervene immediately whenever an employee appointed since the coup is fired. 'Our democracy', the leaflet states, 'consists of the law and the machine gun'.</p>

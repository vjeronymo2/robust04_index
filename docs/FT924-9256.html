			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Ahead, but frightened Curiously, Mr John Major was nearly the winner this week, and Mr John Smith the loser. The prime minister came out better because, owing to a combination of circumstances, he won - just - a parliamentary motion upon which everyone knew he had staked his office. The leader of the Labour party came second because he had manufactured excuses to vote against his own long-held principles, and lost. Mr Major took some of the shine off his victory yesterday by confessing that he had agreed to postpone the third reading of the Maastricht bill until after the second Danish referendum. No final conclusions can be drawn from this little history. There will be more tense votes over the lifetime of this government. Some may come before Christmas, some next week. Mr Smith need not always lose. The chamber has become uncharacteristically volatile because of an extraordinary constitutional development: the elective dictatorship is no longer very dictatorial. In its place we see the frightened administration. This is a type of executive that those with long memories can easily recall. It is frightened of its own party, frightened of the whole house, frightened of public opinion. Some regard this development as inevitable, given the government's low majority of 21. The 1974-79 Labour government, which in its later years lost its majority altogether, was such a frightened administration that it forfeited its ability to govern. But a low majority is not the whole story. Britain has become accustomed to a legislature composed of three national parties plus assorted representatives of the Celtic regions. They all usually fall into line, either behind the government or as a united opposition. Now we must adjust to four main parties, two of them Conservative, plus six varieties of nationalist. The nine parties not bound by ties of loyalty to the government may combine and regroup in ways that cannot always be foreseen. The second, unofficial, Conservative party accounts for about a 10th of the Tories. It is tightly organised and strongly motivated. Its leaders sit in the Lords. It will not vanish as a result of its defeat on Wednesday. Some senior ministers explain the Thatcherites' vociferousness by recalling that the Tories have been in power since 1979. At the beginning of their long reign putative rebels might have held fire, even if the government had then had a low majority (it did not). After what is already an unnaturally extended period in power the emergence of organised factions within the ruling party is perhaps inevitable. This is not all loss. An obstreperous parliament is a joy to behold. It makes ministers sweat. It brings politicians before the public eye. It provides low-cost drama on the TV. There are moments not to be forgotten, as on Wednesday night when Sir Edward Heath looked straight across the chamber at Mr Smith and told him that 'for the sake of the plaudits from some of his backbenchers', he had forsworn his integrity - and the discomfiture of the Labour leader was immediately apparent to the whole house. As it happens Sir Edward went too far. Mr Smith did not irrevocably lose his reputation for probity. He merely allowed it to be scratched a little. Next time he may have the foresight to work hard for an alliance with the Liberal Democrats well in advance of a crucial vote. Like the prime minister he, too, must learn to think of himself as leader of one of 10 parties in a fractious house. The era of simple two-party adversarial contests is suspended. Yet those of us who have been doubtful about Mr Smith's performance as leader so far must recognise that he has hardly got his feet under the table in his new job. He has performed brilliantly in other roles. He may yet do so in this one. One difficulty is that, like Mr Major, the Labour leader appears to be behaving like a mere party manager. Neither has shown much true leadership, in the sense of moving slightly ahead of the prevailing redoubts and pointing out where to march next. The prime minister has had to attempt the management of two parties at once, his own and his predecessor's. He has in recent weeks looked like the rider of a pair of horses veering in opposite directions. Even his dogged persistence about being at the heart of Europe has been compromised: he speaks of what Britain will not do for the European Community not of what the EC will do for Britain. Mr Smith is naturally concerned to maintain Labour's unity in spite of serious underlying divisions, particularly over Europe. These are potentially as harmful to his party as their equivalents are to Mr Major's. That is why the prime minister is in the stronger position. His authority may be minimal. The list of potential causes of trouble - public spending curbs, the council tax, the Maastricht bill - is long. But all nine opposition parties must unite if the government is to be brought down, as opposed to merely frustrated. Mr Smith will find that difficult to arrange.</p>

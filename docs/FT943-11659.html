			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Allies accused by US of appeasing Iran The US yesterday accused its allies of 'appeasing' Iran, in the wake of recent terrorist bombings attributed to pro-Iranian Islamic groups. Although not named, Germany and Japan, both of which have maintained commercial relations with Tehran, were clearly among the targets of criticism from Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, who called Iran an 'outlaw nation'. The US has also complained in the recent past about German intelligence contacts with Iran. Yesterday, Mr Christopher told the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee that the bombings in Latin America and London were 'a tragic reminder that the enemies of peace remain formidable'. He named Hizbollah, a Lebanese Shia group, as one of a number that 'wreak havoc and bloodshed' and must be defeated, adding that 'Hizbollah's patron, Iran, must be contained'. Iran, he said, 'is an international outlaw, yet some nations still conduct preferential commercial relations with Iran and some take steps to appease that outlaw nation. They must understand that by doing so, they make it easier for Iran to use its resources to sponsor terrorism thorughout the world'. He described himself as 'absolutely mystified why these countries are unwilling to put their commercial interests aside and recognise that this kind of terrorism must be dealt with and dealt with very harshly'. In London, Mr John Major, the British premier, accused the Iranian government of presenting 'a serious challenge to the international community,' amid a growing conviction in Whitehall that an Iranian-sponsored terrorist group was responsible for the London bombings. Mr Major said that Britain would prefer a normal relationship with Iran, but that many aspects of its behaviour were 'simply unacceptable.' The prime minister also went out of his way to condemn the Iranian government for behaviour that was 'threatening' to the international community. He said the British authorities could not yet be certain which country or group lay behind the terrorist acts but they had been perpetrated by people 'who refuse to abide by the rule of law and by the principles of a civilised society.' His warning came amid indications British officials have gathered intelligence which suggests the group which carried out the London bombimgs was also responsible for the suicide car bomb attack on a Jewish centre in Buenos Aires, in which 96 people were killed earlier this month. British officials said there was not yet unequivocal proof of the involvement of Tehran, but that all the circumstantial evidence pointed in that direction. If that judgment was confirmed it could lead to a renewed break in Britain's relations with Iran. Mr Christopher declined to name the countries appeasing Iran. The US, would share intelligence about Iran with them 'to see if we can't draw them back from this conduct which I think unnecessarily encourages Iran and is very destructive of the international co-ordination that we should have.' The UN Security Council is today expected to issue a statement strongly condemning terrorism and emphasising the need for strengthened international co-operation in fighting it in the aftermath of the bomb attacks on Jewish targets in London and Buenos Aires.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Employers told to win backing on pensions Employers who do not intend to allow employees to appoint representatives to pension-scheme boards of trustees will have to prove that the employees have agreed to forgo their rights, a government discussion paper proposed yesterday. The Department of Social Security has released a discussion document following last week's white paper on pension reform. It spells out how proposals allowing members to appoint up to a third of their scheme trustees will work in practice. The document says that employers will have to consult both employees and pensioners on opting out of the member-trustee requirement. Employers will then have to hold a referendum to show that members have genuinely agreed to forgo their rights. Many large schemes already have member trustees although some are appointed by management. Some trustees may also be appointed by unions. The government said it did not wish its new law to upset existing arrangements which had proved satisfactory to both scheme members and employers. Schemes which opt out of the member-trustee requirement should be allowed to do so for no more than six years at a time before being asked to review the arrangement. Under the proposals existing trustees should be responsible for determining appropriate procedures for the nomination and selection of member-nominated trustees, although employees should have the right to challenge those procedures. Also, no employer should be allowed to remove a member-appointed trustee, even if that employee is sacked or leaves voluntarily. Member-trustees may only be removed by a unanimous vote of the remaining trustees or by the new pensions regulator, the proposals suggest.</p>

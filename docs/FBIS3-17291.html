There is  no end to attacks by armed gangs demanding large ransoms for  hostages taken from among the civilian population. Schools and  apartment blocks are being set on fire. There have been plenty  of killings. Muggings alternate with car thefts. The armed  formations looting and pillaging in South Ossetia and Abkhazia  seem to now be exploring new territory -- parts of Georgia that  have been settled since time immemorial by the 500,000-strong  Azerbaijani community.    In the past Zviad Gamsakhurdia was keen on Georgianizing  this  area, freeing the hands of the "bandit formations" who began  getting rich by looting and pillaging. The Azerbaijanis  suffered least during the Georgian wars of the last few years  and were partially able to retain their possessions. But, in  the past year alone, 65 Azerbaijanis from Dmanisi, Marneuli, and  Bolnisi have been abducted.    The fight against the armed gangs has been stepped up  following intervention by the Azerbaijani leadership and  vigorous measures by Georgian Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze.  However, Georgia's Azerbaijani communities think that one-shot  actions cannot solve these problems since it is not only radical  nationalists, but also outside forces trying to complicate the  situation in Georgia with "another Karabakh" that have an  interest in the confrontation.    The situation in the region has had a palpable impact  primarily on the Georgian economy. Azerbaijanis cannot  cultivate the land under the barrel of a gun and the fields have  not been sown. The market has lost an appreciable amount of  food. Gangs are active on the highways linking the  "Azerbaijani" regions with Tbilisi and Baku, and the Georgian  militia itself is not averse to exacting dues from the peasants  and confiscating produce.    Observers think it extremely dubious that the Georgian  authorities are capable of imposing order in the region given  the chaos reigning in the country. The Azerbaijanis are asking  Heydar Aliyev to help and vigorously defend his compatriots.  The situation has not improved even after Eduard Shevardnadze  received a group of Azerbaijani elders. Leaders of Azerbaijan's  political parties are voicing fears that the situation itself  will force the Azerbaijanis to take up arms in order to defend  their families.</p>

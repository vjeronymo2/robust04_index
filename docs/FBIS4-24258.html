			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Claire Gebhardt] </F>   [Text] Less than 5 percent of companies and only about 20  percent of taxpayers will end up shouldering South Africa's R4  billion [rand] transition cost.    Commissioner of Inland Revenue Trevor van Heerden confirmed  at a Nedbank/Old Mutual Budget Forum in Cape Town that only  about 15,000 of the 330,000 companies registered have taxable  income which exceeds R50,000 -- and these are mostly blue-chip  companies.    Experts said this was indicative of the financial  difficulties companies faced as a result of the recession and  the fact that many companies were dormant.    However, it could also be attributed to the practice by  which  many companies reduce their taxable income by inflating certain  expenses such as directors' fees.    Other ploys include buying groceries through a company  credit  card, overseas entertainment and sundry other expenses.    They said many companies would now be looking to defer  income  and advance expenditure to avoid the levy.    On the personal tax side, fewer than a million taxpayers out  of a total of about 4.5 million will have to dig into their  pockets to fork out the 5 percent levy.    Van Heerden also confirmed that a negligible number of  married women earn taxable income above R175,000 a year --  making this concession almost meaningless.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "First Thing" </F> program]    [Text] The fail-safe policy of boosting incentive programs  to reward the most efficient workers in certain economic sectors  is an invaluable tool of motivation at times when the Cuban  family is experiencing acute material shortages in terms of food  and services, such as electricity, water, gas, and  transportation. It was explained that work incentives were first  introduced in selected sectors such as tourism, ports, repairs,  electric plants, mining, and the sugar industry to mention a few  examples. Given the shortage of resources, the idea of rewarding  a greater number of sectors with larger incentives is out of the  question. If the resources were available, however, it would be  absurd to reward every worker equally regardless of their labor  contributions. Although this type of argument is strong enough  to not require further explanation, it is logical that those who  endure daily limitations will take longer to understand this  fail-safe policy.    Independent of the necessary understanding of the people,  however, we need to listen to these who call for modest  incentives at nonproduction workplaces that do not accrue hard  currency. The idea of rewarding the most efficient workers at  facilities that are not economically essential has merit if,  from a realistic point of view, we acknowledge that some reward  or modest services can also play a role while we wait for  greater incentives.    It would be good to adopt such a policy in budgeted  facilities on the basis of local or provincial initiatives  resulting in modest incentives -- given their actual value -- to  meet a number of current expectations. A center not related to  production praiseworthy for its efficiency, where management and  the union arranges for its workers and their relatives services  such as shoe and home appliance repairs, a special lunch, or  reservations at a leisure camp, will thereby motivate workers  demoralized by the loss of their purchasing power. Other  motivational formulas could stem from initiatives from sectors  with unique characteristics such as health and education, where  it is imperative to find mechanisms to reduce the personnel  exodus. Management and the unions face an unexplored path they  must now undertake. The effort, however, will be worth its while  if simple incentive formulas, which do not burden the payroll  budget, are found.</p>

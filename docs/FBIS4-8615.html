			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 14 (TANJUG) -- Co-chairman of the  conference on former Yugoslavia Lord Owen on Thursday assessed  as very good the agreement on a general cease-fire in civil war  torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was proposed by Bosnian Serb  leader Radovan Karadzic.    In a statement to reporters following talks with Serbian  President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade, Lord Owen explained  that the agreement called for the deployment of the U.N.  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) between the warring sides.    It is very important for UNPROFOR to be there because that  would reduce the risk of new armed confrontations, Lord Owen  said.    Lord Owen said that progress had been achieved in the talks  with Milosevic and that he now felt there was reason for greater  optimism.    Lord Owen and the other co-chairman of the international  conference on former Yugoslavia, Thorvald Stoltenberg, who was  also present at the meeting with Milosevic, said that there were  three phases in the present diplomatic activities for resolving  the Bosnian crisis.    The first phase begins on Friday when the co-chairmen and  special Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin will leave for Pale and  Sarajevo, the seat of the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Moslems.    The second phase will be the signing of the peace agreement.    The final phase will begin only after the general cease-fire  agreement is reached. That phase will cover the precise drawing  of maps, the determining of borders between the Serb republic  and the Croat-Moslem federation and the lifting of the  sanctions, Lord Owen said.    The U.N. Security Council imposed comprehensive and binding  sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in late May  1992 because of its alleged involvement in the war of local  Serbs, Croats and Moslems in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Churkin, who joined the talks between the co-chairmen and  Milosevic, explained Moscow's stand on this issue, Lord Owen  said.    Lord Owen said that if they [word indistinct] be partners in  the peace process, then that partnership should not cover only  the drawing of maps, but also the specification of the process  of the gradual suspension of the sanctions.    Prior to today's joint meeting with the co-chairmen, Churkin  met with Milosevic three times in the past 24 hours.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Observer: Island in the sun As the Bundesbank snootily left its all-important discount rate untouched yesterday, it was all too much for Europe's pressured finance officials. Asked about a possible devaluation of the krone, Danish central bank chief Erik Hoffmeyer snapped: 'I absolutely exclude it. American bankers will not be allowed to decide our monetary policy.' American bankers? Not many of those in the upper echelons of Buba. No, Hoffmeyer - who obviously has a long memory - could be thinking of Robin Marshall, the thoroughly English, Oxford-educated chief economist of Chase in London who paid the Danes a visit back in February. Marshall, who was greeted at the airport by hordes of journalists and was taken aback at the interest his trip aroused, made the point that punishing domestic interest rate levels suggested the krone was ripe for devaluation, if not outright suspension from the ERM. No country likes foreigners being rude about its currency, and the Danes acted particularly wounded. The stock market duly fell. But the local press comforted itself with the thought that the view was typical 'of the islanders who are biased by the pound's unworthy exit from the EMS', and perhaps only to be expected from a graduate of one of 'the right British universities'.</p>

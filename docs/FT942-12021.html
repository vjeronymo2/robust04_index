			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / People: Pannonplast's Feher ahead of the pack Eastern Europe's communist economies produced few great managers, writes Nicholas Denton. Nor, despite official lip service to sexual equality, did the former Soviet bloc allow many women to rise to the top in business. But there are exceptions, and Erzsebet Feher, managing director of Hungarian plastics group Pannonplast, is one. Under her leadership, Pannonplast was an east bloc pioneer in the 1980s; it took up World Bank credits and set up joint ventures with western manufacturers. And this week the company completes its privatisation: Ft1.83bn (Dollars 18m) worth of Pannonplast shares are on offer to foreign institutional investors and the Hungarian public. 'She's always been ahead of the pack,' says an investment banker who has worked closely with her. While westerners often make a hobby of complaining about Hungarian managers, they swoon before Feher. Advisers break off from moaning about the tedium and uselessness of meetings in Hungary to marvel about the amount of ground they can cover with Feher. Feher finds the acclaim all rather embarrassing. A genuinely modest person, she is far happier talking about her company than herself. Pressed to reveal what makes her tick, Feher reluctantly ventures her sporting background. Now 58, she played ping-pong for Hungary's national youth team and says it may have inculcated discipline and a fighting spirit. She is less proud of her gender. Indeed, Feher seems to agree with Hungarian male attitudes towards businesswomen; they can be petty, she says, and poor at seeing the big picture. But it only takes a meeting or two, Feher says, before male negotiating partners see that she is not like that.</p>

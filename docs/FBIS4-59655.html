			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 16 May (MENA) -- Interior Minister Hasan  al-Alfi has ordered the release of a large number of detainees  who, according to the State Security Intelligence services, have  renounced extremism, departure from the right religion, and  terrorist practices.    The Interior Ministry issued a statement saying these  releases demonstrate that various police agencies are fully  aware of movements of terrorist groups at home and abroad. It  also proves that these agencies firmly adhere to law and  legitimacy, honestly shoulder their national responsibility, and  highly appreciate the public's support for them in their  decisive confrontation with bloody terrorism and its elements,  which target the nation and its interests.    An official security source at the Interior Ministry  stressed  that the release reflects a firm and credible policy by the  Ministry regarding the emergency law; namely, that it should not  be applied except against the elements that pose a threat to  society.    The source said that these release orders will be  implemented  within hours, and will be followed by releases of other  detainees whose files and positions on terrorism and extremism  are now being reviewed by the State Security Intelligence  agencies.</p>

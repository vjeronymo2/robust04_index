			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Portsmouth &amp; Sunderland up 20% but sees growth slowing Portsmouth &amp; Sunderland Newspapers, the publishing and retailing group, yesterday warned profits growth was expected to slow following the loss of two substantial printing contracts over the next two years. Mr Christopher Brims, chief executive, described the group's 20 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 7.5m as satisfactory in spite of difficult trading conditions. Sales for the 53 weeks to April 2 rose to Pounds 112.1m, compared with Pounds 103m for the previous 52 weeks. Stripping out the extra week, pre-tax profits were 6 per cent higher, on sales up by 7 per cent. Mr Brims said P&amp;S would face a difficult two years, following the decision by the Daily Mail not to renew its printing contract. The Independent contract, which expires in 1996, was also under review. These two contracts represented two thirds of the Pounds 12m printing business. The chief executive was confident growth in the publishing and retail business would offset the loss of the contracts. Advertising was reviving across the board. The strongest growth came from recruitment advertising, which was 20 per cent up in volume. The convenience store division increased profits by 25 per cent on sales 11 per cent higher for the comparable 52 weeks. This was partly due to expansion - nine outlets were added. Publishing increased profits by 23 per cent on sales ahead 3 per cent. This was due both to increased advertising revenues and the benefits of rationalisation. P&amp;S took an exceptional charge of Pounds 1.7m to pay for rationalisation. Earnings increased were 13 per cent ahead to 41p. Excluding the extra week, earnings fell by 1 per cent. The final dividend is raised to 7.52p for a total of 10.64p (9.46p).</p>

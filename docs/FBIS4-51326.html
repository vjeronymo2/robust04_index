			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Fang Jin (2455 3866)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- Wang Zhaoguo, director  of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central  Committee, met here with a delegation from the federation of  textile-related guilds of Hong Kong this afternoon.    The group, consisting of more than 20 members, including  (Tang Jiqian), (Chen Ruiqiu) and (Fang Keng), arrived in Beijing  on 24 May. Wang Zhaoguo welcomed the representatives of Hong  Kong's textile trades. He thanked people of Hong Kong's  textile-related trades for joining their mainland counterparts  in working hard for economic development during China's reform  and opening up period. He also thanked people of Hong Kong's  industrial and business circles for their work in the  development of education and public welfare on the mainland.    The federation of textile-related trades of Hong Kong, set  up  in 1989 and composed of textile, dyeing, garment, and eight  other guilds, represents Hong Kong's textile and garment  industries. It is one of the largest industrial organizations  in Hong Kong. The federation's board of directors is composed  of well-known industrialists and businessmen of Hong Kong. Most  of the members of the federation have invested in running  factories on the mainland. The current visit by the delegation  is for the purpose of enabling Hong Kong's textile and garment  industries to increase contacts with the relevant central  departments, know more about the situation of reform and opening  up on the mainland, and expand relations and cooperation with  the mainland. During their stay in Beijing, the members of the  delegation will pay courtesy calls on the responsible persons of  the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, the  United Front Work Department, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation, the Ministry of Internal Trade, the China  Textile Council, and other departments concerned.    Wang Zhaoguo said during the meeting: Over the last decade  since the start of reform and opening up, China has made  tremendous economic progress, with a rapid increase in  investment by people from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. With  the economic and trade relations between Hong Kong and the  mainland becoming closer and closer, Hong Kong and the mainland  have been economically linked together, complementing each other  and working for a common prosperity.    Wang Zhaoguo exchanged views with the representatives of  Hong  Kong's textile and garment industries on questions of concern,  such as how to work more for Hong Kong's economic prosperity and  smooth transition.</p>

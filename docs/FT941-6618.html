			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Observer: Going forth to multiply If the European Central Bank has yet to pick a figurehead to engrave on its banknotes, it could do worse than Mayer Amschel Rothschild, whose birth 250 years ago in Frankfurt was yesterday being celebrated by a gathering of the clan in the German financial capital. That at least was the respectful opinion of the town's mayor after listening to the encomium delivered by Lord Jacob Rothschild to the founder of the eminent banking dynasty. The English Lord related how Mayer Amschel built up a prototypical European Union when he sent out five of his sons on their famous journey from Frankfurt's Jewish ghetto to European capital cities. 'He had a vision of a network of European countries collaborating and improving their communal lot,' Lord Rothschild recalled, squeezing in a quote from an essay penned by his Aunt Miriam. As was readily apparent, the clan's knowledge of the lingo of western Europe's largest country is virtually non-existent, and the group's axis is indeed firmly Anglo-French. The German branch of the family died out in the early years of the century, and the family had no presence in Frankfurt until a small office was opened in 1989, which today has fewer than 10 professionals on its staff. After Chancellor Kohl and retinue helped crown the proceedings last night at the Jewish museum, it must surely be one of the most feted outposts in the world.</p>

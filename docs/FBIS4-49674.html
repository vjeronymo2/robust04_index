			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  has called for the strengthening of friendly contacts between  China and India with a view to promoting Sino-Indian friendship  and cooperation.    Li expressed the hope at a meeting here today with Arjun  Singh, Indian minister of human resources development, who has  been here to preside over the Indian cultural festival which  opened in the capital today.    Li wished the festival a success, saying the festival has  brought India's ancient and splendid culture to China. The  festival is itself a direct contribution to enhancing the  friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples, he said.    China and India, both civilized ancient countries and  bordering each other, have all reasons to be friendly neighbors,  Li said, adding that in recent years, the relations between the  two countries have been developing smoothly, featured by  "positive achievements" in quite a few fields.    Some outstanding questions between China and India will  finally be solved properly so long as both sides cooperate  sincerely, Li believed.    Singh believed that the current Indian cultural festival  will  also turn out a success as the Chinese cultural festival held in  India in 1992. He said that the holding of the two festivals  was decided by Li Peng and Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha  Rao in 1991.    The minister said the Indian Government will continue its  efforts to further consolidate and develop the relations between  the two countries.    Present at the meeting were Cultural Minister Liu Zhongde  and  Vice Cultural Minister Liu Deyou.</p>

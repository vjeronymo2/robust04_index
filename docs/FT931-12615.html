			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: New French futures contract welcomed THE new French futures contract based on long-dated government bonds is expected to get a warm reception when it starts trading today on the Matif, the Paris futures exchange. Traders expect the FLT contract to be popular both with speculators and with investors seeking to hedge their portfolios. It will be one of the few contracts in Europe, apart from those in the Ecu and Dutch markets, whereby investors can play the yield curve up to 30 years. Daily volume is expected initially to be around 20,000 contracts, but should increase. However, the Matif's 10-year bond future, which trades an average of 120,000 contracts a day, is expected to remain the most active. The creation of the French treasury bond futures contract has been made possible by the existence of a mature underlying market, itself the result of the government's decision to extend its debt profile in recent years. The total outstanding of cash OATs with a maturity of 15 years and over now stands at FFr178.9bn. Since 1987, average monthly issuance in France has increased progressively, and in 1992 average volume per month was around FFr8bn. The French treasury has announced that it will issue FFr220bn worth of OATs, of which almost half is expected to be at the longer end. Four OATS, due 2008, 2012, 2019 and 2023, totalling FFr172.3bn, will be deliverable into the FLT contract, of which the OAT due 2023 will be the cheapest to deliver into the March contract. Groupe Worms has joined Robert Fleming, the UK bank, in taking a controlling minority stake in Ifabanque, one of the few Arab institutions still operating in the west. Banque Worms, part of the UAP group, has ceded its place in Ifabanque, which is two-thirds owned by Kuwaiti and Saudi Arabian shareholders, to Groupe Worms.</p>

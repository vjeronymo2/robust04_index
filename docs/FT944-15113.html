			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Nestle bridles at Thai price curbs Thailand has put instant coffee on a list of products subject to price control, prompting veiled suggestions from Nestle, the Swiss foods multinational, that foreign investors would take offence at the move. Nestle - whose Thai subsidiary Quality Coffee Products has more than 80 per cent of the local instant coffee market - angered the government by raising prices 10 per cent in July and by refusing commerce ministry demands to reverse the price increase. The dispute came to a head this week when the cabinet authorised the ministry to put instant coffee on the list of controlled consumer products. Instant coffee had been removed from the list two years ago along with 100 other products as part of an economic liberalisation drive. 'This restrictive measure applied to a non-essential product may prove prejudicial to Thailand,' said Mr Andreas Schlaepfer, managing director of the Thai Nestle group, 'particularly since this case has attracted the attention of foreign investors in the region.' He said the 10 per cent rise, the first in three years, was to offset higher operating costs and was unrelated to rising world coffee prices. 'It's not a monopolistic situation at all,' he said. 'There are two other factories here, with large installed capacity and the right technology.' Businessmen in Bangkok believe Nestle has fallen foul of the Thai government's attempts to control inflation, which reached 5.3 per cent in September.</p>

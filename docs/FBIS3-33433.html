			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A new element was introduced on 22 February in the  Haitian political crisis. The National Front for Change and  Democracy, FNCD, made public in Washington on 22 February a  proposal for a solution to the crisis. A plan issued after a  plenary session by some parties and organizations close to the  FNCD was thus presented to the UN secretary general. In this  document the FNCD legislators repeated, but in a different  order, the priorities and the steps necessary to put an end to  the political crisis. The FNCD plan, which does not indicate a  specific date for the return of President Aristide, provides in  point seven the process for his return. Regarding the  nomination and the installation of a new prime minister, the  FNCD advocates in this plan, first a vote on some essential laws  including the one on amnesty and the retirement of General Raoul  Cedras. In presenting this plan on 22 February, Senator Turneb  Delpe, the FNCD spokesman, guaranteed that a large sector of  national political opinion supported him. Senator Turneb Delpe  presented the various points of this plan advocated by the FNCD:    [Begin recording] [Delpe] A vote on the laws: a) Amnesty;  b) Separation of the police from the Army; c) international  cooperation; 1.2 [number as heard]: anticipated retirement of  Gen. Raoul Cedras; 1.3: Nomination and ratification of a new  commander in chief of Haiti's Armed Forces; 1.4: Nomination  and ratification of a new prime minister; 1.5: Formation of a  government of national concord; 1.6: Suspension of the  sanctions; 1.7: Return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide;  1.8: Lifting of the sanctions. Resolution 2: A delegation  of political leaders and FNCD legislators will go to Washington  to promote this realistic compromise to President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide and the representatives of the international community.  [Reporter Clarence Renois, in Creole] Senator Delpe, did you  discuss this plan with President Aristide and what is his  position on this proposed plan? [Delpe, in Creole] We did not  make the plan public yet because we wanted to discuss it with  him. Generally speaking, we can say that he does not have much  objection to it, although he has his own opinion. When he  examines it he thinks that there will be some sequences he  disagrees with, since he feels that the anticipated retirement  of Gen. Raoul Cedras must come before the nomination and  ratification of a prime minister. [end recording]</p>

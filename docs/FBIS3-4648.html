			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] PHNOM PENH, Feb 28 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge guerrillas  launched heavy counter-attacks against government troops at a  major rebel base in northwest Cambodia which was captured early  this month, government and military officials said Monday.  "Since the February 19 the Khmer Rouge launched attacks against  Anlong Veng, especially using artillery," Cambodian army General  Chum Chheang said. "But our forces are still resisting the  Khmer Rouge attacks."    Heavy guerrilla shelling, however, forced government troops  to make "tactical retreats" from certain parts of the base which  stretches for several kilometers, he said. The guerrillas were  also splitting up into small groups and attacking government  troops "from everywhere", he said. The general, however, denied  reports that the Khmer Rouge had re-captured all of Anlung Veng.  "It's not true. Our troops are still in Anlung Veng, we just  move tactically around the area," he said.    A government minister, speaking on condition of anonymity,  acknowledged there was a major guerrillla assault against the  base. "The situation is still confusing," he said. "But we are  building up new fighting forces to kick the Khmer Rouge away  completely from the area."    Anlung Veng, which fell to the government February 5, was  the  Khmer Rouge's headquarters for all guerrilla operations in north  and central Cambodia. The guerrillas retreated rather than face  the 3,000-strong government force in a conventional battle. But,  operating in small units from the hills and jungle around the  base, the guerrillas have continued to stage hit-and-run attacks  on the government forces.    Western military analysts said the government may be  over-stretching its resources trying to maintain and supply  large numbers of men in the remote and inhospitable area, and  they warned that the conquerors could become targets for  fast-moving teams of guerrillas. A high-ranking defence  official, however, said the army was aware of the threat.  "Anlung Veng may be a trap, so we have to prepare for  everything," he said.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Keeping a check on office air quality Headaches, dizziness and allergic reactions can all be caused by the dust, gases and microbes in every office. As the number of ozone-emitting photocopiers and printers increases, so moves to newer offices compound the problem by cutting off natural ventilation such as draughts. To detect poor air quality Winton Environmental Services, of Worcester Park, Surrey, has developed a monitor which continuously checks, during office hours, whether the air is likely to cause illnesses. The Monitair 393 checks for bacteria, fungi, carbon dioxide and formaldehyde - often emitted from soft furnishings - as well as dust and ozone. The samples are removed every three weeks and tested. A summary of the results and recommendations are then given to the company. Winton Environmental Services: UK, 081 337 0731.</p>

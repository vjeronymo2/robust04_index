			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / S Africa trade surplus falls South Africa's trade surplus fell in September to just R168m (Pounds 30.5m), precipitating a sharp rise in local bond yields. Imports dropped slightly to R7.4bn from August's R8.1bn, exports fell even more sharply to R7.6bn from R8.4bn, bringing total trade surplus so far this year to R10.6bn, well down on R14.9bn for the same nine months in 1993.

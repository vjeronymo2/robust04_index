			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Observer: Alone in the Strand That bespectacled Australian scuttling down the Strand with his face hidden behind a newspaper on Monday was probably Neil Pickard, the New South Wales agent general. John Fahey, the premier of New South Wales, told parliament in Sydney yesterday that he had dismissed Pickard after receiving 'inconsistent and unconvincing' explanations for unauthorised travel in continental Europe last week. To make matters worse, Fahey had had a spot of difficulty contacting Pickard to convey the news of the termination of his ADollars 200,000-a-year job. It was only when the premier got through to the doorman and conveyed the urgency of his message that his call was actually returned. Pickard flies back to Sydney in only slightly more controversial circumstances than those in which he left from down under last year. The former energy minister came to London courtesy of Nick Greiner, the then NSW premier, after Pickard lost his state parliament seat following an electoral redistribution. But this was rather inconsistent with Greiner's campaign promises to end the 'jobs for the boys' syndrome which has long dogged the state, and contributed to Greiner's own downfall earlier this year in a corruption scandal surrounding another appointment. Meanwhile, Fahey's decision not to replace Pickard may unnerve the other four Australian agent generals left in London. Justifying a presence that has more to do with the states' relations with Britain in a bygone colonial age becomes increasingly delicate when the richest and most populous state is willing to let the Australian High Commission do the job.</p>

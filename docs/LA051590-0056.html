			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REVIEW;  </P> <P> POWAY CENTER EARNS POP KUDOS  </P> <P> Opening nights aren't supposed to go this smoothly, particularly the premiere  production in a brand-new venue.  </P> <P> You always expect at least some complications: a malfunctioning sound system,  an out-of-sync spotlight, a problem with getting people seated on time, a  miscued curtain drop.  </P> <P> But when the Poway Center for the Performing Arts celebrated its grand opening  Saturday night with a black-tie benefit concert by pop singer-songwriter  Melissa Manchester, patrons were treated to a remarkably glitch-free  production, from start to finish.  </P> <P> It was as much a tribute to the staff's careful prep work as a good omen for  the facility's future as a cultural center.  </P> <P> The sound system worked perfectly, beaming Manchester's voice into every nook  and cranny of the 800-seat theater, regardless of whether she was belting out  her parade of late-1970s, early-'80s Top 40 hits with full-band accompaniment  or singing softly into the microphone, a cappella.  </P> <P> The spotlight tracked her every move, even when she was rapidly pacing the  stage during an inspired rendition of the gospelish "Oh Heaven."  </P> <P> The lobby lights flickered on and off a few minutes prior to show time, giving  lollygagging patrons a little encouragement to step along.  </P> <P> Flashing their tickets to the ushers, they were then promptly directed, and  sometimes escorted, to their seats -- the ushers having a good handle on the  floor plan.  </P> <P> And, at the end of the concert, the curtain came down at precisely the right  moment, just as Manchester and her band members were taking their final bows.  </P> <P> Even the pre- and post-concert receptions went off without a hitch.  </P> <P> Before the show, there was an ample supply of Champagne, wine and hors  d'oeuvres. And exiting patrons were handed boxes of truffles as they made their  way into the lobby for a nightcap of fresh-brewed coffee and cookies.  </P> <P> The only complaints heard all night were that the "Telephones" sign in the  lobby pointed to an empty hole in the wall and that the absence of working  doorstops somewhat impeded the exodus.  </P> <P> And these were but minor, easily resolved annoyances with the facility itself,  which was built at a cost of $8.4 million by the city of Poway, the Poway  Unified School District, and the nonprofit Poway Foundation for the Performing  Arts.  </P> <P> Manchester's 90-minute performance was almost as flawless as the production.  Her middle-of-the road repertoire and Las Vegasy delivery might not be for  everyone, but anyone who caught her show must concede that she's extremely good  at what she does.  </P> <P> After a brief orchestral overture consisting of several bars of her best-known  hits, Manchester came on stage wearing a sequined, black dress and immediately  sat down behind a grand piano for a seductive rendition of "Easy," a  quintessential torch song.  </P> <P> She then chatted with the audience ("You all look absolutely stunning") before  resuming her set with a pair of originals, "Shine Like You Should" and  "Midnight Blue," her first big hit, which peaked at No. 6 on Billboard's Hot  100 chart in 1975.  </P> <P> As the evening progressed, it became increasingly apparent that Manchester has  matured considerably as a singer in the eight years since her last chart hit,  1982's "You Should Hear How She Talks About You."  </P> <P> Her earlier recordings were too often marred by excessive vocal histrionics,  but singing them here on stage, many years later, she exercised a lot more  restraint, allowing the purity and clarity of her rich, rangy voice to shine  through at last.  </P> <P> As a result, Manchester's four big hits -- the other two are "Don't Cry Out  Loud," with which she ended the show, and "Just You and I," her encore --  sounded a lot better live than they did on record.  </P> <P> Manchester also sang compelling versions of Dionne Warwick's "Walk On By" and  "Whenever I Call You Friend," the smash Kenny Loggins-Stevie Nicks duet she  co-wrote in 1978.  </P> <P> Her finest vocal performance, however, was reserved for a medley of vintage pop  classics from her recently released comeback album, "Tribute." The album  consists entirely of covers of songs made famous by legendary female singers  she cites as her early influences, including Billie Holiday, Judy Garland and  Rosemary Clooney.  </P> <P> Manchester did these songs justice. Her version of Garland's "Over the  Rainbow," in particular, was simply superb.LINDA HECHT / Photo for The Times  </P></p>

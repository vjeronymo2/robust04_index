			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents] </F>   [Text] Bonn May 13 TASS -- German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel told the Russian president on Friday that Germany is  ready to promote Russian integration into European organisations.    "We have stated our readiness to help Russia in its joining  all European structures which are important for it at present --  the Council of Europe, GATT. We also intend to support your  country in joining the trade regime, which will be set up after  the elimination of Cocom [Coordinating Committee for  Multilateral Export Control], and surely, (in joining) the  `Partnership for Peace'", he told reporters describing his talk  with Boris Yeltsin.    The problem of mutual restitution of cultural valuables  seized during the Second World War was also raised. "We  understand the delicacy with which the Russian side treats the  issue. But I once again drew the attention of the president to  the great importance of the problem for us", Kinkel told TASS.</p>

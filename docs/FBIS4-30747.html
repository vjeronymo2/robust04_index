			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by Edith Heller </F> in Warsaw; date not given: "The Poles Have Always Found a Way  Out"]    [Text] [Heller] The news we get from Poland is very  contradictory. On the one hand, Poland has the highest economic  growth rate in Europe -- some people even speak about the future  "European tiger." On the other hand, your successor in the  "Solidarity" trade union, Krzaklewski, said recently that there  have been as many as 774 strikes this year. Doesn't that prove  that a large part of the population does not see any progress?    [Walesa] If you view Poland from the perspective of stable  democracies, you may consider what is happening in our country  as anarchy. But you cannot measure us by your standards. Prior  to our revolution, we were all equally poor. Now we are  building capitalism -- which has led to gross inequalities. The  people do not strike because they are worse off than in the  past, but because others are better off than they. The strikes  are not protests against the reforms. They are protests for the  reforms -- for more justice, more law, and more security.    [Heller] How large are the percentages of "winners" and  "losers"?    [Walesa] I would say one-third of the people have already  the same or even a better living standards than the people in  the West. Another 30 percent live a bit better than they did  four years ago. Approximately 20-30 percent are a bit worse off.  These latter people live in small towns where the only factory  was closed down and no new ones have been set up.    [Heller] Is the number of discontented people large enough  to provoke serious social unrest?    [Walesa] A total of 20 percent discontented people would be  a lot if they were concentrated in Warsaw or Gdansk. But these  people are spread throughout the country. That is why a massive  outbreak of dissatisfaction cannot be anticipated.    [Heller] However, the success is measurable. Last year, the  gross domestic product increased by 4 percent, production and  consumption by 8 percent each. Where do you see the cause of  this success?    [Walesa] It was important for us to get rid of our  handcuffs.    [Heller] That does not always work. Many reform states have  made similar efforts.    [Walesa] There are cleverer and less-clever people. The  Poles have always found a way out.    [Heller] However, regarding foreign investment, Poland is  still lagging behind Hungary, which is much smaller. German and  Austrian investors see more favorable conditions in the Czech  Republic. What advantages do your neighbors offer?    [Walesa] Today they are better, but tomorrow, our system  will at least be twice as effective. The Czech Republic has had  good results with small changes. Take agriculture, for  instance. We are about to really privatize everything. In the  Czech Republic, they have not even started privatizing the  agricultural sector.    The Czechs also proceeded differently with the privatization  of industry. They distributed shares and vouchers in their  companies. If I said that this is a "higher form of socialism,"  they would perhaps be offended -- but it actually was a sort of  distribution system. That is why everything went relatively  fast. What we are doing is try and find new individual owners  for as many companies as possible -- and that takes longer.    [Heller] Don't you see a danger that privatization in Poland  will be slowed down by the new left-wing government?    [Walesa] No. The change of government last fall has led the  process a bit off course, but it will get back on the right  track again.    [Heller] Do you think Poland will, in the foreseeable  future, be accepted into the European Union and NATO?    [Walesa] The West should be more interested in our  membership than we are, for the following simple reason: We are  lagging 10 or even 20 years behind. We will catch up, whereas  you will run the risk of falling behind, if you isolate yourself.    The West suffers from overproduction. We lack production  capacities. That is why the West should have an interest in  taking us in, in order to make money and fill the gaps.    You also draw superficial conclusions in connection with  NATO. You say that we are afraid of Russia and therefore want to  seek refuge with the West. However, that is not true. The  Russians do not threaten us; they had us, and we did not do them  good. If the Russians want to have someone, it is you, the West  -- not us.    [Heller] If Poland is not threatened, could it not become  a neutral state like Switzerland?    [Walesa] Poland is too large. Its central position between  east and west, north and south plays a role in this respect.  Poland cannot afford neutrality, nor will the world permit it  to be neutral.    [Heller] One of the factors deciding on Poland's future is  inner stability. We are having doubts in this respect. You  fight against every government, and there is a permanent "war of  the elites."    [Walesa] Do not forget that we do not yet have a ready  system, we do not even have a new constitution! I provoke, in  order to point out shortcomings. The point is not my person. I  have assumed the task of leading my country in this difficult  time, in order to build a new and modern Poland. A good system  is created by way of discussion and debate.    [Heller] Why are you seeking a presidential system? Could a  strong government, controlled by Parliament, and a merely  "representative" president not serve Poland equally well?    [Walesa] Of course. But the difficulties regarding the  reforms are like a storm at sea. In such a moment, there cannot  be 10 captains on board. That is why we need a good helmsman  with more options than in the past.    In addition, you will certainly also have heard that my  popularity is declining. However, it is only declining because  I am not efficient. I know what to do, but I cannot carry it  out, because I do not have executive powers. The people tell me  that I promised something but did not keep my word. All this  will repeat itself with the next president.    [Heller] How do you feel as president? You complained the  other day that you do not have enough time to fulfill your  duties as husband.    [Walesa] In times of large changes and great reforms, it is,  of course, a tough job. Once law and order and stability have  been restored, one will like this office.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 16 -- The Senate on Thursday adopted  the unchanged version of the law on the management of property  left to the state treasury by the Russian Army formerly  stationed in Poland. Senators had proposed a few changes in the  text but the house finally rejected them in order to finish work  on this urgent issue.    The newly-adopted law says that the property is now managed  by provincial governors who may pass this responsibility on to  local governments if the latter want it. Forests will be  administered by the state forests management. Property of  special importance for national defence will be taken over by  the Defence Ministry.    The former Soviet and later Russian Army left in Poland  nearly 8,000 buildings and other property worth over 158 million  U.S. dollars. To upgrade this property to a reasonable  condition, Poland will have to spend nearly 93 million U.S.  dollars, while the estimated value of ecological damage amounts  to about 53 trillion zlotys (2.5 billion U.S. dollars). Some  30-40 per cent of the property, mainly buildings, have already  been overhauled and are used.    The Senate also adopted the law on restructuring the  co-operative banks. Under this law, the co-operative banks will  be grouped in nine regional banks, and the Bank of Food Economy  (BGZ) will be transformed into a joint stock company and will  play the role of the national bank. Within five years, its  shares will be sold to cooperative banks.    The Senate decided to make no changes in the recently  amended  law on corporate income tax. According to the amendemnt, bank  reserves covering bad credits will be considered as the bank's  costs and in that way banks will pay lower taxes. If the  amended law is signed by the president, the state central budget  will get 1.7 trillion zlotys less.</p>

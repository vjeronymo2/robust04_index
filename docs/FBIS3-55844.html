			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] One more word on the NATO summit to say that  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has denounced the French proposal on air  strikes in Bosnia. In his tactful style, he described the  proposal as being fascist. He said so in the Duma corridor  today during the first session of the two chambers of the new  parliament. Before it started its work, the Duma observed two  minutes of silence in memory of the victims of the revolt of  last October.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Letter: Not so good with VAT numbers Sir, Charles Batchelor ('Negotiating the barriers', June 1) rightly refers to the difficulties and burdensome administration of new rules on value-added tax, especially the completion of statistical trading reports. One might be impressed by the apparent sophistication of Customs &amp; Excise computer systems to process such volumes of trade data. However, we find it astonishing that VAT offices are able to confirm whether a VAT number applies to a particular European company, but, given the names, are unable to advise the correct VAT number for the occasional firms that our time-consuming and expensive mail, fax and phone communications have been unsuccessful in obtaining.

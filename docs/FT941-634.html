			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Metropolitan back in black with Pounds 7.2m Scottish Metropolitan, Scotland's largest property company, yesterday announced a return to profitability. It announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.16m for the six months to February 15, compared with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.18m for the comparable period. Mr Scott Cairns, managing director, was 'cautiously optimistic.' Although property values are increasing, demand from tenants is still weak, he said. 'The letting markets are very tough,' he added. The turnround in profitability resulted from a Pounds 5.05m gain on the sale of investment property, together with a reduction in net interest costs from Pounds 8.84m to Pounds 5.22m. Operating profits fell from Pounds 9.51m to Pounds 7.33m, mainly as a result of loss of revenue from buildings that were sold. The company's borrowings have fallen from Pounds 144.9m last August to Pounds 67.9m on February 15. During the period, the company raised Pounds 26.8m through a rights issue and sold six investment properties for Pounds 55.3m, showing a 10 per cent surplus over book value. In the second half of the year the company plans to sell buildings worth between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m, mainly in the south of England, as it implements its strategy of increasing its emphasis on Scottish prop-erty. It has spent Pounds 8.9m on acquisitions of industrial and retail property since the half-year end and has about Pounds 50m of unused facilities for further acquisitions as opportunities arise. Earnings per share were 6.19p, compared with losses of 1.32p. The interim dividend is lifted from 0.4p to 0.5p.</p>

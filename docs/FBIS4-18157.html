			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Finnish News Agency report: "Freedom From Alliances in the </F> Shade"]    [Text] Claes Andersson, Left Alliance [VL] Chairman, is  attacking Finland's foreign policy leadership for not having  acted with sufficient determination in the EU [European Union]  negotiations to keep the country out of military alliances. In  Helsinki on Saturday [12 March], Andersson asserted that the  country's striving for freedom from alliances had been mentioned  when Finland first applied for EU membership.    "An attempt has been made to conceal the freedom from  alliances [doctrine] in order not to jeopardize the membership  talks," he said.    According to Andersson, the strengthening of Russian troops  on Finland's eastern border is partly because Russia is  preparing against a change in Finnish security policy in the  event Finland becomes an EU member and that organization  develops its own defense policy cooperation.</p>

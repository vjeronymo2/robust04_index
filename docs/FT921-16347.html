			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / International Company News: Founder of Hyundai retires from business MR CHUNG JU-YUNG, founder and honorary chairman of the Hyundai group, one of South Korea's largest conglomerates, announced yesterday that he has retired from business to start 'a new venture', believed to be a new political party, AP-DJ reports from Seoul. 'I retired from the group's management as of December 31 1991, and now I will do a new venture,' Mr Chung said after meeting with senior company officials. He said Hyundai, which is the second largest chaebol, the conglomerates which dominate the South Korean economy, would now be run and controlled by his younger brother, Mr Chung Se-yung, who headed the successful expansion of the Hyundai car subsidiary into the world market. Last month Mr Chung Ju-yung had denied speculation that he was about to retire, saying he would spend the next three years restructuring his diversified business empire and then retire in 1994. Yesterday, Mr Chung did not say what the 'new venture' would be, but close associates said the 72-year-old businessman would enter politics and form a new political party soon. Mr Chung's move into politics would be highly unusual in a country where business leaders usually maintain close relations with politicians, particularly those in the government party. Mr Chung has been at odds with the South Korean government of President Roh Tae-woo because of his critical stand on its economic and other policies. Last year, Mr Chung and his family were forced to pay won 136.1bn in penalty taxes for allegedly illegal stock transactions aimed at evading inheritance or donation taxes. Mr Lee Myung-bak, Mr Chung's closest aide, also announced his retirement yesterday as chairman of Hyundai Engineering and Construction, Reuter reports from Seoul.</p>

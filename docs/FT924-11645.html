			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Factional row hits Japan's ruling party: Younger LDP members talk of new political grouping JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) was stricken yesterday by a dispute among its most powerful officials, prompting rumours within the party that new factions and even a new party could soon be formed. The confusion follows the choice of Mr Keizo Obuchi to lead the party's largest faction - formerly run by the party's 'godfather', Mr Shin Kanemaru, who resigned in disgrace last week after violating political funding laws. Mr Kanemaru had chosen Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a former party secretary-general, as his successor but other senior officials of the faction opposed the appointment and selected Mr Obuchi. He took office before a consensus had been reached, an unusual move in Japan. Fearing that Mr Ozawa could dominate the party if he controlled that faction, the heads of the four other factions supported Mr Obuchi, although he does not have majority support within his own group. These factions are not based on ideology, but on personalities. The largest faction, the Takeshita faction, owes its name to former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who was forced to resign in a separate scandal three years ago. The deep rifts within the Takeshita faction and among the other groups have prompted some younger LDP members to talk of new factions and parties. The conflict, unlikely to be settled quickly, has crippled the party's policy-making activities, and prompted widespread criticism of the LDP's neglect of government business. Mr Obuchi, 55, toured the offices of the faction heads yesterday, promising to 'heal the wounds' opened in recent days and to reform the scandal-prone Japanese political system. Mr Ozawa's enthusiasm for deep political reforms intimidated the party elders, who are comfortable with the more modest ambitions of Mr Obuchi, a former chief cabinet secretary. Meetings of senior faction officials are planned for this weekend. But it is unlikely the disputes will be resolved, prompting some Japanese commentators to call for the return of the disgraced Mr Kanemaru, who was capable of keeping order within the party. Mr Kanemaru had played an important role in mustering support for details of the recent emergency economic package. The appointment of the politically weak Mr Obuchi suggests the party now has no one capable of performing that powerbroking role.</p>

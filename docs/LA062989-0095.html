			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL CUTS $800 MILLION IN STEALTH BOMBER FUNDS  </P> <P> The House Armed Services Committee Wednesday scrambled the Bush  Administration's proposed $300-billion defense budget for next year, restoring  programs slated for cancellation by the Pentagon and slicing $800 million from  the B-2 stealth bomber production program.  </P> <P> In doing so, it defied both its chairman, Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), and Defense  Secretary Dick Cheney.  </P> <P> After a long session marked by haggling among committee members, Aspin proposed  undoing the day's work in what some lawmakers called a "King of the Hill"  amendment. Aspin asked that the committee adopt the Pentagon's proposed  $69-billion arms production budget request as it had been submitted to  Congress.  </P> <P> However, his amendment was rejected in a dramatic 26-26 vote, handing both  Aspin and Cheney a major defeat. Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) and Rep.  Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) passed during the roll call on the amendment but  then cast "no" votes that resulted in the tie and the amendment's defeat.  </P> <P> Lawmakers repeatedly cut into the Air Force's controversial stealth bomber  program in an effort to increase spending for other projects without increasing  the $300-billion budget.  </P> <P> Rep. G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.), in a successful effort to increase  purchasing funds for the National Guard and reserves, offered a provision that  would take $500 million from the stealth bomber's $2.7-billion production  budget. The panel voted also to direct the Air Force to shift $300 million in  B-2 production funds into the aircraft's research and development budget.  </P> <P> The aircraft's R&amp;D fund would remain at the level initially requested by  the Air Force, however, because the committee had taken $300 million from the  bomber's development Tuesday.  </P> <P> If approved by the full House and adopted by the Senate, the stealth cutbacks  would force Northrop Corp., which is building the aircraft, to scale back its  planned production of three airplanes in 1990. It might also force the company  to reduce its advance purchases of parts and equipment for the bomber.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Test Flights  </P> <P> In defending their votes to take production funds from the stealth bomber,  several lawmakers have argued that it would be premature to begin high rates of  production for the aircraft, which has not yet made its first flight. The  plane's flight tests have been delayed repeatedly because of technical  problems.  </P> <P> The bomber's price, now expected to soar well over $500 million apiece, also  has stirred concern on Capitol Hill. But defenders of the program argue that  the craft will bring revolutionary capabilities to the nation's bomber force  and warn that efforts to slow the program will only increase its final cost.  </P> <P> The B-2 is designed to penetrate Soviet airspace to hunt down and destroy the  Soviets' mobile missiles and the command bunkers into which Soviet leaders  would retreat in periods of international crisis. Its "flying-wing" design and  special coatings would allow the craft to elude Soviet radar while it streaks  over the Soviet homeland.  </P> <P> </P> <P> B-1 Bomber Troubled  </P> <P> The Air Force fears that, without the stealth bomber, it will lose its ability  to threaten such targets after the mid- to late 1990s. The troubles plaguing  the B-1 bomber, which critics believe would have problems penetrating Soviet  airspace, have added urgency to the development of the stealth bomber.  </P> <P> The bill approved by the committee, which is expected to come to the House  floor after members return from their Fourth of July recess, gives new life to  two programs that Cheney had proposed to terminate in a recent budget-cutting  drive.  </P> <P> The committee bill would restore funds for the development of a unique  tilt-rotor aircraft called the V-22 Osprey and for the continued production of  the Navy's F-14D fighter aircraft.  </P> <P> The bill would also transfer $1.2 billion from a wide range of Army and Air  Force programs -- including the B-2 bomber -- into equipment purchases for the  Guard and reserves.  </P> <P> In a 45-5 vote, the Democrat-controlled panel gave final approval to earlier  action cutting $1.1 billion from the Bush Administration's $4.9-billion "Star  Wars" request. But the panel rejected an amendment that would have denied the  Administration its requests to begin production of a new rail-basing plan for  the 10-warhead MX missile and to accelerate development of the small mobile  missile widely known as Midgetman.  </P> <P> Members warned that they would seek a further cut of $700 million in the "Star  Wars" research budget when the bill reaches the House floor. Lawmakers have  proposed using the additional savings to fund cleanup of the Energy  Department's troubled nuclear weapons complex, to fight drug smuggling and to  strengthen non-nuclear military forces.  </P> <P> The full House is expected to act on the bill during the week of July 23.  Members said that they would pose further challenges then to the  Administration's proposed nuclear missile programs, as well as to the B-2  bomber.  </P> <P> "It's not the end of the war, but it will be difficult for the House to change  things, since this is the committee bill," said Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.), who  spearheaded efforts to restore funds for the V-22 and the F-14D aircraft.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By special reporter Ching Chi (5427 2765)] </F>   [Text] The latest results of the examination by the  Chinese State Council's inspection team for investment in fixed  assets in Guangdong, Shanghai, Fujian, Sichuan and 10 other  provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions has shown that  various localities have continued to vie with one another in  starting new projects and increasing investment to an excessive  degree. The scale of investment was too large, and the  distribution of the investment was not rational. The problem  was rather prominent. The actual amount of investment arranged  by the state-owned institutions for capital construction in the  14 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions exceeded  the state plan by $60.9 billion, or 11.7 percent.    The State Council leadership stressed the need to increase  the intensity of macrocontrol this year; otherwise, the gross  amount of investment in fixed assets this year will exceed the  planned ceiling of 1,300 billion yuan.    The recent inspection found that, although Shanghai,  Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Shanxi, and other provinces and  municipalities arranged their own investment according to the  state plan, prefectures, cities, and counties increased the  scale of investment level by level. As a result, the total  exceeded the plan laid down by the provincial and municipal  authorities.    Another problem found in the inspection was the lack of  rationality in the distribution of investment, and there was a  serious degree of duplication of investment in similar projects.  For example, international airports were built at the same time  in Xiamen and Fuzhou of Fujian, which are just 300 kilometers  apart; moreover, Quanzhou, 81 kilometers away from Xiamen, and  Zhangzhou, closer to Xiamen, also planned to build their own  airports. Similar infrastructural facilities were built in the  same area without proper coordination according to local  capabilities. Duplicated layout of investment was also found in  Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan.    The inspection report also pointed out that, because various  localities vied with one another in starting new investment  projects, the gross amount of investment continued to swell.  This took away money and affected the state's key construction  projects. For example, a city in Henan arranged 30 construction  projects this year. Only two were state-level key projects and  seven were provincial-level key projects, with the rest being  arranged by the city on its own. As localities launched a large  number of projects on their own, priority was not actually given  to the state's key projects.    As another example, a coastal city planned to rebuild its  airport, and the state approved 200 million yuan in investment.  The local government decided to expand the airport according to  the standard of an international airport, however, and made this  a fait accompli in order to require that the state authorities  approve a commercial loan of $90.6 million. The total  investment thus exceeded 2 billion yuan. According to the  investigation, the airport project was started even before it  was approved by the state authorities.    The State Planning Commission pointed out that, if this  year's actual investment exceeded the planned ceiling of 1,300  billion yuan, it will have serious consequences for China's  macroeconomic ratios. In particular, as prices are now  increasing sharply and inflationary pressures are increasing,  firmly controlling the size of investment in fixed assets has  become a pressing task of the moment. The projects which should  be suspended must be resolutely suspended so that the state's  key construction projects can be actually guaranteed.    The local authorities have appropriately centralized  investment management according to the State Council's  instruction on further intensifying the state's macro-control  over investment in fixed assets, and have changed the situation  in which investment projects were managed by different  departments without proper coordination.</p>

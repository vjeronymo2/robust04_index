			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: SUDDEN CHANGE OF PACE FOR A MATURING PUMA  </P> <P> Sometimes an artist can subvert a carefully crafted image with a sudden change  in repertoire. Consider Venezuelan heartthrob singer-actor Jose Luis  Rodriguez's performance on Friday at the Universal Amphitheatre. Maybe it was  because the half-empty, 6,250-seat house failed to inspire Rodriguez. Maybe it  was because the Spanish-language soap and film star has matured too much to be  taken for the ravenous, lovesick Puma for which he is nicknamed.  </P> <P> Whatever the case, during the lion's share of the show that was dedicated to  the romantic Latin ballads that have made him hugely popular, Rodriguez sang  with little conviction. Despite the increased richness of his impeccably  well-phrased voice, his lyrics settled into a saccharine fatigue of easy  sentiments and quasi-religious nuances. No sexual risks or social transgression  here. This was especially evident in his schmaltzy rendition of "Ode to Joy"  from Beethoven's 9th Symphony.  </P> <P> Then, in a sudden but refreshing stylistic switch, Rodriguez strode on stage  with Mariachi del Sol Mexican, singing songs from his new Mexican album.  Rodriguez even seemed to surprise himself as he connected with the raw honesty  and defiance of "Despacito," a Jose Alfredo Jimenez ranchera classic. VICTOR  VALLE  </P></p>

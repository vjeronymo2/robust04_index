			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 13 Apr -- A federal law "On the status of a  Federation Council deputy and the status of a State Duma deputy  of the Federation Council of the Russian Federation" was adopted  today as a whole by the State Duma. This law defines the  rights, obligations, and responsibility of Federation Council  and State Duma deputies of the first convocation, and envisages  the basic legal and social guarantees of the work of elected  deputies.    The law notes, among other things, that Federation Council  and State Duma deputies enjoy immunity in the course of the  whole of their term of office. They cannot be subjected to  criminal or administrative responsibility submitted in legal  form, detained, arrested, or subjected to search or  interrogation without the consent of the appropriate Federal  Assembly chamber -- apart from instances of their detention at  the scene of a crime -- or subjected to personal inspection,  with the exception of instances where this is provided for by a  federal law to ensure the security of other persons.    A deputy's immunity extends to his place of domicile and  work, his luggage, his private and company transport, his  correspondence, the means of communications for his personal  use, and also documents belonging to him.    A Russian Federation Federal Assembly deputy may not be  subjected to criminal and administrative proceedings for a view  or a position expressed during voting, including at the time of  the expiry of his term of office. This situation does not  extend to instances where a deputy has made public insults or  committed slander and other violations, the responsibility for  which is covered by federal legislation.</p>

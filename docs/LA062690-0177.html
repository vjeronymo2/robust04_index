			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OILERS' ROZIER IS TARGET OF SECOND PATERNITY SUIT  </P> <P> Houston Oilers running back Mike Rozier has been named in a paternity suit for  the second time in a month by women who each contend he is the father of their  unborn child.  </P> <P> The latest suit was filed Monday by Rita Baldwin, 25, who contends Rozier is  the father of her baby, according to lawyer Glenn Lilly, who also represents  Pamela Gobert, 23, who filed a paternity suit against Rozier earlier this  month.  </P> <P> Baldwin, an unemployed student in Dickinson, said in the suit filed in Harris  County Family District Court that she is expecting a baby in September.  </P> <P> Gobert is four months' pregnant, Lilly said.  </P> <P> Both women are seeking medical costs and child support for their children, he  said.  </P> <P> Rozier has 21 days to respond to Baldwin's suit and until July 16 to respond to  Gobert's petition. If he contests fatherhood of either child, Lilly will ask  the court to order medical tests to determine paternity.  </P> <P> Rozier so far has paid for the initial doctor's visits for both the women,  Lilly said.  </P> <P> Baldwin apparently was unaware of Rozier's relationship with Gobert, Lilly  said. He described the Baldwin-Rozier relationship as "girlfriend on and off  for some time."  </P> <P> "Rita (Baldwin) obviously feels lied to and deceived by Mike Rozier," the  lawyer said.  </P> <P> Rozier signed a one-year contract with the Oilers last week. The contract  includes several lucrative incentive bonuses and is expected to match the  previous year's $625,000 base salary and $25,000 signing bonus.  </P></p>

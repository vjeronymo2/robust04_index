After three and a half years as ICI finance director in India and two years in Brussels as chief financial officer of ICI's materials division, he is returning from Belgium to the UK with his Brazilian wife. He has been appointed controller of ICI, reporting to Alan Spall, general manager finance. He will be based at Millbank and says he has a house for sale in Altrincham, Cheshire. Charlton, 49, replaces Ivan Marshall who is to become controller of Zeneca, ICI's soon-to-be separated bioscience subsidiary.

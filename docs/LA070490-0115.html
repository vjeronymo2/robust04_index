			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> "...AND THE ROCKETS' RED GLARE, THE BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR...";  </P> <P> HOW FIREWORKS GET THEIR COLORS  </P> <P> The fireworks' color palette is created by using precise amounts of chemicals  mixed with the explosives. Blues, for example, are obtained by using copper,  Strontium salts make the red colors, calcium makes orange and sodium makes  yellow. Since World War II, organic compounds of chlorine have been mixed with  the explosive to make the color burn brighter. The sparkling effects are  created by using metals, such as iron or magnesium, which burn brightly when  placed in an explosive mixture.  </P> <P> Source: Collier's Encyclopedia  </P> <P> </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FIREWORKS SHOWS  </P> <P> Anaheim: Peralta Canyon Park, Gerda and Pinney drives, fireworks 9:30 p.m.  Free.  </P> <P> Anaheim: Disneyland, 1313 Harbor Blvd., 9:30 p.m. Park admission $22.50 to  $25.50.  </P> <P> Brea: Brea-Olinda High School, 789 N.

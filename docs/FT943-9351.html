			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Analysts worry as South Africa climbs Johannesburg closed sharply higher once again, although analysts detected a conflict between the bullish sentiment and the feeling that price gains were outstripping strength in underlying economic fundamentals amid a lack of quality stocks. The market, they noted, was drawing in retail buyers, looking to take advantage of this week's major rally. The overall index was up 95 at 5,918, a closing high, the industrial index by 39 at 6,694 and the golds index by 65 at 2,222. Analysts said the weaker commercial and financial rands, a firmer bullion price and mostly steady world equities had offered support, export-orientated shares posting the biggest gains. Gencor jumped 80 cents to R12.60 in steady trade as it shrugged off recent lethargy which followed sharp gains ahead of its Billiton purchase. Joel ran out of steam after its recent bullish run, slipping 10 cents to R7.15.</p>

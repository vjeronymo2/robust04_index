			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sawsan Abu-Husayn: "Sabah al-Ahmad Tells </F> AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: Final Gulf Position on Yemen To Be Defined  Next Week"]    [Text] Cairo -- Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Shaykh Sabah  al-Ahmad has said in a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the  Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] foreign ministers' meeting  scheduled to be held in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia next week  will define the final position on the Yemeni war, especially as  the Gulf states have monitored the position of both the north  and the south and the contacts made between the two sides, and  in view of the adoption of the Security Council resolution. He  stressed that all efforts should be aimed first at securing a  cease-fire.    Asked about the possibility of restoring Kuwaiti-Iraqi  relations if Iraqi President Saddam Husayn announces in a clear  statement that Kuwait is a free independent state which Iraqi  has nothing to do with, the Kuwaiti foreign minister said: The  Iraqi president must announce that and register this recognition  in the Security Council and the United Nations first. Because  there are no relations between the two countries at the  bilateral level. And there are Security Council resolutions  which Iraq must comply with and implement first. On lifting the  embargo in Iraq and the Security Council's remarks in this  connection, he said: We have nothing to do with that issue, and  the council must decide what it deems right in accordance with  the resolution adopted by it. On Arab reconciliation he said  that it still needs time, especially in view of the current  deteriorating Arab conditions, as the region is full of problems  and disputes which should be resolved first.</p>

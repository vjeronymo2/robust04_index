			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKERS TAKE LOSS TO PISTONS OUT ON THE KNICKS, 115-104  </P> <P> Post-Piston Depression did not hit the Lakers Sunday night. Instead of  wallowing in the frustration of Friday night's overtime collapse, the Lakers  took it out on the New York Knicks.  </P> <P> The Lakers repelled repeated Knick runs for a 115-104 victory before 17,505 at  the Forum.  </P> <P> Had the Lakers not rebounded Sunday night -- and rebounding was only one of the  reasons for the victory -- the specter of rare back-to-back home losses would  have really put the Lakers in a funk.  </P> <P> That did not happen, though, thanks in part to the Lakers' 47-39 rebounding  edge, their double-teaming defensive pressure on Patrick Ewing and strong play  from four reserves.  </P> <P> En route to regaining the NBA's best record at 12-3, and taking the Pacific  Division lead back from the Portland Trail Blazers, the Lakers withstood two  serious second-half rallies by the Knicks (10-6), who ended a trip that  included four games in five nights.  </P> <P> In addition to Magic Johnson's 20 points, which included a three-point basket  and long jump shot late in the game that buried the Knicks, and James Worthy's  22, the Lakers received lifts from backup point guard Larry Drew in the fourth  quarter, reserve centers Vlade Divac and Mark McNamara and Michael Cooper's  steady play.  </P> <P> The Lakers certainly did not stop Ewing, who had two 40-point outbursts earlier  in the week. Ewing finished with a game-high 29 points, 25 coming in the second  half when he made nine of 15 shots.  </P> <P> Foul trouble put Ewing on the bench for all but eight minutes in the first  half, but, in the second half, he did not dominate the game, as the Lakers had  feared.  </P> <P> Ewing and a third-quarter lull notwithstanding, the Lakers were satisfied with  the way they bounced back from Friday's loss to Detroit.  </P> <P> Coach Pat Riley was so worried about possible lingering effects that he gave  the Lakers the day off on Saturday and did not breath a word about that loss  before Sunday's game.  </P> <P> "It bothered me," Riley said of the Detroit game. "Not that we lost, but how we  lost. I know it bothered the players. I didn't want to make any references to  it, just go on to New York."  </P> <P> Laker players said the Pistons were the farthest things from their minds on  Sunday. But the day after, Saturday, was another matter.  </P> <P> "That ruined our day off," Mychal Thompson said. "We spent that day brooding  about it. But if we would've had the Pistons in the back of our minds, the  Knicks would have walked all over us."  </P> <P> That did not happen, mostly because many of the Lakers' failings in the Piston  loss did not arise again.  </P> <P> Unlike the Detroit loss, the Laker bench came through Sunday. Divac scored 11  first-half points when Thompson got in foul trouble. McNamara scored five  points in the second half when both Thompson and Divac got in foul trouble.  Cooper played most of the fourth quarter and was a steadying influence.  </P> <P> And after the Knicks pulled to 89-88 with 9:33 to play, Drew scored six points  in a 13-5 Laker run that put the game away.  </P> <P> "They (reserves) took the shots they had tonight," Johnson said. "The other  night, they just looked for James and me for the shots after the ball went to  the post. Our bench played very well, and they are going to have to."  </P> <P> Riley said: "We got a nice lift off our bench. Mark came in and played well.  Larry moved the ball in the fourth quarter. And had Vlade not gotten into foul  trouble, he would have put up some big numbers."  </P> <P> But Riley was not totally happy with the Laker effort.  </P> <P> A major concern was the Lakers' 5:17 third-quarter scoring drought, not as  severe as Friday night's 8:02 lapse against the Pistons.  </P> <P> This time, the Lakers' second-half slump began after they had taken an 11-point  lead with 9:39 to play in the third quarter.  </P> <P> The Knicks were able to take a 68-64 lead, helped by eight Laker turnovers in  12 possessions. The Lakers also missed all 12 of their shots during the slump.  </P> <P> But the Lakers recovered to regain the lead, 82-79, heading into the fourth  quarter. It took all the Lakers' effort, however. Johnson finally ended the  scoring drought with a layup and accompanying free throw. That was followed by  a dunk by A.C. Green off Thompson's miss, then a Byron Scott layup off a Knick  miss.  </P> <P> The teams traded leads once more late in the third quarter, before baskets by  McNamara and Johnson in the last 30 seconds.  </P> <P> Ewing had yet to hit stride during that third-quarter Knicks run, although he  had 12 points in the quarter. He then scored the Knicks' first nine points in  1:35 of the fourth quarter, pulling New York to 89-88.  </P> <P> That would be as close as the Knicks would get, despite Ewing. He had 17 of the  Knicks' 25 fourth-quarter points, but the Lakers spread around their 33 points  in the period.  </P> <P> "It's a good thing (Ewing) got in foul trouble early," Thompson said. "We  couldn't control him in the second half. He was unstoppable."  </P> <P> The secret to the Lakers' success Sunday night?  </P> <P> "We didn't have to show anything tonight," Johnson said. "We're not in the  playoffs yet. We had to put Detroit in the back of our minds, as we did. If  not, the Knicks would've beaten us."  </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> Forward Orlando Woolridge, on the injured list after arthroscopic surgery on  Oct. 17 to remove bone fragments from his right knee, said Sunday he probably  will be ready to return to action this week. . . . Reserve center Mark  McNamara, who had been suffering from dizziness recently and passed out in his  hotel room in Sacramento on Wednesday, said Sunday that results of a 24-hour  monitoring of his heart showed no abnormality. "They think it was just related  to the flu I had," McNamara said. "But they told me to watch for any dizziness.  I felt fine today." McNamara explained his fainting spell on Wednesday: "I had  been feeling a little light-headed that day, and when I got up to answer the  door when the maid knocked, I opened it and, I guess, fell backward right in  front of the maid. I fell straight back. I was lucky I didn't hit my head on  anything. I do have a big scratch on my arm. I woke up about 10 seconds after I  passed out. I didn't want to go to the doctor, because I knew they'd do  something like this to me. But Gary (Vitti, the Laker trainer) made me."  </P></p>

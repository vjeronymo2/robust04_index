			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] President Yeltsin condemned attempts by  some Western leaders to stop Russia from resolving some  important world issues. Here is the opinion of Boris Yeltsin's  press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, on the latest events  around Yugoslavia.    [Begin Kostikov recording] I would like to recall in this  respect that recently the opposition accused the president of  all the deadly sins: in betraying Russia's interests and in  selling himself to the West, and in playing to the foreign  policy tune of the United States... How much speculation there  were around trips to Yugoslavia. All and sundry went there, in  an attempt to earn some political brownie points on the Yugoslav  crisis.    President Yeltsin, however, managed to succeed where our  political chatterboxes failed -- he demonstrated in deed the  clause, enshrined in the new constitution, that it is the  President of Russia who is the guarantor of Russia's national  security.    A few more words on the president's role in these events.  Let us word this issue in simple terms: Who, except for  President Yeltsin, could say today such a weighty and decisive  word -- so that it would have been heard in Sarajevo, Bonn, and  Washington -- in the whole world, as a fact. There is no other  person like this now. [end recording]</p>

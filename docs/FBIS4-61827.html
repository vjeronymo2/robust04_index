			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ibrahim Humaydi report: "Russian Diplomatic Sources Deny </F> Agreement With Syria on Debts Question"]    [Text] Damascus -- Russian diplomatic sources have  confirmed to AL-HAYAH that the negotiations between Russia and  Syria are still continuing in order to secure a mechanism  guaranteeing a practical solution to the debts issue, the  "obstacle" that has hampered the development of Russian-Syrian  relations in recent years.    The sources said that technical experts from the two  countries will meet shortly to agree on the method of paying  Syria's military debts, which total some $11 billion. This sum  includes overdue payments totaling $1.5 billion owed to the  former Soviet Union for weapons exported to Damascus.    The sources went on to say that, "despite the two sides'  agreement during the meeting early last month between Deputy  Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and President Hafiz al-Asad on the  principle of solving the problem, the two sides still have not  solved it." The sources said: "We need tireless negotiations."    Regarding the claim that Moscow has agreed to write off  about  90 percent of the debts, the diplomatic sources said that "it is  not an agreement. It was an offer made during the  negotiations." The sources pointed out that the "Syrians wanted  to pay about 8 percent of the debts in Syrian pounds or local  commodities, but the Russians insisted that the Syrians make 20  percent of every payment in foreign currency." The sources said  that the talks "are continuing between us and our friends in  Damascus." In a statement to AL-HAYAH well informed Russian  sources expected an agreement to be reached on writing off about  75 percent of the Russian debts, provided Syria pays the  remaining 25 percent and the value of the deals between the two  countries "in hard currency and immediately."    The sources commended the military and trade agreements  signed recently in Damascus during Deputy Prime Minister Oleg  Soskovets' visit to the Syrian capital. The agreements provide  for exporting spare parts for Syria's Russian weapons and Syrian  factories. They also provide for Russian companies'  participation in international tenders announced by Syrian  public establishments, as well as participation in extracting  Syrian phosphate.    The Russian sources described what has been reached so far  as  "an achievement" compared with the situation a few years ago.  They pointed out that "the differences were big" between the  two sides with regard to resolving the debts issue. The Syrians  linked it with the political role played by the former Soviet  Union and with whether Russia is its heir.    The sources said that the two sides have now agreed to solve  the issue. They have also agreed that the Russian Federation is  the heir of the Soviet state. They have agreed on separating  the debts question from the other questions and from the  political role Moscow is seeking to play in the peace process.  The sources said that the CIS' agreement on its share in the  Soviet Union's legacy has contributed to reaching an  understanding with the Syrians.    As for the Russian initiative to convene a "Madrid-2" and  the  active Russian role in the peace process, the sources said that  Moscow is seeking "to compete with Washington in the peace  negotiations." They said that the Russian role is leading to a  balance, and "any balance is not going to hamper the peace  process or cause any party to adopt a hard line. On the  contrary, it will give the parties self-confidence and enable  them to take courageous decisions."</p>

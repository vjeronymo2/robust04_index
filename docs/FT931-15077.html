			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Middle East tensions unsettle equities THE EQUITY market's con-cern about fund-raising via rights issues, the siphoning of cash into the gilt-edged market and worries about the UK Budget remained ever-present but played second fiddle yesterday in a market obsessed by the possibility of further conflict in the Middle East. News late in the session that President Bush had sanctioned an air strike against Iraq and that allied aircraft were about to attack Iraqi installations swept through the City's dealing rooms, triggering a fresh decline in an already weak equity market. Official reports of the allied strike came after the market had closed. At the finish the FT-SE 100 Index posted a 12.6 loss at 2,745.3, its seventh successive decline. Since reaching a record 2,861.5 on January 4, the first working day of the new year, the market has fallen 116.2 points, or 4.1 per cent. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, however, which substantially outperformed the 100 Index during the last quarter of 1992 and up until last week, was much steadier, ending only 2.8 easier at 2,876.3. Dealers spoke of a much higher concentration of buying interest in the second-tier stocks compared with that in the FT-SE 100 constituents, a view borne out by the breakdown of yesterday's market turnover figures. Overall volume was a relatively high 652.7m shares, with activity in non-Footsie stocks accounting for business of 432.3m shares. Footsie turnover totalled 220.4m shares. Dealers made a bold attempt to get the equity market moving ahead at the start of trading, taking the view that the straight-line fall in excess of 100 Footsie points more than accounted for the spate of gloomy news in recent sessions. 'The institutions were definitely nibbling this morning, but only until lunchtime, when the future started to come under pressure,' said a leading trader at one of the top UK securities houses. He added that the market's growing apprehension about the possibility of military conflict in Iraq unnerved fund managers. But a general view in the market was that further military action in the Middle East would be short-lived. The Footsie future continued to play a big role in determining the course of the cash market. 'The future was under pressure all afternoon and being constantly tested on the downside,' one dealer said. Having risen more than 10 points during the first hour of trading, the Footsie began to falter and moved into negative territory around midday. The build-up of selling pressure reached its height in mid-afternoon, with the index down 17.2 at 2,740.7 before its late rally. Wall Street, some 20 points weaker at the opening, was staging a minor rally as London closed. The retail sector, which outperformed the wider market immediately before and after the Christmas period, suffered another setback after disappointing trading news from Dixons and Body Shop and confirmation of market fears of poor trading at Alexon. Oil shares were roughly treated as crude oil prices slipped below Dollars 17 a barrel and leading brokers cut oil price forecasts. The best individual performances in the Footsie 100 stocks came from the power generators amid suggestions that the long-awaited contract to supply British Coal was about to be signed.</p>

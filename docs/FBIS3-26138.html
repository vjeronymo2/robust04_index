At yesterday's conference,  provincial Vice Governor Liu Guanghe delivered a speech in which  he stated: This year, the province's banking work should focus  on raising construction funds through all channels. Last year,  the province's bank deposits registered an 18.86 percent  increase and loans an 28.27 percent increase, totaling more than  3 billion yuan, while the province's insurance premiums income  exceeded 110 million yuan.    Vice Governor Liu Guanghe noted: This year, the province's  banking departments should make continued efforts to raise funds  through all channels and should whole-heartedly support  provincial wide economic construction. To this end, he said,  first, the province's banking departments should carry out basic  work in a down-to-earth manner, exert their utmost to increase  bank deposits, and take basic work as an important criterion for  appraising overall work performance. Second, they should make  flexible use of funds, speed up free flow of funds, and achieve  higher funds utilization efficiency. The principal leaders of  various localities and professional departments should take  personal charge of loan recovery work in the same way they do  loan provision work. Third, the province's banking departments  should work hard to explore and discover new capital  coordination channels to absorb as much idle capital in the  society as possible. Moreover, banking departments should make  every possible endeavor to ensure smooth issuance of local  construction and enterprise bonds, safeguard and rectify the  banking order, and ban irrational capital outflow. Fourth, the  province's banking departments should make active efforts to  raise all sorts of funds, develop insurance undertakings,  increase insurance premiums income, and increase credit and loan  sources.

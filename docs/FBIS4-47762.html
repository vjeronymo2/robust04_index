			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban May 3 SAPA -- Counting at most stations in  KwaZulu/Natal had been completed by Tuesday [3 May] morning and  results of the elections were being compiled, Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] spokesman Glenn McDougall said. At  Durban's Expo Centre, where a third of the province's votes are  being counted, six of 28 stations were still counting. In  Pietermaritzburg and Port Shepstone, counting had been completed  by 9.30AM.    In Empangeni on the North Coast counting was still  progressing, said Mr McDougall. There had been minor disputes at  some stations in the region.    In nearby Eshowe all ballot slips in undisputed boxes had  been counted. Disputes about the remainder were being resolved  on Tuesday morning.    Mr McDougal estimated counting in the province would be  completed by late Tuesday afternoon.

			<p>BFN     [Text] On Saturday [25 June], Uzbekistan's President Islam  Karimov told his ministers and government executives that the  Republic would work for the convertibility of its new currency  unit -- som, respect for it at the international marketplace and  its high buying potential. The som is to replace the som-coupon  on the domestic market on 1 July. The som-coupon was introduced  in November 1993.    Karimov called for the priority of exports and increased  production of competitive goods.    He was worried about the growth of prices for many items on  the domestic market and demanded tighter control of commercial  stores which, he said, bought production of state-managed  facilities to sell it at inadequate prices to the population.  That, in Karimov's view, could lead to the devaluation of the  new currency unit.</p>

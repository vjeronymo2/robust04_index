			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ewa Thibaud report: "Sweden Cannot Count on Opt-Outs"] </F>   [Text] Madrid -- Sweden's neutrality belongs to the past.  The Swedes must realize this. So said Spanish European Affairs  Minister Carlos Westendorp on the subject of Swedish admission  to the EU [European Union]. He also said that Sweden cannot  remain outside a common currency.    "If Sweden were to want to remain outside, there would be  legal problems. It is only Denmark and Great Britain that have  opt-outs that give them the right to remain outside."    The Spaniards were very active participants in the most  recent round of membership negotiations, particularly toward the  end, when the issue was Norway and fish. They had their own  protracted negotiations in the eighties fresh in their memories.  And many Spaniards thought that those countries now seeking  membership achieved much better terms than they achieved  themselves.    In the Spanish press it was often possible to read sentences  like: "The Swedes are negotiating as if the EU wants to become  a member of Sweden and not the other way round." In Sweden on  the other hand the Spaniards' attitude was taken to mean that  they did not want the Swedes as members of the EU.    "Of course we do," Carlos Westendorp said. "Above all  because Sweden has the right to become a member. But also  because the level of intellectuals, businessmen, and politicians  is high in Sweden.    ``No, I am not afraid that the Nordic area will have too  much  weight in the EU context. The center of gravity will move  northward, but this is a fact; there is nothing to be done about  it. The EU cannot be enlarged to the south.''    He could not be expected to say anything else. Nor does the  opposition say anything else. But Isobel Tocino, the  conservative People's Party EU spokesman, gave a slightly more  open display of Spanish concern. She is fond of talking about  the "European troika" and refers here to Germany, France, and  Spain.    "From Germany and France we have received promises that the  Mediterranean region will not be forgotten," she said. "We  border on Africa, and the instability that could come from  there."    I was told several times in my conversations in Madrid that  Germany, France, and Spain are the major countries. It was also  repeated several times that the applicant countries together  have fewer inhabitants than Spain.    Spain is also a major recipient of EU support. Twice as much  money goes to Spain as goes to Italy or Greece. Much of the EU  money goes to infrastructure. There is a frenetic building of  roads throughout Spain, and the impression is gotten of a  country that is much more prosperous than it really is. The EU  money that goes to individual companies is only a small  percentage of all the EU money. And businessmen are not  particularly happy.    Least happy were the Spanish fishermen who were unable to  understand why the Norwegians should be given better terms than  they had been given. Now the Spanish Government is relatively  content with the final agreement. But the fishermen are not  content, and their discontent is not directed against Norway  alone. An "anchovy war" is currently taking place between French  and Spanish fishermen.    "On the fisheries issue we were defending national  interests,  but apart from that we have the whole time pushed common EU  interests," Isabel Tocino said. She was referring here to the  agreement in Greece on how many votes are needed to reach  decisions after the EU is enlarged. Here Spain and Britain were  the two driving forces. Recalcitrant countries, some said.    As far as Sweden's admission is concerned, it was chiefly a  phasing-in of dues payments that the Spaniards could not accept.  Nor could they accept that Sweden's regions would receive as  much support money as impoverished Spanish regions. But the  compromises that were cobbled together have satisfied the  Spaniards, for the time being at least.    What worries the Spaniards is that Sweden agrees to raising  environmental standards. Although Carlos Westendorp said that  it is not Swedish environmental policy that could cause problems.    "Sweden and Norway have developed without destroying their  environment. What we cannot accept is that Germany and Denmark  want to limit our ability to develop when, at the same time,  they have destroyed the environment in their own countries.  They say that we cannot build roads because some particular  sort of animal must be saved. All right, but in Germany and  Denmark they have killed all those animals. Now they have to  give us a chance to develop.    ``What worries us is when people use the environment as a  pretext to prevent free trade. As when Germany demands that we  should clean up our water, and the equipment is only sold by  German companies.''    Carlos Westendorp is convinced that the Swedes will vote in  favor of membership in the EU. But he thinks that a national  debate is needed in Sweden.    "There is a need for a pause for thought, a little time. But  soon you will have to make up your minds about whether or not  you want joint defenses. Joint defenses are probably much  cheaper than retaining neutrality."    As far as a common currency is concerned, the Spanish  Government and opposition are in complete agreement. Nobody  really wants to start planning for it yet, but both view it as a  natural development. Isabel Tocino sees no possibility for  Sweden to preserve its neutrality in the event of membership.    "Before we ratify the agreement we must look at the Swedish  attitude. I reiterate that there is no room for neutrality if  you want to create a union. A country cannot stay outside and  think that it can do what it thinks is most comfortable. When  you join a union you have to accept and live by its rules."</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> KITTY DUKAKIS HOSPITALIZED; ILLNESS HELD NOT DRUG-RELATED  </P> <P> Kitty Dukakis, wife of Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, was in a hospital  intensive-care unit Tuesday as doctors tried to diagnose her illness.  </P> <P> The governor's spokeswoman said initial tests were inconclusive, but indicated  that the ailment was not drug- or alcohol-related.  </P> <P> "Mrs. Dukakis is tired of tests, but she's feeling OK. She's up, she's alert,"  spokeswoman Minday Lubber said.  </P> <P> She was taken by ambulance Monday night to Brigham and Women's Hospital after  several days of flu-like symptoms, Lubber said.  </P> <P> "I don't know if it's flu-related. I know she was feeling groggy," Lubber said.  "She's had the flu. She's been feeling tired. Last night she was feeling  particularly lethargic."  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Kitty Dukakis underwent four weeks of treatment for  alcoholism. She said previously that she had been addicted to diet pills for  years.  </P> <P> She also underwent neck surgery last year while her husband was running for  President.  </P> <P> Lubber said the governor had been at his wife's side much of Monday night and  Tuesday. He did not immediately comment.  </P> <P> Hospital officials refused to provide any information, but said admission to  the intensive-care unit was standard under such circumstances.  </P></p>

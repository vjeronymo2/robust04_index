			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Japanese banks change strategy: Institute Of Geographers Conference JAPANESE BANKS in the UK are behaving increasingly like other foreign and British banks in Britain, the Institute of British Geographers' Conference in Swansea was told yesterday. Their lending patterns are starting to resemble those of other banks, said Mr Adam Tickell, a researcher at Leeds University. By late last year there were nine Japanese banks with offices outside London with a total of 26 employees, and 53 banks in the capital with almost 4,000 employees. Japanese banks make up the second-largest concentration of foreign banks in the UK after those from the US. The banks moved into the regions in response to lower rents, because of a desire to make contact with customers outside London, and to follow the growing importance of regional centres with strong banking presences. The banks typically said that 50 per cent of their loans went to Japanese businesses in the UK. When the banks started in the UK in the mid-1980s, they focused on loans to the distribution sector, where there was a Japanese presence. However, the balance of their portfolios now closely resembles lending by other banks. About 40 per cent of outstanding loans last August were to financial services companies, with 18 per cent to distribution companies and 18 per cent to construction and property companies. Lending by Japanese banks represents 7.5 per cent of all UK resident lending, defined as lending to domestic organisations. If London's role as an international financial centre declines and the Japanese banks move abroad, it could have a fundamental impact on British business, he said.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Euromoney advances 42% to Pounds 4.62m EUROMONEY Publications topped a buoyant set of first-half results with a 23 per cent rise in the interim dividend from 6.5p to 8p. The magazines publisher recorded advances of 71 per cent in operating profits to Pounds 3.71m (Pounds 2.17m) and 42 per cent in pre-tax profit to Pounds 4.62m (Pounds 3.26m). Growth was achieved in all but one activity. The favourable comparison was aided by the depressing effect of the Gulf war on the previous first half. The company does not expect this growth rate to continue in the second half, but does foresee a satisfactory outcome for the year. Highlights in the period under review included international financial publishing, which raised its contribution by 76 per cent from Pounds 1.59m to Pounds 2.8m, aided by the modest recovery in some financial markets. Energy publishing jumped to Pounds 375,000 (Pounds 121,000) and event businesses put in Pounds 710,000 (Pounds 373,000). The only disappointing area was aviation and leasing publishing which declined to Pounds 279,000 (Pounds 531,000). Earnings per share improved from 10.39p to 14.9p.</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                        Reflecting Bonn's preference for structural reforms and  opposition to economic stimulus measures, the German  participants' positive evaluation of the 14-15 March G-7 jobs  conference in Detroit focused on the conference proposals for  education and labor market reforms but rejected U.S. suggestions  that Germany stimulate domestic growth by reducing taxes and  lowering interest rates.  German officials were also cool to U.S.  proposals for setting up new institutions to deal with the issues  of unemployment, technology policy, and education, preferring  instead to work through the existing OECD framework or through  bilateral ties.                                       END SUMMARY     Germany's finance, economic, and labor ministers, all of whom  participated in the jobs conference, seemed to devote virtually  all their attention to the conference recommendations to promote  economic growth through international trade, technological  innovation and private enterprise and to achieve structural  reforms through education, greater flexibility of the labor  force, lower costs, and deregulation.  Anticipating U.S. efforts  to make the Bundesbank's interest rate policy a central issue,  Bonn officials sought even before the conference to focus  attention on structural issues and to avoid discussion of  stimulus measures (Die Welt 14 March).  They also rejected U.S.  proposals for setting up new groups to study technology policy  and employment and for creating a new institution to exchange  ideas about education, suggesting instead that existing  institutions and bilateral relations were better suited for  dealing with these issues (Frankfurter Allgemeine, 15 March).     No New Stimulus Measures     Both Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Economics Minister Guenter  Rexrodt rejected the U.S. call for Germany to reduce its taxes  and interest rates to stimulate domestic growth.  Citing  Germany's budget deficit, Waigel repeated Bonn's position that  Germany's unemployment is a structural problem and that a  cyclical recovery will not automatically solve the problem  (Frankfurter Allgemeine, 15 March).  According to Rexrodt, since  new programs to "stimulate the economy" do not offer a way out of  the German labor market crisis, efforts must focus on "structural  changes" (DPA, 14 March).     Structural Measures, Domestic Solutions     German conference participants stressed the need to reform  Germany's economic structures and, while welcoming cooperation on  common concerns, rejected proposals to create additional G-7  institutions:     --Indicating that he saw the jobs conference largely as a  confirmation of the German government's plans for improving  Germany's competitiveness, Rexrodt said he would take away from  the conference ideas on "labor market flexibility, trade  liberalization, deregulation," and lower wage costs, and said  Germany must "learn from U.S. technological and innovation  successes."  He did not favor U.S. proposals for new study groups  for technology policy and employment statistics, however, saying  that the OECD framework already dealt with such issues, and he  opposed creating a new institution for exchanges on educational  issues, saying he preferred bilateral arrangements (Frankfurter  Allgemeine, 15 March).     --Similarly, Waigel stated that there is no "miracle cure " --  each  country "must find its own solutions" and, for Germany,  "structural reforms" will make its labor markets "better equipped  for the challenges of the future" (Handelsblatt, 17 March).     --Bluem, on the other hand, appeared to see more room for  international cooperation, saying that the jobs conference had  "clearly improved conditions for harmonizing labor market  initiatives."  Because of current practices of multinational  corporations, he said, job developments can "no longer be an  exclusively national task" (Sueddeutsche Zeitung 17 March).  He  cautioned against an "uncritical acceptance" of the U.S. model,  however, saying that the drastic cost reductions have not led to  the expected rises in profits (Frankfurter Allgemeine, 15 March).     Press Reaction     Press reaction echoed the largely positive official reaction,  with several papers welcoming President Clinton's initiative, the  G-7's focus on people's concerns rather than on macroeconomic  issues, and the opportunity for international cooperation on  employment issues.  Most media supported the Government's stance  against stimulative measures:     --Frankfurter Allgemeine's Washington correspondent Carola Kaps  on 16 March called it "remarkable" that a G-7 conference had  focused not on "interest rates and exchange rates" but on the  "well-being of the average citizen."  She defended Germany's  stance against stimulus measures, however, saying that the "nasty  and trite" controversy over German interest rates shows that the  "special German situation" is still being largely "ignored."  Nevertheless, she said hopefully that the U.S. administration now  "seems to understand" that Germany's current conditions "do not  permit an additional stimulation" of demand.     --The leading business daily Handelsblatt of 17 March, citing  Clinton's observation that job losses in one country lead to  higher unemployment in neighboring and partner countries, said  that "no country" can fight unemployment with domestic means  alone in a world economy that is increasingly interdependent.     --Sueddeutsche Zeitung's chief editor Josef Jof fe also saw  increased international cooperation resulting from the jobs  conference, saying that such issues as "unemployment, health  insurance, immigration" have become "international politics" and  politicians now realize that domestic policy problems "cannot be  solved exclusively" by a single country.  He praised President  Clinton's "initiative" for highlighting the "necessary shift in  awareness" (16 March).     --The left-of-center Frankfurter Rundschau presented one of the  few negative reactions to the conference outcome, regretting the  conference's failure to adopt new stimulus measures.  "Any plans  President Clinton may have had" for preparing a plan for  coordination at the Naples G-7 Summit, it said, were "destroyed"  with Rexrodt's "unmistakable rejection" of "any type of Keynesian  economic program" (16 March).

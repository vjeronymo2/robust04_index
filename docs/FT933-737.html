			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / FT Financial Reporting Conference: Delay in audit reform sought LEADING British companies yesterday called for delays to proposed auditing standards reforms until new accounting standards have been developed further. Mr Nigel Stapleton, chief finance officer of Reed Elsevier and chairman of the technical committee of the Hundred Group of leading finance directors, called for greater focus in financial reporting. Speaking at the FT Financial Reporting Conference in London yesterday, he said there were too many initiatives with too little co-ordination under way. He called for standards-setters to focus on 'priority issues' and avoid topics outside the area of improved financial reporting. 'There is a risk of reform overload,' he said. He also stressed the need for more authoritative guidance on implementing the Cadbury code on corporate governance, and warned that the guidelines on internal controls being drafted were too broad. Mr James Carty, technical partner at accountants Robson Rhodes, criticised the Accounting Standards Board for acting too slowly, generating standards which were too confusing and poorly written, and for failing to distinguish the need for different standards for smaller companies. Mr Mike Townsend, finance director of Rolls-Royce, said FRS 3, the new profit-and-loss account standard, 'is not helpful in understanding the real dynamics and trading position and trends' of his company. He said there was little consistency in the way in which City analysts interpreted Rolls-Royce's 1992 results, which were prepared according to the new standard. He cited the earnings per share and p/e ratios quoted by five leading City investment houses following the results, which produced widely varying figures. The numbers ranged from a loss per share of 20.9p from Paribas to earnings of 6.6p from Henderson Crosthwaite. He said that if analysts provided such varied interpretations, private investors would be even more confused by the new standard. Mr Jim McCaughan, managing director of UBS International Investment in London, defended City analysts. He said much comment related to the activities of brokers' research departments. He drew a distinction between these readers of accounts - often accused of short-termism - and investment managers, whose research is longer-term and given no publicity. He said he sympathised with companies' attempts to put 'a positive spin on events' but said auditors needed to be stronger to ensure this spin did not go beyond the requirement for accounts to show 'a true and fair view'. Mr Richard Goeltz, director and group chief financial officer at National Westminster Bank, said the ASB's proposed clampdown on capital instruments and off-balance-sheet finance would reduce demand from financial advisers to produce treatments designed with 'cosmetic enhancement' as their main aim. But he said there was an 'increasingly aggressive' market among advisers to devise 'tailored financial instruments to resolve real problems'.</p>

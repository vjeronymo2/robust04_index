			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Curbing Europe's steel aid THE EUROPEAN Community's private steel companies are getting nervous. They fear that the Commission may be preparing to support billions of Ecus in government aid to their state-owned rivals in exchange for only minimal steps to reduce the over-capacity which is bringing the industry to its knees. In the past week, the mostly private German steel industry has accused the Commission of going soft, while privatised British Steel has threatened to boycott EC-wide restructuring plans unless a tougher line is adopted. The private steel groups' concern is understandable. Ideally, there would be a total ban on state subsidies. This is not merely because handouts are a waste of public funds. State aid also allows inefficient public companies to compete unfairly against private manufacturers. Private companies may well ask what is the point of a single market if state groups are allowed to engage in such blatantly unfair trading. Unfortunately, a total ban on aid is impossible. The bulk of the aid - to Italy's Ilva, Spain's CSI and Germany's Ekostahl - has already been sunk and cannot be clawed back. Moreover, it is unrealistic to expect the Italian or Spanish governments to close down their entire steel industries. The best that can be hoped for is that state groups will make the bulk of the capacity cuts that are needed to bring the market into balance and that the industry will be run on subsidy-free lines in future. Difficult hand Equally, private companies cannot really afford to boycott restructuring plans. The industry is haemorrhaging to the tune of Ecu4bn a year. The longer capacity cuts are delayed, the worse the position and the greater the likelihood of more private-sector bankruptcies. The only way forward is to rely on the Commission. The Commission in turn has a difficult hand to play, since it needs unanimous approval from the Council of Ministers for its decisions. The main fear is that the Commission will take an excessively soft line in order to close the dossier. The main practical question is how well the Commission is playing its difficult hand. Until Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, puts forward firm proposals on the three big state aid cases, it will be impossible to give a definite answer. But at present, the signs are reasonably hopeful. The main positive sign is that the Commission's hitherto strong line has forced all three states, in varying degrees, to embrace privatisation. Italy plans full privatisation, Spain has pledged that a new mill in the Basque region will be financed mainly by private capital, while the Treuhand, Germany's privatisation agency, has promised that private funds will be found for new investment in Ekostahl. The emphasis on private capital provides the best guarantee for a subsidy-free future. Clearly inadequate But there are still two concerns. First, will the state-owned steelmakers make sufficient capacity cuts to stop the need for future subsidies? Italy's proposal to focus its main cuts on a plant that has not been operating for two years is clearly inadequate, while Spain's plan to delay closures for two years is also suspect. It would be unacceptable if losses were allowed to continue for anything more than a short period after an overall restructuring plan was agreed. Second, is the current emphasis on private capital genuine? Given the industry's overcapacity, it is unclear why rational private investors would want to build new capacity in Spain and Germany or even buy an existing debt-laden group such as Ilva. The natural fear is that governments will find backdoor ways to sweeten investment by private capitalists. The council of ministers meets next week to debate these issues. Sensibly, the Commission has resisted the temptation to put forward formal proposals. Although this means that a deal will be delayed at least until November, that is better than rushing into an unsatisfactory one. Nevertheless next week's meeting will be important. Pro-competition governments must insist that future handouts are stopped and not disguised under the cloak of privatisation. The Commission itself must be tough.</p>

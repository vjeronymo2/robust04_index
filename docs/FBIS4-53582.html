			<p>BFN     [Text] Major General Alfredo Filler, Armed Forces of the  Philippines [AFP] vice chief of staff, stressed that the members  of the Alex Boncayao Brigade involved in the killing of U.S.  Colonel James Rowe are covered by the government's amnesty  program. Filler said that the killers were captured and  punished. They, however, still have the right to apply for the  amnesty program.    It will be recalled that the U.S. Government objected to the  granting of amnesty to the three New People's Army rebels who  killed Rowe while on his way to JUSMAG [Joint United States  Military Advisory and Planning Group] in Quezon City during the  latter part of 1980.    According to Filler, the Philippines will not be violating  the diplomatic agreement which it signed wherein the government  will give protection to American nationals in the country.  Filler clarified that the agreement does not stipulate the  banning of parole or amnesty.</p>

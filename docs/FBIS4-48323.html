			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban May 16 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  spokesman Ed Tillett on Monday said some sections of South  Africa's news media were eating humble pie after the IFP's  election triumph in KwaZulu/Natal. "I think certain sections of  the media have tended to swallow their own propaganda and myth,"  he said. "Prior to the elections the debate on federalism was  stifled and instead editorials turned out a bland uniformity of  thinking."    Mr Tillett also criticised opinion surveys, saying most had  predicted three per cent national support for the IFP. However,  the party garnered 10.5 per cent of the votes for the National  Assembly. "It would appear sections of the media were paralysed  into impotency by their transitional jargon and the media  appeared to lapse into a certain lingua franca of...informed  speculation."    Prof Keyan Tomaselli of the University of Natal's Centre for  Cultural and Media Studies on Monday said incorrect predictions  of support for the IFP were due to unreliable population  statistics provided by the state, particularly for rural and  peri-urban areas.    He said the IFP had lost the support of the English press in  the past year because it had become a threat to economic  stability and therefore a menace to big business. The English  press was free- market orientated, he said, and naturally sided  with business.</p>

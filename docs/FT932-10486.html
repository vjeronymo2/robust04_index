			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / No hiding place for Major: English voters have taken their revenge on the government Mr John Major should not be too surprised. For nearly a year his government has been tearing itself apart over something called Maastricht while the rest of the country endured the ravages of the recession. The voters were bound to take their revenge. But after one of the worst nights for a Tory government in living memory, that will be scant consolation for his embattled administration. The prime minister's fragile political authority has suffered another blow. His party shows every sign of panicking. It was not only his enemies who were using words like 'dreadful' yesterday. The losses were much heavier than even the pessimists in 10 Downing Street predicted. The 33 per cent fall in the Conservative vote in Newbury was the largest the party had suffered in any by-election since the second world war. A Liberal Democrat majority of, say, 5,000 would have surprised few. The 22,000 margin won by Mr Paddy Ashdown's party was a shock. The government's paper majority in the House of Commons has been reduced to 19. The fractious mood among the malcontents and the disenchanted on the Conservative backbenches means that in reality it cannot rely even on that. The county council elections reduced the once-Tory shires to the Tory shire. Essex man and woman have had enough. So, too, have their tweed-suited counterparts in the English heartlands of Surrey, Berkshire, Hampshire and Sussex. It may well be that in two years we will look back on the results as a classic mid-term aberration: a protest vote by a badly bruised electorate rather than a declaration that it intends to boot out the government in the subsequent general election. There are crumbs of comfort for Mr Major. The resurgence of the Liberal Democrats - a triumph for Mr Ashdown after a year in the wilderness - was a potent reminder of how the Conservatives may still profit from a divided opposition. The collapse of the Labour vote in Newbury to the lowest recorded in any constituency for more than 50 years may have been a predictable by-product of tactical voting. But a respectable showing in the shire counties provides little evidence that Labour has re-established its claim as a government-in-waiting. So the national and local results have rekindled speculation that the two main opposition parties will be driven inexorably towards some kind of pact at the next general election. Mr Ashdown, taking full advantage of his party's return to the political sunlight, is already speaking of the need for a change in the 'culture' of opposition politics. The habit of co-operation at local level will strengthen its case. The message will not be lost on those in Mr John Smith's shadow cabinet who believe an informal deal with Mr Ashdown is vital to avoid a fifth consecutive general election defeat. But for all the inevitable speculation, there is no sign yet Mr Smith is ready to give up his hope of winning alone. If there is to be another Lib-Lab pact it will be born of opposition desperation not of Tory defeat. The economy is on Mr Major's side. Scalded by their misplaced trust in April 1992, the electorate declined this week to believe that a vote for the Conservatives on Thursday would underpin economic recovery on Friday. But by any objective analysis the recession has ended. It is a fair bet that six months from now, voters will feel a great deal more comfortable; and Mr Major is only one year into the parliament. But the hope that history will take a kinder view of this week's humiliation will not make life any easier for him in the short term. It is just possible  -not yet probable - that the rout could be the catalyst for another loss of collective nerve in the Tory party. If that were to happen, the prime minister's own position would be questioned. His most immediate problem is to restore an appearance of authority. His government's strength is being sapped by the continuing battle over the Maastricht treaty. Downing Street is probably right when it claims that the latest climbdown over the social chapter will not in the end disrupt ratification of the treaty. But the threatened legal challenge from Tory Euro-sceptics will keep open the wound. Mr Major can no longer escape the pressure for the radical shake-up of his cabinet which he has avoided since the debacle last September of sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. In recent weeks, only Mr Douglas Hurd has stood out as a figure of calm authority. Mr Norman Lamont's hold on the chancellorship looks more precarious than ever. His characteristically irreverent comment during the Newbury campaign  -Je ne regrette rien - has come back to haunt him. The prime minister has not made up his mind about a reshuffle. Until yesterday his inclination was to avoid one. He will be careful not be seen to be stampeded into instant changes. But his friends believe the risks of keeping on Mr Lamont now outweigh the threat that the chancellor might not go quietly. They want a late July reshuffle. Those looking at potential successors should add Mr Malcolm Rifkind to the list of names at present headed by Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael Howard. Whatever he decides, Mr Major must also confront a more fundamental problem. The government's authority will be restored only when he establishes the identity which has so far eluded it. What is Majorism? Until it is answered it remains a dangerous question for the prime minister. The mix of free-market economic orthodoxy and caring Conservatism which he offered at the general election has been lost in the recurrent crises of the past year. A catastrophic increase in public borrowing has driven him to contemplate an assault on the welfare state that even Lady Thatcher shunned. But his promise yesterday to listen to the electorate must push him in another direction. Resentful voters cannot be expected to greet with enthusiasm cuts in state pensions or benefits provision or the introduction of new charges in the National Health Service. Nor do the promised privatisation of British Rail or the deregulation of London's buses seem likely to persuade voters that Mr Major represents the kind face of Thatcherism. His friends believe that the government will now have to rethink its agenda  -starting with the legislative programme for next year. The prime minister needs to reassert his image as an instinctively centrist leader. A starting point might be to end the chaos in the schools by reaching a compromise with the teachers in the dispute over tests. A Pounds 1bn-a-week public borrowing requirement will not allow any relaxation of public expenditure constraints. But the more radical suggestions emerging from the Treasury's review will have to be unceremoniously dropped. It would be fatal to panic now. Past form - remember all those predictions of impending catastrophe during the general election campaign - suggests Mr Major will not. Economic recovery will prove a potent balm. But after this week's humiliation the prime minister might pause to reflect also that there is no iron rule of politics that says governments always, but always, regain their balance.</p>

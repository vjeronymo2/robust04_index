			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on a press statement by a Foreign Ministry Spokesman] </F>   [Text] In connection with the fact that the annual report  on terrorism recently published by the U.S. State Department  cited totally distorted and fabricated material and tried to  brand our country as a terrorist state, a DPRK Foreign Ministry  spokesman released the following press statement [tamhwa] today:    Press statement by a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman    The United States has recently further expanded its  commotions against our Republic.    According foreign news reports, the U.S. State Department  released an annual report on terrorism on 9 May. In the report,  the State Department cited totally distorted and fabricated  material and tried to brand our country as a terrorist state.    The U.S. Administration publishes an annual report on  terrorism every year, putting the label of terrorism on other  nations which do not meekly obey it. This is a customary  practice for veiling its ill fame as the biggest breeding ground  of state and individual terrorism.    Today the DPRK is the main target of U.S. terrorism. The  United States has persistently hatched every conceivable plot  against it.    The U.S. State Department abused the DPRK again over the  terrorist issue. It is an anachronistic act based on the U.S.  hostile policy for impairing the image of the DPRK and stifling  it, as it has done over the nuclear issue.    The DPRK rejects all manner of terrorism, proceeding from  the  fundamental principle of the chuche idea that sets greatest  store by human dignity and value. It also opposes any act  encouraging and supporting terrorism. The world community well  knows of this.    The United States, known as the chieftain of terrorism,  should mind its own business, instead of impudently trying to  brand other nations as terrorist states. This would be better  for the United States itself.</p>

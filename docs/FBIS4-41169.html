			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, S. Kolosova, and others]    [Text] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Krylov  described the citizenship act passed in Latvia as inhuman. He  told Interfax that the act turned numerous residents of Latvia  into stateless persons, made it impossible for them to become  citizens and imposed naturalization quotas.    He said the law did nothing for the image Latvia was  striving  for itself as a stronghold of democracy.    Krylov said that the act was aimed against the  Russian-speaking residents of Latvia. He explained that if it  became law, Russian- Latvian relations would deteriorate, the  visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to Latvia  would most likely not take place and numerous agreements made  during the recent visit of Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis to  Moscow would be in doubt.    He did not rule out the possibility that Russia would lift  Latvia's most favored nation status.    Krylov said he did not believe, however, that the  citizenship  act would influence the deadline for the withdrawal of Russian  troops from Latvia.    He said that Russia intended to raise the question of human  rights violations in Latvia in the CSCE and other international  organizations.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Leading Article: The centre holds THE FUNERAL today of Mr Chris Hani, the assassinated African National Congress leader, is as momentous an event as any in the country's history. When Mr Nelson Mandela walked to freedom, millions of black South Africans welcomed an icon who had come to life. Three violent years later, they are mourning a man they see as a martyr, and celebration has turned to frustration and bitterness, anger and sorrow. These are times fraught with danger: extremists have drawn blood, black township youth are impatient for change, and the ANC's mass action campaign for early elections will inevitably raise the temperature. So far, however, the political centre holds. Some 28 deaths since the assassination are known to have been politically related. It is 28 deaths too many; but well below the weekly average this year. Last Thursday's tragedy in Soweto, when four demonstrators were killed and hundreds injured by police fire, illustrated again that the security forces' first instinct is to shoot, often without provocation. But on a day when more than 1m protesters took to the streets, tragedy could have become catastrophe were it not for the marchers' restraint, the presence of ANC marshalls, and the moderating role of the country's political leaders. Mr Mandela has been at his best, striking the right note in a television address to the nation last Wednesday as important for its symbolism as its substance. It not only confirmed his elder statesman status that, for a while at least, transcended his party loyalty; it was recognition of the reality that underlies the negotiating process: white South Africa can no longer govern on its own. For his part, President F W de Klerk has been treading a tightrope, resisting calls for a crackdown and countrywide state of emergency from the right, but reinforcing security where needed. And Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, accompanied his tribute to Mr Hani with an appeal for calm. What above all may have kept black anger in check, however, is the progress apparently made at the negotiating table. The expectation that the talks, due to resume soon, will set a date for elections was a vital safety valve. Optimism may be misplaced, for key issues - control of the security forces during the extended transition; how executive power is to be shared in the envisaged coalition - have yet to be resolved. Additionally, Chief Buthelezi, who seeks what amounts to autonomy for Natal, has not been accommodated. It is well nigh inevitable that there will be further strains on stability, whether assassinations or political violence. But unless the next round of talks produce tangible progress, there will be no safety valve. The real test of South Africa's centre may be yet to come.</p>

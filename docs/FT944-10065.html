			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: JJB Sports to float with Pounds 64.5m valuation JJB Sports, the UK's largest independent sports retailer, yesterday finalised its flotation, pricing the shares at 215p to give it a market capitalisation of Pounds 64.5m. Mr David Whelan, the former Blackburn Rovers player who broke his leg in the 1960 FA cup final, founded the chain in Wigan in 1971. Mr Whelan, who began his business career with Pounds 400 raised by benefit matches, and his family interests is selling 6.2m shares, raising more than Pounds 13m. A total of 10.5m ordinary shares, or 35 per cent of the enlarged share capital, have been placed with institutions and other investors by Charterhouse Tilney. The company is raising Pounds 8.6m of new money, net of expenses, from the sale of 4.28m new shares. Mr Whelan said yesterday that the group would be spending Pounds 4m on a new 100,000 sq ft warehouse in Wigan, to be built next year, and Pounds 4.5m on opening another 30 stores. The group, which will have more than 120 outlets by the end of this year, concentrates on providing kit and equipment for all active sports. It stresses that it is not in the fashion end of the market. Operating profits of not less than Pounds 6.5m are forecast for the year to January 31 1995. Last year it made Pounds 4.7m on turnover of Pounds 41.2m. Forecast earnings of 16.35p put the group on a multiple of just over 13. The notional net dividend is 6p, giving a notional gross yield of 3.5 per cent. Dealings are expected to begin next Friday.</p>

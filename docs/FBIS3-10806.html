Maluf will have to resign as mayor of Sao Paulo on 29  March. Maluf's decision is not tied to his party's decision to  form an alliance to support his candidacy.    Maluf made the announcement to five of his aides: Planning  Secretary Claudio Lembo, Finance Secretary Celso Pitta,  Government Secretary Edevaldo Alves da Silva, Highway Secretary  Reynaldo de Barros, and Education Secretary Solon Borges, who is  also the deputy mayor of Sao Paulo. It will be Maluf's third  attempt to reach Planalto Palace: in 1984 he lost to Tancredo  Neves at the Electoral College; and in 1989 he lost to Fernando  Collor.    "I have already decided and I want to make it quite clear  that I have already met with my government team. I am very well  prepared," he said after lunching in Rio de Janeiro with Globo  Organization President Roberto Marinho.    Claiming he would feel restrained if he announced his  decision in Rio de Janeiro, Maluf only hinted that he would run  for president:    "I have even studied the timetable. I cannot resign on 2  April because it is Saturday, and it will be published in the  official gazette on Monday, which is 4 April. It is not good to  do it on 1 April, right? March 31 might have a political  connotation (anniversary of the coup of 1964). I cannot do it  on 30 March because it will be published by the official gazette  on 31 March. Consequently, my deadline is 29 March. It will be  published in the official gazette on 30 March," he said.    Maluf reiterated that he would renounce his candidacy in  favor of Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes (PFL) [Liberal  Front Party], whose name "appears second in the polls" and who  cannot be excluded from an alliance among the PPR, the PFL, the  PP [Popular Party], the PL [Liberal Party], and the PTB  [Brazilian Labor Party].    Maluf says he had dinner with Antonio Carlos Magalhaes three  weeks ago. He noted that he will consider it discourteous if  during a meeting scheduled for today, PFL President Jorge  Bornhausen proposes that he give up his candidacy. Giving a  personal example, Maluf criticized the proposed alliance between  the PFL and the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]:    He said: "Just imagine if [Workers Party President] Lula [da  Silva] and I made an alliance. It would be cynical,  hypocritical, and would reduce the number of votes for both  parties. The PFL is much better with the PPR."    Maluf believes the implementation of the URV [Real Value  Unit] is merely a dollarization, adding that Finance Minister  Fernando Henrique Cardoso should not resign to become a  candidate.    "He should explain whether the plan was made for the  election  or for Brazil," said Maluf.</p>

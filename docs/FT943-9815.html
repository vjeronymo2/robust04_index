			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: UK property The long queue of investors for Pillar's flotation says more about the company than the state of the wider property market. Despite the brightening economic prospects, there is still little sign of rising rents. The latest survey evidence points to falling capital values in retail, office and industrial sectors. Anecdotal evidence suggests institutional investors pulled back from direct investment in property during the second quarter. This may have been caused by falling equity and bond markets, which tended to push property weightings higher even without action. Pension funds may also be mulling the government's proposed solvency test and asking where property might fit into their portfolios in future. There seems little chance of another slide in values, especially now that the gilts market has recovered some poise. With property values becalmed, though, stock market investors are looking for companies which can add value to their assets through development or trading. Pillar seems to fit the bill  -as did Argent, which saw its flotation oversubscribed in June. At a 5 per cent discount to net assets neither flotation was especially cheap. Indeed, if Pillar and Argent represent fair value at this level it is difficult to see why the less dynamic or well-placed property companies are trading at a similar discount.</p>

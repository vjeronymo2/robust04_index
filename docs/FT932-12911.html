			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / International Bonds: UK companies hit the US private placement trail UK companies are flocking to the US private placement market, attracted by the ready availability of long-term funding at relatively favourable terms. Last week saw the announcement of a Dollars 116m US private placement for Lucas Industries, the engineering group. The deal, which has a 6.95 per cent coupon and 12-year maturity, comes hot on the heels of similar placements for the Vinten Group, HP Bulmer, and Hunting. Corporate advisers expect more UK borrowers to follow suit. UK companies say there are advantages in using the US private placement market. 'Interest rates in the US are at their lowest in nearly two decades, so you can lock into low fixed rate financing which is very attractive,' says Mr Richard Green, financial director at Vinten. The group, a camera mountings and systems, surveillance and electro-optics company, raised Dollars 40m of 10-year money this month. It is paying a coupon of 6.72 per cent to the US institutions which hold its bonds. By comparison, Mr Green estimates the company would have had to pay at least 7.52 per cent for fixed rate dollars in the UK. As important as the low interest rates is that companies find it easier to borrow long-term (from seven years up to about 15, depending on the borrower) in the US private placement market. That UK companies have turned their attention to the US market reflects the lack of suitable borrowing opportunities on their own doorstep. Many of the UK names which have followed this route point out that they have little alternative to obtain long-term financing. The pricing on bank loans has risen over the past three or four years, reflecting new controls on capital and concern about the creditworthiness of borrowers at a time of recession. HP Bulmer, the cider group, raised Dollars 25m of seven-year money and Dollars 20m of 10-year money recently. Mr Michael Ward, group finance director, says: 'We wanted a source of long-term funds. Currently there is a lack of preparedness by the UK clearing banks to extend over three years, so if you are looking for five- to seven-year money you have to be prepared to pay a very high price.' Mr Ward points out that he would expect to pay a margin of 75 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) for loans of between three and five years, and 'quite a significant premium' for loans of over five years. Mr Green says there is more flexibility in terms of covenants with a US private placement than with straightforward bank lending. In his view, the tight UK covenants - which set out the limits on financial ratios such as gearing - could prevent a company from making acquisitions which in the longer term would help to lift its profits. While some of the bigger, blue chip names can tap the Eurobond market for longer-term financing, this route is not open to less renowned credits. 'Companies below the double-A rating level can't access the Eurobond market easily,' points out Mr Stephen Schechter, managing director at Wertheim Schroder. Lucas's long-term credit rating was recently downgraded by IBCA from A - to BBB+. Mr Edward Freeborn, Lucas's director of corporate finance, admits that given the current credit rating 'it would not have been as easy' to go to the Eurobond market as to the US private placement market. Others, such as HP Bulmer, do not have a credit rating so would not be able to tap the Eurobond market, or else are too small in size. 'We have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 200m and pre-tax profit of about Pounds 13m . . . certainly for us a Eurobond would be out of the question,' points out Mr Dennis Clark, finance director of Hunting. Proceeds from US placements are often used to refinance more expensive debts at lower rates. Hunting has used proceeds from its Dollars 50m US private placement to replace its existing dollar borrowings at lower rates, while the proceeds from its Dollars 35m seven-year placement have been converted into floating and fixed rate sterling. Lucas plans to use the proceeds of its bond placement to refinance its short-term debt, although it swapped proceeds from an earlier private placement into floating rate dollars and sterling. HP Bulmer chose to swap its long-term dollar borrowings into floating and fixed rate sterling to give effective 10-year funding at a margin over Libor of less than one percentage point.</p>

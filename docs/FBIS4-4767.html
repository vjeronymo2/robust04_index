			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "First Opinion" column by Ricardo Malay: "Birth </F> of the Leftist Third Force"]    [Text] There were no cheers nor happy faces when Siglaya  was unveiled as the newest and third formation to grace the  political landscape of the Left. Its antecedents are, of  course, the venerable CPP [Communist Party of the Philippines]  and the revisionist Forte factions, better known as the  reaffirmists and the rejectionists, respectively.    The long faces at Siglaya's birth announcement could be the  result of pondering the shaky future that the Philippine Left  faces. The orthodox CPP leadership is in exile in Europe, its  chairman-guru forever lecturing on the relevance of Maoism to  the "Urgent Tasks" to his coterie of supporters who have seen  the practicality of pitching camp in the Netherlands.    The second block, headed by Felimon Lagman (who uses Carlos  Forte as a nom de guerre), may have seceded from CPP and  recruited two or three regional party groups and individual  party members to its "Urban Insurrection" cause. Yet no sparks  have been flying from Forte's camp except for an ABB [Alex  Boncayao Brigade] operation that resulted in the gunning down of  same small-time miscreants.    Siglaya's leaders made it clear that they do not subscribe  to  armed struggle in pursuing their vision of "human liberation."  Since it acknowledges that it's still in its infantile stages,  Siglaya has yet to spell out its charter. Is it influenced by  Marxism, by social democracy, by environmentalism?    The leading lights of the movement were only recently  members  of CPP. Hence, they are familiar with "democratic centralism,"  "proletarian dictatorship" and other practices which governed  the lives of Marxist revolutionaries.    These theories were great when the party was united and  growing in strength against an enemy that didn't hesitate to use  fascist methods -- such as the Marcos dictatorship. Never had  iron discipline been a great welder of party unity.    Of the three currents in the Philippine Left, Siglaya  appears  to be the moderate option. It steers clear of revolutionary  rhetoric and speaks of the "hopes and dreams of our people," and  being open to "changing realities and new ideas," and a manner  that is "empowering and democratic."    In a word, it is fed up with tyranny, double-talk,  rural-mindedness, impetuosity, infantile disorder and coercion.  Although a proletarian party is expected to uproot these  poisonous weeds, in practice the reverse is more likely to  happen.    When Lagman allowed himself to be interviewed by a TV  reporter, he mouthed hackneyed phrases taken from the works of  Marx, Lenin and Mao. He had nothing new to say, except that his  Manila-Rizal group was seceding from the CPP of Joma [Jose  Maria] Sison due to differences in "line and ideology." Some  differences. In a dramatic bid to dust up its image, his Alex  Boncayao Brigade (ABB) swore to dispense revolutionary justice  by executing corrupt officials and heinous criminals.    The ABB could only score minor hits but none of the big fish  it promised. Meanwhile the Manila-Rizal group is languishing in  inactivity. Its ideological leader is none other than Lagman  who cannot talk without quoting from the revered names of the  revolution.    Lagman's group has no prospect but extinction. It is in a  muddled mess, neither having an agenda nor a steady source of  financial support. As the latter crumbles, the group acquires  two options: One is to apply for amnesty and start off on a  different foot as peaceful reformists, and the other is to  resort to "economic struggles," that is, robbing banks and  extorting from businesses and rich people. Should the second  option be preferable, the urban insurrectionists will be seen as  the new lumpen proletariats of a new age.    The CCP [as published], in contrast to Lagman's group, has  had a charmed life. Even if the party organization and NPA [New  People's Army] units loyal to it gradually shrivels up, the  leadership remains intact in Europe.    It is possible that Sison, in 1987, foresaw the decline and  ebb tide of the revolution. Touring Europe at the time and  proffered sage advice by Louie Jalandoni, he concluded that  Europe offered him more space and security to inspire, direct  and orchestrate the revolution than if he were to return to the  Philippines.    Besides, the Europeans would be a perfect audience for the  CPP founder whose "original" views made him a candidate (along  with Abimael Guzman) for the "Revolution's Fourth Sword." In  view of Guzman's capture and conciliatory statements attributed  to him, Sison, according to his Filipino and European followers,  has won the moral right to be crowned the "Fourth Sword." The  three other swords are Marx, Lenin and Mao.    It is not known how Guzman will take these developments.  Although the Peruvian has a whole continent of revolutionaries  to ratchet him up, Sison has the militant Utrecht community and  a portion of Belgium backstopping him in this epochal showdown.</p>

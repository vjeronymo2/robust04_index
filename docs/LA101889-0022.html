			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Southwestern Bell Corp.: The St. Louis-based telecommunications company's  third-quarter net income fell 9% from a year ago to $295.3 million. Revenue  totaled $2.2 billion, down slightly from last year. The results were attributed  to a franchise tax refund Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. received last year;  the shift in production of several Yellow Pages directories from the third to  the fourth quarters; a one-time adjustment to the telephone company's revenue,  and a rate refund for Missouri customers as part of an agreement between state  regulators and the telephone company. The factors came despite growth in the  telephone company's customer access lines.  </P></p>

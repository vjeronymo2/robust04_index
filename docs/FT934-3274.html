			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: McCarthy &amp; Stone loss nearly halved at Pounds 11.2m McCarthy &amp; Stone, Britain's biggest builder of retirement homes, yesterday reported a reduction in pre-tax losses from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds 11.2m during the 12 months to the end of August. The company added that for the first time in three years it had earned an operating profit before interest, of Pounds 5.6m. The reduced loss was assisted by a fall in exceptional provisions from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 7.8m to cover the cost of running down Quadrant, the group's French business, and reorganising the UK business. The company has substantially reduced the amount of working capital tied up in stocks. It has also gained an improvement in margins as prices have risen and the need for sales incentives reduced as conditions in the housing market have improved. 'Prices currently are running about 11 per cent higher than during the corresponding period last year when the market was at a low ebb following sterling's withdrawal from the ERM,' said Mr John McCarthy, chairman. Turnover slipped from Pounds 73.7m to Pounds 71.1m. The group would be seeking shareholders' approval to set off a cumulative deficit of Pounds 6m against its share premium account. That would bring forward the date at which it could resume ordinary and preference share dividends when profitability improved, said Mr McCarthy. The sale of the company's Peverel management company since the year end for Pounds 30.7m had enabled it to reduce its borrowings to about Pounds 20m, equivalent to about 30 per cent of shareholders funds. Mr McCarthy said that the company was now well placed to take advantage of a market which would grow substantially as the number of elderly people reaching retirement age increased.</p>

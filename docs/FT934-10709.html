			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UDM may challenge pit closure BRITISH COAL was yesterday threatened with a legal challenge after it launched its pre-privatisation programme of pit closures by disclosing plans to end mining at Calverton colliery in Nottinghamshire in a fortnight. Leaders of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers said British Coal would contravene the industry's modified colliery review procedure by closing the pit on November 19 before consultations with workers would be concluded. Calverton was one of 12 pits reprieved by the government in March. Mr Mick Stevens, UDM general secretary in Nottinghamshire, said the pit was financially viable and the union would fight the closure. It hoped to persuade British Coal to keep the mine open while talks continued but would consider a High Court challenge. The stance of the UDM is significant because the union, which is predominant in Nottinghamshire, is seen as more pragmatic than the National Union of Mineworkers, the main union in the Yorkshire region, where more closure announcements involving two to four pits are expected next week. Further closures and mergers are expected in the next few months, to leave the industry with about 15 pits for privatisation. The 640 miners at Calverton will meet on Sunday to decide their next move. Some may be tempted by British Coal's redundancy terms, which will provide long-serving employees with up to Pounds 37,000. British Coal said there was a precedent, at Cadeby in South Yorkshire, for stopping production at a pit still in the review process. Calverton would be kept in a state where it could be re-opened. Mr John Longden, British Coal midlands director, said average production costs at Calverton were the highest in the coalfield. More than 22,000 workers have left the industry since last October. The remaining 30 pits employ 19,400 miners and British Coal has 10,700 other staff.</p>

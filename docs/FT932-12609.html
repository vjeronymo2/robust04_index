			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Russians cool to new bank proposal RUSSIA'S deputy prime minister, Mr Alexander Shokhin, yesterday dismissed the need for a new bank, modelled on the German Kredit-anstalt fur Wiederaufbau, to foster the financing and development of small and medium companies in Russia. 'It is one of the main functions of the EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Devlopment), we must build on this,' he said in an interview. 'We should certainly use the German experience, but if we create yet another bank we will waste more time and money.' Creation of a new bank was proposed by Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister at the opening of the EBRD annual meeting on Monday. Mr Shokhin also toned down criticism of slow disbursement by the EBRD expressed by Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of the Russian central bank, in his official statement as Russia's representative on the EBRD board of governors. 'It is true that disbursement is slow,' said Mr Shokhin, 'but that is more because of legal problems over the negative pledge clause demanded by the World Bank, than problems with the EBRD itself which operates on a more commercial basis.' When the EBRD sought to accelerate disbursements through the use of escrow accounts, it encountered problems with legal experts at Russia's own finance ministry, he said. 'Our experts feared that opening such accounts would facilitate the illegal flow of capital out of Russia. But after losing a year sorting out problems like these, we finally agreed on a formula using escrow accounts in a narrow range of approved banks.' Russia wants the EBRD to extend the range of projects it is prepared to finance away from the current emphasis on oil and other energy projects.</p>

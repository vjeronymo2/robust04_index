			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Books: The turning-point of suffering - The horrors of Stalingrad THE BATTLE FOR STALINGRAD by Edwin P Hoyt Robson Books Pounds 18.95, 304 pages IN LATE June 1941 Adolf Hitler launched 'Operation Barbarossa', a three-fronted attack on the Soviet Union aimed at a near-complete conquest before the dread Russian winter set in. It very nearly succeeded. Stalin had decimated the Red Army's command during the purges of the '30s. With an overwhelming superiority in quality and equipment, Hitler reckoned his armies would make short work of the Russians. He did not take into account that incalculable element which fate sneaks into battles. In this case it was twofold: the extraordinary resilience of the Russian people, their determination and fatalistic acceptance of sacrifice; and General Georgi Zhukov, the Red Army's Chief of Staff. Stalin and Hitler had a grudging admiration for each other. Both conducted the war with total disregard for the lives of their own people. But whereas there was no one in the German High Command to curb Hitler's strategic lunacy, Zhukov found the knack of swaying Stalin to see military sense. Stalingrad was built in the '20s. Straddling some 30 miles of the Volga, it was in itself of no outstanding strategic importance. Its significance was primarily psychological: with its parks, model houses and extensive industrial complex, Stalingrad epitomised Soviet Communism's highest achievement. Moreover, it carried Stalin's name. The first German assault ran out of steam at the gates of Moscow and Leningrad. Now the focus of the campaign shifted to the southern front in the Caucasus. Thus in the summer of 1942 every effort was turned to the capture of Stalingrad as first objective, with a pivotal swing northward on to Moscow as second. Stalin, even more than Hitler, realised that the hour of reckoning had come: in Stalingrad the fates of the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were to be determined. Hitler's obsession with the capture of Stalingrad was matched by Stalin's resolve not to retreat a single step. As both sides geared up for the confrontation, the scene was set for the Mother of All Battles; the Armageddon of the century. It proved to be just that. By the end of the summer the German 6th Army under General von Paulus had gained control of all but a few pockets of resistance in Stalingrad. Then winter came with sudden ferocity. In November General Zhukov launched the counter attack aimed at encircling the 6th Army and cutting it to bits. Previous fatalism - enforced by NKVD (the Soviet equivalent of the Gestapo) units peremptorily executing suspected deserters - gave way to growing confidence. At last the Soviet war industry was out-performing the German. In February 1943 General von Paulus, his army starved, frozen, sick with typhus, its supplies exhausted, surrendered unconditionally to the Soviets. Millions died in the battle. The suffering endured by both sides - but particularly by soldiers of the besieged 6th Army, where 'Doberman pinscher stew' was a delicacy while the dogs lasted - defies imagination. The landscape was left littered with frozen corpses and half-eaten cadavers of horses. All that remained of Stalingrad was a broken apocalyptic wasteland. More than 90,000 German soldiers were taken prisoner. Barely 5,000 returned to tell the tale. At Stalingrad the pendulum swung against Hitler. Here was the first big turning point of the war. Literature on Stalingrad is plentiful, including documents newly-released by post-Soviet Russia. Hoyt has made intelligent use of much of it. The writing is cinematically vivid. By including personal testimonies of soldiers from both sides, he offers a poignant human dimension to counter-balance the carnage and devastation of Stalingrad. I found this book almost impossible to put down. Regretfully, the maps are awful.</p>

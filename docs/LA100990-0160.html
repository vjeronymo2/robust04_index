			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ISRAEL SHUTS TEMPLE MOUNT IN BID TO QUELL STRIFE;  </P> <P> MIDEAST: TEAR GAS IS USED ON MUSLIM WORSHIPERS SEEKING TO BREAK THROUGH POLICE  LINES.  </P> <P> Police closed the sacred Temple Mount today and fired tear gas after 200 Muslim  worshipers tried to break through the cordon. Jerusalem's 80-year-old chief  Muslim cleric was overcome by tear gas.  </P> <P> The temporary closure came one day after riots on the Temple Mount, Islam's  third-holiest site, in which at least 19 Palestinians were killed and about 140  were wounded by police gunfire.  </P> <P> In an Arab neighborhood of Jerusalem today, a Palestinian stabbed two border  policemen with a screwdriver. The attacker and another Arab were shot and  wounded, police said.  </P> <P> Clashes between stone throwers and police also erupted in three other Jerusalem  Arab neighborhoods, and widespread protests were reported in Israeli Arab  towns, where leaders called for a two-day strike over the Temple Mount  bloodshed.  </P> <P> Palestinian leaders in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip have demanded  U.N. protection and announced a protest strike beginning today, the start of  the 36th month of the anti-Israeli uprising in the territories seized during  the 1967 Middle East war.  </P> <P> Monday's violence forced the Palestinian question back toward the top of the  international agenda. It was the bloodiest clash in Jerusalem since the 1967  war and the highest single-day death toll in the uprising.  </P> <P> Arab leaders denounced the use of deadly force by Israel. President Hosni  Mubarak of Egypt said the violence could lead to "grave consequences."  </P> <P> Also condemning the Temple Mount violence were Japan, the Soviet Union, the  European Community's executive body and the president of the European  Parliament.  </P> <P> Muslim leaders said today's closure of the Temple Mount marked the first time  police had blocked entry to the 35-acre site and its two mosques since Israel  captured the surrounding Old City in 1967. The keys to the gates of the wall  around the Temple Mount were returned to Muslim officials this afternoon, and  one of the mosque's doors was opened, Muslim clerics said.  </P> <P> Before control of the Temple Mount was returned to the Muslims, the chief  Muslim cleric, the mufti of Jerusalem, led 200 Muslims to a gate of the shrine.  Border police blocked their way and ordered them to leave.  </P> <P> When the Muslims refused, police fired tear gas, and the mufti, Saad al-Din  al-Alami, was overcome, an Arab reporter said. The mufti was taken to Mukassed  Hospital, where he was reported in satisfactory condition.  </P></p>

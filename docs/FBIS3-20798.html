The individual voting district election board  shall count the number of nominating slips in the presence of  the person submitting the slips. If the board does not render a  decision regarding the registration of nomination at the time it  receives the nomination slips, it shall preserve the nominating  slips in the form of a closed, sealed bundle, in a secure place.  The election board shall notify the nominee or his  representative of the date when the election board renders a  decision, and shall open the closed bundle, and perform possible  certification in the presence of the nominee or his  representative.    ``6.6. Unless the election board of an individual  voting district receives a challenge to a nomination, it shall  destroy the nominating slips on election day, in the presence of  the nominee or his representative.    ``6.7. If an objection is raised, or legal recourse is  sought against the decision of an individual voting district  election board, or if legal recourse is sought against the  decision rendered by the National Election Board, the nominating  slips may be transferred to an administrative organ or court  having jurisdiction, for the exclusive purpose of judging the  objection. After a final judgment is reached regarding an  objection or petition for legal recourse, these nominating slips  shall also be destroyed on election day.    ``6.8. Election boards shall make provisions to deny  access by unauthorized persons to the nominating slips during  the time period beginning with the receipt of nomination slips,  and ending with their destruction.    ``6.9. If a nominating slip is used as evidence in a  criminal proceeding, it shall be destroyed immediately after an  affirmed judgment is reached in the criminal proceeding.    ``6.10.

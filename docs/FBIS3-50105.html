			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President of the Srpska republic Dr. Radovan  Karadzic visited Vrbas today. On this occasion he informed his  hosts of the current political situation in the Srpska republic.  Here is a dispatch by Novi Sad Television:    [Begin recording] [Reporter Mileva Tomic] The present  moment in the resolution of the crisis in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina is being marked by a unique absurdity,  namely, by the Muslim side rejecting the realization of its own  proposal, President of the Srpska republic Radovan Karadzic  emphasized when he was explaining the stance of the Serbian  delegation at the peace talks.    [Karadzic] Now we will probably revoke all these proposals.  In our pocket we have a new platform [word indistinct] for a  modus vivendi in (?which we shall depart from the factual  situation). The factual situation is the borders of the Srpska  republic. They can only be changed through agreement. The one  who attacks us should receive a fitting reply in accordance with  the rules of international military law. This is one of the  possibilities by which we might recall everything that the  Muslims have gained from us as a sort of concessions.    [Tomic] Speaking of the long-term goals of the Serbian  people on the territory of former Yugoslavia, Radovan Karadzic  singled out the need for unity and responsible analysis of joint  interests as the only way of their realization.    [Karadzic] I must say that it has always been a great  concern of ours and that, regardless of what we do, we also  think of the Serbian Krajina. [Serbian President] Milosevic,  myself, and my delegation (?have concluded) that it would be the  best to accept the opening of a bureau of the Republic of  Croatia in Belgrade, as this would in no way impair Krajina's  interests, because the bureau of the republic of Serbian Krajina  and the bureau of the Srpska republic already exist in Belgrade.  With the bureau of the Republic of Croatia, Croatia is now being  brought to a completely equal footing with Krajina and the  Srpska republic; therefore, it did not get any more than the  Serbian Krajina got.    The other thing that we have achieved is that Croatia's  drawing nearer to the Serbs has de-vilified Serbia. Serbia is no  longer an aggressor, a demon, and so forth, and here we have  benefited much more than [Croatian President] Tudjman.    [Tomic] The Srpska republic is a real country, Karadzic  said,  disorganized as much as any other country in conditions of war,  but with a clear goal and generally acceptable methods for the  creation of a free and democratic community of the Serbian  people.

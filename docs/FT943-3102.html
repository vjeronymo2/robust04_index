			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Swiss investment group criticises banks' profit fall BK Vision, the investment company controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group, has strongly criticised the first-half profit slump of Switzerland's large banks. In its report to shareholders for the eight months to August 31, BK argues that the volatile own-account securities trading business is not compatible with the traditional and highly profitable services of Swiss banks. BK is the largest shareholder in Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), holding 7 per cent of the capital with a SFr2.1bn (Dollars 1.59bn) market value. UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, last month reported a 28 per cent slide in first-half net income to SFr929m, mainly because its profits from trading, at SFr493m, were SFr1.05bn lower than in the first half of 1993. Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corporation also suffered sharply lower trading profits. BK, which earlier this year attacked UBS for having too large a board of directors, called on the banks' boards to make clear their risk policies. Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, a BK director, said there was nothing intrinsically wrong with high earnings volatility, but investors needed to know where they stood. Mr Schiltknecht said Swiss banks had to be active traders in support of their large fund management businesses for clients. According to a recent compilation by Euromoney magazine, UBS is the third largest fund manager outside the US, with about Dollars 245bn under its control. However, the question was whether the banks should also be trading in risky securities for their own account. UBS said yesterday it was not just a fund manager. It aimed to be a global financial services group, strong in credit and trading sectors as well. It felt the volatility of its trading profits had stayed within reasonable levels in the past few years, with the exception of the first half of 1993, when the result was extraordinarily high. BK made a SFr11m profit for the eight-month period, turning round a loss of SFr30.1m suffered in the first four months. Administration expenses were virtually unchanged from the first four months. No management fee was payable in the latest four months because of the decline of the market value of the shares in the portfolio. The company charged SFr30m against earnings for unrealised losses. BK reported a SFr76.7m net gain on investments in the eight months, compared with a loss of SFr3.9m in the first four months. Its holding of Zurich Insurance was reduced by 65,500 shares between April and August while its holding in UBS was unchanged with 18.6 per cent of the registered shares and 3.1 per cent of the bearers.</p>

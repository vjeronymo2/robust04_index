			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency stated that it believes this reporting requirement is necessary for several reasons. It would provide one central location from which information can be gathered concerning the labels. Inquiries could come from within the agency, or from interested members of the public. In addition, such reporting would aid the agency in deciding whether to initiate any investigations or audits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency received several comments on the proposed reporting requirements. AAMA stated that the proposed requirements should be modified to require submittal of information not later than the date the first vehicle of the carline is offered for sale to the ultimate purchaser. Isuzu suggested that flexibility be introduced to permit manufacturers to submit a report whenever a major specification change has been made in the middle of a model year or whenever the manufacturer opts to change the model year at a timing different from normally accepted model year changes. NTEA stated that it understands that small multi-stage businesses are not subject to the reporting requirements unless they produce carlines of over 1,000 vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the comments, the agency has decided to adopt reporting requirements along the line of the proposal, but to require submittal of information not later than the date the first vehicle of the carline is offered for sale to the ultimate purchaser. This date will be adequate for the agency's purposes in monitoring the information on the labels. Moreover, this date is consistent with the agency's decision, discussed above, not to require labels to be placed on vehicles prior to the introduction date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency cannot provide flexibility to permit manufacturers to update labels during a model year, since section 210(b) provides that content percentages are ``established at the beginning of each model year for such carline and shall be applicable to that carline for the entire model year.'' There is therefore no reason to provide flexibility with respect to reporting updated information. However, if a manufacturer discovers an error in the information reported to the agency, it should send information to the agency correcting that error.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA agrees with NTEA that any manufacturer that is not required to provide information on a carline basis, i.e., items one and two on the label, is not subject to the reporting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Leadtime/First Year Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of manufacturers and suppliers argued that they cannot comply with all the data collection and calculation requirements by the October 1994 implementation date. AAMA stated that the proposed regulation will require extensive data collection and calculation requirements, and that there are several areas of uncertainty that will not be resolved until a final rule is issued. It stated that it has been working in conjunction with the AIAG and a number of suppliers to establish processes to comply with the law, but has been unable to complete this activity because of uncertainties about the final rule. AAMA stated that manufacturers and suppliers will not be able to comply with all the data collection and calculation requirements by October 1994. It requested NHTSA to allow manufacturers and suppliers to use procedures that are expected to yield similar results for at least 12 months after the final rule is published.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GM stated that because of the scope of the effort to comply with the new requirements, at least one year is required between the publication of the final rule and the effective date of the rule. That manufacturer stated that it supports the interim AAMA proposal of making a best efforts determination of domestic and foreign content for the AALA required label using presently available CAFE cost and origin data for the first year after publication of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford submitted a comment along the lines of that of AAMA. It also provided NHTSA with a copy of an EPA final rule, published in February 1993, which established labeling requirements for products manufactured with certain ozone-depleting substances. EPA stated in the preamble for that final rule that it recognized the practical problems the regulated community would have in meeting a May 15, 1993 statutory deadline for labeling, ``given the late publication of this rule.'' 58 FR 8136, February 11, 1993. EPA stated that ``(a)s a result of the concerns, it is the Agency's policy to take no enforcement action for matters occurring during the first nine months following the publication of these regulations.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BMW stated that if NHTSA does not permit manufacturers a permanent alternative of using existing, substantial business records to make parts content calculations, it should allow such an alternative on an interim basis in lieu of granting additional leadtime.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Calsonic stated that the proposed leadtime for suppliers was extremely short and requested postponement of at least a year. Nippondenso also stated that the proposed leadtime for suppliers was short, and requested that the effective date of the regulations be postponed for at least six months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the comments, NHTSA agrees, given the complexity of the data collection and calculation requirements, that it is impossible for manufacturers and suppliers to fully comply with all of the requirements by October 1, 1994. The agency notes that this conclusion is partly based on the fact that manufacturers cannot complete their calculations until they receive specified information from suppliers, and allied suppliers cannot complete their calculations until they receive specified information from outside suppliers. The conclusion is also partly based on the fact that many of the requirements are in the regulation as opposed to section 210, i.e., manufacturers and suppliers could not comply with the data collection and calculation requirements absent a final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA is nonetheless faced with the section 210(b) requirement that labels be provided on each vehicle manufactured on or after October 1, 1994. The agency agrees with AAMA that the most appropriate means for resolving this problem is to permit manufacturers and suppliers to use procedures that are expected to yield similar results, for about a year. The agency believes that this temporary alternative will ensure that consumers receive the best information possible about the foreign and U.S./Canada origin of vehicles they are considering purchasing during this period, given that full compliance by manufacturers and suppliers is not possible. NHTSA has decided to adopt the following specific requirement: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For model year 1995 and model year 1996 carlines which are first offered for sale to ultimate purchasers before June 1, 1995, manufacturers and suppliers may, instead of following the calculation procedures set forth in this part, use procedures that they expect, in good faith, to yield similar results. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA notes several things about this temporary alternative approach. First, it is available for all model year 1995 vehicles and for any model year 1996 vehicles which are introduced before June 1, 1995. The agency selected the June 1, 1995 date because it ensures manufacturers additional flexibility for about a one-year period. NHTSA notes that since most model year 1996 vehicles will be introduced in the fall of 1995, manufacturers will have additional flexibility for early introductions (a model year 1996 vehicle could be introduced as early as January 1995, for which full compliance might not be possible), but will need to meet the full requirements for the vast majority of model year 1996 vehicles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

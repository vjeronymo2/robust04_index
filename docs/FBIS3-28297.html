			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] While the United States has demanded that Japan  implement income tax reduction, the implementation has now been  taken back to the drawing board amid the current confusion on  the tax system reform. In this connection, a top Foreign  Ministry [MOF] official stated on the evening of 4 February:  "If the prime minister cancels the upcoming Japan-U.S. summit  meeting because of a failure to implement tax cuts, it will be  questioned how other issues would be dealt with." Thus, the  official indicated that Prime Minister Hosokawa's visit to the  United States set for 10 February should take place even if no  conclusion is reached on the tax cuts issue.</p>

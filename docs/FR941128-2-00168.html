			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, under the Exchange's current rules, a subject who unsuccessfully attempts to resolve a disciplinary matter through expedited proceedings is permitted to take advantage of the entire 120-day settlement period, no matter how long the subject may have spent in the expedited proceeding process. As a result, as noted by the Exchange and by the Division of Market Regulation (``Division'') of the Commission in connection with the Division's inspection of the Exchange's surveillance, investigative, and enforcement programs which took place last year, it is possible for a respondent to utilize the expedited proceeding process as a means of circumventing the 120-day settlement period limit and accordingly as a means of simply delaying the resolution of the case. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter from Brandon Becker, Director, Division, Commission, to Charles Henry, President, CBOE, dated October 20, 1993, and Letter from Charles Henry, President, CBOE, to Brandon Becker, Director, Division, Commission, dated January 14, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to this concern, the CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rule 17.8 to reduce the time period during which settlement offers may be submitted by a subject who seeks to resolve a disciplinary matter through expedited proceedings, is unable to reach an agreement with Exchange staff, and consumes over 30 days in the expedited proceeding process. Specifically, under the proposal, the number of days in excess of 30 days that a subject spends in the expedited proceeding will be deducted from the 120-day settlement period applicable to the subject; provided, however, that in no event will a subject's settlement period under CBOE Rule 17.8 ever be less than 14 days. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendment will also amend all of the references to the 120-day settlement period which are contained currently in CBOE Rule 17.8 to acknowledge that this settlement period will be shorter in situations where the mechanism described for limiting the 120-day settlement period becomes applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The mechanism for limiting settlement periods will apply only to a subject who attempts to resolve a disciplinary matter through expedited proceedings and is unable to reach an agreement with CBOE staff upon a letter of consent. It will not apply to a subject who attempts to resolve a disciplinary matter through expedited proceedings and who reaches an agreement with CBOE staff upon a letter of consent, but finds that the agreed-upon letter of consent is not accepted by the BCC. In addition, under this mechanism, in no event will the number of days between the time that the expedited proceedings process is deemed to end (as described below) and the time that a subject is served with a statement of charges be deducted from the 120-day settlement period applicable to the subject. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment will also refine the procedures that are applicable to expedited proceedings under CBOE Rule 17.3 in two ways. First, the proposed amendment will impose a new requirement that any subject desiring to attempt to resolve a disciplinary matter through expedited proceedings submit a written notice of this fact to the Exchange staff within 15 days from the date of service upon the subject of a Notification Letter. Second, the proposed amendment will permit either the Exchange staff or the subject to declare an end to the negotiations regarding a letter of consent and thus an end to the expedited proceeding process at any point in the consent negotiations by delivering a written declaration to this effect to the other party. After the declaration is delivered, the subject will have 15 days to submit a Notification Response and the Exchange staff will then be permitted to bring the matter to the BCC. Currently, there is no provision in the CBOE's rules setting forth when a subject is deemed to enter the expedited proceeding process or when the expedited proceeding process is deemed to end, and these new procedures will establish a start and end date for when a subject is deemed to be in the expedited proceeding process so that the number of days that the subject spends in the expedited proceeding process can be calculated for the purposes of CBOE Rule 17.8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the proposal makes certain editorial changes to clarify CBOE Rules 17.8 and 17.3 without affecting their substance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CBOE believes that the proposal will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the Exchange's disciplinary process. Specifically, the Exchange believes that by limiting the settlement period applicable to those subjects who consume over 30 days in the expedited proceeding process but cannot reach an agreement with the Exchange staff upon a letter of consent, the proposed changes will minimize opportunities for delay and thereby help to preserve evidence and the memories of witnesses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Basis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

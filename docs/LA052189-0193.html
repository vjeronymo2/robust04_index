			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: ARTURO TOSCANINI CONTEMPORARY RECOLLECTIONS OF THE MAESTRO  BY B.H. HAGGIN THOMAS HATHAWAY, EDITOR (DA CAPO PRESS: $13.95)  </P> <P> This copious paperback began life as two volumes from the sharp pen of B. H.  Haggin, a 50-year veteran of New York music criticism. The first segment  consists of Haggin's conversations with the Italian conductor, the second of  statements Haggin collected from musicians who had performed with the maestro.  Toscanini (1867-1957) is an excellent subject for personal reminiscence, since  the colorful conductor is almost as famous for his legendary tantrums as he is  for his musical prowess. Haggin himself was Toscanini's equal in vanity, yet  these two men developed a warm friendship, perhaps because they formed a mutual  admiration society. Toscanini allowed Haggin to attend rehearsals; this sign of  favor becomes particularly interesting in light of rumors that Toscanini  periodically ordered lights turned up in the hall during rehearsals while staff  scoured the balconies to see that nobody was concealed there.  </P> <P> Toscanini's pronouncements on the great composers were no more respectful than  his views of contemporary musicians. On one occasion a member of the orchestra  commented that Toscanini looked in good form. Toscanini replied despondently:  "I am an old man." But Maestro, the musician persisted, "think of Verdi. He  lived to be 87." "Verdi!" Toscanini snorted scornfully. "He was a sick old man.  I am strong; I will live longer than Verdi."  </P></p>

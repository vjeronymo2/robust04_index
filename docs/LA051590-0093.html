			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> WESTLAKE FINISHES 3RD IN GOLF  </P> <P> The way Westlake High golf Coach Lorin Maygren looks at things, some days a  team puts the heat on opponents and sometimes it gets smoked.  </P> <P> After Costa Mesa Estancia fired a sizzling 371 at Canyon Country Club in Palm  Springs on Monday to win its second consecutive Southern Section team title,  Maygren shrugged and waxed philosophical about getting waxed.  </P> <P> "We didn't get nipped, that's for sure," Maygren said. "But that's the way it  goes. Some days, a team shoots rounds like that."  </P> <P> Westlake didn't exactly fall over, however, finishing third with a 394. The  Warriors, in fact, recorded their fourth top-three finish in five seasons,  which includes section titles in 1986 and '87.  </P> <P> By finishing in the top four, Westlake advances to the California  Interscholastic Federation-Southern California Golf Assn. championships June 11  at El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana. Teams from the Los Angeles City, San  Diego and Central sections also will participate.  </P> <P> Dana Hills, second at 389, and Palm Desert, fourth at 396, also advance to the  CIF-SCGA event. Even though Westlake did not win the team tournament, it marked  a turnaround: last season the Warriors failed to advance beyond the team  regional.  </P> <P> "We needed to come back," Maygren said. "And I don't think we're through yet."  </P> <P> Hart, which tied Servite at 376 in the Central Regional last Monday at  Montebello Country Club, finished fifth at 399, but missed qualifying for the  CIF-SCGA tournament. Hart was led by sophomore Jason Gore's one-over 73 and  junior Mike Miller's 74.  </P> <P> Juniors Shane O'Brien (83), Chad Butler (86) and Jason Black (83) completed  Hart's scoring.  </P> <P> Newbury Park, third in the Northern Regional last week, fired a 407 and  finished seventh.  </P> <P> Westlake's Charlie Wi, the two-time defending Marmonte League individual  champion, fired the day's low round with a three-under 69. Wi's round included  four birdies and a lone bogey.  </P> <P> "He played close to perfectly," Maygren said of Wi, a senior who will attend  Nevada Reno next year. Jerry Chang (75), John Talifer (81), Mark Buntz (84) and  Aaron Brady (85) rounded out the Westlake scoring.  </P> <P> Estancia blew away the field with a depth charge. Using the standard format in  which the best five of six individual scores count toward the team total, each  Estancia player broke 80 and a round of 78 was tossed out.  </P> <P> For Marmonte League champion Newbury Park, which finished second to Estancia in  the team tournament last season, sophomore Keith Ealy fired the low round of  79, followed by Darren Humphrey (80), Genio Borghi (82), Steve Holmes (83) and  Brad Bronk (83).  </P> <P> Westlake, which finished second to Newbury Park in the Marmonte team finals two  weeks ago, tied Sunny Hills for first in the Northern Regional last week at  Olivas Park Golf Course in Ventura with a 371.  </P> <P> BOYS' TENNIS  </P> <P> Kennedy 28 1/2, Washington 1 -- David Schwartz, Bobby Butler and Tony Yen all  were unbeaten in singles play to lead top-seeded Kennedy in a first-round City  Section 3-A Division playoff match at Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> The No. 1 doubles team of Josh Etting and Che Naveja did not lose a game for  defending champion Kennedy, which plays the winner of the Marshall-Franklin  match at CSUN on Friday.  </P> <P> Cleveland 21, Venice 4 -- Chul Uh and Khoi Doan led Cleveland with three wins  apiece in singles play in a first-round 3-A match at Cleveland.  </P> <P> Chatsworth 18 1/2, Grant 11 -- Fueled by its doubles teams, Chatsworth recorded  a first-round 4-A upset of second-seeded Grant at the Racquet Centre in Studio  City.  </P> <P> The doubles teams of Philip Tietjen and Tony Joseph, John Butiu and Mike  Carone, Fred Wiener and Aron Haaz all were 3-0 to lead Chatsworth.  </P> <P> Taft 22 1/2, North Hollywood 7 -- John Rom, David Alderman, Mikail Rudolfsen,  David Goldman all went 3-1 in singles play to lead fourth-seeded Taft in a  first-round 4-A match at Pierce College.  </P> <P> Derek Halpern and Dvir Levy were 3-0 in doubles for Taft.  </P></p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Arts: How a closet comedian came out - Nigel Andrews talks to Leslie Neilsen, 'Naked Gun' hero and cinema's surest serial laughter-raiser Consider the bizarre career of Leslie Nielsen. A man is born near the Arctic Circle. Descending to the US, he ascends the Broadway stage as a leading actor and soon after becomes a name in lights in Hollywood (The Vagabond King, Forbidden Planet). He spends 20 years drifting through lead roles in smallish movies and historic cameos in big ones: including the Captain who capsized the Poseidon. (Single indelible line: 'Ohh my Gohhd]') Then he turns to comedy, in Airplane and The Naked Gun, and starts to carry entire hit films on his now 60-year-old back. It must be sorcery. Ever since America's centre of witchcraft moved from Salem, Massachusetts, to Hollywood, California, this kind of thing has gone on. But Nielsen embodies something else too: he is modern Hollywood looking back post-modernly on old Hollywood. The characters Nielsen plays for laughs are the same, to all purposes, as the ones he played 40 years ago with a frown. Re-script his earnest spaceship captain in Forbidden Planet for the new gobbledegook, and you would have an advance simulacrum of the Airplane doctor who said 'Don't call me Shirley' or of Lieutenant Frank Drebin in The Naked Gun. 'They spotted me for what I was, a closet comedian,' Nielsen says of the Airplane/Gun team, David and Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams. We were sitting in armchairs in his agent's office in Hollywood. Or rather Nielsen was sitting on a whoopee cushion and I had been reacting politely to his re-run of a rude-noises routine he had once done on the Wogan show. As modern cinema's surest serial laughter-raiser, this man now thinks he ought to be comic off screen. But it is Nielsen's non-comic persona that makes him funny: that craggy face lined with wisdom and topped with Biblical-white hair; that bass voice made to boom orders or to purr fathomless authority. Set them up; burnish them to a glow; then have his characters drive into dustbins, mispronounce names or have 'safe sex' with Priscilla Presley (Naked Gun) wrapped in a body-sized condom. Nielsen, though, thinks the incongruities were there from the beginning. 'I'm bow-legged,' he explains, recalling his first movie. That was The Vagabond King, a sort of medieval musical. 'They make armour for straight-legged people, so as soon as I put it on, I went 'Yeeaggh]' They had to bend my leg-casings. Then I had to walk across the ballroom floor to confront the Dauphin, and the director Michael Curtiz (of Casablanca), who was Hungarian, said 'Leslie, I vant you should move quickly for my tempo.' I said, 'Yes, Mr Curtiz' and off I went. Two years later I saw the film and watched this guy going across the floor looking like a giant egg-beater. If they'd thrown 10,000 eggs in, I could've made breakfast for the army.' I had barely noticed his bow legs, I said. But perhaps they are the concealed motley on a man born to move from Hamlet to clown, even though it took three decades. Nielsen himself cannot believe his career kismet - or that he now thrives in big-city Lotusland. 'Where I was born (Regina, Canada), you had different priorities. I had no choice to become streetwise, because we had no streets. I knew about animals and wheat and mud and gumbo and 64 below zero. Coming from that to Los Angeles, I was someone with a monumental sense of not belonging. I was afraid I'd be found out as untalented and sent back to Canada.' Instead he rose to fame during the incredibly earnest 1950s. His air of avuncular command on screen - a sort of Eisenhower with hair - must have massaged a nationful of bruised postwar nerves and egos. Nielsen himself has a fascination with that time and what it was about. 'Change. Americans were called on to respond to so many changes so rapidly, it's a testimony to the vitality of the society itself that it has survived. 'But changes make you vulnerable, and the values you're talking about' - I had been going on about Doris Day and the squeaky-clean movement - 'became very important to hold on to. Because you did feel there was something slipping away, and 'squeaky clean' means you think you know what you're doing. It's a lack of reality about change; not seeing things as they really were; wanting to keep everything the same.' And 1950s styles and pseudo-certainties, surely, are what movies like Airplane and The Naked Gun are now lampooning?: that daft sense of never had it so good, of 'Someone is in charge', of keep the clay feet hidden and our heroes will remain heroes. The affluent, overconfident 1980s/early '90s saw a mirror image giggling back at them from the 1950s. Airplane's point of departure was an old Doris Day movie, in which the perfect virgin steered a troubled passenger aircraft to safety. And The Naked Gun series takes off from - and takes off - all those 1950s police shows like Dragnet and Highway Patrol where civilisation was saved by cops with deep voice-overs. Nielsen himself received only one unalterable rule from Messrs Zucker, Zucker and Abraham when he was thrown into Airplane. 'They said, 'At no time behave in a way that tells the audience you're trying to be funny.'' Nor was any improvising allowed on the script. 'Comedy is very honed. The smallest deviation can kill the joke.' So he and fellow veterans Robert Stack and Lloyd Bridges donned the frowns and speak-your-weight voices and provided the most powerfully assured old-timers' reunion in all of movie comedy. Now Naked Gun 33 1/3 is about to discharge itself on screen (UK, May 19) and Leslie Nielsen has become a millionaire of stage, screen and cider commercials. He must be afraid that after decades of being typecast as a straight man, with no escape route into comedy, he is now typecast for life as a funnyman. 'No. I am so grateful. My career has been such an incredible roll of the dice. I have no ambitions to play Hamlet.' Well, but now he mentions it - if Mel Gibson and Arnold (Last Action Hero) Schwarzenegger can do it . . .</p>

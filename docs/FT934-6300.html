			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Japanese underwear group advances 5% Wacoal, Japan's leading manufacturer of women's underwear, saw firm interim profits due to rationalisation of sales and advertising costs, but lower sales due to sluggish demand for nightwear and sportswear. The company posted a 5.1 per cent rise to Y6.6bn (Dollars 60m) in pre-tax profits for the six months to September. Sales slipped by 1.7 per cent to Y65bn, but after-tax profits rose by 14.4 per cent to Y3.5bn. Underwear sales rose by 4.8 per cent to Y49.8bn but nightwear sales fell by 12 per cent to Y6.1bn and outerwear and sportswear sales dropped by 25.6 per cent to Y3.6bn. Wacoal said better trading profits offset a fall in interest income due to lower interest rates. After-tax profits were boosted by special gains of Y803m on the sale of securities holdings. The company expects continued sluggish demand during the second half, and foresees a 2.3 per cent decline in full-year pre-tax profits to Y10.3bn on sales up 0.4 per cent to Y128bn. After-tax profit is forecast to rise by 2.1 per cent to Y5.2bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] has decided the system of controlling exports of  strategic materials, including machine tools which might be used  for producing weapons of mass destruction, will be simplified  successively beginning 1 April. Since the international system  for controlling exports of nuclear weapons and missiles has been  strengthened, many more items have now been placed under  control. Therefore, MITI has decided to take this measure to  lessen the office work of businessmen engaged in export, such as  trading firms. In practice, a blanket permit system [hokatsu  kyoka-sei] will be introduced for applications for exports to  Western countries--those countries unlikely to become involved  in conflicts. Once an application is approved, no further  separate applications will be necessary for a period of three  years. Moreover, procedures for applications will be  simplified, and part of the permit-issuance authority will be  transferred to local bureaus of industry and international trade.    There are many varieties of materials and mechanical  equipment which can be used for producing such weapons of mass  destruction as nuclear weapons, biological and chemical weapons,  and missiles; in addition to machine tools needed for producing  nuclear weapons, there is equipment for producing rockets as  well as carbon fiber and super alloys. Concerning the export of  strategic materials, the international control system has been  improved by such countries as Japan, the United States, and  European nations. As a result, the number of items under  control has increased, and the number of permits issued by MITI  increased from less than 20,000 in 1991 to 80,000 in 1993.    According to the blanket permit system, once the application  is approved, individual applications for exports of materials  under control will be exempted for a certain period of time.  This system will be applied for a period of three years to  applications for exports to Western countries which have joined  international export control systems such as the Australia Group  [as published] (participants in the conference on control of  materials that can be used for producing chemical weapons), as  well as applications for export for a period of two years to  affiliated companies established in countries other than the  United States and European nations with the capital of parent  companies. MITI estimates that with the introduction of the  blanket permit system, the number of applications for export  permits will be reduced by about 60 percent.    Moreover, the system of requesting preliminary examinations  prior to the application will be abolished. Procedures for  applications will be largely simplified and the examination  period shortened. Moreover, the authority of issuing permits to  applications for exports to those Western countries which are  participants in the export control system will be transferred  from MITI to local bureaus of industry and international trade  hopefully beginning this fall.    A blanket permit system will also be introduced for export  of  cargoes as well as for transactions in service based on the same  contract. Presently in cases of applying exports of machine  tools and programs for operating these tools, separate  applications are requested for permits, even if exports are  based on the same contract, because these permits are issued on  the basis of different laws and regulations. Therefore,  dissatisfaction has been voiced among those engaged in the  export business.</p>

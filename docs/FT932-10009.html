			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Berisford in black and reaffirms acquisition stance BERISFORD International yesterday reported a return to profits and pledged to continue its search for acquisitions despite being turned down last week as a suitor for C&amp;J Clark, the shoe company. Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive, said the group was assessing four possible deals, mainly acquisitions of subsidiaries of larger companies. Mr Bowkett said Berisford was 'seeking friendly transactions' but then quipped 'a hostile bid would be a piece of cake after this'. Berisford is understood to be considering claiming its costs, amounting to less than Pounds 1m, for the abortive Pounds 184m bid from Clark. Mr John Sclater, chairman, said the property and agribusiness group would 'continue to pursue with undiminished enthusiasm opportunities for our management team to develop a broadly based industrial holding company'. He said Berisford was disappointed not to have the chance 'to effect the substantial improvement in performance that we believe we could have enabled Clark's to implement'. Berisford wished Clark well 'in resolving the substantial issues facing them'. Berisford shares returned from suspension and closed unchanged at 128p. The group reported a Pounds 400,000 pre-tax profit for the six months to end-March, compared to a loss of Pounds 57.4m which was after substantial provisions. However, the outcome included a Pounds 2.1m gain on the sale of the stake in Hunter Saphir. No new provisions were needed, Mr Sclater said, and the group 'is now on a firm financial footing and ready to move forward again'. At the half year end, Berisford had net cash of Pounds 3.2m (debt Pounds 15m at the last year end). At its peak in 1990 debt was Pounds 1.2bn. Turnover fell from Pounds 103.1m to Pounds 47.3m, although the fall in sales from continuing operations was from Pounds 87.4m. The loss from continuing operations was Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 1.2m) as the agribusiness interests suffered a drop in cotton sales and the engineering subsidiary experienced a price squeeze from motor industry customers. Earnings per share were 0.3p (losses of 58.3p restated for the 5-for-1 share consolidation and the use of FRS 3). There is no interim dividend. Berisford last paid a dividend in respect of the year covering 1988-89.</p>

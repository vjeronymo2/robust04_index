			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Argos Argos has done well from the dour business of selling its vast range of consumer goods more cheaply than the competition. On the evidence of yesterday's figures, the formula is far from running out of steam. Second-half sales growth from existing stores of 8 per cent is especially impressive, although that rate of improvement will be difficult to sustain whether or not next month's tax increases dampen consumer spending. While its new stores are performing well, Argos stands out as a retailer delivering decent sales growth without surrendering much by way of margin. The nagging worry is that margins might have to be sacrificed in order to remain the cheapest retailer in town. So far any such price initiatives have come from the company itself, and compensating efficiencies have been found. Limited price wars have been dealt with by surrendering market share, as was the case last year in DIY. The wider danger is that Argos will find its cost advantage gradually eroded by specialist retailers with greater purchasing muscle in each of its product areas. That is all the more reason for Argos to sow the seeds of diversification. With average cash balances running at over Pounds 100m, it has no shortage of resources. The costly flop that was Chesterman should not argue against other, better-timed initiatives. While the cash pile is not yet large enough to demand immediate action, a sensible move to spread its bets cannot come soon enough.</p>

Provincial party committee Secretary Yan Haiwang delivered  at  the conference an important speech in which he stated: As we  are to make a bigger stride forward in respect of reform in  1994, Gansu is expected to confront a rigorous challenge in  building a market economy. In view of this situation, party  committees at all levels in Gansu should make a correct analysis  and acquire a clear understanding of the province's rural  situation, unswervingly give top priority to agriculture in the  province's overall economic work, mobilize and protect the  enthusiasm of peasants, push ahead with in- depth rural reform,  implement rural policies to the letter, be good at guiding and  developing specialized rural commodity production, build a sound  market system and a new economic structure characterized by a  big circulation and a big market, and create favorable  conditions under which peasants and enterprises will be able to  comprehensively enter the market.    Comrade Yan Haiwang emphatically called in his speech for  more energy to be devoted to increasing peasants' income,  formulating measures suited to actual rural conditions,  readjusting rural industrial structure, and expediting the pace  of eradicating poverty, achieving prosperity, and bringing about  a comparatively well-off livelihood. While readjusting the  rural industrial structure, Yan Haiwang said, it is imperative  to make continued and persistent efforts to stabilize and  develop grain production and increase peasants' income.    Yan Haiwang maintained: It is imperative to go all out to  develop products and industries with higher extra value, higher  commodity rates, and higher foreign exchange earning rates and  to implement a joint-stock cooperative system to improve the  quality and vitality of township and town enterprises. In a  word, we should strive to transform a rural economy into a  market economy in an orderly way by carrying out effective  macroeconomic regulation and control, enforcing laws and  regulations aimed at protecting agriculture and peasants'  interests, and comprehensively applying all sorts of economic  measures and necessary administrative measures.</p>

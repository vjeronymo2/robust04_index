			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIXON LIBRARY;  </P> <P> THE OTHERS;  </P> <P> CRITICS LABEL LIBRARIES AS SHRINES BY THE PRESIDENTS, FOR THE PRESIDENTS  </P> <P> Carolyn Husbands was never keen on LBJ. But then she spent one sweltering  afternoon here visiting the Lyndon Baines Johnson presidential library.  </P> <P> From the moment she crossed the threshold of the gleaming white building  perched on a grassy knoll at the edge of the University of Texas campus,  Husbands sensed her old impressions beginning to erode.  </P> <P> First there was the short biographical film on the late President's life, a  heart-tugging presentation that had Husbands dabbing at tears. Then the  resident of Jackson, Miss., strolled the museum corridors and gazed at the  carefully preserved documents and artifacts chronicling Johnson's rise from  poverty in the Texas Hill Country to the Oval Office.  </P> <P> Finally, she mounted a wide marble staircase to the "Great Hall," a lofty  atrium featuring a glass wall exposing floor upon floor of bookshelves, each  holding scarlet boxes with gold presidential seals packed with more than 35  million letters, memos and other weighty documents of the Johnson  Administration.  </P> <P> It was a bit overwhelming.  </P> <P> "I feel better about him after seeing all this," Husbands confided as she  wandered through the library, soaking in the artfully crafted story of the  nation's 36th President. "I know this accentuated the positive, but it changed  my feelings."  </P> <P> Accentuating the positive, it seems, is something presidential libraries do  rather well. And now another is joining the fold. Along with the fanfare of the  Richard M. Nixon presidential library grand opening comes criticism that the  privately operated, $21-million complex in Yorba Linda will present a one-sided  glorification of a President best known for his resignation in the midst of the  Watergate scandal.  </P> <P> Nixon's is not the first presidential library to suffer such barbs. From the  Eastern Seaboard to the cornfields of Iowa, presidential libraries have long  been under attack by those who see them as little more than shrines to the  select few who have held the reins of power in America.  </P> <P> The Johnson library has been dubbed a "Pharaoh's monument," while John F.  Kennedy's library overlooking Dorchester Bay has been criticized for providing  too much Camelot and not enough substance about that Administration's darker  days. Some wags, meanwhile, note that Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower  were so smitten by their respective libraries that both chose to be buried on  the grounds.  </P> <P> To fans, presidential libraries represent a fitting tribute to America's  leaders, a lasting record of their lives and their administrations.  </P> <P> But critics -- among them politicians and scholars of all stripes -- argue that  the museum displays contained in the eight presidential libraries run by the  the National Archives offer a glorified picture of their namesakes, a portrayal  that robs visitors of a balanced perspective on history.  </P> <P> "It's always true that there's a certain amount of distortion in the museums,"  said Stephen E. Ambrose, a political historian from the University of New  Orleans and author of two volumes of biography on Nixon. "They always glorify  the President. I'm sure (the Nixon library) won't be any exception."  </P> <P> Even some partisans agree that a presidential library would be hard pressed to  offer a portrait that is anything but celebratory.  </P> <P> "There's an obvious tendency to think in shrinelike terms when you begin one of  these," said Harry Middleton, director of the Johnson library and a former  speech writer for Nixon's predecessor. "But that kind of thinking flattens  after a while, and very likely the death of the President whose name adorns the  building has something to do with it."  </P> <P> From the day in 1939 that Franklin D. Roosevelt laid the cornerstone for his  library in the Upstate New York community of Hyde Park, presidential libraries  have been at the center of a tussle over their role as emblems of power in a  democratic nation.  </P> <P> Before Roosevelt, Presidents routinely removed their papers upon leaving  office, and their preservation was largely a matter of luck. The bulk of George  Washington's papers, for instance, were recovered by the government only after  a relative sold them to the State Department between 1834 and 1849 for a  then-lordly sum of $55,000.  </P> <P> History suffered as the papers were cut up by autograph collectors, mutilated  by rats, scattered about the countryside, burned in barns or carted off by  marauding troops. The single exception was Rutherford B. Hayes, for whom a  museum and archives were established in Ohio to preserve his presidential  papers and celebrate his achievements.  </P> <P> After the turn of the century, several Presidents began depositing their papers  in the Library of Congress. But it was not until Roosevelt that the concept of  a presidential library run by the National Archives sprang to life. In 1955,  Congress passed the Presidential Libraries Act to allow other Presidents to  follow Roosevelt's example.  </P> <P> Each one did just that, but not without difficulties.  </P> <P> The Kennedy library was originally planned for a parcel in Cambridge beside  Harvard University, but opposition from nearby homeowners resulted in the  complex being delayed for more than a decade. It was ultimately built up the  road at a shoreline site on the University of Massachusetts campus.  </P> <P> Jimmy Carter's library was beset with complaints from homeowners over an  expressway that would have cut through a leafy, well-to-do section of Atlanta.  A proposal for a Ronald Reagan library at Stanford University was scuttled  chiefly by student and faculty opposition, and the complex now is being built  in a rural tract in Ventura County.  </P> <P> The initial reaction in West Branch, Iowa, to plans for the Hoover library was  that the institution would be an intrusion on the community, recalled John  Fawcett, the National Archive's assistant archivist for presidential libraries  and a native of the tiny farm community. Residents were concerned the library  would remove valuable land from the tax base and prompt authorities to plow a  four-lane road through town, he said.  </P> <P> "Interestingly enough, now the Hoover library is seen as the greatest asset in  West Branch," Fawcett said. "There's been a total turnaround in how the  community feels. They're even trying to resurrect the old four-lane road plans  now."  </P> <P> Indeed, the libraries are often seen as an economic and cultural boon by many  townsfolk.  </P> <P> The Johnson library, for instance, is second only to the Alamo as a Texas  tourist attraction, its operators boast. Similar benefits are also reaped in  Independence, Mo., site of the Truman presidential library.  </P> <P> "It's been a real important aspect of Independence life over the last 25 or 30  years," said Barbara J. Potts, the city's longtime former mayor. "Independence  is proud of the Truman legacy. He put us on the map."  </P> <P> Then there are the detractors.  </P> <P> Foes of the libraries have warred with supporters over a broad slate of issues,  from how much space should be allowed for the museums to whether it would be  better to gather all the presidential papers in one place, such as Washington.  </P> <P> Such gripes prompted Congress in 1986 to adopt legislation that provides  incentives to limit the size of future libraries to 70,000 square feet (the  Johnson library sprawls over about 100,000 square feet) and ensures that each  opens only after a hefty private endowment is established to defray operating  costs.  </P> <P> The Johnson library, for instance, has an endowment of $20 million, and the  promoters of the Nixon complex want to raise at least $10 million. Both  Presidents helped out by donating money collected from sales of books they  published.  </P> <P> Others have sought money from friends and the public.  </P> <P> Truman raised revenue by hitting "the rubber chicken circuit," speaking before  countless fund-raisers, said George H. Curtis, assistant library director in  Independence. (Truman was also noted for spending more time at his library than  any other President. He kept regular office hours and even took to leading  packs of schoolchildren on tours.)  </P> <P> In recent years, criticism has even mounted against some of the museum  displays. Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), a prominent anti-war  activist during the Vietnam era, has blasted the Johnson library's exhibit on  the war, charging that it stretches the truth.  </P> <P> Hugh Sidey, a Time magazine correspondent who has covered every President since  Eisenhower, noted that the 20-minute biographical film at the Johnson library  lavishes attention on "Great Society" programs, but spends only two minutes on  Vietnam, which he calls "the single most dominant event in the Johnson  Administration."  </P> <P> Sidey also suggested that Kennedy's museum falls short of conveying the "grim  moments" of 1961, when the Administration suffered "a bunch of hammer blows all  year long" with events such as the Bay of Pigs, the orbital flight of Soviet  cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin and the rise of the Berlin Wall.  </P> <P> "The (Kennedy) museum is much more glamorized than 1961 really was," Sidey  said. "It was really kind of grim. These were young guys not sure what they  were doing."  </P> <P> Despite such criticisms, Sidey sees an important role for presidential  libraries.  </P> <P> "There's an element of enshrining, but that's not so bad really," said Sidey,  who counts himself a supporter of the presidential library system. "Maybe it's  a President's rebuttal. Maybe these guys who take the slings and arrows, who  are so pummeled in public, should have their chance."  </P> <P> Ultimately, it is the presidential archives, the vast repositories of  correspondence, memos and other documents, that are the soul of the  presidential library system, argues Fawcett of the National Archives. While a  presidential museum may offer one perspective of an administration, the  archival records gleaned by a scholar may yield a decidedly different picture.  </P> <P> Lyndon Johnson dedicated his library by declaring that he wanted it to present  "the story of our time -- with the bark off." While some critics may question  how well the museum has fulfilled that mission, the archives seem almost beyond  reproach.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most vivid proof is the publication of Robert A. Caro's  controversial volumes of biography on Johnson, works that were drawn in part  from documents culled from the dimly lit stacks of the Johnson library in  Austin.  </P> <P> As for the Nixon library, it will largely be the public that decides its  success or failure, Fawcett said.  </P> <P> "The Nixon presidency is a particularly difficult one to portray," he said.  "There were significant foreign policy advancements, major domestic triumphs,  yet through Watergate some of the most tragic developments of any presidential  administration.  </P> <P> "It has the potential of being a very good exhibit on a very important part of  history. But that is not for me to judge. It's for the people who visit -- the  people of hometown U.S.A., the architecture critics, the political critics, the  newspaper columnists. That's how a museum is judged."  </P> <P> </P> <P> PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARIES  </P> <P> Rutherford B.

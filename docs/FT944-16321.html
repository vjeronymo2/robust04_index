			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / SPD poised to tighten grip on upper house No matter what happens in Sunday's election there will have to be a 'grand coalition' between parliament's upper and lower houses. Even if the governing coalition remains in power it will have to reach a new compromise with the Bundesrat, the upper house which represents the 16 states and is dominated by the opposition Social Democrats and Greens. Moreover, the influence of the SPD is likely to increase after the Lander elections in the eastern states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Thuringia which also take place on Sunday. In western Germany, the SPD is expected to comfortably win Saarland, headed by Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the party's economics spokesman. Both east German states are currently governed by the CDU in coalition with the FDP. Opinion polls indicate that the FDP will fail to win 5 per cent of the vote, the minimum required to enter the state parliaments, while the CDU will not gain enough support to form a government on its own. In which case, the CDU might be forced to form a grand coalition with the SPD. In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, opinion polls give the SPD 31 per cent of the vote, compared to the 27 per cent it won in 1990, while the CDU's vote remains stable at 38 per cent. The Party of Democratic Socialism, successor to the former east German communist party, could gain at least 17 per cent of the vote; the Greens could retain their 6 per cent share. There is some temptation among SPD officials in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to form a government with the PDS, but this would not be tolerated by the federal party organisation. 'Unless the Greens do very well, we could form a grand coalition with the CDU,' an SPD official said. The same possibility exists in Thuringia, where opinion polls show CDU's share of the vote slipping from 45 per cent in 1990 to 41 per cent, while the SPD's share has risen from 22 per cent to over 31 per cent. The Greens might retain their 5 per cent. The PDS's share is expected to increase from 9 per cent to about 13 per cent. A grand coalition in these two states would mean them sending CDU and SPD representatives, instead of CDU and FDP ones. This would weaken the FDP's influence in the Bundesrat while strengthening the SPD's. The 68 members of the Bundesrat are not directly elected but chosen by the state governments. Ten of the states are SPD-led, three are governed by the CDU, two have CDU/SPD grand coalitions, while Bavaria is run by the Christian Social Union, the CDU's sister party. A stronger SDP hold on the Bundesrat could make life difficult for a CDU-led coalition if it is returned to power. In the last legislative period, 81 of the 504 laws approved by the Bundestag were initially rejected by the Bundesrat. These were then passed to a mediation committee consisting of members of both houses. Three laws were rejected completely by the Bundesrat even after mediation. Except for amendments to the constitution, which require a two-thirds majority, a simple majority is required in the Bundesrat to block or accept legislation approved by the Bundestag. 'Before we even debate draft laws in the Bundestag, it is crucial to sense the mood in the Bundesrat,' a CDU deputy said, who spent three years trying to reach a compromise on a compensation law for east property owners.</p>

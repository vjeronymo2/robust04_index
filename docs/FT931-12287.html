			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / IG Metall offers new deal GERMANY'S engineering industry employers said yesterday they were ready to back plans for substantial subsidies to loss-making east German enterprises, provided engineering workers accepted a slowdown in their pay rises. Details of the deal were leaked yesterday by IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, and promptly denounced by the employers, because of the lack of a new wages agreement. The employers said that a secret document, spelling out the rescue programme for eastern industry, was 'not authorised.' It had been agreed by negotiators 'only with the express precondition that there would be a revision of the wage contracts' in east Germany. That was still rejected by the union, the most powerful in Germany. The 'solidarity pact' for the engineering industry would, if it can still be agreed, provide a key element for the wider solidarity pact between the German government, opposition, employers and unions, to finance the cost of east German economic recovery. A renegotiation of the engineers' existing wages deal in the east, which would grant a 26 per cent pay increase on April 1, and parity with western workers by 1994, has been a key demand of both the German government and industrialists for the planned solidarity pact. The engineering pay deal is seen as the key to a series of wage equalisation contracts in the east, which have made eastern industry uncompetitive, and slowed down private investment in the region. The joint paper worked out by negotiators for IG Metall, and Gesamtmetall, the employers' organisation, calls for extended investment subsidies beyond 1996, special preferences for the products of east German manufacturing industry, and a new deal to support exports by east German enterprises to eastern Europe. It proposes a long-term trade deal with states of the former Soviet Union, including guaranteed exchange rates against the rapidly-devaluing rouble, to encourage purchases. The whole programme would be financed by savings and re-ordered priorities in the government budget.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / BR chief hits out at demands of sell-off Changes demanded by British Rail's privatisation have slowed improvements in the quality of service, its chairman, Sir Bob Reid, said last night. Sir Bob expressed sympathy for the victims of Saturday's rail crash in Kent, in which five people died. He added that the commitment to safety had not been compromised. However, he said: 'The continuing demands of the further reorganisation and contractual issues have unfortunately not allowed as much managerial effort as we would have liked to be devoted to the day-to-day activities that determine the quality of service to our customers, particularly in terms of punctuality and reliability.' He said the signalworkers' strike had accentuated problems and the 'consequent loss of momentum'. He said: 'Sad to say, but we have to face facts. It is those three factors - the strikes, loss of momentum in investment and slippage in performance - that have turned 1994 from a potential year of renaissance to one of disappointment, damage and major threat.' Sir Bob, giving the annual Dallas Lecture in Glasgow, said the rail industry would benefit from being made into smaller, more autonomous units which would 'loosen up rigidities and give flexibility to take account of local circumstances'. He said: 'Expenditure on basic infrastructure has fallen seriously behind what is needed to maintain the sort of performance that we have on the railways today, let alone improve it.' Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's transport spokesman, said Sir Bob's comments were 'a thinly veiled indictment of the rail privatisation shambles'. Meanwhile, the government said that an independent inquiry into the Cowden crash would be held in public. Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, told the Commons that Railtrack, BR and the Railway Inspectorate were carrying out their own technical investigation. BR and Railtrack have accepted responsibility for the crash.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / A package that fails to please: Steven Butler asks whether Japan's spending proposals can boost the economy The verdict on the Japanese government's package of emergency economic measures announced early yesterday could hardly have been more swift or more clear. As investors gradually absorbed the details of the package, the stock market fell 323.36 points to finish the fiscal year at a new five-year low of 19,345.95 on the Nikkei index. The market was also unimpressed by reports that Japan's official discount rate would be cut by 0.75 percentage points to 3.75 per cent, a move which was indeed announced early this morning. With manufacturing inventories bulging and capital spending being reduced, many economists believe that even a steep cut in rates would not encourage fresh corporate borrowing. The government's package, aimed at stimulating the economy, did not dispel the deep sense of pessimism which has tightened its grip on Japanese financial markets; it merely reinforced fears that no one was riding to the rescue. In spite of cries of anguish from the financial industry, burdened by trillions of yen of bad debt; in spite of plunging property prices, collapsing profits of manufacturing companies, steep cuts in manufacturing investment, falling industrial output, and weakening consumer spending; in spite of all this, the Japanese government does not believe the economy is suffering from much more than a lack of confidence. The government is accelerating public infrastructure investment by spending 75 per cent of the annual budget in the first half of the year. Yet the programme includes not a single yen of previously unbudgeted money. Economists could find only a maximum of two trillion yen (about Pounds 9bn) of spending - amounting to less than half a per cent of gross national product - moved from the second half of the year to the first. There is no commitment as yet to fill in the spending gap in the second half of the year. In announcing the package, the Economic Planning Agency, which co-ordinates government economic policy, argued that employment, consumer spending and even corporate profits remained strong. The agency said it was merely trying to prevent a psychology of pessimism from spreading throughout the economy. But is the government right? Is Japan's underlying economy strong in spite of the deep depression among financial and manufacturing industries? The fall in capital spending, industrial output and the cooling of consumer spending, it maintains, are a necessary and even healthy response to the rampant asset inflation of the 1980s 'bubble economy'. Or has Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, squeezed too hard and too long in efforts to damp inflation by means of high interest rates - until this morning at 4.5 per cent  - and thereby caused an unnecessary slowdown in the economy? A great deal is at stake. Japan's trading partners are increasingly annoyed at Japan's huge trade surpluses. As the US and European economies try to climb out of recession, they will not want to see depressed import demand from Japanese consumers, the main cause of the rise in the trade surplus over the past year. The strongly negative reaction of the US government to the stagnation of US semiconductor sales in Japan, announced on Monday, could be a taste of much nastier things to come, particularly in industries such as cars or electronics. It is, therefore, important not only to Japanese companies and shareholders but also to the world trading system that the government comes close to its growth target of 3.5 per cent this year by reviving domestic demand. This, however, is looking less and less realistic. The roots of the current slowdown lie in the enormous expansion of the Japanese economy in the late 1980s. The fall in the official discount rate, the rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks, to a low of 2.5 per cent during 1987 and 1988, together with a rising stock market, meant that corporations were able to raise funding at almost no cost, contributing to an asset price boom. Mr Mieno began to raise interest rates in 1989 to pierce the bubble. The stock market first buckled in early 1990 and land prices have fallen steeply since then, leaving banks and companies with poorly secured loans and accumulating bad debts. It seemed that he had successfully steered a delicate course - puncturing the asset price boom and bringing down consumer price inflation, yet having little impact on economic activity. The current slowdown, however, suggests that such a positive diagnosis may have been premature. As a series of unexpectedly weak statistics over the past month has shown, the economy is now in pain: Industrial output. Industrial production declined in February for the fifth month running on a year-on-year basis. Factory output was 4.2 per cent lower in February than a year ago and 0.6 per cent less than in January. Production is being pushed down because manufacturers have accumulated inventories of unsold goods. The adjustment process of bringing down those inventories has begun. Inventories fell by 1.4 per cent from January after months of build-up, but they remained 10 per cent higher than a year ago in February. Money supply. Japan's money supply growth has fallen to historic lows for three months running, with broad money (M2 plus certificates of deposits) expanding by just 1.6 per cent in February. The growth rate has been distorted by a flight of money into postal savings, which are excluded from the definition of broad money. Nonetheless, even on its widest definition, credit growth has fallen well below the central bank's projections. A collapse of demand for funds from the corporate sector is what lies behind the exceptionally weak numbers. Consumer spending. Consumers have money in their pockets, but they are not spending it as actively as they were up until last autumn. Store sales have generally been flat to slightly negative year-on-year. Bank assets. Banks may be shouldering up to Y20,000bn (Pounds 87bn) in bad and doubtful debts, much of which is secured by property that has plunged in value. The true size of the problem is impossible to gauge because banks are not required to report the figure or cover it with provisions. With the commercial banks' reserve capital eroded by the stock market plunge, banks could struggle to meet the 8 per cent capital-to-asset ratios specified by the Bank for International Settlements, which take effect next year. The need to meet this ratio is creating difficulties for the banking system and many weaker banks may face a crisis. Most banks are being forced to reduce their asset base, and to be exceptionally cautious about extending new credit. One obstacle to an autumn recovery is that banks will encounter problems providing the necessary finance for expansion. Even sound but not cash-rich companies may then find it hard to borrow. All this evidence would appear to point to an economy with serious difficulties in many sectors. Compared with the scale of the problems, the government's package of fiscal measures intended to stimulate the economy looks inadequate, unless it is followed by a supplementary budget to boost domestic growth. Economists yesterday were talking of the need for a stimulus of Y5,000bn-worth of public spending. The government may, however, be proved right in its belief that the economy is not as deeply troubled as it might appear. 'Recession' in Japan certainly looks nothing like its counterpart in the UK or the US where the cost in unemployment, house repossessions and failing businesses is high. As the Japanese economy steadily weakened over the past year, 1.4m jobs have been created. Unemployment in February declined by a 0.1 percentage point to 2 per cent. Nationwide there are still about 1.25 jobs for every applicant. However, this ratio has dropped over the past year, and many companies have cut overtime. Economic hopes are pinned on a recovery of consumer and business confidence and spending. Consumers are not burdened by heavy debts as are their counterparts in the US and Europe. Corporate liquidity, profits and capital investment plans are low only by the inflated standards of recent years. The Long Term Credit Bank of Japan this week projected an 8.2 per cent decline in manufacturing investment in the fiscal year starting today. Nonetheless, in the larger service sector, investment is set to rise by 4.5 per cent. On balance, this is not the picture of an economy on the verge of collapse. Economists at Salomon Brothers, the securities house, are more pessimistic than most observers; but even they project growth of 1.3 per cent in the coming fiscal year with no further fiscal stimulus. Should the government adopt a Y5,000bn supplementary budget in the autumn, which it could afford, annual GNP growth would rise considerably faster than that. Whether growth stays above 2 per cent depends to a large extent on what the Japanese government and the central bank wish to achieve. Mr Mieno, with good reason, has chosen so far to stamp on inflation while risking slower economic growth. But the longer monetary policy remains tight, the greater the risk that he will push deflation too far. Mr Mieno and his colleagues in the government are likely to find that the dangers of a sharply slower economy are now far greater than any possible resurgence of inflation. Mr Mieno's decision to cut interest rates makes the probability of a sharp contraction in the economy less likely. But a further easing of monetary and fiscal policy may well be needed before he, and his political masters, can be sure that the threat has disappeared.</p>

In applying under this competition, States are to ``describe the procedure for obtaining the active and continued involvement in the statewide School-to-Work Opportunities system of employers and other interested parties such as *&blank;*&blank;* postsecondary educational institutions *&blank;*&blank;*.'' As the commenter notes, it is very possible that a co-op program could be included as part of a School-to-Work Opportunity system, so long as it meets the basic program requirements. The Secretaries would expect States to discuss in their plans how they will build on, modify, and enrich the efforts of community colleges to develop comprehensive School-to-Work Opportunities systems that meet the requirements of this priority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> General Program Requirements_School-based Learning Component  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that School-to-Work Opportunities systems will never achieve their intended goal of creating high-quality opportunities for all American youth unless programs contain: (1) ``Enabling tools'' to provide students and parents with the information, assistance, capacity, and (2) safeguards necessary to obtain the opportunities promised by the School-to-Work Opportunities program. The commenter believed that it was necessary to provide parents with: (a) An unambiguous statement targeted to all youth of the opportunities provided by the program; (b) the information, assistance, and authority for targeted youth and their parents to obtain access to program opportunities, participate in shaping programs, and remedy the problems that will inevitably occur; (c) systems for ensuring that information about these program opportunities and involvement in shaping the programs extends beyond the school district central offices to the teachers; and (d) a statement of responsibilities for both technical assistance and overseeing local implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretaries agree that providing program information to both parents and students, is essential to a student's successful participation in, and completion of, a School-to-Work Opportunities program. For that reason, they have added under ``examples of statewide activities,'' the clause ``working with localities to develop strategies to recruit and retain all students in programs, including those from a broad range of backgrounds and circumstances,'' and, as an example of activities for local partnerships, they have added the clause ``conducting outreach to all students in a manner that most appropriately meets the needs of their communities.'' Also, under paragraph (b)(3) of the priority, States are required to describe their procedure for obtaining the continued involvement of ``employers and other interested parties, such as *&blank;*&blank;* students, parents *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Moreover, under the Student Participation selection criterion, the Secretaries will evaluate whether each State has proposed realistic strategies and programs to ensure that all students have the opportunity to participate in the State's School-to-Work Opportunities program. The Secretaries expect that a part of each State's strategy for ensuring participation would be providing information to all students about opportunities that are available to them within the program. However, beyond these provisions, the Secretaries are opposed to imposing further requirements upon States governing the formulation and nature of the program information disseminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The section on ``Examples of Statewide Activities'' has been revised to include ``working with localities to develop strategies to recruit and retain all students in programs including those from a broad range of backgrounds and circumstances.'' As an example of ``Activities for Local Partnerships'' the following has been added: ``Conducting outreach to all students in a manner that most appropriately meets their needs and the needs of their communities.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter observed that the academic outcomes expected from school-based learning should qualify students to enter and succeed in four-year postsecondary institutions upon graduation from high school. This commenter saw a significant possibility that students who enter a School-to-Work Opportunities program will face barriers to the full range of postsecondary institutions, feeding parents' and educators' tracking concerns. The commenter also believed that the imperative for students to meet entrance requirements for four-year institutions is made more critical by the early age at which youth will be encouraged to select a ``career major.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

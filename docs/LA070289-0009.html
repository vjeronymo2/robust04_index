			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIVE SUMMER STORIES;  </P> <P> DAVID FREEMAN  </P> <P> "I always thought Hollywood would provide me with a living. What I hadn't  expected was that it would also provide me with a subject.  </P> <P> "I'm trying to write about the daily life of Hollywood in a way that's more  realistic than not. Most fiction about the movies falls into two categories:  angry screeds about the unfairness of the business written mostly by  disaffected screenwriters. Or supercharged fantasies that try to be about  glamour -- mostly who wears what and who sleeps with whom.  </P> <P> "My intention is to reflect what actually goes on, and that certainly includes  anger and glamour, but I hope what I write reveals something of the way the  business and the people in it really operate."  </P></p>

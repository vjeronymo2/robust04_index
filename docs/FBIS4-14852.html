			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Responses by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to written </F> questions from Pilar Bonet; date, place not given: "I Will  Leave Russia in Safe Hands"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Bonet] Is the political system  of the republic set out in the new Constitution a transition  model or is it designed to be a permanent solution tied to the  specific conditions of Russia?    [Yeltsin] The processes developing in Russia today cannot be  considered as having been "defused." The changes are coming  thick and fast, and in these conditions it is difficult to make  any long- term predictions. Moreover, with the adoption of the  new Constitution we have determined the basis and the main  parameters for the development of the political system for the  next 10 or 15 years. Despite the various and even contradictory  points of view of the new parties and political blocks, we are  seeing increasingly clearly the formation of a national  consensus based around a strong power. This is a response as  much to historical tradition arising out of the dimensions of  the state itself and the complex national make-up of society as  to the needs of the current stage of transition from  totalitarianism to democracy. Naturally, a strong power does  not mean unlimited power, a lack of control, or  authoritarianism. Moreover, the arbiter and supreme guarantor  of the free development of Russia will be the expression of  popular will, in democratic elections.    [Bonet] If you do not stand at the 1996 elections, what  guarantees are there that a strong presidential power will not  end up in the hands of a person with authoritarian or even  neofascist tendencies?    [Yeltsin] For me it is not a problem of whether I stay or  go.  The problem is leaving Russia in safe and democratic hands.  These hands must be capable of holding Russia's helm steady in  a stormy sea. I believe that one of my main accomplishments by  1996 will have been to create the guarantee that prevents the  country from falling into totalitarianism.    [Bonet] What are the conditions enabling the president and  the new Russian parliament to maintain constructive relations?    [Yeltsin] It is necessary, firstly, to have political  maturity in the main state institutions. There is no cure for  the lack of a political culture -- we need time. However, there  are already good foundations for cooperation between the  president and the parliament: the new Constitution stabilizes  the principle of a clear division of powers. I also believe  that we will learn our lesson from the dramatic outcome of the  events of 3 and 4 October last year (the storming of the Russian  parliament -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note). For my part, I have  already learned the lesson and am in favor of dialogue and  cooperation. Our shared duty is to isolate the extremist forces  in parliament.    [Bonet] How do you intend to dissipate the growing fears in  the countries of eastern Europe, including the former Soviet  republics, faced with the dangers arising from the advancement  of the radical nationalists in Russia?    [Yeltsin] These fears are unfounded. Russia cannot be  transformed into a flourishing and stable country if it is a  threat to its neighbors. If we had other intentions or ulterior  motives we would not have withdrawn our troops. We had  sufficient possibilities for staying put. Unfortunately, the  politicians in the various countries are artificially  exaggerating their fears and have brought a rain of complaints  down on the international organizations. In general, these fake  concerns hide concrete economic and political calculations --  for example, obtaining rapid integration into NATO or using the  scare tactics of the "Russian threat" in their internal  struggles for power. Those who speculate on Russia's return to  an imperialist doctrine are basing their fears merely on  statements made by specific political extremists who are far  from being able to formulate our country's foreign policy.    [Bonet] What is the state of relations between Russia and  Ukraine?    [Yeltsin] Relations with Ukraine are complex. Its  independence has posed many difficult problems. However, I am  not going to dramatize the situation. We need to be less  emotionally involved and take fewer hasty decisions. History  cannot be undone: economic, social, demographic, and cultural  needs will in time do the work that is impossible for  politicians to do. I can see the prospect of a deep,  multilateral integration, simply because there is no other  solution. I am also convinced that we will manage to find a  solution to the problem of the Black Sea Fleet based on the  formula drawn up in Massandra at my meeting with President  Kravchuk.    [Bonet] Is the Atlantic Alliance the best-suited collective  security system for Russia? If so, why has Moscow not asked for  membership of the organization? If it is not, what is the best  system?    [Yeltsin] For decades, NATO has guaranteed security in West  Europe at a time when there was a severe East-West confrontation  between totalitarianism and democracy. However, at the same  time, no one can ignore the radical changes that took place in  Europe after the triumph of the democratic tendencies in Russia.  It is uncomfortable to pretend that we are sitting in a chair  that no longer exists. Today Russia does not threaten the world  or Europe. In these conditions, it is counterproductive to  retain intact a powerless system directed toward stiff  opposition with the enemy. We must find new security formulae  based, naturally, on the fact that NATO has useful experience  and institutions that must be put to the best use. Russia must  be able to participate in the same conditions and with the same  security guarantees. We have ceased being rivals but we must  learn how to be partners. The mechanical enlargement of the  block with specific countries can only revive old fears and  suspicions.    [Bonet] How do you think the countries of the West can  contribute to supporting democracy and benefiting the success of  economic reform in Russia?    [Yeltsin] We have gone through a phase of overoptimism. On  the one hand, we ourselves overestimated the possibilities  offered by the West, which today is experiencing difficult  economic times and does not want to take any risks. Secondly,  it is now clear that no one can really help Russia, given its  economic contradictions and its specific characteristics  inherited from the socialist regime. Our task today consists of  creating normal economic and legal conditions for major  investment. However, now is also the time that the West should  stop feeling as a donator to Russia, and should start behaving  like a clear-thinking businessman acting in his own interests.  Russia must become one of the most profitable places in the  world for capital investment.    [Bonet] Why until now has the fight against corruption in  Russia yielded no results?    [Yeltsin] We must not look at things as if corruption were a  specifically Russian phenomenon. Even in the most democratic  country, there are those who profit from their positions as  state employees, and wealthy people trying to profit from the  greed of the civil servants for their own ends. We fight  against this as we fight against any other type of crime or  antisocial activity. However, in a number of cases the  corruption has taken on threatening dimensions in Russia. We  must not rely on the state being able to defeat them using  solely repressive means. Just a short time ago, I signed a  decree on state service that should serve to create an  unfavorable social climate for corruption. We also need to  create a system of social and material guarantees for state  employees that give them a suitable standard of living and that  then frees them from the need to look for other ways in. In  short, we must try and create the conditions in which it will no  longer be profitable for them to safely agree to corruption.</p>

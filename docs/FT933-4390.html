			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Swans unions seek Pounds 1m compensation UNIONS representing Swan Hunter employees yesterday launched an attempt at an industrial tribunal in Newcastle upon Tyne to obtain compensation which could exceed Pounds 1m in total for 420 workers made redundant from the Tyneside shipbuilder by receivers Price Waterhouse. The unions, who are claiming the receivers breached section 188 of the Trades Union Labour Relations (Consolidations) Act 1992 by not observing a 90-day consultative period, are seeking the maximum possible compensation of 90 days' pay. Price Waterhouse did not contest the claim, and Mr David Reed, tribunal chairman, reserved a decision.</p>

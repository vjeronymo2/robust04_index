			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Observer: Send on Lou Despite the odds against winning the world cup (500 to one) Saudi Arabia is sparing no effort to make sure that press coverage of its team is favourable. The squad's spokesman is one of its Washington based diplomats, Adel al-Jubeir. He's renowned for his affability and the favourable spin he can put on awkward stories, like cash shortages and defecting diplomats. However, he knows little about soccer. So to overcome the deficiency the kingdom has hired the services of promoter Lou Goldstein. 'Everyone knows Lou,' says al-Jubeir. 'He's the best.' Lou's first challenge is today when the Saudis play the Netherlands.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Aga takes 35% stake in Russian gas group Aga, the Swedish industrial gas group, has taken a 35 per cent stake in Balashiha Kislarodnyj Zavod (BKZ, Balashiha Oxygen Plant), one of Russia's two largest industrial gas groups. The group aims to become the majority owner in BKZ this summer and eventually take full control. It has acquired a majority stake in a gas company in Kaliningrad and has a small operation in St Petersburg. It is looking at other opportunities, including Lentechgas in St Petersburg, Russia's other big industrial gas group. BKZ has 360 employees and annual sales of SKr45m (Dollars 5.7m). It is the largest industrial gas company in the Moscow area, with considerable production and distribution capacity for oxygen, nitrogen and argon. It is also the leading company in the former Soviet Union for ultra-pure gases and gas mixtures. Mr Lars Kallsater, an Aga vice-president, said the company had bought its initial stake through a tender from a state property fund. The fund is left with a 14 per cent holding, most of which is soon to be auctioned, with the remaining 51 per cent held by the group's employees. Mr Kallsater declined to say how much Aga had paid for the shares, but said commitments to invest in plant equipment and modernisation had been as important as price in the tender selection process. He said the main challenge was to increase energy efficiency and supply modern air separation capacity. 'We see the risks in Russia but also the opportunities. If there are setbacks, it is relatively easy for us to reduce our activity and still survive with this type of operation,' he said. Aga has been an active investor in eastern Europe. Apart from Russia, it has invested in the three Baltic states, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 22 (CTK) -- Basic questions are not,  in the contemporary Czech Republic, decided at demonstrations  but in parliament, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus said today,  commenting on the midday trade union demonstration in Prague's  Old Town Square.    He said the demonstration was organized by a "partial" group  of inhabitants. While this sort of thing may have been all right  in February 1948, it was no good for March 22, 1994, he told  journalists.    Today's demonstration was organized by the Bohemian and  Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS) in support of the  withdrawal of the amendment to the employment code from  parliament's March agenda, which begins today. The union  members' biggest objections concerned the articles on the  possibility of concluding repeated fixed-period contracts and on  night work by pregnant women.    Unionists have negotiated these demands with the government  and have attended the meetings of individual parliamentary  committees, where they said they met with a lack of  understanding of people's situations and therefore decided to  call today's demonstration.</p>

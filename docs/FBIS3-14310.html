			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F> Group]    [Text] Although no progress was achieved in the so-called  Middle East peace talks last [Iranian calendar] year, [which  ended on 20 March,] the commencement of direct talks with the  Zionist regime paved the way for another pact. The signing of  the Gaza-Jericho Self-Rule Accord between the PLO and the  Zionist regime in September was the most important development  in the Palestinian and Middle East crisis not only during the  past year but during the five decades of Arab conflict with the  Zionist regime.    The signing of this accord encouraged Washington to  reactivate its Middle East diplomacy and a meeting was held  between the Syrian president and his U.S. counterpart in Geneva  in a bid to reach other compromises in other areas of the Middle  East crisis. But the failure to implement the PLO-Tel Aviv  accord destroyed the grounds for other accords and placed a  question mark over the implementation of this accord as well.    Political analysts believe the most important reason for the  failure of the 'Arafat-Zionist accord is that Israel's wishes  alone have been fulfilled in this accord. Implementation of the  major articles of the accord has been postponed, which means the  PLO has granted Israel extensive privileges without reaping  anything for itself. The implementation of one part of the  accord, the withdrawal of the Israeli military forces from Gaza  and Jericho, was foreseen a month ahead of the accord's signing  but it did not take place at the set date. Still, Israel  propounds various pretexts and is not ready to implement this  part of the accord.    The most important outcome of the Gaza-Jericho Accord is the  legitimization of the usurping presence of the Zionist regime.  After gaining this big concession, Tel Aviv started its  extensive blackmail of the Palestinians and the Arabs and every  country, demanding that the Arabs end their economic sanctions  and establish diplomatic relations with it. It also called on  the Western countries to extend more economic aid to it in view  of this compromise.    This accord, which was signed under pressure of the equation  of the superiority of the Zionist regime and the United States,  regionally and internationally, and quickly received  international support, has faced numerous failures during the  past few months because of the absence of the main elements that  are needed for its continuation. Political analysts believe  that the massacre of the worshipers in the Ibrahimi mosque has  revealed the contradictory aspects of this accord. Its  implementation is almost impossible without fundamental  adjustments.    'Arafat's insistence on gathering up some Zionist  settlements  and disarming their residents, Israel's agreement to limit the  activities of some extremist Zionist groups, and the dismantling  of some Zionist settlements show that despite their varying  views, the two signatories of the Gaza-Jericho Accord seek ways  to save this accord from total failure.    The continuation of the intifadah after the signing of the  Gaza-Jericho self-rule pact is considered one of the major  elements leading to the failure of the accord because, although  some time after the signing of the Oslo Agreement, 'Arafat  ordered his forces in the occupied territories to set aside  their fight against the Zionist regime, the intifadah  intensified. And although 'Arafat's forces were faithful to  organizational commands at first, once they knew the details of  the accord and saw the Zionist regime conitnuing its hostile  attitude toward them, they joined the Muslim combatants.    Although the signing of the Gaza-Jericho Accord strongly  polarized the combatant forces in the occupied territories,  contrary to the expectations of the Zionist enemy, the outcome  benefited the intifadah and gathered together the combatant  forces under the banner of Islam. Remarks by a U.S. official  that reaction by Muslim Egyptian society to the tragedy at the  Ibrahimi mosque may lead to the overthrow of the Cairo regime  reveals that the struggle against the Zionist regime, which is  declining among the ranks of the Arab governments, is rising  among nations and that if the joint struggle of the Muslim  nations and societies is organized, the current disgraceful  equation in the Middle East will cease to exist.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Kalashnikov: "Post-Confrontation Europe: </F> A Future That Is Here: Traditional Ideas Are Coming Into  Conflict With the New Reality"]    [Text] One appreciable contradiction stands out in  present-day Europe. On the one hand it is no longer separated by  ideological and military-political barriers. A number of common  principles, recorded in the Paris Charter of 1990, documents of  the CSCE, and other multilateral acts, has been proclaimed  throughout its expanse. The zone of European integration and,  with it, the zone of particular legal, economic, and  technological standards and provisions are expanding. On the  other, the 45 countries located here--a record number for the  20th century--are astonishing in their diversity of forms of  state arrangement and political life and models of economic  development, which has not been seen for a long time and which  is, by all accounts, growing. Ukraine and Denmark, Spain and  Estonia, Finland and Bosnia--these are just some of the "poles"  of European reality, from which it may be seen that it is hardly  any easier to impart to it a common denominator today than it  was before the recent "great change."    The elimination in the East and the weakening in the  West of bloc "discipline" has widened the way to  individualization for the European countries. They are being  prompted to take it by the aspiration to take advantage of the  opportunities of independent development, but primarily by the  need to adapt to the new conditions. Both are stimulating the  cultivation of a new identity and compelling a fuller use of  one's own potential with its frequently unique characteristics.  National-state singularities, which previously were frequently  blunted and suppressed even, are now being brought to the fore.  The lifting of interbloc tension, democracy, and the market are  causing a common complication of the European geopolitical  landscape, by no means its alignment.  <H5>  Three `Not's' </H5>   The post-postwar situation in Europe is NOT a malfunction in  the course of a history which failed to reach the  liberal-conformist "end" predicted for it. It is a natural  fleshing out by the forces and regularities that were unable to  develop to the full extent in the rigid structures of the  bipolar world. But the latent accumulation of these forces had  not been interrupted. All the more strongly and unpredictably  have they begun to influence the course of things following the  end of the cold war.    The second occurrence is NOT the fate of the former  socialist  countries, which are clambering out of crisis with radically  renewed economic and social structures, alone. Profound reforms  are unfolding in states of the West also. Having liquidated the  "iron curtain," the Old World has begun to change completely,  according, what is more, to laws affecting it as an entirety,  not only, for example, its more or, on the contrary, less  prosperous parts.    Differentiation and fragmentation are NOT alien phenomena  for  Europe. High heterogeneousness combined with internal unity  constitute one of its fundamental qualities as a particular  geopolitical zone. But this unity consists not of the uniformity  of this "superstructural" institution or the other but primarily  of the existence of organic relationships among all its so  dissimilar components. Such relationships have been generated  over centuries and are often of a nonmanifest nature mediated  many times over.    The unity of Europe is more fundamental than ideologies,  blocs, and government policy. The erection of barriers or, on  the contrary, centralized all-European structures camouflages or  distorts its essence only to this extent or the other.  <H5>  New Directions of Differentiation </H5>   Following the achievement of a very relative consensus on  questions that had hitherto constituted the principal material  of disagreements, Europe has begun with redoubled vigor, as it  were, to draw lines of demarcation in other spheres.  Specifically, the spectrum of tasks of national-state  development has widened. Today it incorporates, aside from all  else, completion of the processes of unification (Germany), the  surmounting of the consequences of division (the Czech Republic,  Slovakia), the preservation of territorial integrity (Ukraine),  and a change in international status (as yet neutral Austria,  Sweden, and Finland). There have come to be more types of  national-state strategies in Europe. It is not surprising that  it is increasingly difficult to bring them together in a single  channel.    The giant differences between individual countries in terms  of length of sovereign existence and, correspondingly, maturity  of state institutions have acquired new seriousness. The  temporal horizon of European policy has lost its former  evenness. Still strong "veterans" are living in direct proximity  to the "newborn," among whom there are those who are near death  also, most likely.    The ways in which certain European governments and leaders  have come to power sometimes differ just as strongly as the  Bible and a detective novel. While having become fully equal  from the viewpoint of international law (there were previously  certain reservations on this score in respect to the communist  regimes), they nonetheless afford grounds for comparisons of  their legitimacy and also the probable longevity of their  position. All this poses anew the problem of the compatibility  of legal systems and the ponderability and reliability of  agreements and treaties that are concluded.    The culture factor is assuming ever increasing geopolitical,  if not geostrategic, significance. It has been confirmed many  times over in recent years that no fewer forces of rapprochement  or repulsion may operate at the civilization level than in, say,  the economic sphere. In addition, it is being recognized  increasingly extensively that democracy in its canonical version  advanced by the Council of Europe is part of a particular way of  life and cannot take root in other cultural soil without  detriment to both. Problems of the intrinsic value of all  cultures, the preservation of which in their multiplicity is a  prerequisite of the normal development, if not to say survival,  of Europe, arise automatically.    It may be assumed that the forms of state and political  arrangement which are destined to take hold and function in  Russia will differ from the Western forms no less than our way  of life from, say, the German way of life. But in this case  anything more than the coexistence of these forms is hardly to  be expected. Although they all fall into the parliamentary  democracy category. This entire national-state mosaic, after the  artificial "capitalist-socialist" counterpoise has been  rejected, does not fit within either the dichotomy of the "old  democracies-new democracies," "market economy-transitional  economy," or "rich countries-poor countries" type or within a  rigid framework at all. The increased internal heterogeneousness  in international associations, including the European Union and  NATO, and their actual expansion are making it impossible to use  membership of them as a basic typological characteristic. A new  European area-study typology based on the principles of  objectivity and ideological neutrality is required. Small  countries would, probably, prove to be a principal typological  group. No less than three-fourths of the CSCE members situated  here could be classed as such in Europe. Small countries, which  have tangibly influenced the state of affairs in Europe as it  is, are now proving to be a quite clearly expressed level of its  post-confrontation architecture. Their similarity in terms of  type of behavior and problems creates the basis for a kind of  small-state solidarity, from which it is easy to switch to the  coordination of joint actions. For the major European powers,  Russia included, numerous small partners could prove a highly  promising, albeit complex, field for new geopolitical strategy  and tactics.  <H5>  Dramatis Personae and Agents </H5>   While having affirmed that the role and policy of states in  Europe are changing considerably, it is essential, of course, to  go deeper. That is, to the primary motives and energy sources of  these changes. In other words, to the exponents of the interests  or the participants in those same national interests which are  usually discussed as a whole, whereas today they require an  "address." The modern state and society are characterized by the  increased assertiveness and autonomy of all their components, in  respect to international affairs included. Especially if it is a  question of today's European situation with its intensive  modification of socioeconomic and political structures.    The role and correlation of the principal exponents of  interests in the European countries is a fundamental question of  their status and future development. Together with an area-study  typology this could be a priority and most applied topic of  European research.    We would point out by way of illustration that the structure  and modus operandi of the elite of a united Germany will differ  appreciably from that of the former Bonn republic. The changes  have affected the holy of holies--the upper stratum of German  banking business. The unprecedented infusions in the "new lands"  ($100 billion a year along federal lines alone) have lent  impetus to a reallocation of roles and influence among banking  groups. New people with new aspirations and styles have begun to  make their way into this sphere also. What is to be expected  from this, the near future will tell. It is noticeable as yet  how in traditional German expansionism (both external and  internal) extensive ingredients are beginning to supplant  intensive ingredients. The imbalance in the giant financial  mechanism is forcing an acceleration of political steps and not  that sensitive an attitude toward the interests of European  neighbors, and of many compatriots also.    Describing Russia as a riddle wrapped in a mystery, W.  Churchill observed that there is a clue to this riddle in the  form of Russian national interest. But judging Russian interest  was simpler at that time inasmuch as there were before one's  eyes merely several of its incarnations accommodated in Kremlin  offices. For a serious analysis of Russian foreign policy today  an in-depth knowledge of Russian society, which is in a state in  which "only faith" remains, is required. The West has,  seemingly, inwardly recoiled from the boundless and highly  unfamiliar picture of the Russian cosmos which has suddenly been  revealed. The reduction in the pace of rapprochement on the part  of the former may partially be explained by this conceptual and,  simply, informational insufficiency. Nonetheless, many key  intra-Russian components are displaying a surprising stability,  which is why the reforms under way here are in content closer to  modernization. The role of the fuel and energy complex-military  industrial complex duo is growing. Having regrouped, having cast  off the jacket of super-centralization, and having united with  the biggest banks, they will, most likely, increasingly  assuredly influence Moscow's actions in the world arena. As  before, they will need major external sales markets, better near  than far. At the same time the pleiades of Afghan vets and  politicized technocrats in the top leadership will for a long  time, most likely, serve as guarantors against any adventures.  It will not take these circles and groups long to ponder the  nature of their overseas interest. The most concise description  of Russian foreign policy in the coming years will be pragmatism.  <H5>  Crisis of the Structural Genre </H5>   All that has been said merely confirms that the existing  international structures and institutions are subject to  reinterpretation and adjustment. It would seem that the stage of  the unswerving increase in the level of their integration in the  direction of some "higher state" is played out. The need for a  further increase in their supra-national character is  increasingly being called in question in the top political  stratum of the West European states.    European economic and political integration was conceived in  certain "hard nuclei." The states belonging to them were  particularly closely interconnected with one another and very  close in terms of type of economic, political, and cultural  development. The structures that they formed are genetically  linked with this type, which, strictly speaking, limits the  potential of their geographical expansion.    The European Union and the Council of Europe and, in fact,  this "hard nucleus" now face a strategic dilemma: either to  lessen the demands on the internal consolidation of the  international structures and on the new members or to expend  additional resources on an upturn in the general level of  integration. The path of compromise is preferred as yet, by all  accounts. The existence in the European Union of at least two  integration "speeds" has been acknowledged and  institutionalized, virtually. The preparatory institution of  "candidacy" (association, "partnership," "specially invited  state") has been instituted under various structures.    As distinct from the former political, more precisely,  military-political, pressure along NATO lines, on the part of  the United States, I should say, even the West European states  will hardly succeed in sticking to a common integration course.  A third version, no longer that hypothetical today, of a gradual  transition of the leading role in respect to consolidation in  Europe to Germany and, possibly, the Western European Union, is  emerging.  <H5>  New Geopolitical Paradigm </H5>   A serious modernization of their conceptual and  methodological resources is required of European politicians and  researchers today. The former foreign policy thinking that took  shape under the influence of the rivalry between NATO and the  Warsaw Pact was based to a large extent on numerical ideas. It  was mainly a question of a comparison of military and economic  potentials in their various aspects. This was, so to speak, an  "arithmetical approach" to all-European reality. The impending  era requires a recognition of the growing specificity and  interdependence of all parts and aspects of European life. Tasks  of a qualitatively new level of complexity are coming to  confront the researchers and politicians. Inertia in thinking  and political practice rooted in the previous stage could under  these conditions do its exponents a bad turn, but those who  depend on their decisions even more.    As far as Russia is concerned, it is important for it today,  in addition, not to lapse into conceptual dependence. The  concentration of Russian geopolitical thought on the problems of  international structure-formation could distract it from the  rapidly developing European realities, from the new trends at  the national-state level particularly. NATO and the European  Union are and will for a long time yet remain for Russia "things  in themselves." It will hardly ever have full-blooded relations  with them. The CSCE is, like any club with a low admission  requirement, incapable. The situation would change were it to  interface with Western military-political mechanisms. But for  Russia the same problems would then arise.    The "all-European" idea as presently crafted is barren in  itself also. The cross-breeding of Central Asian and, say, North  European interests within the framework of a 54-party forum is  just as absurd as it is patently unproductive. The anemic  post-Helsinki principles and institutions have been cast aside,  virtually, by acts of struggle for a restructuring of Europe and  the world.    Russia is persuaded on the basis of its own experience of  the  value of a direct approach to European affairs in their dynamic  diversity and of the need for the retention of freedom of  decisionmaking.</p>

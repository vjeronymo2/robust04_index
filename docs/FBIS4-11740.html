			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Clarification on Libyan Opposition's </F> London Meeting"]    [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- Clarifying a report published by  AL-HAYAH last Wednesday on Libyan oppositionists' London  meeting, Prince Muhammad al-Hasan al-Rida al-Sanusi has said:    1. We renew our respect for all Libyan opposition figures  and groups and wish them success in ridding the country of its  predicament. We also renew our willingness and desire to  meeting with any figure or group to exchange views on the Libyan  problem. We stress that we do not consider ourselves an  opposition faction or organization. We belong to everyone, in  accordance with the traditions of our al-Sanusi family, which  has never sided with one group against another.    2. With regard to the meeting held in the London house of a  figure known for his generosity and good reputation, we clarify  that it was not a political meeting. It was an invitation to a  lunch which witnessed general and unspecific discussions about  Libyan issues, just like any other discussions one would expect  at such meetings. No memorandum was written, nor were  signatures on any initiative collected.    3. We have been surprised by what was published and  circulated by Libyan brothers. We had organized the issues  raised at the meeting. We would like to stress that we are not  against any opportunity to discuss current political affairs,  but we prefer that there be clear prior organization for the  sake of the unity of all the nation's sons.    4. We do not wish to be a means for any plan or a tool for  any quarter seeking to achieve personal or factional interests.  And we assure everyone that we will respect the will of every  person and quarter and will not interfere in the Libyan  opposition's affairs.</p>

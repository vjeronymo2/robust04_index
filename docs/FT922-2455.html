			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Chink in the armour of US regulation: Moves towards a global market in equities Globalisation is a rather tarnished concept. So what should be made of proposals which could allow non-US investment companies - such as UK unit trusts - to sell their shares more freely to American investors, as long as US mutual funds obtain similar access overseas? The question is topical because of a recent report by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities industry watchdog. This 540-page document had its genesis two years ago, when the SEC decided to review some 50-year-old legislation governing its investment management industry. Proposals in the report are sweeping, stretching beyond the 'internationalisation' issue. The document suggests, for example, that restrictions on the sales fees which US investors can be charged by the nation's Dollars 1,300bn (Pounds 722bn) mutual fund industry should be largely abandoned. It recommends that funds specifically for sophisticated investors should be freed from onerous registration requirements. And it advocates allowing funds' shares to be sold, European-style, by advertisement, ditching the requirement that investors see a full prospectus. The aim of reforms such as these is twofold: to streamline regulation, hopefully stimulating innovation; and to introduce more competition. The main suggestions on globalisation are: Foreign investment companies should be permitted to sell shares in the US without having to meet all provisions of the Investment Company Act, provided they are subject to regulation in their home country which provides 'substantially equivalent' protection for investors. Their entry into the US should also be 'in the public interest'. The SEC should be authorised to enter bilateral agreements with other regulatory organisations to facilitate this. The SEC should support tax changes to help US investment companies compete abroad. The SEC should restrict its supervision of 'foreign advisers' who register to do business in the US. It should not regulate a registered foreign adviser's dealings with clients outside the US. At first glance, the proposals seem commonsense. The 1940 Investment Company Act bars a foreign investment company from making a public offering of its shares in the US unless the SEC believes it can enforce compliance with all provisions of the act (in this case, it grants a 'section 7(d) order'). Since the act prohibits practices which are commonplace in Europe this means a foreign fund wishing to sell shares to US investors must structure itself and operate like a US investment company. As the report notes, no foreign investment company has obtained a 7(d) order for almost two decades. Equally, a foreign investment adviser, who registers with the SEC to sell services in the US, will find all his activities - in the US and outside - become subject to the 1940 Investment Advisers Act. A non-US adviser can discover that legitimate business in his home country proves illegal under US rules. To get around this problem, foreign advisers set up 'independent' subsidiaries, registered in the US, to advise US clients. Such arrangements can prove cumbersome. However, whether the SEC staff proposals present a practical answer to these problems is another matter. For a start, it is uncertain how speedily changes in the US could be implemented - even assuming that higher authorities at the SEC are supportive. Giving foreign companies the right to sell shares in the US without effectively turning them into US operations would require legislative changes, for example. The domestic impetus behind such a change seems questionable. The Investment Company Institute, which represents the US fund management industry and has been talking informally to counterparts in Europe about increased reciprocity, has been only lukewarm. Ironically, political elements within the SEC may be more enthusiastic than the industry. 'This time round, the SEC is quite proud of the US investment industry,' says Mr Pierre de St Phalle, a partner with Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell, the US law firm. 'So I think they're keen to push the reciprocity idea.' Obstacles to sales reciprocity do not end with federal regulation. There is a series of diverse state rules, known as the 'blue sky laws'. As the SEC report notes: 'This second layer of registration is arguably more burdensome for a foreign investment company . . . since (it) must also satisfy applicable regulatory requirements in its home country.' Conversely, it is unclear how much advantage US funds would gain in Europe, even if satisfactory bilateral agreements were secured. After all, they can already register a fund in Luxembourg - but are still hampered by the marketing demands of different European countries and tax disadvantages. More fundamentally, it is questionable how great the 'cross-border' demand really is. Big institutional investors are showing a greater appetite for globally diversified portfolios - although on the US side, interest has increased from low levels. But even if this is indicative of investor demand generally, it may be met by a growth in locally registered funds which concentrate on holding foreign issues, The number of US-registered open-ended international equity funds, for example, rose from approximately two dozen in 1985, to 145 at end-December. Still, if increased reciprocity for mutual fund sales is a subject on which the fund management industry - on both sides of the Atlantic - is cool, other elements of the SEC report enjoy a warmer response. The suggestion, for example, that regulation of non-US advisers should be restricted is seen by some UK fund managers as having real practical value. Also, the suggestion that an unlimited number of 'qualified purchasers'  - that is, sophisticated investors - should be allowed to hold shares in a non-US fund where these are sold by private placement, wins some plaudits. The limit is currently 100 US shareholders. But globalisation, it seems, can wait.</p>

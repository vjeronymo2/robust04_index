			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Uncertainty and over-supply slow new issue activity EUROMARKET participants may be struck by a feeling of deja vu looking back over the first three months of this year. As in 1991, the period saw a torrent of new issues as investors flocked to the market, followed by near-paralysis as uncertainty and the effects of over-supply took hold. If anything, the swing from boom to bust was even more pronounced this year than last. In total, Dollars 73.6bn new Eurobonds were issued, against Dollars 63.5bn in the first quarter of 1991. Yet the slowdown in new issue activity during March has been spectacular. Only a handful of new issues was launched last week, most meeting a muted response. One reason for the slowdown in new issue activity over the past two weeks is economic: there is deep uncertainty over the prospects for both the US and European bond markets. The yield on the US Treasury long bond retreated back above 8 per cent this month, and analysts are divided about the future prospects. One leading Eurobond firm admitted last week that even its in-house economists were divided over the outlook for the dollar bond market. Some see a triple-dip US recession on the horizon, with the long bond rising and the yield falling towards 7.5 per cent. Others see a resurgence of growth and inflationary pressures in the US economy, with the long bond moving to 8.5 per cent by the middle of the year. In Europe, most bond markets have lost the gains made in the aftermath of the Maastricht summit, which seemed to set the economies on a path towards monetary union and low inflation. Against this background, institutional investors are loathe to commit additional funds to the market. However, the over-supply of bonds during February and the early part of March has greatly accentuated the problem. Many Eurobond firms are holding substantial inventories of unsold paper, much of it underwritten at prices which no longer reflect secondary market levels. Just how much of the Dollars 73bn total new issuance remains on the books of underwriters is uncertain. Estimates range from 25 per cent of total new issuance - dismissed as outlandish by many syndicate officials - to a modest Dollars 5bn equivalent. The truth is probably somewhere between the two. The league table of lead mangers shows some substantial changes over this time last year. Deutsche Bank Capital Markets is the biggest winner in terms of market share, rising to the top slot from seventh position at the end of the first quarter of 1991. Union Bank of Switzerland also increased its volume of lead underwriting, rising to third position from 10th under the management of Mr Len Harwood, who assumed responsibility for new issue activity at the end of last year. In contrast, Morgan Stanley International was at the head of the league table in March 1991 but now stands at 19th position. Banque Paribas Capital Markets has fallen from second place to fifth. The slide of both firms is due to the lower volume of large Ecu bond issues by sovereign and supranational borrowers over the past three months. Ecu bond issuance amounted to Dollars 13.5bn equivalent, from Dollars 15.53bn in the first three month of last year. The Ecu remained the second most popular Euromarket currency, but the dominance of the dollar has not been threatened this year as it was in the early months of 1991. However, market share does not always equate with profitability. The firms rumoured to be carrying the most unsold inventory of bonds also appear towards the top end of the underwriting league table.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROBOND ISSUES BY CURRENCY  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           1st quarter 1992                       1st quarter 1991  -------------------------------------    ------------------------------                        Total    No. of               Total    No. of Rank    Currency      raised    issues    Rank      raised    issues                   (Dollarsbn)                  (Dollarsbn)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    1      USDollars      20.15       109       1       17.61        79    2      Ecu            13.50        45       2       15.53        20    3      Yen             9.04        45       4        7.26        46    4      D-Mark          8.52        53       6        3.90        34    5      Lira            5.33        24       8        2.06        11    6      Sterling        5.26        22       3        7.43        37    7      FFr             4.66        24       7        3.50        17    8      CDollars        2.97        20       5        3.97        24    9      Guilder         1.70        13      10        0.55         2   10      ADollars        1.38        20       9        1.45        22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IFR BONDBASE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP EUROBOND LEAD MANAGERS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                First quarter of 1992           First quarter of 1991            -----------------------------  ------------------------------ Manager    Dollarsbn  Rank     %  Issues  Dollarsbn  Rank     %   Issues  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Deutsche   Bank          6.54     1  8.95      32       2.84     7   4.49      14 Nomura          5.24     2  7.16      27       5.63     3   8.88      28 UBS             4.89     3  6.69      16       1.70    10.  2.68       7 CSFB            4.63     4  6.33      19       3.59     5   5.66      13 Paribas         4.11     5  5.62      14       6.50     2  10.25       9 Nikko           3.71     6  5.08      22       1.99     8   3.15      13 Yamaichi        2.82     7  3.86      16       1.93     9   3.04      18 Daiwa           2.48     8  3.39      21       3.87     4   6.11      22 Merrill Lynch   2.33     9  3.19      12       3.12     6   4.93       7 Goldman Sachs   2.13    10  2.91      10       1.36    13   2.15       7 CCF             2.03    11  2.78       6       1.18    15   1.86       3 IBJ             2.02    12  2.77       6       1.07    16   1.68       6 JP Morgan       1.89    13  2.59       9       0.85     -      -       7 SG Warburg      1.79    14  2.45       7       1.62    12   2.55       9 SBC             1.68    15  2.29       9       1.62    11   2.55       8 Commerzbank     1.64    16  2.24       6       0.27     -      -       2 BNP             1.58    17  2.16       4       0.07     -      -       1 Credit  Lyonnais       1.45    18  1.99       9       0.97    19   1.53       5 Morgan Stanley  1.21    19  1.66       4       6.53     1  10.31       6 Bankers Tst.    1.16    20  1.59       7       0.97    18   1.53       6 Industry   totals     **73.11                 390      63.57                  310  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- **Preliminary Figures - Full credit to book runner Source: IFR BONDBASE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Observer: Where is thy sting? It's the silly season for news - maybe sillier than usual. The Irish Times last week ran a story - since repeated elsewhere - which reported that Ballymena undertaker Conrad O'Lone was commissioned by an unnamed Nigerian oil baron to conduct the funeral of his 114-year-old grandmother, buried in a 500lb gold-plated casket costing Pounds 1m. She died in December but was embalmed and finally buried in February this year, when a purported 200,000 people attended a four-day funeral service. Total cost? A reported Pounds 4m. Hmmm. Why should O'Lone choose to publicise his story now, some six months after the event? Yesterday O'Lone was not at his Ballymena number. Nor was he available at The Limelight, a Dublin bar where, Observer was advised by O'Lone's Ballymena company, Graveside Services, he could be contacted. Nigeria's High Commission in London said yesterday: 'We were ourselves wondering if it were true. It's too outlandish, though the village of Issele Uku (where the funeral is said to have occurred) does exist. There could have been a flamboyant burial, perhaps - but on such a scale?' Information officer Charles Chikese adds that, surprisingly, he saw no report of the funeral in The Guardian or The Daily Times, Nigeria's two biggest newspapers. Curiouser and curiouser. Maybe the Nigerian hacks misheard the name as Con Alone.</p>

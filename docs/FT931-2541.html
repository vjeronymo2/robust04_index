			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Venezuelan leader again under assault: Joe Mann reports from Caracas on a move to impeach Perez VENEZUELA'S President Carlos Andres Perez, who survived two attempted coups last year and repeated demands for his resignation, now faces possible impeachment 11 months before he is due to leave office. The initiative, launched by Mr Ramon Escovar Salom, attorney-general, has generated a new wave of rumours about another military uprising, renewed the debate about early presidential and legislative elections (at present due in December), and sapped confidence among investors. As attorney-general, Mr Escovar acts independently of the administration. However, he himself has been accused of being motivated in this action by personal ambition. The Supreme Court has been asked to rule on whether there is sufficient merit in Mr Escovar's petition to impeach the president for allegedly embezzling some Dollars 17m in 1989 from a secret Interior Ministry account for national security and defence expenditures. Mr Perez insists the money was used for 'secret' security and defence purposes. His opponents say it was spent on his 1988 presidential campaign, and possibly for other non-security purposes. There is little public sympathy for Mr Perez, a popular figure before he began implementing economic reform measures four years ago. President in the oil boom years from 1974 to 1979, he has become for many Venezuelans a symbol of corruption and old-style backroom politics. If the high court rules in favour of the petition, the senate must decide if just cause exists to try the chief executive. A positive senate vote would then cause the president to be suspended and stand trial before the supreme court. The petition, unprecedented in recent history, has created new uncertainties in a country still jittery over last November's foiled military uprising. The executive branch in the past wielded huge power, hardly fettered by the supposedly-independent supreme court. Important decisions were influenced by the presidency or leading figures in the country's two big political parties: Mr Perez's own Democratic Action party and the Christian Democrats, Copei. However, this seems to be changing. Last week, the court ruled that the government's use of special summary courts-martial to try military and civilians accused of participating in last November's rebellion was unconstitutional. This means that the accused rebels must be retried before ordinary courts-martial, something the government had wanted to avoid because of defence attorneys' delaying tactics. It has still not managed to prosecute the military accused in the attempted coup in February last year. Ironically, Mr Perez lobbied successfully last year for changing the composition of the supreme court, effectively taking a first step towards de-politicising it. For the president, the attorney-general's initiative extends his political purgatory. He and his administration, committed to widespread economic and political reform, have faced over the past 13 months two military uprisings, hundreds of anti-government protests and riots, repeated calls for his resignation and press attacks. Partly as a result of his policies, Venezuela's economy has been the fastest growing in the region since 1990. However, this has not been enough for investors, who are worried about the political uncertainty and doubts about the policies of the next president.</p>

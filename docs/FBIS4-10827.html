			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 14 Apr (PL) -- The Cuban press today accused  the United States of courting danger by preparing the largest  military exercise in the Atlantic region, which represents an  unusual increase of forces in the area.    GRANMA newspaper reports the increase of tensions due to the  Agile Provider-94 joint exercises scheduled for 22 April-11 May,  in a region which encompasses seven states in the southeastern  United States.    The newspaper states that (according to Defense Department  spokesmen) the exercise will include the participation of  approximately 44,000 U.S. Army, Navy, Marine infantry, and U.S.  Coast Guard personnel.    The report explains French and Netherlands units will also  participate, and the maneuvers will be concentrated in the area  of Camp Lejeune and Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort  Chaffee, Arkansas.    GRANMA reports that "Agile Provider will help lubricate the  powerful war machine that the U.S. Atlantic Command represents.  It includes the largest number of U.S. land, tactical air, and  naval forces; and they will train together for the first time  since its reorganization in October 1993."    The newspaper specifies that such a concentration of  military  troops, with high capability and combat readiness under  conditions that are very similar to actual combat, represents an  unusual buildup of forces in the area.    It adds that Agile Provider-94, the command's largest  exercise, renews the United States' large-scale military  activity just as the Fleetex 2-94 joint maneuvers will conclude,  and at a time when the program foreseen for the Trade Wind  maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea is scheduled to end.    The strange concurrence of the maneuvers and exercises in  the  Atlantic region once again proves that the "supplier" of dangers  is truly "agile" when fulfilling its goals, the report concludes.</p>

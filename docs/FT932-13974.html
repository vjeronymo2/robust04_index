			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Arts: Lion in the Streets - Theatre The Canadians are coming. Now, Judith Thompson's perplexing play Lion in the Streets replaces Brad Fraser's thriller Unidentified Human Remains and the True Nature of Love at the Hampstead Theatre. Both are fractured works, high on impact and low on plot. Thompson's play presents civilisation and its discontents; it makes strange, compelling drama. Lion in The Streets comprises a series of linked, loosely interrelated contemporary scenes set in Toronto, that clean city by the lake so polluted it never freezes. But this is not the Toronto of Bay Street commerce, Younge Street style or Oakville money. Thompson creates basic neighbourhood feel, and then fashions scenes of unmediated emotion from instinctual reactions. Her characters are animal then rational, flickering between both. The play develops themes of violence and personal identity from her 1989 collection The Other Side of the Dark. It holds its secrets until the final scene. Isobel, a portuguese girl, has been searching throughout the play for the man who killed her, the lion in the streets. She finds him: 'I love you, you took my last breath . . . give me back my life,' she says, then to the audience, 'I came back. I want you all to take your life, I want you all to have your life.' She acts throughout the play as a chorus, speaking to characters who sometimes hear, a voice warning about the need to live a connected, consistent life and the pain of not doing so. Each scene contains within itself its own genesis, like a course in Freudian psychotherapy. Thompson takes her characters back to primal scenes of childhood, forward to fantasies of sex and death, and sideways into the rational world. The result is a disjointed play which stresses the gaps and processes that operate between people in all relationships. Here are characters pushed to the side of their own lives: a broken marriage, a father's death, or a local Parent Association meeting which accuses the teacher of fostering 'lifetime sugar addiction.' Another character discovers she has leukemia and dreams of being Ophelia, floating away down the Humber; a priest receives absolution from a gay confessee ('You can be honest with me, father, I'll forgive you . . .'); a journalist is so taunted by the sexual fantasies of a cerebral palsy interviewee that she beats her up. The six actors (Shirley Henderson, Beth Goddard, Julie Legrand, Kerry Shale, David Sibley and Sonia Ritter) play 26 characters; the action is given purpose and shape by Matthew Lloyd's intelligent direction, which makes sense of each scene, as a good psychotherapist does. Jessica Tyrwhitt's fine design can be a park, nightclub, office or construction site, crammed onto the Hampstead stage. Hampstead Theatre, Swiss Cottage, until May 15 (071 722 9301)</p>

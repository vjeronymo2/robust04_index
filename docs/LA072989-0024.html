			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICK CARROLL  </P> <P> Concerning Claudia Puig's article on Rick Carroll, the radio programmer who  died this month ("Carroll Brought Luster, Listeners to KROQ-FM," July 14): I  was a deejay for 17 years, many of those working with or for Rick Carroll. Rick  was able to instill a feeling of true security and protection, while making you  feel like the world revolved around you. The feeling he gave you transferred to  the performance you gave on the air and consequently to positive results in the  ratings.  </P> <P> This ability, combined with his brilliance in music selection and programming,  made him a genius.  </P> <P> T. MICHAEL JORDAN  </P> <P> (a.k.a. Tom Nefeldt)  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

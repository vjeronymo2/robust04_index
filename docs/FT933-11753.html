			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Survey of Resource Management - Buying-in Services (4): World's largest 'outsourcing' contract for computer services PICTURED above is the data centre of Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) at San Diego, California, which recently won a Dollars 27m 'outsourcing' contract with Sun Microsystems. CSC is one of the largest independent services companies in the computer industry and has developed many long-term outsourcing partnerships in the last twenty years to provide information technology (IT) services in the US, including NASA, New York State and the National Flood Insurance Program. The addition of the world's largest-ever outsourcing contract (Pounds 3bn over then years) at General Dynamics has taken CSC's outsourcing business to around Pounds 1bn - 40 per cent of the company's total earnings. This year, the Services Management Division (SMD) of CSC Europe, based at Weybridge, Surrey, secured the outsourcing contract for British Home Stores (BhS). For BhS, this contract involves business re-engineering, extending IT links into the supply chain, developing inventory management and marketing new retail systems.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Venezuelan officers fill top ministerial posts TWO SERVING military officers were sworn in yesterday as Venezuela's new ministers of defence and foreign affairs, in an apparent gesture by President Carlos Andres Perez towards the armed forces, writes Joseph Mann in Caracas. Air Force General Ivan Dario Jimenez Sanchez takes the key position of defence minister, while Army General Fernando Ochoa Antich, who held the defence post since June 1991, was moved to head the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is the first time an active member of the armed forces has held the post of foreign minister, and that a cabinet has had two on-duty generals in important positions. The government's former debt negotiator, Mr Carlos Hernandez Delfino, is to head the Venezuelan Investment Fund overseeing privatisation.</p>

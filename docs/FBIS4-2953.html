			<p>BFN     [Text] Urumqi, April 13 (XINHUA) -- China has made much  headway in the prospecting and development of oil and natural  gas in its three major basins in northwest China.    Up to now a total of 34 oil-gas fields have been found with  a  proved oil-bearing area of over 1,200 square kilometers in the  three basins of Junggar, Tarim and Turpan.    Scattered in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous  Region, the basins cover a total area of 740,000 square  kilometers.    Scientists from home and other countries have proved that  the  basins have good generative conditions for oil and natural gas.    They predicted that reserves in the basins hold billions of  tons of oil, about one-fourth of the total onshore oil resources  in China.    In the early 1980s, China began its efforts to find new oil  resources in the western part of the country as part of the  country's oil development strategy.    Since then, a large-scale oil prospecting and exploration  campaign involving big investment has started on the Gobi Desert  of Xinjiang.    Local petroleum scientists said that oil prospecting and  development there has entered a very active and fruitful period.    Some nine new oil and natural gas fields have been  discovered  in the 130,000-square-kilometer Junggar Basin in northern  Xinjiang in the past ten years, including Xiazijie, Huoshaoshan,  Beisantai, Cainan, Shixi and Mahu.    In the Tarim Basin, which is 560,000 square kilometers in  area, nine oil-gas fields have been found in the last five years.    Six new oil-gas fields have been discovered in the Turpan  Basin, though prospecting and exploration started only three  years ago.    Now 18 oil-gas fields have been built or are under  construction in the three basins. They have had a production  capacity of 11.79 million tons of crude oil annually.    Petroleum geologists have made surveys of deep geological  structures of the three basins and discovered 75 large  oil-bearing structures. And beginning this year there will be a  "peak stage" when more oil-gas reserver will be found in the  three basins.    Now there are over 50,000 oil workers and over 100 drilling  and geological teams working in the basins. The prospecting is  expanding and wells are being sunk deeper, from 3,000 meters to  more than 6,000 meters.</p>

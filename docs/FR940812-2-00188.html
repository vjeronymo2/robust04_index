			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second portion of the tube integrity evaluation is intended to assure that total leak rate from the affected steam generator (SG) during a postulated MSLB occurring at EOC would be less than that which could lead to radiological releases in excess of the licensing basis for the plant. If calculated leakage exceeds the allowable limit determined by the licensing basis dose calculation, licensees can either repair tubes, beginning with the largest voltage indications until the leak limit is met, or reduce reactor coolant system specific iodine activity (refer to example technical specification (TS) pages of Enclosure 2). The analyses discussed above may incorporate or reference previous analyses, or portions thereof, to the extent that they continue to bound the conditions of the steam generator as determined by inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For plants in which the technical specifications do not require the pressurizer power-operated relief valves (PORVs) to be operable during power operation, these tube integrity analyses should be conducted for an assumed differential pressure across the tube walls equal to the pressurizer safety valve set point plus 3 percent for the valve accumulation less atmospheric pressure in faulted steam generators. For plants in which the technical specifications do require the PORVs to be operable, the assumed differential pressure may be based on the PORV set point in lieu of the safety valve set point with similar adjustments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. a&blank;Conditional Probability of Burst During MSLB <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For this generic letter, the conditional probability of burst refers to the probability that the burst pressures associated with 1 or more indications in the faulted steam generator will be less than the maximum pressure differential associated with a postulated MSLB assumed to accur at EOC. A methodology should be submitted for NRC review and approval for calculating this conditional burst probability. After the NRC approves a method for calculating conditional probability of burst, licensees may reference the approved method. This methodology should involve: (1) Determining the distribution of indications as a function of their voltage response at beginning of cycle (BOC) as discussed in Section 2.b.1, (2) projecting this BOC distribution to an EOC voltage distribution based on consideration of voltage growth due to defect progression between inspections as discussed in Section 2.b.2(2) and voltage measurement uncertainty as discussed in Section 2.b.2(1), and (3) evaluating the conditional probability of burst for the projected EOC voltage distribution using the correlation between burst pressure and voltage discussed in Section 2.a.1. The solution methodology should account for uncertainties in voltage measurement (Section 2.b.2(1)), the distribution of potential voltage growth rates applicable to each indication (Section 2.b.2(2)), and the distribution of potential burst pressures as a function of voltage (Section 2.a.1). Monte Carlo simulations constitute an acceptable approach for accounting for these various sources of uncertainty. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.a.1&blank;Burst Pressure Versus Bobbin Voltage <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An empirical model, for 7/8-inch or 3/4-inch diameter tubing as applicable, should be used to relate burst pressure to bobbin voltage response for purposes of estimating the conditional probability of burst during a postulated MSLB. This model should explicitly account for burst pressure uncertainty as indicated by scatter of the supporting test data and should also account for the parametric (i.e., slope and intercept) uncertainty of the regression fit of the data. The supporting data for 7/8-inch diameter and 3/4-inch diameter tubing should include all applicable data consistent with the industry recommendations in letter dated April 22, 1994, to Jack Strosnider, NRC, from David A. Steininger, EPRI, ``Exclusion of Data from Alternate Repair Criteria (ARC) Databases Associated with 7/8 inch Tubing Exhibiting ODSCC'' (Reference 1) and letter dated June 9, 1994, to Brian Sheron, NRC, from David J. Modeen, Nuclear Energy Institute (Reference 2) respectively, with certain exceptions. Specifically, data excluded under criteria 2a and 2b in References 1 and 2 should not be excluded pending staff review and approval of these criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.b&blank;Total Leak Rate During MSLB <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A methodology should be submitted for NRC review and approval for calculating the total primary-to-secondary leak rate in the faulted steam generator during a postulated MSLB assumed to occur at EOC. After the NRC approves a leakage calculation methodology, licensees may reference the approved method. This methodology involves: (1) Determining the distribution of indications as a function of their voltage response at beginning of cycle (BOC) as discussed in Section 2.b.1, (2) projecting this BOC distribution to an EOC voltage distribution based on consideration of voltage growth due to defect progression between inspection as discussed in Section 2.b.2(2) and voltage measurement uncertainty as discussed in Section 2.b.2(1), and (3) evaluating the total leak rate for the projected EOC voltage distribution using a probability of leakage (POL) model as discussed in Section 2.b.3(1) and conditional leak rate model as discussed in Section 2.b.3(2). The solution methodology should account for uncertainties in voltage measurement (Section 2.b.2(1)), the distribution of potential voltage growth rates applicable to each indication (Section 2.b.2(2)), the uncertainties in the probability of leakage as a function of voltage (Section 2.b.3(1)), and the distribution of potential conditional leak rates as a function of voltage (Section 2.b.3(2)). Monte Carlo simulations are an acceptable method for accounting for these sources of uncertainty provided that the calculated total leak rate reflects an upper 95% quantile value. [Note: draft NUREG&hyph;1477, Section 3.3, page 3&hyph;21, presents an expression for T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> l <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i.e., working bound for total leak rate) which is based on the premise that leak rate is independent of voltage. This expression does not account for parametric uncertainty in either the POL or conditional leak rate model. Thus, the draft NUREG&hyph;1477 equation should not be used unless appropriate modifications are made to the equation to account for these parametric uncertainties.] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.b.1&blank;Distribution of Bobbin Indications as a Function of Voltage at BOC <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The frequency distribution by voltage of bobbin indications actually found during inspection should be scaled upward by a factor of 1/POD to account for non-detected cracks which can potentially leak or rupture under postulated MSLB conditions during the next operating cycle. POD stands for probability of detection of ODSCC flaws. This adjusted frequency distribution minus detected indications for tubes that have been plugged or repaired should constitute, for purposes of the tube integrity analyses, the assumed frequency distribution of bobbin indications at BOC as a function of voltage. This can also be expressed as: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Complacency about escalation of debt Sir, Barry Riley (Weekend Money, November 12/13) is a little too complacent about the indebtedness of poor countries. 'Most of such countries,' he says, 'have been allowed to renege on the bulk of their debts and are now at various stages of a third world economic boom.' This is unfair and untrue. Because of what Keynes called 'the magic of compound interest', because of high real rates of interest, and because of unfavourable exchange rate movements, every single month between 1982 and 1990 - every month not year - the poor of the south paid the rich north Dollars 12.5bn. This is as much as the entire third world spends on health and education combined. Interest arrears on long-term debt owed to official creditors has risen from Dollars 126m at the beginning of the 1980s to more than Dollars 10bn today, and more than half of the debt owed by poor countries to the Paris Club now consists of capitalised interest. Over the period 1993-1996 poor countries are scheduled to pay an average of USDollars 41bn a year to their creditors - most of them rich OECD governments. This is two to five times as much as they were able to pay in 1992. Of growing concern is the stock of debt owed by developing countries to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which has risen faster than any other type of debt. It tripled from Dollars 98bn in 1982 to Dollars 304bn in 1992. Furthermore, there is no mechanism for the rescheduling or reduction of this debt. Translated into ability to pay, Africa is more debt-distressed than any other developing region. Its debt has spiralled from Dollars 8.4bn in 1980 to just under Dollars 200bn now. This is equivalent to 110 per cent of Africa's entire income. The Debt Crisis Network, an alliance of 40 organisations working in, or linked to, developing countries, has welcomed the chancellor's recognition of 'the unsustainable debt burden' of the poorest countries. We only wish that his concern was shared by columnists on your newspaper, so that your readers may not all be rudely jolted out of complacency by the next debt crisis.

			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> PIANIST PETER SERKIN PRESENTS EVENING OF PREMIERES  </P> <P> In prospect extremely promising, in practice appallingly disappointing, a  program devoted entirely to new works for the piano as played by Peter Serkin  was performed in Royce Hall on Friday night. An audience of decent size  attended, and stayed through intermission. Those who remained longer were not  rewarded.  </P> <P> No fewer than 11 West Coast premieres occupied the agenda, a project of  co-commissioning sponsored by the UCLA Center for the Performing Arts, the 92nd  Street Y in New York, the Chicago Symphony and the Kennedy Center in  Washington.  </P> <P> Ten composers -- Peter Lieberson, Oliver Knussen, Bright Sheng, Tobias Picker,  Christine Berl, Tison Street, Alexander Goehr, Luciano Berio, Leon Kirchner and  Toru Takemitsu -- were represented. Despite the familiarity of some of their  names, most of them failed to produce engaging or memorable pieces.  </P> <P> Three of these 11 works that might impress on a second hearing are Lieberson's  two-minute nocturne, "Breeze of Delight," Berl's lyrical and melodious "Lord of  the Dance," and Berio's etudette, "Feuerklavier," the only bright spot in the  second half.  </P> <P> Otherwise, this program became an exercise in compositional futility, though  Serkin performed all of it with amazing conviction, and with his usual deep  concentration and immaculate pianism.  </P> <P> He miscalculated in his insistence on lingering too long at the keyboard at the  end of every piece, and by choosing as his stage companion and page-turner a  distracting young woman wearing a leather skirt, but he inspired admiration by  giving his all to music which seemed to deserve less.

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Scores of Hindus arrested on march INDIAN police yesterday arrested scores of Hindu nationalists as they marched towards the Pakistan High Commission in a demonstration organised by the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata party, the main opposition party, whose supporters last week sacked a mosque and prompted a nationwide wave of violence, writes Stefan Wagstyl in New Delhi. Across India, the security forces also rounded up hundreds of members of militant religious organisations which have been banned by the government in the wake of the destruction of the mosque at Ayodhya in northern India. The move was aimed at showing the determination of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, to punish the perpetrators of the attack on the mosque and to try to stop militant groups from fomenting religious intolerance.</p>

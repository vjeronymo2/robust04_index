			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Chechen talks fail to agree deal: Clashes near capital - Russia told conflict may spread to other regions Peace talks between Russia and the breakaway Chechen republic broke up last night without agreement after a day of clashes between invading Russian troops and forces loyal to the republic. Leaders of the delegations at the talks, held at Vladikavkaz, the capital of North Ossetia and close to the Chechen border, said there would be a further meeting today. Mr Vyacheslav Mikhailov, the Russian deputy nationalities minister, said: 'We agreed the most important thing is to stop the bloodshed in Chechnya.' The two sides said they had 'agreed in principle' to resolve the conflict peacefully and that the Russian demand for the Chechens to disarm and re-establish constitutional order had been 'received with understanding'. However, it is understood that an attempt to agree a simultaneous withdrawal of the Russian forces with a handing over of arms by the Chechen forces and the Russian-backed groups opposed to them has foundered on an inability to agree the mechanisms of such a move. The Chechens have also drawn attention to the low rank of the Russian team. Yesterday Russia continued to pour troops into the region. The conflict, which began when Chechnya declared independence three years ago, took a violent turn at the weekend when Russia set out to crush the rebel state. Russia's intervention in the volatile region has sparked fierce opposition from many Russians, who fear the country is being drawn into a 'second Afghanistan'. But yesterday Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who is in hospital recovering from a minor operation, reissued an ultimatum that all armed forces in Chechnya must disband by Thursday. Russian forces, which launched a three-pronged assault on Chechnya, have met stiff resistance both from the Chechens and other people in the north Caucasus. The Russian intervention also appears to have, at least temporarily, united the Chechen government and its armed domestic opponents, who jointly formed the delegation at yesterday's talks. Fighting was reported early today, with witnesses claiming to have heard a series of explosions near Grozny, the Chechen capital. The most serious of yesterday's clashes came at Dolinskoye, about 15 miles north-west of the city, involving a four-hour battle. The Russians said there had been more than 40 casualties after Chechen forces launched rocket attacks on advancing Russian troops, prompting retaliatory air strikes by helicopters and bombers. The Russian forces advancing from Dagestan to the east of Chechnya met with stiff resistance and at least 47 of their soldiers were said to have been captured. To the west, Russian units were fired on in the neighbouring region of Ingushetia prompting a furious reaction from Moscow. Mr Pavel Grachev, Russia's defence minister, accused Ingushetia of 'waging war'. Mr Ali Aliev, speaker of the parliament of the Confederation of Caucasus People, which unites all the non-Russian nationalities in the region, warned Russia that all Caucasus people were prepared to rally to Chechnya's aid. The intervention also sparked heated political debate in Moscow and about 5,000 people protested in Pushkin Square yesterday. Leading politicians, headed by democratic party leaders Mr Yegor Gaidar and Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, attacked the use of force. However others, such as Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister, supported Mr Yeltsin's tough approach.</p>

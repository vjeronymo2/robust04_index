			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Accountancy Column: Annual report with a difference boosts ethical approach - An unconventional company which applies 'social' guidelines to its trading strategy A HIGHLY unusual document has been circulating in the boardrooms of the FT-SE 100 companies in the last few weeks. It is a plea for greater accountability and information; and its source is not a pressure group, but a rival business. The request comes in the form of a document designed to lead by example; an annual report with a difference called a 'social audit'. Its aim is to assess the social impact and ethical behaviour of the company in relation to its aims and those of its 'stakeholders'. The 20-page glossy brochure provides background on topics such as the breakdown of costs and profits throughout the production process of a sample of products, a description of some of its suppliers, and figures on the composition and salary scales of the workforce. The source for this information is an extremely unconventional company called Traidcraft. Founded in 1979 in Newcastle upon Tyne, the business imports food, clothing and handicrafts from groups in the Third World. Its aim is to promote 'fair trade' by buying at what it considers just prices from suppliers who promote social and economic development in their communities. Some of its principles have been challenged in the last few years by a deficit which threatened its future. It has changed management and restructured with the aim of being profitable and paying dividends. However, the new mood has not removed the directors' determination to keep sight of at least some of their radical origins. Traidcraft maintains a policy of offering the highest-paid employee no more than three-times the wage of the lowest. Its objectives of promoting fair trade remain. Its social audit report is a development out of these concerns. The idea of social auditing is not new. In a booklet* produced earlier this year by the company in conjunction with the New Economics Foundation, an alternative economics think-tank, it lays out the history of the process in the last 20 years. The authors are Richard Evans, Traidcraft's external affairs director, and Simon Zadek from the foundation. In 1971, there was a social audit of the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders. A number of similar assessments in the UK and US were carried out during the decade by Social Audit, established by the Public Interest Research Centre, largely without the co-operation of managements. Pressure for greater disclosure by companies developed, with guidelines from the Confederation of British Industry and limited extra disclosure requirements in successive pieces of company law covering political and charitable contributions and employee welfare. In other countries, there has also been considerable attention paid to social accounting issues beyond the narrow confines of financial performance: companies in the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, the US and India have produced reports. But the authors argue that the missing ingredients have been anything systematic, comprehensive and regular. They are often focused around one particular event such as a factory closure, only consider certain products or regions, became rapidly dated, may be superficial, and typically are not independently verified. There is also no framework to help guide disclosures and make them consistent. Traidcraft's recent efforts certainly try to address these limitations. Its first tentative steps took place last year with a document called 'Towards a Social Audit'. It profiled two of its suppliers, analysed changes in its product range, made reference to market research into its mail order customers, and described its environmental impact. The full 1992-93 social audit document and process - which cost Pounds 20,000 - goes rather further. It considers its ability to maintain growth in sales and continuity of orders to help producers, the proportion of sales derived from the Third World, and shareholder participation. The picture that emerges is not entirely positive: purchases fell from its profiled region - the Philippines - because of the UK recession, failure to generate sufficient revenues under Traidcraft's minimum target sales and inability by a supplier to deliver a promised product range. It documents concerns by some producers that the company failed to communicate sufficiently. The report on employees raises some concerns about whether the company should pay a greater wage to those at the lower end of the salary scale, and on the ambivalence of non-Christian staff to the company's policy of only allowing Christians to sit on the board. On environmental issues, it admits it has generally been unable to trace products to source to judge whether they are produced sustainably. A three paragraph 'auditor's report' written by the New Economics Foundation is not entirely positive. It says: 'We are satisfied that the (report) . . . offers an adequate basis for understanding key aspects of the social impact and ethical behaviour of Traidcraft in relation to its aims and those of its main stakeholders for the period in question.' But it goes on to endorse the need to continue to develop the social audit method, apply more specific indicators and targets, focus on the effectiveness of lobbying and education work, give further emphasis to environmental aspects and develop additional forms of social book-keeping to ease the audit. Traidcraft admits to a number of difficulties. It stresses that the report will evolve in the future, and that only next year can it begin to assess performance. It argues that it is difficult and dangerous to quantify too far, or to add up different numbers to attempt to produce a single overall figure of social profit or loss. There are, nevertheless, a number of weaknesses in the report. It fails on several occasions to clearly lay out its objectives and then assess them: using a graph which is all but impossible to read to highlight the growth in goods sourced from the Third World, for instance. The report makes little attempt to justify its choice of assessment criteria or show how they are audited - though much evidence according to the 'Auditing the Market' booklet is apparently to be based on discussions with staff - which does not seem appropriate for issues such as how to assess the impact of its educational activities. It often cites highly anecdotal evidence, such as that there has been a 69 per cent increase in the last year on the time spent visiting producers to work on product design and development. This is interesting but smacks of gathering anything available rather than systematic probing. It raises the wider question of how far the profiles of suppliers are always likely to be self-justifying. A producer of handicrafts may sound worthy of support because it also sponsors social welfare programmes in the community. But would the money be spent more productively or efficiently given to another local group whose sole concern was these social issues? In addition, It reflects the inadequacy of any attempts so far to meaningful define 'fair trade' in any but very general terms. That will clearly hamper any effects to genuinely assess the company's effectiveness. More fundamentally, it highlights the fact that even the highly unusual shareholder base is apathetic and happy to let the company do its work. Without active discussion of its objectives, how can Traidcraft effectively debate what its ethical and social priorities should be? Given the difficulties in yet refining its own methodology, let alone its rather unusual shareholder profile, it is also difficult to see many other companies following Traidcraft's lead in the short-term: welcome though that would certainly be. *Auditing the Market, by Simon Zadek and Richard Evans.

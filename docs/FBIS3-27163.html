On 18 Feb, Bosnian Serb leader  Karadzic announced that the process would be completed 24 hours  before the deadline set by NATO's ultimatum. Izetbegovic, the  Bosnian Muslim leader, after a meeting with UN peacekeepers on  18 February, said that the Muslims would also withdraw their  heavy weapons from Sarejevo or place them under the control of  the UN peacekeeping forces from 19 February. He thought that the  crisis in Sarajevo would be concluded very soon. The  above-mentioned conditions hopefully provide some light for a  peaceful settlement of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  which is facing a crucial turning point.    Since NATO issued its ultimatum, which was mainly aimed at  the Bosnian Serbs, and demanded that they withdraw all of their  heavy weapons from an area with a 20-km radius surrounding  Sarajevo by 0000 local time on 21 February, or place those  weapons under the control of UN troops. Bosnian Serb leaders  have repeatedly said they are willing to comply and that they  started the process on 11 February, but that the scale was not  large. According to an estimate by UN troops, the Bosnian Serbs  have about 300 artillery pieces in the Sarajevo area, while the  Muslims have about 150. By 14 February, artillery withdrawn by  both sides or handed to the places specified by UN troops  accounted for only about 10 percent. The Bosnian Serbs moved  slowly, and the main reason was because they thought the  Muslims, who have better infantry, were adjusting their lines in  those areas evacuated by the Serbs; the Muslims were also slow  to withdraw their heavy weapons, and there were differences  between Serb political and military leaders on whether to  continue the withdrawal.    When the Serbs hesitated and entered an impasse with the  West, Churkin, a special envoy sent by Russian President  Yeltsin, again arrived in Belgrade on 16 February carrying with  him a proposal from the president, which said that if the Serbs  withdrew all of their guns or accepted UN supervision, Russia  would participate in the peacekeeping mission in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and would immediately send 400 Russian  peacekeeping troops from Croatia to Sarajevo, and would add  another 400 troops, who would guard positions vacated by the  Serb gunners. This move by Russia satisfies the main demands of  the NATO ultimatum on the one hand, and, on the other hand,  enables the Serbs to have a sense of security and a path to back  off, therefore, it immediately received a general welcome from  various quarters, except the Bosnian Muslims, and it brought  about important factors contributing to the development of  situation.    Can bombing by the West of positions held by the Serbs be  avoided? A spokesman with the UN peacekeeping forces said that  the Serbs had begun a large-scale withdrawal of heavy weapons on  17 February, while some other heavy weapons had been handed over  at five designated points in Sarajevo; the Muslims were also  handing over their heavy weapons at two other designated places,  which would see the arrival of peacekeepers stationed there.  Observers said that the possibility of an air strike had  diminished, but the danger still remained. Although the Serbs  declared that they would complete their withdrawal by 2400 on 19  February, the NATO countries said they would "look at the  results" when the deadline set by the ultimatum expires, and  that "any heavy weapons which have not been withdrawn or placed  under control will be hit immediately." In addition, in the  past, incidents have erupted in Bosnia-Herzegovina at crucial  moments, and the commander of the peacekeeping forces in  Bosnia-Herzegovina has said repeatedly in the past two days that  he was most worried about sudden incidents taking place at this  time. Once vicious incidents erupt, it is difficult to deal with  the situation.    Will NATO really take military action outside its defense  zone for the first time since its founding? Can an air strike  in Bosnia-Herzegovina be avoided? People are watching closely.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Tiphook plans name change Tiphook, the debt-laden transport leasing group, wants to change its name to the Central Transport Rental Group and be known as CTR. A resolution to adopt the new name will be put to shareholders at the next annual general meeting, expected in September. In March Tiphook confirmed the sale of the group's biggest asset, its container business, to Transamerica, the US financial services group. It was paid Pounds 673m then and may receive a further Pounds 49m from the deal, subject to a completion audit. Tiphook, which had debts of more than Pounds 1bn before the sale, had warned that its survival depended on the disposal.</p>

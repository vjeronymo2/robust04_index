			<p>BFN     [Text] Osaka, April 1 KYODO -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister  Begum Khaleda Zia flew out of Osaka on Friday [1 April], capping  a five-day official visit to Japan.    In summit talks with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in  Tokyo on Tuesday, Zia was quoted as offering to drum up support  for Japan's bid to become a permanent member of the United  Nations Security Council. The 48-year-old premier said  Bangladesh's support stems from its belief "that the leadership  and positive posture of Japan are important for further  strengthening the role of Asia in international relations."    During her visit, Japan pledged to extend a 23 billion yen  official aid package to Bangladesh, Foreign Ministry officials  said.    The pledge, covering two projects, was formalized in a  ceremony to exchange notes between Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata  and Bangladesh Finance Minister Saifur Rahman, the officials  said.</p>

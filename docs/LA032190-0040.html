			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BRODERICK HELD FOR ARRAIGNMENT IN MURDER CASE;  </P> <P> CRIME: JUDGE SAYS THERE IS ENOUGH CAUSE TO BELIEVE DIVORCEE IS GUILTY OF  SHOOTING HER EX-HUSBAND AND HIS NEW WIFE.  </P> <P> Betty Broderick, the former wife of a prominent San Diego malpractice attorney,  was ordered Tuesday to appear April 3 in Superior Court to be arraigned on  charges that she murdered her ex-husband and his new wife.  </P> <P> Municipal Judge E. Mac Amos Jr. said that less than 1 1/2 days of testimony had  established sufficient cause to believe that the 42-year-old divorcee is guilty  of shooting Daniel T. Broderick III and his wife, Linda, as they slept in the  early morning of Nov. 5. Amos also ordered that Betty Broderick continue to be  held without bail.  </P> <P> "It's clear that the homicide was committed from the evidence that I heard and  that the defendant committed the killings," he said, adding that he was denying  a bail request from Broderick's lawyer because "I am very concerned about the  defendant's mental stability."  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells said she will disclose at the arraignment  whether she will seek the death penalty.  </P> <P> Amos' rulings were the final step in what was a brief but emotional preliminary  hearing. On Monday, seven witnesses had taken the stand, each of them  elaborating on Betty Broderick's state of mind before, during and after she  allegedly emptied her .38-caliber, five-shot revolver into her ex-husband's  darkened bedroom, ripped a telephone out of the wall and fled.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the prosecution called its final witness, Ronnie Brown, a friend  whom Broderick called on the day of the shootings. Brown merely repeated what  previous witnesses had said about Broderick's "distraught" state of mind that  day, when she went to her daughter's Pacific Beach apartment, calling friends  and family, before contacting an attorney and turning herself in.  </P> <P> According to Broderick's boyfriend, Bradley T. Wright, and to her two  college-age daughters, Kim and Lee, Betty had made no secret of her hatred for  the slain couple, who she maintained had begun an affair while she and Daniel  were still married. Broderick frequently had said she wanted to kill Daniel and  Linda, they said, and in recent months has admitted committing the murders.  </P> <P> After testimony was completed Tuesday, Jack Earley, Broderick's lawyer, asked  Amos to set bail, claiming that his client was not a threat and would not flee.  </P> <P> "Ms. Broderick did turn herself in. She had an opportunity to leave, and she  did not avail herself of the opportunity," he said, adding that, if freed on  bail, she could aid in her own defense by sifting through the voluminous paper  work associated with the Brodericks' lengthy, complicated divorce.  </P> <P> "It's very difficult for her to be able to defend herself while she is in  custody," Earley said.  </P> <P> But Wells countered that Broderick was indeed a threat -- even to Wells  herself.  </P> <P> "The evidence has shown, at least to a limited extent, the defendant had a  significant long-term hatred for the victims in this case and she ultimately  killed them," Wells said. "She is still filled with hate, and she has directed  that hate toward other members of the community."  </P> <P> Wells submitted a letter, written in Broderick's hand, that she said threatened  Wells herself. To give the court "a flavor" of the defendant's attitude, Wells  then read from a handful of letters Broderick has written from jail.  </P> <P> One letter accuses Larry Broderick, Daniel's brother and the court-appointed  guardian of the Brodericks' two minor sons, of kidnaping the boys.  </P> <P> "Right after this happened, my husband's brother went to court with no notice  to me and seized physical custody of my youngest two children and whisked them  off to Colorado and is telling them they will never see or speak to me again,"  Wells read, quoting Broderick. "I think I've heard this tune before! Even  though my husband is gone, his friends are still here and if anything, my  husband's influence in legal circles has grown."  </P> <P> In some letters, Betty called Larry Broderick "scum . . . the exact words she  used to describe her ex-husband," Wells said. "If she is released from custody  . . . there are other people out there that she might do bodily harm to."  </P> <P> Amos denied the bail request. He also denied Earley's request that he continue  the hearing to give Earley time to refile several subpoenas. Earley had sought  to subpoena Daniel Broderick's bank records, but had executed the documents  improperly, making them invalid. Amos said that Earley should feel free to  refile the subpoenas, but that he did not see how the victim's finances would  be relevant to the defense's case.  </P> <P> Earley later questioned the fairness of the ruling, noting that the prosecution  had successfully subpoenaed Broderick's bank statements. Earley said the ruling  indicated "there's going to be a number of things that are uphill battles. If  she does something, it's going to have to be 100% by the book."  </P> <P> He also said he will probably file disqualification motions against the bench  at the arraignment.  </P></p>

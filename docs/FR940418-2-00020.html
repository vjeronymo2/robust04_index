			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> As explained above, in Certain Steel from Austria, when the company producing steel was restructured, we found that a benefit to the new company arose because the new company did not receive any of the losses accumulated by the former company. There was no specific act of payment or loss coverage undertaken by the Government of Austria to eliminate those losses as part of the restructuring. Instead, the losses were simply left behind in the former company. In Certain Steel from Austria, these losses left in the ``shell'' company were determined to be countervailable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, in the case of restructuring TAS into the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA, the liabilities and losses left behind in TAS have been found to give rise to a benefit to ILVA. There was one specific act of debt forgiveness between Finsider and TAS. That was accounted for in our calculations, but only as a part of the totality of the restructuring action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We further believe that the snapshot approach has fully captured the benefit to the subject merchandise. Based primarily on the annual reports of IRI, Finsider and TAS, petitioners have developed a long list of ``subsidies'' that include IRI's forgiveness of Finsider's debt and numerous and varied forms of payments to TAS throughout and subsequent to the restructuring. We have concluded that countervailing subsidies from IRI to Finsider and from Finsider to TAS would lead to an overstatement of the benefit. (See DOC response to Comment 2.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the subsidies received by TAS after the second asset transfer to ILVA (e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  interest paid to TAS on its shares in ILVA, capital gain on real estate received by TAS, etc.), we recognize that these payments did, in fact, reduce the liabilities in TAS. However, because we included in the restructuring benefit the amount of liabilities remaining in TAS after the second transfer, we have already captured the benefits from these subsidies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is similar to the situation that occurred in Certain Steel from Austria. As discussed above, we treated as a subsidy the amount of losses left behind in the former company, without regard to whether there was a specific act by the government to cover those losses. In fact, the Government of Austria did make a payment a few years later to that company. Recognizing that the second transaction was basically to clean up the company's books for an event that had occurred earlier (the failure to transfer losses), we did not countervail the payment by the Government of Austria as it would have amounted to double-counting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, petitioners misuse the concept of cash flow effect when they argue that this concept prohibits us from using a snapshot approach. Cash flow effects do not identify subsidies. Instead, the cash flow concept tells us when to assign the benefit from a particular subsidy. For example, the cash flow concept tells us to assign the benefits received from a subsidized loan to the point in time when the company would have made the interest payment because this is when the company's cash flow is affected. In this case, the effect on ILVA of not assuming TAS' liabilities and losses occurred when the assets were transferred, in 1989 and 1990, and we have assigned the benefits to these years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners argue that the Department did not directly address the question of the benefit to the Finsider group as a whole, and through the Finsider group to TAS, of a multi-billion lire debt forgiveness provided in connection with the 1988/90 steel industry restructuring. The only debt forgiveness that was included in the Department's preliminary calculations was the 99.9 billion lire in debt forgiveness provided to TAS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners claim that the Department should countervail a debt forgiveness in the amount of 6.2 trillion lire to the Finsider Group in 1988 and allocate the resulting benefit over a sales denominator reflecting the scope of operations of the Finsider companies that were liquidated and merged into ILVA. Moreover, petitioners argue that the Department should countervail the 99.9 billion lire debt forgiveness provided specifically to TAS in 1989 as a separate benefit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondents argue that petitioners have failed to establish that the forgiveness of Finsider's debt is tied to the subject merchandise. Respondents argue that the 1988 debt forgiveness to Finsider pre-dates the restructuring of Finsider into ILVA by nearly one year. Thus, Finsider at the time of the debt forgiveness was not the same company as it was when its assets were transferred into ILVA. Respondents maintain that Finsider and TAS existed and functioned as two separate corporate entities and, therefore, argue that TAS was never potentially responsible for the assumption of Finsider's debt. Respondents assert that only the 99.9 billion lire debt forgiveness provided directly to TAS should be treated as a countervailable debt forgiveness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the early stages of this investigation, it became clear to us that there were two alternative approaches to addressing the allegations in the petition regarding subsidies to the producers of electrical steel. One approach would have been to analyze the restructuring of the entire Finsider group into ILVA and to examine all subsidies provided to Finsider by IRI and the GOI. Using this approach we would, in essence, be measuring subsidies provided to the Finsider group as a whole. Therefore, we would not have allocated subsidies to any of the group's operating companies, such as TAS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second approach would measure the subsidies provided to the producer of the subject merchandise. In other words, our analysis would focus on subsidies such as equity infusions, loans, and grants specifically provided to the producer of the subject merchandise,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Terni/TAS and the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

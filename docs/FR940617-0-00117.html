			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) The engine otherwise included in (1)(iii) remains or will remain at a location for more than 12 consecutive months, or a shorter period of time where such period is representative of normal annual source operation at a stationary source that resides at a fixed location for more than 12 months (e.g., seasonal operations such as canning facilities.) A location is any site at a building, structure, facility, or installation. Any engine (or engines) that replaces an engine at a location and that is intended to perform the same or similar function as the engine replaced will be included in calculating the consecutive time period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A portable generator engine which functions as a permanent back-up generator and which is replaced by a different engine (or engines) that performs the same function would be an example of engines covered by (2)(iii). In such a case, the cumulative residence time of both generators, including the time between removal of the original engine and installation of the replacement, would be counted toward the consecutive residence time period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intended the revised definition of nonroad engines to address concerns expressed by the commenters in response to the definition originally proposed. Under the revised definition, an internal combustion engine would be a nonroad engine if it is used in equipment that is self-propelled or intended to be propelled while performing its function, or if it is portable or transportable. The revised definition specifically distinguishes between nonroad engines and stationary internal combustion engines on the basis of engine mobility and residence time, rather than on horsepower size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intended that stationary internal combustion engines be all internal combustion engines regulated by a federal New Source Performance Standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act and all internal combustion engines that are neither nonroad engines nor engines used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition. Moreover, the revised definition specifically states that portable and transportable engines remaining in a particular location for over 12 months are not nonroad engines (this excludes engines in self-propelled equipment and equipment intended to be propelled while performing its intended function), thus ensuring that engines that are actually used in a stationary manner are considered stationary engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised nonroad engine definition excluded from nonroad regulation those engines that are used for normal annual source operations at fixed stationary sources that only operate on a seasonal basis, such as canneries. This provision is designed to ensure that engines that operate as integral parts of these stationary sources are considered stationary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised nonroad engine definition also included a provision that if an engine is replaced by another engine within the 12 month period, the replacement engine should be considered in calculating the consecutive time period. This provision is designed to ensure that where an internal combustion engine is necessary for the operation of a stationary facility, the replacement of one particular engine with another would not prevent the engines from being included as part of the stationary facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

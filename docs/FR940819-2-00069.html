			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In February 1981, the Federal Reserve established procedures to assist depository institutions with clearing arrangements at Reserve Banks, recognizing that the maintenance of an account relationship is necessary for (a) depository institutions that do not maintain reserve accounts but desire direct access to some or all Federal Reserve priced services and (b) depository institutions that do maintain a reserve account but find the reserve balance inadequate for their transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because clearing balances were established as a result of depository institutions wanting access to Federal Reserve priced services, it was determined that investment earnings attributable to clearing balances should be ascribed to the System's priced service operations, comparable to the use of these balances by other service providers. The 1982 annual financial report of the Federal Reserve reflected these earnings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This priced service revenue factor, net income on clearing balances (NICB), is the difference between the income the Federal Reserve imputes on clearing balances held with the Federal Reserve System, less imputed reserve requirements, and the priced services cost of earnings credits granted to depository institutions, net of expired earnings credits. (Appendix A illustrates the current NICB calculation.) The private sector recognizes revenue from these balances in a similar way.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1982, under its delegated authority rules, the Board approved a rate of return equivalent to the yield on the short-term assets included in the System Open Market Account portfolio for calculating clearing balance income. The Federal Reserve selected the 90-day Treasury bill coupon equivalent yield to impute income on clearing balances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A primary benefit of the 90-day Treasury rate, which is still used today, is that its yield is equivalent to the yield on short-term assets currently included in the Federal Reserve's System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio. Additionally, use of the short-term 90-day rate was viewed as more closely approximating what would have been realized had clearing balance funds been held and invested by a private business firm. Lastly, Treasury yield data are available to the public. This allows the earnings calculation to be replicated by the private sector.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Reserve System recently reviewed the methodology used to impute income on clearing balances to determine the comparability of Federal Reserve practices in this area with practices of correspondent banks. A telephone survey of bank holding companies was conducted to determine the types of assets in which correspondent banks invest clearing balance funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Survey results showed that, although correspondent banks pay earnings credits based on a short-term rate (90-day Treasury bill), their investment of clearing balance funds is determined by the economic environment, their risk policies, and investment opportunities available. The survey participants identified a range of investment options including, loans, securities, and overnight funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It was observed that correspondent banks may exercise a broad range of investment opportunities whereas the Federal Reserve has adopted a more restrictive practice. Since Reserve Bank imputed investments do not reflect correspondent bank practices, the approach is inconsistent with other areas of priced service accounting. Other areas of priced service accounting either draw on actual Reserve Bank costs, or are imputed based on BHC data. More important, over time, by computing clearing balance income in the current fashion, the Federal Reserve may be understating clearing balance revenue, increasing costs of Federal Reserve priced services, and setting prices higher than necessary to promote effective competition and efficient payment services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal under consideration by the Board of Governors is to determine the maturity structure of short-, intermediate-, and long-term securities assets from the BHC model and impute income based on published matching term Treasury yields. The Board is considering the BHC structure/Treasury yields method because it promotes competitive equity with private sector practices by matching the maturity structure for investment of clearing balances to the structure revealed in bank holding company data on investments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One problem with attempting to match the earnings realized by bank holding companies is that the risk premium for the private sector is difficult to manage and approximate. Also, the Federal Reserve could not determine administrative costs from available data. Therefore, the Board believes that the Treasury rate provides a reasonable proxy for the actual rate realized by bank holding companies on clearing balances, without the risk premium associated with holding company investments and administrative costs incurred managing portfolio risk. Bank holding company maturity structures and Treasury yields are publicly available so that the NICB calculation can be replicated by the private sector. The recommended approach provides longer term investments, which would produce higher earnings, assuming an upward sloping yield curve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed NICB Computation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An estimate of NICB is prepared annually. Under the recommended methodology, selected earning assets include Federal funds, repurchase agreements, and securities. These investments were chosen because they most closely represent the Treasury function investments of the private sector. The earning assets maturity structure of the BHC model would be defined as follows: less than one year (short-term), one -to -five years (intermediate-term) and greater than five years (long-term). The maturity structure would be calculated from the most recent four quarters of Y9 data. The Y9 is a quarterly BHC report filed with the Federal Reserve and is generally available to the public 50 to 60 days after the close of the quarter. For example, four quarters for 1992 would be used for the 1994 earnings rate estimate, which would be calculated in the fall of 1993. Similarly, 1992 BHC data are used for the 1994 PSAF calculation. Historical rates are used because the Board has decided in previous instances to avoid the appearance of forecasting interest rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Published matching-term Treasury yields would be applied to the maturity percentages and summed to develop the earnings rate. The Board intends initially to use shorter term Treasury rates. In this regard, a three-month Treasury yield would be used for the short-term rate maturity portion. A one- year Treasury yield would be used for the intermediate-term, and a five-year Treasury yield would be applied for the long-term portions. Current year-to-date (approximately four months) week-ending average Treasury yields from the Federal Reserve H.15 Statistical Release would be used for the estimate. The recommended maturity structure and applicable Treasury yields are shown below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,tp0,i1,s30,r20,r30 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1BHC  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> maturity structure  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> (A) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Treasury  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> yield (B) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Weighted average rate (AxB) <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> % Investment &lt; 1 year  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> lThree- <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> month  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> &blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;%  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> % Investments 1&hyph;5 years  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> lOne- <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> year  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> &blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;%  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> % Investment 5+ years  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Five- <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> year  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> &blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;% <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=02 g=1 f=1 --> Total <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Weighted average estimated rate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Actual NICB results are imputed monthly.

The week-ending average yields, as published in the Federal Reserve H.15 Statistical Release, would be used to calculate the monthly rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / People: Morgan and Thomas to put steel into GM Firth Peter Morgan, 58, who steps down as director general of the Institute of Directors in July, is teaming up with Sir Alan Thomas, head of the government's defence sales organisation, to try and revitalise the fortunes of GM Firth (Holdings), the small Wakefield-based engineering company with a turbulent past. Morgan, who spent 30 years with IBM before being headhunted for the IoD job in 1989, has been appointed a non-executive director of GM Firth (Holdings). The loss-making group, currently capitalised at Pounds 14.5m, recently had a Pounds 4m rights issue to repair its balance sheet and announced that Sir Alan Thomas, 51, a former Raytheon executive, would take over as executive chairman in July when he finished his MoD job. The two men go back a long way together. They both hail from Wales, made their names in computers and have more than a passing knowledge of the steel business. Morgan's first job was programming computers for the Steel Company of Wales and he came to know Sir Alan during his IBM days because Sir Alan's Data-Logic was an important IBM customer. Having sold his company to Raytheon, Sir Alan continued as a senior Raytheon executive. They took up their posts at the IoD and the MoD at the same time. Morgan is a non-executive director of South Wales Electricity and National Provident, and is also an adviser to Apax Partners, the venture capital firm.</p>

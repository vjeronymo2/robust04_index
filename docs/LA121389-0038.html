			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDS TRADE TIM LEARY TO THE YANKEES  </P> <P> The New York Yankees, whose 4.50 earned-run average was the second-worst in  baseball last season behind Detroit, acquired former Dodger right-hander Tim  Leary from the Cincinnati Reds for two minor leaguers Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Yankees sent outfielder Hal Morris and right-hander Rodney Imes to the Reds  for Leary and minor-league outfielder Van Snider.  </P> <P> Leary, 8-14 in 1989 with a 3.52 ERA, will join Andy Hawkins and Pascual Perez  in the Yankee rotation.  </P> <P> Leary, 31, is 45-56 lifetime. He was 17-11 with a 2.91 ERA in 1988 but was 6-7  last July 18 when the Dodgers traded him to Cincinnati along with Mariano  Duncan for Kal Daniels and Lenny Harris. Leary was 2-7 in 14 starts for the  Reds with a 3.71 ERA.  </P> <P> "It gets real defeating when you come out of a game losing 2-1 and the chances  are 90% you're going to get a loss," Leary said.  </P></p>

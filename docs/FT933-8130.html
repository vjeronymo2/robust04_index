			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Abbey sells estate agency chain ABBEY NATIONAL is selling its 347-branch Cornerstone estate agency chain for less than one-tenth of the price per outlet paid by many buyers in the late 1980s. The sale will end a six-year venture into estate agency which has cost the UK bank an estimated Pounds 258m (Dollars 384m). Abbey is selling Cornerstone for Pounds 8m to two chartered surveyors who are backed by Provident Life, the life insurance company. The deal will create the UK's largest independently-owned chain of estate agents. The sale price is equal to Pounds 23,000 per agency, against about Pounds 250,000 per branch paid in the housing boom of the late 1980s as mortgage lenders and life companies competed to build up distribution arms. Abbey will still operate mortgage selling units in 50 of the Cornerstone branches. Lex, Page 14</p>

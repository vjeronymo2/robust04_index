			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: PERFECTDATA TO SPEND $100,000 IN BUYBACK PLAN  </P> <P> PerfectData Corp., a Simi Valley maker of computer maintenance supplies, said  it set aside $100,000 to repurchase its stock in an effort to boost the stock's  price.  </P> <P> PerfectData's stock traded Monday at a bid price of 44 cents a share; at that  price, $100,000 would buy about 227,272 shares, about 7% of its total shares  outstanding.  </P> <P> The company approved the repurchase because "three consecutive successful  quarters have apparently gone unnoticed by the investment community" and failed  to bolster the stock, PerfectData President Lee R. Mannheimer said in a  statement.  </P> <P> Separately, PerfectData said it acquired the assets of Coverware Co. of San  Diego, which makes computer and office equipment dust covers. Terms were not  disclosed. PerfectData also hired Coverware's former president, Robert Miller,  as product manager.  </P></p>

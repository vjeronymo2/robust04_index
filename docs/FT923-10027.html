			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Think cheap when you choose a company car THE INLAND Revenue had some dispiriting news for Britain's executives this week. From now on, it seems, the rule of thumb when choosing a company car will be - go for the cheapest. Many drivers could gain if proposals to reform income tax treatment for company cars - contained in a new consultative paper - are enacted. Tax bills could be cut by as much as 30 per cent, although some may go up by more than 40 per cent. The reforms will not operate until the beginning of the 1994-95 tax year at the earliest, and the Revenue could yet make changes. But if you are choosing a company car in the next few months, it would be foolish not to bear these plans in mind. The present system lumps cars into broad bands according to their engine size if their price is below Pounds 19,250. The new rules would tax cars entirely on their price, and would have far more bands. There are, however, several ways in which price could be assessed. At present, the Revenue favours the manufacturer's retail list price, but other possibilities include the cost to the employer and the original market value. Some accountants, including Martin Myerscough of Arthur Andersen, also are worried that the new administrative burdens on companies, and the costly consequences of making mistakes, will discourage some from offering company cars altogether - heaping further gloom onto Britain's executives. Precise gains and losses cannot be determined until the new rules are more definite. But those affected worst are likely to be drivers of cars with engines just below two litres and which fall just within the Pounds 19,455 limit. Tax bills for them could increase by up to 40 per cent, but they have been benefiting from the present system. Shed a tear, also, for executives with cars costing between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 60,000. Their tax could increase by around 35 per cent. If your company has bought you a cheap but powerful car, such as a Vauxhall Astra or Ford Fiesta, expect to benefit by anything up to 25 per cent. All the precise details will be announced in the Budget next March. Several experts are hoping for changes, as well as extra detail, by then but Clive Tulloch, tax partner with accountant Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said the Revenue had missed several opportunities to remove anomalies in the system. He pointed out that the proportion of the scale charge on a car which individuals must pay will still be based on their business mileage. This is bad news for those with very high annual distances covered who need their cars most. According to Tulloch, those with annual business mileages of somewhere between 12,000 and 15,000 miles at the bottom, and 17,999 at the top, would be better off taking additional cash from their employer and buying their own car.</p>

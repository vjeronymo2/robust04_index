			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Tribunal showed race bias The woman who chaired an industrial tribunal showed bias and acted irregularly in her handling of a case brought by a college lecturer of Asian origin, the Employment Appeal Tribunal has ruled. The Commission for Racial Equality said the appeal judgment demonstrated the need for specialist tribunals to deal with race-discrimination cases. The claim was brought in November 1990 before the London South Industrial Tribunal by Mr Minya Laher, a senior lecturer in financial management at Westminster College, London. He claimed that his failure to be shortlisted for two teaching posts at another college amounted to racial discrimination. The tribunal, chaired by Mrs Stella Hollis, dismissed his claim. However, Mr Justice Morison said Mrs Hollis had shown bias and acted irregularly by denying Mr Laher the opportunity to explore evidence. She was also criticised for querying whether Mr Laher could speak English properly. Mr Herman Ouseley, CRE chairman, said the case vindicated the commission's concerns about tribunals in race cases. 'The commission has long advocated the need for specialist tribunals in discrimination cases. This case demonstrates that adjudication in such cases requires special skills and good cross-cultural understanding.'</p>

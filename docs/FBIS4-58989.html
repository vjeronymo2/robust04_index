			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: The U.S. Administration is expected to  resume its efforts in the Middle East early next week with a new  tour by its chief diplomat, Warren Christopher, in order to  clear the way for the resumption of the Washington bilateral  negotiations. It is natural that the resumption of the  negotiations should be linked with the degree of seriousness in  Israel's answers to the basic questions Secretary of State  Christopher carried from Damascus after he held detailed talks  with President Hafiz al-Asad.    It is also natural that progress or stalemate in the peace  process should be linked to real change in Israel's position.  No one would disagree that the establishment of peace needs  action rather than sweet talk on the importance of and the need  for achieving that peace. The U.S. Administration has sensed  Syria's true intentions, and President Bill Clinton has not  concealed this. Moreover, he has reiterated on many occasions  his belief in Syria's credible position and its serious trend  toward peace. Christopher did the same during his tour of the  region last week.    Syria's concern for pushing the peace process forward,  however, does not at all mean any relinquishment of its  constants or any bargaining over territory, rights, and  sovereignty. These are matters that Syria will never reconsider  under any circumstances. President Bill Clinton's  administration, as well as Israel, knows this fact.    Total withdrawal from Golan is the basis for negotiations on  the Syrian track. This occupied Syrian territory should return  completely to the motherland, as it used to be before the June  aggression of 1967. Syria's right to sovereignty over its  territory is a fact that cannot, and will not be bypassed. What  applies to Golan also applies to the occupied part of southern  Lebanon and to Jordanian territories occupied by Israel. Hence,  the importance of continued coordination among the Arab parties  involved in the peace process. This coordination will be a  guarantee for the Arabs and will constitute a weapon that will  enable them to regain their usurped rights and their occupied  territories and to avoid the Israeli trap of unilateral deals  and partial settlements.    Experience has shown that such settlements will not achieve  peace, but will undermine the chances of achieving a  comprehensive and just peace. The best example is the  disappointment of the Palestinians in the occupied Arab  territories following the signing of the fragile self-rule  accord, which will keep the Palestinian people subject to  Israel's mercy and domination.    Syria is working to establish a comprehensive peace and  durable peace that will not create disappointments. Such a  peace cannot be achieved without the implementation of the  relevant UN resolutions and the land-for-peace principle, which  former President George Bush's administration proposed, and on  which the Madrid conference was launched under the U.S. and  Russian sponsorship, and to which current President Clinton's  administration committed itself after pledging to play a fair  and complete partner in the peace process.    Those who seek such a peace will find every cooperation from  Syria. But if talk about peace is merely an Israeli maneuver,  no new tour by Washington will achieve anything to save the  peace process from the crisis in which the Israeli rulers have  placed it.    Syria has repeatedly asserted that peace falls within the  strategy it has adopted for many years. But the other side,  Israel, has been talking about peace at a time when it places  obstacles, mines, and thorns on the road. Today, we say that  the opportunity to achieve peace is available if intentions are  sincere and if statements turn into action on the ground.  Otherwise, the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace  will remain out of reach. This fact will be sensed by the head  of U.S. diplomacy, Warren Christopher, when he returns to the  Middle East. He should deal with facts and deeds to succeed in  his new mission and so that the peace process can witness a real  move toward its desired goal.</p>

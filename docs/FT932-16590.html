			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Economics Notebook: UK industrial policy set to enter a new era NOW that the UK government has extricated itself from the coal debacle, we can expect the Department of Trade and Industry to start playing a more prominent part in the economic life of the country. In the weeks ahead, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is likely to disclose more of his ideas for increasing industry's competitiveness in line with the government's new-found commitment to support manu- facturing. The DTI is maintaining a resolute silence about Mr Heseltine's plans. But those who fear that his pledge at last year's Conservative party conference to intervene to help British companies 'before breakfast, before lunch, before tea and before dinner' means the UK is returning to discredited industrial policies of the 1970s may be in for a surprise. Let there be no mistake. Mr Heseltine is an interventionist by the standards of the 1980s. He is busy establishing a new dialogue with industry that will lead to relatively frequent round-table discussions with top UK businessmen over industry's strategic goals. He prevailed on the Treasury in last year's Autumn Statement and last month's Budget to provide more support for exporters. But this need not mean that the government is about to re-enter the business of trying to pick winners or support ailing industries or companies. It can be argued that his solution to the coal crisis was the minimum consistent with the will of Parliament. Mr Heseltine's refusal to mount a rescue for the UK operations of the Leyland-Daf commercial vehicle group suggests that he has no ambitions to revive the DTI as a rescuer of lame ducks. Indeed, Mr Walter Eltis, who became Mr Heseltine's chief economic adviser last year, recently provided a timely reminder that a well-run macro-economic policy can be far more important for the future welfare of industry than any amount of specific support organised by the DTI. Delivering the Esmee Fairbairn Lecture at Lancaster University, Mr Eltis explained how three main handicaps had caused British manufacturing industry to fall behind that of Germany and Japan. In his view, UK industry: has been inadequately profitable to cover interest costs; has had to live with 'extraordinary volatility' of government policy, and; has allowed trade unions to influence the way companies are run to too great an extent. In his lecture (which was given last November but published only last month), Mr Eltis identified the relative lack of profitability as the achilles heel of UK industry. Figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris show that despite some recovery, the UK business sector's net operating surplus (the surplus of net company income over wages and bought-in inputs) as a percentage of net capital stock consistently lagged that of the UK's leading industrial trading partners in the 1980s. The upshot has been an industrial sector that has less financial margin for error, that lives in fear of its financiers and which is less able than foreign rivals to develop and market world-beating products. That the UK's company bosses have been obliged to spend their time on finance, avoiding bankruptcy, negotiating with trade unions and government and dealing with take-overs and mergers also explains the dominance of accountants among their ranks. Mr Eltis says government has a vital role to play in resolving this state of affairs. But the role he prescribes might surprise those who see the DTI as a potential hot-bed of intervention in company affairs. He argues that the predictability and stability of the macro-economic environment can swing the balance between success and failure for companies. In addition, the structure of taxation and public expenditure can have 'a vital impact on industrial relations and the freedom with which managements can achieve and finance higher productivity and faster economic growth'. These appear to be big claims for a policy that seems reminiscent of the 'hands-off' approach to industry pursued in the Thatcher years. But Mr Eltis provides some persuasive arguments to support his case. It is precisely because average profitability is low in British industry that the predictability and stability of the cash flow to be expected from investments are especially important. Government must therefore achieve low inflation and control its borrowing. Financial markets punish failures with higher interest rates and currency movements that can wipe out profits on longer term contracts. Mr Eltis cites research from the mid-1980s by Mr Sushil Wadhwani, now an economist with Goldman Sachs in London, to the effect that each 1 per cent addition to the inflation rate adds almost 6 per cent to the number of company insolvencies in the UK. The importance of controlling government expenditure and limiting the impact of taxation on individuals and companies can be seen in the UK's greatly improved industrial relations, last Friday's transport strikes notwithstanding. Real wages and profits grew strongly in UK industry in the 1980s, creating an environment where employees and manufacturers could gain from co-operation. Such a scenario would have been less likely if the state had channelled most of the increase in national income into the public sector. The government's industrial policy, when finally disclosed, will contain all manner of specific measures that will be battened on to its increasingly pro-business macro-economic stance. Some, such as the abolition of the car tax, were introduced in the Autumn Statement. Others, such as the real freeze on business rates, came in the Budget. There is still much to do by way of cutting red tape and enabling small companies to grow. In his lecture, Mr Eltis was not speaking for his boss. But it would be unusual if Mr Heseltine were to turn against a philosophy in which government facilitates the growth and recovery of manufacturing rather than force-feeding it. Industrial policy in the 1990s may therefore see the Treasury and DTI in harmony rather than at loggerheads.</p>

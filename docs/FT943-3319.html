			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: P&amp;O pleases P&amp;O was outstanding in the transport sector, jumping 21 to 674p on the back of significantly better than expected half-year results. The shares moved to 675p in heavy early morning volume but eased back on modest profit-taking. The six-month performance was above the top end of most brokers' estimates, rising strongly to Pounds 126.4m before tax on the back of rapid expansion on the shipping side. The results, together with an upbeat management statement, led analysts to rapidly revise upwards their projections for full-year profits. To take one example, UBS is now pitching for Pounds 360m pre-tax for 1994, up from earlier projections of Pounds 320m. A surprised stock market described the buying as 'serious' and trading volume topped 2.9m shares. According to traders, it begins to look as though P&amp;O's heavy capital spending of recent years is finally bearing fruit. Elsewhere, airports group BAA moved ahead 10 to 493p following the announcement of a 6.4 per cent advance in passenger volume for August.</p>

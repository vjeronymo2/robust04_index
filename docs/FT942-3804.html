			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / International Company News: Outokumpu in FM1.2bn share offer Outokumpu, the Finnish mining and metals group, has launched a FM1.2bn (Dollars 217m) international share offer on the back of a sharp improvement in profits in the first four months. The Finnish state is also selling part of its stake in the company to raise FM400m. The moves give further impetus to the Finnish privatisation programme and will reduce state ownership in Outokumpu to as little as 38.2 per cent from 50.1 per cent. Outokumpu and the state will offer 18m A shares, increasing to 21.3m shares if there is strong demand. All shares will carry warrants, giving subscribers the right to acquire one additional share for every six warrants before June 28 1996. The offer is mainly aimed at international institutions, although there will also be a Finnish retail tranche. Proceeds will be used to strengthen Outokumpu's balance sheet, lifting its equity-to-assets ratio towards a targeted 40 per cent from 28.7 per cent at the end of April. It will also help finance investments in the group's base metals and stainless steel businesses. The offer will be marketed in the second half of June, and pricing fixed in early July. Global co-ordinator is S. G. Warburg Securities. Kleinwort Benson Securities, Merrill Lynch International and Prospectus/Kansallis-Banking-Group are co-lead managers. This will be Outokumpu's third share issue in little more than a year and comes on the back of a strengthening financial performance and rising metals prices. The group lifted pre-tax profits to FM304m from FM21m in the first four months of 1994, despite a 4.8 per cent fall in net sales to FM5.51bn. Improving market conditions, rationalisation and reduced debt are expected to maintain the better trend over the rest of the year. Outokumpu's shares fell FM6.60 to FM85.20 on Friday.</p>

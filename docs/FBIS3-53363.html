			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fayzah Sa'd] </F>   [Text] Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi has appointed 10  financial advisers in charge of protecting the regime's wealth  and oil revenues. Al-Qadhdhafi selected Central Bank Governor  'Abd-al-Hafiz Salatini as a top adviser. Al-Salatini is to be  assisted by 'Umar al-Manshi; 'Abd-al-'Ati al-'Ubaydi; Sadiq  Hajjaji, the president of the Arab-Hellenic Bank in Milano; and  Sulayman al-Shuhumi, under secretary at the Unity Ministry. The  five men are busy transferring Libyan assets in European banks  to private accounts.    The value of these assets have been estimated at $3 billion  and were withdrawn in cash and taken in bags to Libya. Some  funds have been transferred to secret accounts in Swiss banks  and some to personal bank accounts in Luxembourg, Cyprus, and  Lebanon.    ROSE AL-YUSUF has learned that the transfer of Libyan funds  is not only taking place due to the UN Security Council  resolution freezing Libyan assets abroad but also due to the  current power struggle in Libya between supporters of  Abd-al-Salam Jallud and those of al-Qadhdhafi.    Transfers to accounts held by supporters of both men were  made as a measure of their loyalties to the country's strongmen.  It is expected that Libyan oil exports will be affected due to  the ongoing power struggle. The roads running though the oil  fields are no longer safe. Colonel Sa'id 'Uwaydat al-Qadhdhafi,  commander of the Seventh Division stationed in Zahunah, has been  ordered to move some of his units to al-Yarta'ah to protect oil  shipping docks from possible attacks by clan militia. Some  public transportation buses lately came under attacks involving  robbery and murder.</p>

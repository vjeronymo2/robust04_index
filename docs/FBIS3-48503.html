The Chinese administration on auto imports says that  1,346 Korean automobiles were sold through official channels for  14.1 million U.S. dollars in January-September last year,  according to industry sources Monday.    In the nine months, the Chinese bought 58,660 Japanese  vehicles, the highest figure, followed by Russian vehicles at  39,651, German at 33,774, French at 20,589 and American at  6,184. Italy placed low with 1,224 vehicles. The Korean share  of the Chinese import market was 2.3 percent of the Japanese  share and 21.8 percent of the U.S. share. The real number of  Korean vehicles sold in China last year is assumed to be nearly  50,000 (new and used), the sources said.    The Chinese Government bans imports of completely assembled  automobiles in principle but legally purchases nearly 200,000 a  year with a 180 percent to 220 percent tax by barter or for  official use. It is estimated that 500,000 to 600,000 foreign  automobiles are imported by China through legal and illegal  channels each year.    The Chinese Government partly allowed private dealers to  import vehicles in January, lowered the tax to 80 percent  minimum and gave a quotas by country. Since it has decided to  exclude from the quotas nations continuing to export to the  Chinese market through illegal channels, Korean automakers must  find new ways to sell in China, a source said.</p>

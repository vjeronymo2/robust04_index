			<p>BFN     [Text] The situation is dramatic in Rwanda where fighting  with heavy weaponry continued last night around the Meridien  Hotel, Kigali where fighters of the Rwandan Patriotic Front  [RPF] are encamped. The RPF not only refuse to recognize the  government set up by close aides of assassinated President  Juvenal Habyarimana but they are currently marching on Kigali  to, according to them, stop the carnage by government forces.  As I said earlier, it was initially thought that a cease-fire  was possible between the two parties but in reality that is not  so. The RPF's movement toward Kigali continues. This was  confirmed this morning by Augustin Mukama, an RPF officer in  Kampala, Uganda, in an interview with Raphael Mbadinga.    [Begin Mukama recording] We formally and categorically deny  that there have been any negotiations on a cease-fire between  the RPF and the puppet government set up in Kigali. There have  been no cease-fire negotiations. There have never even been any  negotiations on a truce. It is strange that Europeans and  foreigners are being given the right to come to the rescue of  their citizens while the RPF is being asked to stop doing the  same for Rwandans who are in a much more critical situation than  the foreigners in Kigali. It is therefore our responsibility,  our sacred duty, to march on Kigali and to save the people.  Yesterday afternoon, at 1500, our troops were 8 km from the  capital. Now, we are in the outskirts of the city and even  within Kigali commune. [end recording]    We now bring you the reaction of the Republican Democratic  Movement, the assassinated Prime Minister Agathe  Uwilingiyimana's party. Its West Africa representative, Mr.  Kaberuka, refutes the RPF's statements. He was interviewed this  morning by Raphael Mbadinga.    [Begin Kaberuka recording] The truth is that the RPF is  looking for a dual cease-fire. It wants a cease-fire in Kigali  alone but rejects a nationwide cease-fire as proposed by the  government. You will understand that there can be no question  of a cease-fire in Kigali while fighting continues in the rest  of the country [words indistinct]. Either we cease fire and  drop the war option or we leave out the question of a cease-fire  and choose war. It seems the RPF has chosen the warpath which  is exactly what the interim government does not want. This is  what the interim government and the Rwandan people have never  wanted.

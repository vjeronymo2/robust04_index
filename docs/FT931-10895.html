			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Fairbriar sees end to suspension FAIRBRIAR, the property group which went into administrative receivership in September 1991, said it anticipated that all conditions of the reconstruction would be satisfied by February 24 allowing the suspension of its shares to be lifted and dealings in the new ordinary shares to begin. Fairbriar's shares were suspended on September 10 1991 at 8p. The proposals included an offer of 7.67m new ordinary shares of 1p each and reorganisation of the existing share capital. The Royal Bank of Scotland will convert about Pounds 12m of borrowings into 4.13m new ordinary and 8.82m convertible preference shares. It will also convert some debt into a maximum of Pounds 10.6m in loan notes in addition to providing further credit facilities.</p>

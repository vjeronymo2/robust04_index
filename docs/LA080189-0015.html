			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Two disgruntled employees are getting back at "The Boss." A New Jersey Superior  Court judge told Bruce Springsteen's attorneys to comply with an earlier court  order and turn over all of the rock star's income tax records to the attorneys  of two former "roadies." Michael Batlan and Douglas Sutphin are suing  Springsteen, saying he owes them thousands of dollars in overtime from the  "Born in the U.S.A." tour in 1984 and 1985. Each made about $50,000 a year  working for Springsteen. DANIEL CERONE  </P></p>

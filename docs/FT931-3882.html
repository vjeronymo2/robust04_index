			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Business body angry at 'snub' THE GOVERNMENT was acc-used yesterday of snubbing Britain's largest small-business organisation by failing to send a minister to the annual conference of the Federation of Small Businesses. The 58,000-member federation said this was the first time in many years that a minister had not attended its conference in Bournemouth, which ends tomorrow. Three hundred delegates have attended for debates on subjects such as the recession, the role of small businesses in economic recovery, the Maastricht treaty and the Budget. 'It is a snub,' said Mr Ian Handford, chairman of the federation's policy unit. 'It confirms our view that the government is paying lip service when it comes to practical policies for small firms. 'We have more members than the CBI and the Institute of Directors put together and we feel a minister should have been here to listen to our views.' The federation said it had asked Mr John Major to attend, but the invitation had been passed on to Baroness Denton, small firms minister at the Department of Trade and Industry. They finally invited Mr Bill Cash, a Tory Euro-rebel MP, who accepted an invitation to talk about the Maastricht treaty. The DTI said the invitation had reached Baroness Denton only a month ago and she could not change her programme, which involved visits to Devon and Cornwall.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> LETTER OF TRIBUTE TO DAD FROM ONE OF THE BOYS  </P> <P> My dad is turning 50 this Tuesday. I have nothing in this world that I could  give my dad that would have a money value on it. So I wrote this letter.  </P> <P> There are 12 (children) in our family: nine boys and three girls, ages ranging  from 30 to 5 years of age. We were raised on a farm in Hemet, and my dad worked  his fingers to the bone for a company in Lake Skinner. He would be dead tired  but would always find the time to play ball, and go hunting and fishing with us  all the time.  </P> <P> He would get up at 5 a.m. and milk the cow and collect all of the eggs before  we were even awake. Then, when he got home from work he would milk the cow and  play with us until dark.  </P> <P> When times were tough, there was always a great Christmas for all of us. Now  that I'm a father -- a son and a daughter -- I hope that I'm half the father he  was to me.  </P> <P> We always had family nights on Monday where my dad taught us morals: not to  cheat or steal; to love our neighbor, and to respect our elders. He taught us  by example. He treats my mom like a queen and loves her with all of his heart.  </P> <P> My dad still has eight children at home to raise, and he's done a great job. I  wish I had a million dollars to give my dad, but I don't. The only thing that I  can give to my dad this birthday is my love for him in this letter.  </P> <P> He gave up great-paying jobs, in which he would have to travel a lot, to be  with all of us. He said that nothing in this world is more important than the  family.  </P> <P> When we get together for birthdays and such, it's so much fun to be with a  father who always builds you up and tells you how great you are -- especially  in this world when there is so much negative.  </P> <P> Dad, I love you more than you will ever imagine.  </P></p>

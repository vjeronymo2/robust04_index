			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Mercedes-Benz hopes for a profit next year MERCEDES-BENZ will start making an operating profit again next year even though no significant recovery in the car market can be expected, Mr Helmut Werner, its chairman said yesterday. For the current year he expects sales of the company's luxury cars, buses and trucks to bring in DM65bn (Pounds 26bn), compared with DM66.5bn in 1992. Mr Werner, who has already forecast an operating deficit for this year, is looking for pro-ductivity improvements of 15 per cent in 1994 to assist recovery. Sales of the new C-class car model, launched in June, are expected to reach 100,000, compared with earlier production forecasts of 120,000. Mr Werner claimed that the new entry-level model had attracted many new buyers. About 40 per cent of deliveries so far have gone to people whose previous car was not a Mercedes. The top-of-the range S-class, however, had not sold as well as expected. Even so, orders were stable and the cars had a 27 per cent share of its market segment. AP adds: Mercedes-Benz will announce the location of its plant in the US on October 1. The decision will end months of high-powered jockeying by several states eager to have the new factory. Mr Jurgen Hubbert, head of the Mercedes passenger car division, said the decision would be announced on that day somewhere in the US. The company has been studying dozens of American sites since early this year. It plans to invest Dollars 300m (Pounds 199m) in its first US passenger car plant, where it will build a four-wheel-drive, sport utility-type vehicle. The plant will employ about 1,500 workers and begin production in 1997. Priced at Dollars 20,000-30,000, the new utility vehicle will be the lowest priced Mercedes-Benz vehicle, even less than the company's C-class compact models. BMW, Mercedes-Benz's German rival in the luxury car sector, broke ground in June for a plant near Spartanburg, South Carolina. Speculation on a Mercedes plant site had focused on North Carolina and South Carolina because Freightliner, a subsidiary of Mercedes, has three plants in North Carolina.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Troops ring Transkei SOUTH African troops and police ringed a pro-ANC black homeland yesterday in a show of force before a second attempt to launch multi-party talks on a transition from white rule to democracy, Reuter reports from Cape Town. A police spokesman said more than 1,000 police and an undisclosed number of soldiers threw a cordon around the Transkei homeland. 'We have to stop attacks on civilians by APLA (Azanian People's Liberation Army) members from Transkei,' he said. The APLA is the military wing of the black-supremacist PAC, one of 26 groups due to meet in Johannesburg today and tomorrow for democracy talks</p>

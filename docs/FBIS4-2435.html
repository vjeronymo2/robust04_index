			<p>BFN     [Text] Macao, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Macao Governor General  Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira said that the forthcoming visit of  Portuguese Premier Cavaco Silva to China would not only  consolidate the friendly relations between the two governments  of Portugal and China, but would also further strengthen such  friendly relations of the two sides.    He made his remarks when leaving Macao this evening for  Lisbon, for the purpose to accompany Portuguese Premier Cavaco  Silva's visit to China.    He said "I think that the efforts made by the two  governments  in strengthening their friendship and mutual trust will be  beneficial to Macao."    He continued, Macao is now in the transitional period,  noting  that so long as the two Governments of Portugal and China get  along with each other friendly and make joint efforts, the  transition can be carried out smoothly.    The Macao governor will accompany Portuguese premier to  visit  Beijing and Shanghai. The premier will also visit Macao for  three days starting from April 17 after concluding his visit to  China.</p>

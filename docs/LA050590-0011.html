			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORKING OUT OF A TIGHT SPOT;  </P> <P> BUSH WAS RIGHT TO REFUSE TO OFFER VILNIUS GUARANTEES OF INDEPENDENCE  </P> <P> It is not easy to be both prudent and principled in the pursuit of foreign  policy. So far, however, President Bush has struck that balance on the question  of Lithuanian independence. At the moment, the beneficiaries of his success  appear to be the American and Soviet people; ultimately, the Lithuanians, too,  will profit.  </P> <P> The latest test of Bush's resolve in the matter came this week when Lithuanian  Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene was invited to the White House to plead her  struggling government's cause. Clearly her presence in Washington just weeks  before the President's May 30 summit with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was  an inconvenience, if not embarrassment, to the Administration. Thus, there  probably was as much chagrin as diplomatic scrupulousness in the rather  grudging initial reception Prunskiene was given at the White House. She was  forced to leave her car and show her Soviet passport at the executive mansion's  gate, then walk up the driveway to the White House itself. There, she and her  party were left to wait unattended for 10 minutes.  </P> <P> Point made -- however indelicately: Prunskiene does not represent a nation  officially recognized by the United States. She does, on the other hand,  represent a people badly used by history, and for whose wholly legitimate claim  to self-determination the American people have profound sympathy. President  Bush made that essential point, too, in their frank, 45-minute talk.  </P> <P> The President reminded Prunskiene of how the West rhetorically encouraged the  1956 Hungarian uprising, then stood back and watched as it was murderously  repressed. In place of such bloody brinkmanship, he said, the United States  wants "dialogue -- talk, talk, talk." He also correctly turned aside her  suggestion that America become a formal mediator between Vilnius and Moscow.  "If there was a constructive role for the United States, of course, we should  fulfill that," Bush said, "but there's not."  </P> <P> Perhaps most important, the President rejected Prunskiene's proposal that the  West "guarantee" Lithuania's independence by formally recognizing its  government, sovereignty and territorial boundaries. In return, she had  proposed, her government would accept a recent suggestion by the French and  Germans that Lithuania voluntarily "suspend" its declaration of independence  for two years.  </P> <P> Self-reliance and not another's guarantee is the wellspring of genuine  self-determination. Americans are not indifferent to Lithuanian freedom, but  they cannot be made hostage to a particular notion of how it must be expressed.  John Quincy Adams' admonition to realism applies now as it always has: "We are  the friend of liberty everywhere, but the custodian of none but our own."  </P></p>

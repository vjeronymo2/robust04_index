			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Reforms that err on the safe side: The UK pensions industry accepts the need for change - with reservations The ghost of Robert Maxwell looms large over the UK pensions industry. At the annual conference of the industry's trade association in Glasgow last week, its members spoke frequently of the shockwaves caused by the disapperance of more than Pounds 400m from pension funds he controlled. They are steeling themselves for a radical overhaul of pension laws now seen as inevitable. Some members of the National Association of Pension Funds believe that change is desirable. 'There is a general recognition that reform is inevitable,' said Mr Brian McMahon, Napf chairman and group benefits director at BET, the industrial conglomerate. But among many delegates the desire for reform is more cosmetic than real. While Napf leaders are calling for the industry to co-operate in drafting new laws, scheme administrators are hoping that existing laws can merely be adjusted. They are seeking an overall structure which will reassure employees of the safety of their pensions while doing little to change the day-to-day operations of the funds. 'There is a danger that mistakes will be made,' said Mr David Morgan, pensions manager at Nestle Rowntree, who describes himself as an advocate of reform. 'If you improve the existing system by manipulating the edges, you have fewer chances of getting it wrong.' The spectre of Mr Maxwell, delegates said, has injected a new sense of urgency into an industry which has consistently rejected calls for reform. The spotlight has made some of its members uncomforable.  Several delegates expressed shock at seeing their habitually clubby annual conference displayed on national television news programmes. Mr McMahon said the industry is clearly taking itself more seriously. Unlike previous years, for instance, the presentation of technical papers has been heavily attended by delegates. 'Ordinarily, these sessions are the ones people use to go out and get a cup of coffee,' he said. The sea change has been prompted by mounting public anxiety over the safety of pension fund assets. 'I think that MPs were universally shocked at how easily Robert Maxwell got away with it,' said Mr Stewart Ritchie, pensions director at Scottish Equitable. 'Now that change is inevitable, the challenge for the industry is to be constructive. Over the past 10 to 15 years, this industry has refused to realise that change is necessary.' Since Mr Maxwell went overboard from his yacht, the safety of pension funds has climbed rapidly up the political agenda. A cross-party parliamentary select committee on social security, which held hearings into the Maxwell affair, has suggested wide-ranging changes to pension laws, including the scrapping of trust law, which governs pension schemes. The committee has asked for a top-level committee of inquiry to be set up to study the matter further. Its formation is expected to be announced shortly by the Department of Social Security. The appropriateness of trust law as the governing force behind pension schemes is a central issue that the committee will scrutinise. Trust law was developed in the Middle Ages to help manage the assets of knights on crusades. Under it, the administration of pension funds is left to the trustees who often represent the companies which sponsor the schemes. Mr McMahon has listed three main areas likely to be the focus of legislation: Who should control pension schemes? Should pension fund boards be required to balance representation between employer and member representatives? What safeguards should be introduced to protect assets? Beyond selecting a competent investment manager, what steps should trustees be required to take to protect their holdings? Should there be a compensation scheme for members and, if so, what sort of mimimum standards should funds have to meet to participate? In addition, Mr McMahon said, MPs may also have to come to grips with the thorny question of just who owns pension fund surpluses. While he expressed confidence in the industry's acceptance of reform, it is clear that there will be firm resistance from some quarters. 'I need reform like a hole in the head,' said the pensions manager of a leading UK company. While, as a practical matter, reform may not require great changes in the way his fund is administered, the expense of conforming to new regulations may raise costs substantially, he said. Mr David Trevor, pensions manager for Grand Metropolitan, the food, drinks and leisure group, said proposals for new pension laws, particularly if they restrict employers' access to scheme surpluses, could result in a curtailment of benefits for members. He said companies which have traditionally assured workers that they will receive pensions of up to two-thirds of their final salary will no longer be able to give that guarantee. Instead, companies may simply designate a lump sum that each worker will receive on retirement and then leave it to the worker to invest the money to provide an annual income. In the US the shift to such so-called money-purchase schemes has been blamed on a raft of pensions protection legislation, which companies say has priced final salary plans out of their reach. But to many Napf members this week, such threats by companies are little more than posturing. Companies fund pension schemes generously because high marginal tax rates make it advantageous for them to do so, said Mr John Cunliffe, a pensions lawyer and partner at McKenna &amp; Company. In addition, a company which does not offer competitive benefits cannot attract and retain qualified employees. That view was echoed by several delegates who act as consultants to the pensions industry. Mr Alan Jenkinson, policy director at the consulting actuaries Noble Lowndes, described talk of cutting contributions as 'propaganda'. However, he said reform could hasten the shift of UK schemes to money-purchase plans. A further contentious issue is the creation of a nationwide compensation fund for pension scheme members who are the victims of failed pension plans. While there is widespread support for such a scheme, some delegates were concerned that well-run schemes will be forced to bail out badly managed ones. Mr Steven Mingle, partner at actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow, said it would be difficult to extend compensation arrangements to schemes with insufficient assets to cover all liabilities were the scheme to be wound up. At the heart of the conference the industry was grappling with what sort of law is needed to reassure pension fund members that their funds are safe, without making them prohibitively expensive for employers to operate. No law has yet been proposed but for the first time there has been a broad recognition of the need for a new framework. The aim is to prevent a scandal on the scale of Maxwell happening again.</p>

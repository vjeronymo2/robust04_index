			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, December 31--The BJP [Bharatiya Janata  Party] has decided to focus attention on the "anti-farmer Dunkel  draft" to refurbish its image. It has planned country-wide  programmes to make their plan turn into a movement.    The party general secretary, Mr K.L. Sharma, today said the  movement would be converted into an agitation around the time of  the budget session in February.    According to the plan prepared by the general secretaries of  the party, there would be a mass awakening programme at the  panchayat level all over the country. The Kisan Morcha of the  BJP has been given the charge of successfully holding these  programmes.    The party intends to publish a large number of pamphlets  which would be distributed freely among the farmers to explain  the BJP's stand on the Dunkel draft. A comprehensive,  documentary film is also being planned. The budget for the  publication of pamphlets and organising meetings would be  decided at a meeting of the Kisan Morcha to be held in Delhi on  January 7.    The meeting would be presided over by the Kisan Morcha  president, Mr Kailash Joshi, MLA [Member of Legislative  Assembly] from Madhya Pradesh. Leaders like Govindacharya and  others have been involved in this programme for creating a  movement against the Dunkel draft.    During the first phase of the programme, which would be from  January 15 to 31, the party intends to hold seminars and  meetings in all major cities. The party would give the slogan of  "kisan bachao, kheti bachao" during these various meetings.    The party would be decided on the further stages of the  programme at the meeting of its "kisan morcha."    The BJP is also contemplating to amend its constitution to  bring about "internal democracy with discipline in the party."  According to sources, this move is being thought of in view of  the growing indiscipline in the party, which had surfaced  recently during the assembly elections. Leaders in the party  feel that the internal squabblings were the result of the BJP's  poor performance in the recent elections.</p>

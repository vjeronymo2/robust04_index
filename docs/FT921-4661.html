			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Questionable guarantee of the pensions pot: The legal loophole which allows trustees to close funds or change the rules For the 13m members of Britain's occupational pension schemes, the looting of the Maxwell pension funds has raised awkward questions about the nature and safety of pension rights. There may not be further frauds on the scale perpetrated by the late Mr Maxwell. But many pension fund members have been uncomfortably reminded that they have little or no say over their second-largest investment after home ownership; and that the employer can have a worrying degree of discretion and control. The plight of the workforce and pensioners within the Melton Medes group (see below) clearly demonstrates the inherent risks in the present system. The prime duty of pension trustees is to exercise their powers in the best interests of present and future pensioners. Yet in practice, the directors of the company usually constitute a majority or all of the trustees. And while pension fund assets are nominally separate from the finances of the employer, they are increasingly becoming intertwined as companies tap pension fund surpluses by ceasing to make contributions or by extracting money directly. Trust law, under which most pension funds are governed, was not designed to cope with this potential conflict of interest in which the employer - the original 'settlor' of the trust  - retains an ongoing financial interest in the fund. And despite warnings from such authorities as the Wilson Committee on the financial system and Professor L C B Gower, author of the government's review of investor protection in the early 1980s, regulation remains patchy. The difficulty experienced by the workers at Melton Medes in extracting information from the trustees is not unusual. Nor is there anything in the government's existing regulations that specifically prevents the investment practices undertaken by the Melton Medes trustees which involved potential conflicts of interest. The whole system is dangerously dependent on the goodwill of trustees. And that goodwill is being sorely tested in the present recession. The prohibitive cost and legal obstacles involved in seeking remedies have long been recognised. Sean Hand, of City solicitors Cameron Markby Hewitt, quotes the 1982 report of the Occupational Pensions Board which said: 'The ability of beneficiaries to obtain redress of grievances against trustees is one of the most unsatisfactory areas of present trust law.' The report of the Commons Select Committee on Social Security on the Maxwell affair, due on Monday, will call for legislation and will no doubt get it in due course. But tighter regulation should not be the end of the story, because the real issue is control. The moral justification for the employers' continuing control of this Pounds 300bn pot of money is that they guarantee the solvency of the funds. Yet the guarantee is meaningless, since most trust deeds permit the trustees to close the fund or change the rules. Nor is it clear what such a guarantee might mean for pensioners in a situation similar to the one described below at Melton Medes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Guiding the People With Correct Public Opinions </F> -- In Commemoration of the 45th Founding Anniversary of JIEFANG  RIBAO"]    [Text] While Shanghai people are jointly celebrating the  45th anniversary of Shanghai's liberation, JIEFANG RIBAO is  greeting its 45th founding anniversary. It is particularly  cheerful that General Secretary Jiang Zemin has written an  inscription for us: "Guiding the People With Correct Public  Opinions." This is a direction that the general secretary has  pointed out for us, as well as an inspiration and encouragement  to us.    "Guiding the people with correct public opinions" is JIEFANG  RIBAO's fundamental mission and the most important task and, as  an official party newspaper, we will not shrink from our  responsibility. "Guiding the people with correct public  opinion" is a pressing need for seizing the opportunity;  deepening reform; opening up wider to the outside world;  promoting development; maintaining stability; unifying the  people; lifting spirits; inspiring fighting will; enhancing  unity; and nurturing and cultivating a new type of socialist  citizen who has high ideals, moral integrity, a better  education, and a strong sense of discipline. Presently, the  efforts of establishing a socialist market economic structure  are storming ahead as a whole and have made breakthroughs in  some key localities around China. This is a great change and it  certainly requires further emancipation of minds and renewal of  concepts.    To guide the people with correct public opinions, we must  make the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics our basic guide and uphold the principle of  serving the people and socialism; this is an official party  newspaper's overall display of its adherence to the principle of  the party's spirit. From discussions about the criteria of  truth to Comrade Xiaoping's important talk during his south  China inspection tour, we have profoundly felt, in the course of  running this newspaper, that the theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics is the driving force for reform,  development, and stability. We should popularize Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics in a scientific, overall, precise, and lively  way and with high political enthusiasm. For the fundamental  interests of the party and people, media propaganda should  always unswervingly uphold the party's basic line; consciously  subject itself to and serve the central work of economic  construction; adhere to the principle of unity, stability,  encouragement, and mainly making positive propaganda; and  guiding the people's attention and creativity to the overall  situation with socialist modernization drive as the focus.    To guide the people with correct public opinions, we should  popularize, support, and promote reform in a clear-cut manner to  create a good media environment for the establishment of a new  socialist market economic structure. Presently, Shanghai should  take the lead in setting up a socialist market economic  operating mechanism, while the Shanghai people are striving for  the fulfillment of the strategic goal -- becoming "a leader of  the Chang Jiang valley and a financial, trade, and shipping  center." We should proceed from Shanghai's new historic  position and be good at discovering and summing up new things  and experiences created and found by the broad masses of cadres  and people in practicing reform.    To guide the people with correct public opinions, we should  always eulogize the main theme of patriotism, collectivism, and  socialism; intensify the construction of socialist civilization;  improve people's quality; raise the level of civilization in  cities; and promote the overall progress in the society. As a  part of the mass media and a textbook for the people, newspapers  should not only guide the people in acquiring correct outlooks  on the world, life, and values, but also transmit messages; pass  on knowledge; offer guidance on life, consumption, and  entertainment; and let the style of socialist spiritual  civilization permeate through every page of the newspapers, so  that they will become good instructors and friends of the people.    Guiding the people with correct public opinions, we should  correctly play a supervisory role in a bid to carry out a  resolute struggle against ill practices, bad behaviors, as well  as negative and corruptive phenomena. As a party paper, we  serve as a party mouthpiece and represent the people's opinions.  While sticking to the role as a party mouthpiece, we should  also adhere to our stance as the people's servant, reflect the  masses' weal and woe, uphold social justice, play a supervisory  role by using the great power of public opinion and courageously  exposing corruptive behaviors and adverse phenomena that damage  the interests of the party and the people and smear Shanghai's  image. In this way, we can cleanse all the trashes.    Guiding the people with correct public opinions, we should  strive to make our paper full of life so that our readers, who  are our close friends, will like to read it and trust it. The  task requires us to improve our paper. In the light of adhering  to the party spirit, we should pay more attention to such  aspects as informativeness, knowledge, service, and timeliness.  We should bring our paper closer to the masses, to social  realities, and to people's daily lives by being more humanistic  and warmhearted. In recent years, our paper has increased the  number of its pages from four to eight and then from eight to  12. On top of that, we issue color editions during the weekend.  Every year, we come up with new treats because we want to  provide our readers with a paper that is high in quality,  informative in content, and attractive to the people. We have  tried every possible way to meet the needs of our readers and  provide them better service.    In the final analysis, guiding the people with correct  public  opinions requires a good contingent of journalists. The  fundamental key to maintaining a correct orientation of public  opinions lies in building a good contingent of journalists. It  is impossible to have a correct orientation of public opinions  if such a contingent is corrupt. It is also difficult to do  splendid propaganda work if such a contingent is of poor  quality. We must conscientiously carry out the guiding spirit  of the National Meeting on Propaganda and Ideological Work to  build a contingent of journalists that is high in political  awareness, professionally competent, upright in work style,  ambitious in career, and has a pioneering spirit. In this way,  we can serve as a herald for the drive of reform, opening up,  and economic development and provide ample and colorful  nourishment for the mind.    The key to guiding the people with correct public opinions  lies in strengthening the party's leadership over media work.  Over the past 15 years since the Third Plenary Session of the  11th CPC Central Committee and particularly since Comrade Deng  Xiaoping delivered the important speeches during his south China  inspection trip and the 14th National CPC Congress, the driving  forces -- deriving their momentum from the emancipation of the  mind, from the drive of reform and opening up, and from Pudong's  development and its opening up to the outside world -- have  invigorated the Pujiang's two banks. The country's prosperity  makes all newspapers prosperous. The drive of reform and  opening up promotes economic development, which in turn promotes  the prosperity of all newspapers. Today, as we celebrate  JIEFANG RIBAO's 45th anniversary, a brand new building equipped  with modern facilities is basically accomplished. At the same  time, the blueprint for a modern printing center is being drawn  up. Looking up to the new building, we are excited to live in  this times of prosperity. We are resolute to unite ourselves,  under the leadership of the municipal CPC committee; gather  around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the  core; and, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics as our basic guidance,  adhere to the party's basic line, follow the right course, and  correctly guide public opinion. We will seize the opportunities  and accelerate journalistic endeavors. We will try our best to  return our thanks to the great chances the times have bestowed  on us and the great expectations our readers have had of us.</p>

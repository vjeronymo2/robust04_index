			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Revolt against the regulators: The case for curbing the watchdogs of Britain's privatised utilities Demands are mounting to clip the wings of the watchdogs responsible for regulating the UK's privatised gas, telecommunications, water and electricity utilities. The call for change is being led by the utilities themselves, angry at what they see as interference in the running of their businesses at the expense of their shareholders. The regulators, they allege, have too much power, too much discretion and too little accountability. The utilities - led by British Telecommunications and British Gas - have made public statements and held private meetings to put forward their line. The overall aim has been to raise concern in the City of London's financial community, parliament and the press about who regulates the regulators. Although the criticism started about a year ago, it moved up a gear with the current Monopolies and Mergers Commission probe of British Gas' near-monopoly position. The MMC will adjudicate in the bitter dispute between the company and Ofgas, its regulator. 'What comes out of the MMC is bound to influence other regulators,' says Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, the electricity regulator. The utilities sense the opportunity to tilt the balance of regulation in their favour because they believe Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, has exposed himself by his high-profile attack on British Gas. The regulators have defended themselves against criticism, arguing that regulation is necessary to prevent the utilities - which have strong monopoly positions - from overcharging their customers. But Sir James, the focus of most criticism, admits he is being outgunned by British Gas: 'We don't have the resources to take full-page advertisements to say how good we are. We don't have the money to wine and dine people - to take MPs on as advisers.' Running parallel to the public statements of the utilities and their regulators has been a proxy battle between rival sets of economists. The utilities' cause has been promoted by Mr Cento Veljanovski and Mr Dieter Helm; the regulators have been supported by Professor John Kay and Sir Christopher Foster. Mr Helm, who has done consultancy work for British Gas among others, argues that the 'regulatory framework is in crisis'. Mr Veljanovski, whose clients include BT and who has written a paper on reforming the regulatory system, accuses the regulators of a 'capricious exercise of the police powers of the state'. On the other side of the debate, Prof Kay describes what is increasingly known as the Veljanovski critique as a 'travesty of reality'. Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the water regulator, says: 'The idea that poor struggling utilities are being kicked from pillar to post, their share prices falling and their shareholders unable to support their families, seems to me a slightly overplayed tune.' Sir Christopher Foster, who is advising the government on rail privatisation and has written a book on monopoly regulation, argues that the UK's system of independent regulators is better than the alternatives: nationalisation, regulation by parliament or regulation by the courts. Behind the rhetoric, there are actually three separate debates - on the style, substance and system of regulation - which have become entangled. As far as style is concerned, the allegation - aimed principally at Sir James and Sir Bryan Carsberg, Oftel's director-general until last year - is that the regulators are confrontational. The response is that Oftel and Ofgas face recalcitrant monopolists, in contrast with Ofwat and Offer, whose industries were broken up before privatisation. On substance, the main issues before the MMC are whether British Gas should be broken up to promote competition and its level of profitability. These issues have been dwarfed in the public debate by the heated discussion about style. The debate about whether the system needs changing - the 'who-regulates-the-regulators' debate proper - revolves around four main allegations: The regulators have too much power. Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, has focused on their desire to accumulate power: 'Regulators like to regulate. This is how they can make their mark and it requires more disinterestedness than the average human being can muster not to wish to make a mark.' Their response is that, if their powers were curbed, the utilities would overcharge customers and drive fledgling competitors out of the market. The regulators are excessively secretive, in particular they do not give sufficient reasons for their decisions or back them up with detailed financial information. The defence, often given by Sir Bryan - at whom this charge was frequently levelled - is that he was unable to reveal financial details on grounds of commercial confidentiality. As for not giving reasons, he says this could have exposed him to judicial review and so delayed the introduction of competition. The regulators are not sufficiently accountable. Here they argue that they are accountable to the MMC on most important matters if there is a dispute, as shown by the current British Gas investigation. 'The permanent question is: would the MMC back me?' explains Prof Littlechild. The regulators have too much discretion. The defence is that, if their discretion were to be narrowed, there would have to be a mass of detailed rules and regulations on top of those that already exist. Sir Christopher says this would make the system more legalistic and allow the utilities to use their deeper pockets to tie their regulators up in knots. So far there is no sign that the government wishes to change the system. It is also possible that, if the MMC rules in British Gas's favour, the other utilities might think there was not so much to fear from the regulators after all.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] -- Shanghai -- A leading U.S. computer maker has  plugged into the booming information technology industry in  Shanghai.    Digital Equipment Co recently signed a memorandum of  understanding with the Pudong Software Park Development Co in  Shanghai.    Initially, Digital is to offer its new Alpha AXP 64-bit RISC  architecture (a high-speed data processing technology), mature  network systems integration and other technical and management  expertise.    ``Shanghai's development in the information technology  industry will be explosive and Digital is very fortunate to have  this opportunity to be a partner with this dynamic company to  further the information technology objectives of China,'' said  Bob Allesio, Digital's marketing director.    Information technology has recently gained a strategic  position in the city's economy, joining automobiles and  telecommunications as a pillar industry.    The industry expects sales to jump from 1 billion yuan ($115  million) last year to 5 billion yuan ($575 million) in 1995 and  20 billion yuan ($2.3 billion) by the year 2000.    City leaders expect the local information technology  industry  to gain at least one-third of the country's market.    As part of the expansion drive, Pudong Software Development  Park was founded by the Electronics Industry Ministry and the  city government to put East Shanghai in a leading position in  the country's software development.    The park's ambitious plan is to employ 3,000 software  engineers in 1996 and 10,000 by the year 2000.    The software park development company, owned by the city  government and the Ministry of Electronics, is in charge of the  park's infrastructure, business operations and support services.    Company president Sun Yuanhong said the signing of the  memorandum marked ``the participation of one of the world's  leading computer vendors in our project.''</p>

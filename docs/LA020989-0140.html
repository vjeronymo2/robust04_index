			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> GLOCKENSPIEL APPROVED  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday gave final approval for construction of a  European-style glockenspiel in a three-story retail project nearing completion  on Canon Drive.  </P> <P> The proposed Beverly Hills glockenspiel was rejected by the City Planning  Commission last year on grounds that it would violate the city's strict sign  ordinance.  </P> <P> The council on Jan. 10 voted 4 to 1 that the glockenspiel, modeled on the  famous devices in Munich, Prague and Venice, was not a sign and that it should  be allowed. On Tuesday, the council members again voted 4 to 1 in favor of a  resolution affirming their earlier decision.  </P> <P> The glockenspiel bears no relation to the musical instrument used by marching  bands. Instead, it includes brightly-colored figurines dancing on moving tracks  to musical themes.  </P> <P> Planning official Ruth Nadel said any changes in the glockenspiel's design must  still be approved by the Architectural Review Commission. Developer Moses  Lerner's glockenspiel will center on the theme of American culture, and it will  feature such figures as a movie projectionist, a dancer and a cowboy.  </P></p>

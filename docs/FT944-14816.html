			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Parade of ministers passes through doorway marked exit Mr Tim Smith is the 11th member of the government to leave office for non-political reasons since Mr John Major succeeded Baroness (then Mrs) Thatcher as prime minister in 1990. Almost all have quit following allegations about their private lives or claims that they had benefited financially from unethical behaviour. Most have denied any wrongdoing, but decided to return to the backbenches to limit the political damage to the government. Most of the resignations have occurred since last year's Tory party conference in Blackpool when Mr Major launched his much-derided Back-to-Basics initiative. The campaign has been a big casualty of the spate of disclosures and resignation. The other is Mr Major, whose efforts to draw a line under government failures have been undermined by a parade of embarrassed ministers: Mr David Mellor, heritage secretary, quit in September 1992 after an onslaught by the tabloid papers over allegations of an affair with an actress. Mr Mellor, who denied any impropriety, resigned after it emerged that he had accepted a paid holiday from the daughter of a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Mr Michael Mates, Northern Ireland minister, quit in June 1993 after revelations about his relationship with the fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir. Mr Mates, who denied any wrongdoing, was seriously damaged by the disclosure that he sent Mr Nadir a watch inscribed 'don't let the buggers get you down'. Mr Tim Yeo, countryside minister, quit in January after disclosures about an extra-marital affair. Mr Yeo said his private life had not affected his ability to do his job. Lord Caithness resigned as a transport minister in January after the suicide of his wife. His resignation was followed by newspaper speculation about his private life. Mr Alan Duncan resigned as a parliamentary private secretary in January after it emerged that he had lent money to a neighbour to buy a house from Westminster City Council at a discount, and that Mr Duncan had then bought the house from him. He denies any wrongdoing. Mr David Ashby resigned as a PPS in January after admitting sharing a bed with a man during a holiday in France. Mr Ashby denies any impropriety. Mr Hartley Booth, Finchley MP, resigned as a PPS after newspaper disclosures of his friendship with a female Commons researcher. Mr Booth denied having an affair. Mr Michael Brown resigned as a whip in May after allegations in a Sunday newspaper that he had had a homosexual relationship with a student. Mr Brown denied any impropriety. Mr David Tredinnick and Mr Graham Riddick were suspended as PPSs in July pending an inquiry into newspaper allegations that they were prepared to accept Pounds 1,000 each to table parliamentary questions. Mr Tim Devlin, a junior whip, was involved in a row with the government's business managers in July when he announced he had resigned over defence cuts, only for the whips to announce that he had been sacked. Lord Archer, former deputy party chairman, failed to achieve promotion earlier this year after disclosures about his share-dealing activities. He denies any impropriety.</p>

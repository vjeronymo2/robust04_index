			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 17 Apr (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic,  president of the Srpska republic [RS], said in Pale this evening  that an agreement on a cease-fire in the Gorazde area with  immediate effect has been reached, which indicates a possibility  of "getting closer to peace" in the region.    The RS president also said that the crisis in the relations  between the RS and the United Nations and the UN Protection  Force [UNPROFOR] has been "overcome to a certain degree".    After several hours of talks with special UN envoy Yasushi  Akashi, Karadzic told journalists that it has been agreed that:  An immediate cease-fire be ordered in the Gorazde area, as well  as "certain separation of the forces, as far as this is  possible," that maximum restraint be displayed in getting  involved in any activities and provocation, and that everything  possible be done in the humanitarian field.    Karadzic said that UN helicopters will evacuate the wounded  from Gorazde as early as tomorrow.    "If we succeed in achieving a cease-fire and certain  separation of the forces we can say that we are on our way to  peace in Gorazde," the RS president said.    According to the current agreement the parties in the  conflict should withdraw from each other of their own accord,  which should be a proof of goodwill by both sides, and then --  when the conditions are ripe to guarantee safety to UNPROFOR  members -- some arrangement could be made to include UNPROFOR as  well.    The RS president also said that the crisis in the relations  with UNPROFOR and the United Nations "is being overcome to a  certain degree."    "Some progress has been achieved today as regards the  position of UN members in our territory. Everything has been  done to enable their free movement," Karadzic said.    He stressed that this order has not yet reached some command  posts, "but it will in any case reach them."    Yasushi Akashi confirmed that a cease-fire agreement with  immediate effect in the Gorazde area has been reached.    "We have also agreed that the forces have to be separated as  soon as possible and that everyone should refrain from  provocation and offensive activities. In the meantime we will  continue with dialogue in order to reach an agreement which  would lead to a more stabilized situation," Akashi said.    He stressed that Karadzic agreed that an evacuation of the  wounded from Gorazde will take place at 0800 tomorrow.    "I suggested to Karadzic that relations with UNPROFOR be  normalized," Akashi said, adding that UNPROFOR will remain  impartial and its task will remain to bring the war to an end  with the help of all sides in the conflict.</p>

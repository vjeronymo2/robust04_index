He was reacting to the question whether his  absence from the Warsaw meeting of the Visegrad defence  ministers, planned for Friday [7 January], was connected with  any statements on the agenda of the meeting.    Secretary of State to the Slovak Defence Ministry Ivo Urban  said on Wednesday [5 January] that the defence ministers'  meeting should coordinate the joint approach to the admission in  NATO and the joint strategy before its forthcoming meeting.    "I refused to attend the first planned meeting already as I  did not deem it purposeful to work on a joint strategy of the  Visegrad Four regarding their relations with NATO," Baudys said.  "The formulation about the joint strategy towards NATO  countries is very unclear for us," he said.    Baudys added that if the Warsaw meeting were to be devoted  to  the issue again, he believes that the first deputy minister of  defence is skilled and informed enough to be able to present the  views of the ministry. "We do not want to create any new  groupings," Baudys said.</p>

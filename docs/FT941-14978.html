			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Oil helps industrial output return to pre-recession levels A sharp increase in oil and gas extraction in November helped bring overall industrial production back to pre-recession levels, while official figures published yesterday also pointed to a quickening of manufacturing output. The Central Statistical Office yesterday reported a 0.4 per cent increase in seasonally adjusted output in the production industries in November to show a 3.9 per cent rise on November 1992. Manufacturing output increased by 0.3 per cent in November and was 2.5 per cent higher than in November 1992. Taking three months' figures, considered by the CSO to be a more reliable guide, overall industrial production increased by 1.2 per cent in September, October and November compared with the previous three months and was 2.7 per cent up on the three months to the end of November 1992. Manufacturing production rose 0.8 per cent in the latest three months compared with the June-to-August period and was 1.8 per cent higher than in the three months to November 1992. The coming on stream of new oil and gas fields as well as cold autumn weather, which boosted demand for gas and electricity, lifted the production industries output index to 100.2 in November. This was its highest level since July 1990, on the eve of the recession, and slightly higher than the average for 1990 that now serves as the index base. Manufacturing accounts for nearly 85 per cent of the production industries' output, which also includes mining, quarrying, oil and gas extraction and electricity, gas and water supply. Oil and gas extraction in November was 24 per cent higher than in November 1992. It jumped by 5.8 per cent between October and November, to come close to its previous record output of May 1987. Oil and gas extraction in the three months to November was up 2.6 per cent on the previous three months and 15.8 per cent up on the three months to November 1992. Output of the electricity, gas and water supply industries was 4.5 per cent higher in the three months to November compared with the previous three months and 4.7 per cent up on the same period of 1992. CSO statisticians said that some 3 percentage points of the growth in electricity and gas supplied in the latest period reflected the effects of unusually cold weather in October and November. Manufacturing output between October and November was boosted by a jump in chemical production and a rise in tobacco output ahead of the November 30 Budget. The latest three-month figures pointed to strong output growth in the oil refining, computer and electronic components industries and in the production of building materials and vehicles. However, output declined in older industries such as shipbuilding and mechanical engineering. CSO statisticians warned that the latest 0.8 per cent three months on three months increase in manufacturing output could give too favourable a picture of UK production trends. The late spring bank holiday depressed output in the three months to the end of August. Nonetheless, they estimated that manufacturing output was growing at an underlying annual trend rate of 1.5 per cent in November against 1 per cent in the previous month while the trend growth rate for the production industries as a whole was 2.5 per cent. Other figures released by CSO and the Department of Employment yesterday revealed a slight upturn in manufacturing productivity growth to 3.6 per cent in the 12 months to November from 3.3 per cent in the year to October. However, the year-on-year growth of manufacturing output per head slowed to 3.8 per cent in the three months ended November from 5.3 per cent in the three months to the end of August. Unit wage costs in manufacturing rose in the three months ended November, the first such rise last year.</p>

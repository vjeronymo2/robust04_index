			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Observer: Heavy burden There are big businesses where the death of a top engineer is hardly noticed. But not the coal industry. The sudden death of Ken Moses, only a few months after he was appointed one of British Coal's two joint deputy chairmen, is a bitter blow not only for his family but for the industry, and the government. Having graduated from Wigan Mining College, Moses showed that it was still possible for a self-made man to make it from the coal face to the top of British Coal. Although he was one of the hard-nosed managers who helped Sir Ian MacGregor break the coal strike in the early 1980's, he was a passionate believer in the industry and was playing a key role in its privatisation as British Coal's strategic planning director. With the recent retirement of John Northard and Ken Moses' death, an even bigger burden now falls on Bert Wheeler, the remaining deputy chairman, especially since his chairman Neil Clarke is not an engineer and is a newcomer to the industry.</p>

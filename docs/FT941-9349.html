			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Recession cuts jobs and output at Fokker Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, has unveiled plans for a drastic cut in aircraft output and jobs to cope with the continued deep malaise in the aviation industry. The company, which came under majority control of Germany's Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) last year, is to reduce the number of aircraft it manufactures to 40 a year from around 60. This will lead to the loss of some 1,900 jobs out of almost 10,000, marking the third major reorganisation at the company in the space of three years. Mr Reinder van Duinen, who became acting chairman last month after a boardroom shake-up, denied the cuts had been imposed by Dasa, which owns 51 per cent of Fokker's shares. 'That is complete nonsense,' he said in a statement to staff. 'We must again cut jobs because the market is so bad. The market, and not Dasa, dictates to Fokker.' He said other aircraft manufacturers were being forced to take similar action, citing job cuts at Dasa and at Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the US. The cuts are harsher than those proposed by Mr van Duinen's predecessor, Mr Erik Jan Nederkoorn, who resigned on January 31 after a bitter row over the division of responsibilities within the board and the scale of the reorganisation. The plans also call for Fokker's suppliers to reduce prices, thereby enabling the Dutch company to be able to meet customers' demands for lower selling prices. Mr Nederkoorn had previously sought a 30 per cent reduction in cost prices, but Mr van Duinen would not be drawn on the scale of cuts being negotiated. Mr van Duinen said Fokker would remain a 'fully fledged' aircraft maker despite the cut in production. During the takeover negotiations with Dasa last year, the Dutch had insisted the company retain a full complement of industrial capabilities, including the development, production and marketing of aeroplanes. Mr van Duinen and his fellow board members declined to forecast when Fokker would return to profit or when the market for aircraft would recover. Before the latest round of cuts, Fokker had predicted it would post a loss of Fl 150m (Dollars 76m) in 1993. Figures for 1993 are due in March.</p>

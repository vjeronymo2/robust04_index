			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Poll tax grant scheme extended The community charge grant scheme will be extended into 1995-96, Mr David Curry, local government minister, announced yesterday. The grant offsets local authorities' loss of income following the Pounds 140 general reduction in poll tax for 1991-92. Mr Curry said extension of the scheme would enable local authorities to receive compensation for arrears collected during the period. There would be no further extension.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  on Thursday [16 June] agreed to continue efforts to expand  foreign access to Japan's sheet glass market, a Trade Ministry  official said.    The two countries confirmed the mutual efforts during sheet  glass talks resumed under the trade "Framework" negotiations, an  official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI) told a press conference. "Both parties agreed to  continue constructive talks for further penetration by imported  sheet glass in this country," the official said. The official  noted the two parties agreed to meet again in July or shortly  after the Naples summit of the group of seven leading  industrialized nations.    During Thursday's meeting, the first since December last  year, Japanese negotiators explained that the volume-based share  of foreign-made sheet glass in the Japanese market increased to  5.6 percent in 1993 from 4.9 percent the previous year,  according to the official. The Japanese negotiators were also  quoted as saying the number of Japanese wholesalers handling  foreign sheet glass rose to 39 at the end of last December from  17 in June 1992. At present, there are 400 sheet glass  wholesalers in Japan.    The Japanese side said it has taken steps to open Japan's  sheet glass market in line with an action plan introduced two  years ago, the official said. The Japanese sheet glass industry  will send a trade mission to the U.S. in August to study the  U.S. distribution system, according to the official.    Sheet glass trade is among a basket of existing trade pacts  under the framework talks. The trade talks were launched in  September last year, and held in October and December. But the  talks were suspended following the Feb. 11 collapse of the  summit between then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  and U.S. President Bill Clinton.</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ATTORNEY CLAIMS CLIENT MAY HAVE TRIED TO PROTECT BROTHER IN GUARD'S DEATH  </P> <P> A Glendale man on trial for machine-gunning an armored car guard, leaving him  paralyzed, may have gotten involved in the aftermath of the crime only because  he tried to protect his older brother, the true gunman, the younger brother's  defense attorney argued Wednesday in Pasadena Superior Court.  </P> <P> In closing arguments in the second trial of Alfred Giordano, attorney Robert C.  Swanson portrayed his client as a possible accessory in the shooting of Howard  White, an armored car guard. White was machine-gunned by a would-be robber on  Dec. 31, 1987, outside a check-cashing service in Glendale.  </P> <P> Swanson told jurors that it was Peter Giordano, Alfred's older brother, who  wounded White.  </P> <P> Witnesses have linked Alfred to attempts to disguise the getaway car and to  hide the Uzi submachine gun involved in the shooting. The defense attorney said  Alfred may have gotten involved following the shooting to protect Peter.  </P> <P> "You could believe that Al, knowing Peter committed a crime, could have helped  Peter in covering it up," Swanson told the jury.  </P> <P> But Deputy Dist. Atty. Jo Ann B. Glidden argued that Peter Giordano was the  getaway driver in the crime, and that Alfred Giordano was the gunman.  </P> <P> "Alfred Giordano did everything in his power to kill Howard White," Glidden  told jurors.  </P> <P> Both Alfred, 27, and Peter, 33, were charged with attempted murder and  attempted robbery. But in a trial last May, Peter was acquitted of his alleged  role and a mistrial was declared on the charges against Alfred after jurors  deadlocked 11 to 1 in favor of conviction.  </P> <P> Swanson tried earlier this week to call Peter Giordano to the witness stand,  and asked Judge Terry Smerling to grant him immunity from prosecution.  </P> <P> But in a hearing Monday outside the presence of the jury, Smerling ruled that  Peter would not be allowed to testify. Smerling said the prosecutor would be  unfairly restricted in cross-examination because Peter, although acquitted  earlier, indicated he would refuse to answer questions that could implicate him  in the crime.  </P> <P> Since the second trial began on Feb. 15, Glidden has presented witnesses who  testified they saw Alfred Giordano shoot White, search the canvas bag the guard  was carrying, then flee after finding it empty.  </P> <P> A key prosecution witness was Kimberly Giordano, Alfred's wife, who testified  that Alfred told her he committed the crime.  </P> <P> But Swanson on Wednesday told jurors that Alfred Giordano was visiting a friend  in Orange County at the time of the shooting. He said that Kimberly was jealous  and angry at Alfred because he had been having an affair, and portrayed her  testimony as "confused" and "willfully false." He also accused police  investigators of coercing her to testify.  </P> <P> The attorney also argued that witnesses to the crime had mistaken Peter for  Alfred. Even the victim, when asked at the first trial to point out his  assailant, had pointed to Peter, Swanson said.  </P></p>

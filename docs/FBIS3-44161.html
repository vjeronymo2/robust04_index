			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria Jan 25 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive  Council on Tuesday changed the date for South Africa's first  all-race general election from April 27 to April 28 and 29.  Special votes will now be cast on April 27. It was also  decided to declare Friday, April 29 a public holiday.    The council decision to alter the date was based on a  recommendation from the seven-member management committee which  steers the process. Concerns expressed by some council  participants that the change could confuse voters were dismissed.    Voters will be able to cast their votes between 7am and 9pm  on the polling days.    The council further decided to advise President F W de Klerk  to proclaim the election date this Friday. Political observers  explained parties would have 10 days from Friday, January 28 to  register for the election.    Friday's proclamation effectively meant the final deadline  for a political settlement between the government and the  African National Congress [ANC] and the Freedom Alliance could  be stretched until the February 7 cut-off date for the  registration of parties.    The ANC's Mac Maharaj, defending the date change, said the  management committee believed the change "will not cause a  serious disruption". He said the reason for the recommended  change was to coincide with the last weekend in April. A  countrywide voter education programme would ensure the new dates  "will be firmly imprinted on people's minds".</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F> Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "Fini: `Unitarian  Federalism? This Can be Discussed'"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Guiglia] How does it feel to  be allied with the person who, in the north, has gone into  alliance with [Northern League Secretary] Bossi?    [Fini] The agreements on the antiprogressive front are on  two  levels: first on an electoral basis, like the one we have  entered into just now with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, and  then on the level of policy, like the one signed between Forza  Italia and the Northern League. The National Alliance will be  putting up its own candidates throughout the north because it  does not share the League's social egotism and intends to offer  an alternative to Italians who are against the left and who are  tired of the fantasies of the center.    [Guiglia] According to MSI's [Italian Social Movement]  Tremaglia, Forza Italia cannot stand on an "anti-Italy" ticket.  Is he right or wrong?    [Fini] The big success which we and Berlusconi will achieve  in the center-south will be the best guarantee of national unity  and will make any separatist whims impossible. The agreement  which Bossi has been forced to make with Forza Italia is a  "defensive" pact. Without Berlusconi's aid, the League would  have lost many of its votes.    [Guiglia] Would it not have been better to convince  Berlusconi to present himself in competition, rather than in  alliance with the League?    [Fini] The conditions were not right for this to happen. On  the other hand, in the proportional vote in the north we will  each be present in our own candidates: National Alliance, Forza  Italia, and the League. We will then know who is growing and  who is getting smaller.    [Guiglia] And if by running in the north you contribute to a  progressive victory, by withholding from Berlusconi and Bossi  the votes which are decisive for success?    [Fini] The Alliance is a national movement, not a southern  league. Renouncing the possibility of winning in any part of  Italy would be to betray ourselves. Moreover, Bossi is  untrustworthy, in particular when it comes to solidarity.    [Guiglia] Communists or federalists, who today are the main  enemies of the right?    [Fini] Enemy number one is the old power system, which is  still in existence, in part masked by a progressive front, and  in part by the centrist re-edition of Martinazzoli [Italian  Popular Party, PPI], Segni [Pact for Italy], La Malfa [Italian  Republican Party], and Amato [Pact for Italy]. A strong  National Alliance presence in parliament will thwart the danger  of terminating the silent and nonviolent revolution of recent  months.    [Guiglia] According to Foreign Minister Andreatta,  Berlusconi  risks a "Zhirinovskiy effect" by entering into alliance with  Fini. When will you march on Istria and Dalmatia?    [Fini] My judgment on Zhirinovskiy is worse than  Andreatta's:  a dangerous madman who is wandering around Europe demanding what  cannot be demanded, including our Alto Adige region. The  Alliance's position on the Italian character of places like  Istria is one of principle and does not present any threat to  the balance of foreign politics. We are calling for a review, by  pacific means, of an unjust treaty, which has penalized all  other borders and rights of the Italian community, which has  been rooted in these areas for centuries. Do you want to make a  comparison between the way German-language citizens live in  Bolzano and Italian ones in Istria? No marches to Rome, not  even small ones. This is how Andreatta can function in Piazza  del Gesu [PPI headquarters]. When a foreign minister obeys  party rather than national interests and dignity, he is not a  good foreign minister. Berlusconi anyhow does not come into the  picture here: With him we have an electoral agreement, not an  agreement on policy.    [Guiglia] With Forza Italia you have candidates and even  symbols in common. Is it not a little hypocritical to talk only  of an "electoral" entente?    [Fini] I do not deny that we share certain commonalities. I  am referring to the objective of discomforting the left, our  objection to excess taxation, and the socialism which still  pollutes public administration. With Forza Italia there is the  issue of institutions which we could look into in greater depth:  That is the idea of "macrocommunes" launched by Professor  Antonio Martino. We also believe that excess centralism is not  beaten with Bossi's federalism, but with "unitarian"  decentralization. We need an intermediate body between local  councils and parliament. Certainly not bankrupt and  "party-ruled" regions. Could this be the "macrocommunes" which  Forza Italia has defined? I believe that we can discuss this  very seriously.    [Guiglia] Segni is not excluding the possibility of an  "institutional" government. And if the Alliance returned to the  ghetto after 27 March?    [Fini] It is the voters who have brought us out of  isolation.  It is true that there is the risk of a new clash with the  progressives. We are already saying no. The League has  committed itself to an equally clear no. And who can swear that  it will not be Segni who moves toward the center-right after  changing positions for the umpteenth time?</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (8): Pilot project gets ready for lift-off BULGARIA is hoping the sale of Balkan Bulgarian Airlines, the national carrier, will put its privatisation programme on the map, writes Virginia Marsh. 'Balkan is the first large company to be put forward for privatisation. We are effectively a pilot project for the whole process,' says Mr Kostadin Botev, managing director. He hopes the airline, which is being advised by SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank, will be sold off by the autumn, after two years of restructuring. 'We've reduced our staff from 4,100 to 3,700 but still managed to increase our route network to 64 destinations.' Balkan begins its second marketing phase with a short list of potential foreign partners this month. On offer to foreign investors is up to 49 per cent of the airline, the second largest in the former east bloc after Aeroflot. The state is expected to retain a minority shareholding of around 40 per cent with the remainder going to Balkan employees and other domestic investors. Mr Botev believes Balkan, with its strategic position on Europe's south eastern flank, has two major options - to link up with either a European or an Asian carrier. To make the airline more attractive, the Bulgarian government has made Balkan the single carrier on its network for 15 years and agreed to modernise Sofia airport. Mr Botev says Balkan's low labour costs should be attractive to investors: 'Only 7 per cent of our costs go on salaries compared to an average of 30 per cent at western airlines.' But the airline's future owners will have to foot the bill for the replacement of Balkan's Soviet-made fleet whose high energy consumption and noise levels do not meet western standards. With foreign debt negotiations deadlocked, the airline has been unable to secure credits to buy western aircraft. Instead, it has leased four Airbus A-320s, three Boeing 737s and the two Boeing 767s but this has proved expensive. Leasing costs gobbled up 91 per cent of operating profits of Dollars 12.4m in the first half of 1992.</p>

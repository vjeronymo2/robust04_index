			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: AWARDS  </P> <P> Super star Michael Jackson was one of the few winners present at the Black  Radio Exclusive awards show Sunday at the Universal Amphitheater. Jackson  accepted an award for outstanding achievement in pop, rock and soul, and his  appearance turned out to be the high point of the evening. The big  disappointment to the packed house was that hot young star Bobby Brown didn't  show up. In fact, the Brown-oriented crowd booed when Karyn White's  "Superwoman" was named best song over Brown's "My Prerogative." Brown was named  best male artist, and another no-show, Anita Baker, was picked as best female  artist. Two teen favorites -- New Edition (best group) and Guy (best new group)  -- did show up for their awards. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

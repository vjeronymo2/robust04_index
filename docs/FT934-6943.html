			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Kozyrev threatens Armenia Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, yesterday threatened Armenia with 'something other than persuasion' if it did not curtail its support for the Armenian-dominated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. It had reached a limit, he said 'beyond which ..lies direct harm to Russia's national and state interests'. This is the first time a senior Russian politician has directly threatened retaliation against Armenia for its sponsorship of the Karabakh independence movement, a sponsorship the republic has always denied.</p>

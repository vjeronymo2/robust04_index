			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSICAL AIRPORTS  </P> <P> I'm convinced. I've been convinced ever since the first time I landed a jet  fighter at Lindbergh Field (1959)! San Diego does need a better and much safer  international airport.  </P> <P> There's a logical solution staring us in the face. The "center of population"  of those who fly with the airlines is on the north side of San Diego, not on  the south side, near Brown Field. But, the Navy needs and will not give up  Miramar Naval Air Station.  </P> <P> So, let's do the obvious: use the money for a new international airport to  upgrade and construct a new "Miramar NAS" at (and perhaps just north of) Brown  Field. Build new family housing, the "works."  </P> <P> Then the only logical site for our new airport becomes available, Miramar.  </P> <P> CARROLL NJUST  </P> <P> Fallbrook  </P></p>

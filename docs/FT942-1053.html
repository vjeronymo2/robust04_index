			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Books: Spanish festivals captured in print A small child gazes transfixed at the shrine of Saint Minnia in Brion, Galicia: one of 187 colour photographs from Festivals and Rituals of Spain by Cristina Garcia Rodero (Harry N. Abrams, Pounds 40, 298 pages). Ms Garcia Rodero, professor of photography at the University of Madrid, has captured the rich fusion of ancient pagan ritual and solemn religious rite with its parade of jesters, maskers, penitents and carousers in an apparently endless cycle of celebrations. The poet and novelist J. M. Caballero Bonald provides the introduction and a map shows the locations of the villages photographed, most of them unknown to tourists.</p>

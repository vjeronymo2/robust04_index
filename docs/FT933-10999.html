			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bridgestone slashes forecast BRIDGESTONE, the Japanese tyre maker which owns Firestone of the US, yesterday dashed hopes of growth this year, slashing Y9bn (Dollars 85m) from its forecast for worldwide net profits and saying it expected sales to fall Y100bn short of original expectations. It blamed the setback, which would bring a 1.4 per cent dip in earnings compared with last year to Y28bn, on a poor showing by its domestic operations. 'Overseas subsidiaries and affiliated companies are still expected to achieve initially forecast financial performance levels,' Bridgestone added. Global sales, at a projected Y1,650bn, would be 5.5 per cent below the 1992 level. At the Japanese parent company alone, figures released yesterday for the first six months showed pre-tax profits halved to Y13.76bn from Y28.91bn, on sales down 11.3 per cent to Y304.2bn. The weak Japanese economy brought a drop both in the sales of new cars for which it supplies tyres, and in replacement tyres particularly for commercial vehicles as road freight slackened. Exports from Japan were maintained in unit terms but revenues decreased with the appreciation of the yen. Non-tyre operations, which represent more than a quarter of the parent's business, were similarly affected - stronger sales of bathroom fittings and office materials were not enough to offset weak demand for chemicals, car seat materials, water tanks and bedding. The interim dividend is being held at Y6 a share, drawn from net earnings per share of Y8.11 compared with Y19.83.</p>

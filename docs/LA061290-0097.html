			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATOR WANTS TOUGHER ACTION IN S&amp;L CASES;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: THE HEAD OF THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE SAYS THE ADMINISTRATION  HASN'T ASKED FOR ENOUGH FUNDS TO PURSUE THE PERPETRATORS.  </P> <P> Joining a rising chorus of political anger over savings and loan fraud, Senate  Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) on Monday called for  "a more aggressive crackdown" on the white-collar criminals who helped cripple  the thrift industry.  </P> <P> "The need for additional investigative and prosecutorial resources is  unlimited," Riegle said in a major Senate speech. He accused the Bush  Administration of failing to ask for enough funds to pursue the perpetrators of  financial fraud.  </P> <P> A Justice Department spokesman fired back at Riegle, saying "it's too  simplistic to suggest more money means more cases investigated and prosecuted."  </P> <P> S&amp;L fraud cases "are hard cases to make," said Douglas Tillett, the Justice  Department spokesman. "We have to bring evidence and prove guilt -- members of  Congress can hold a press conference and not be accountable for their grand  ideas."  </P> <P> Riegle, a key author of the 1989 S&amp;L rescue bill that provided funding for  the sale or shutdown of hundreds of insolvent thrifts, added his influential  voice to a new wave of criticism sweeping through Congress. Lawmakers are among  those having to cope with the political fallout from the biggest financial  scandal in American history.  </P> <P> Because savings deposits are insured up to $100,000, taxpayers will bear the  massive financial burden for cleaning up the defunct S&amp;Ls and disposing of  their assets. The Bush Administration said last month that the cleanup cost had  been badly underestimated. It said it would need as much as $60 billion more  for the job.  </P> <P> Although the complexities of the scandal have been slow to penetrate the public  consciousness, politicians draw big applause when they call for retribution  against those who helped loot S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> Congress authorized $75 million for prosecuting thrift fraud, but the  Administration limited its request to $49 million, Riegle said.  </P> <P> "The Administration opposition to additional funds for savings and loan fraud  prosecutions is difficult to reconcile with available evidence on the magnitude  of the problems and the Justice Department's current resources," Riegle said.  </P> <P> The Justice Department spokesman said his agency is spending the  fraud-prosecution money effectively and doesn't need more. "To appropriate  money in December, 1989, and expect to put people in jail in June, 1990, is a  little unrealistic," Tillett said. The Justice Department has created 155 new  slots for FBI agents and 118 for assistant U.S. attorneys, but needs hundreds  more, Riegle said.  </P> <P> His willingness to write a virtual blank check to pay for S&amp;L fraud  prosecution illustrates the growing intensity of the issue on Capitol Hill.  More than 100 House members have signed a resolution calling for a special  prosecutor to deal with thrift fraud.  </P> <P> Sen. Alan J. Dixon (D-Ill.), joining several Democratic senators in proposing a  special strike force last week, said: "This country is being robbed blind, and  the crooks are getting away scot-free."  </P> <P> The Justice Department says it has 27 local task forces capable of doing the  job. "You've got a lot of angry constituents raising the issue with their  elected representatives -- and rightly so," said Tillett. "Members of Congress  are looking for a quick solution to a problem not quickly solved."  </P> <P> It takes an average of three to four years to bring a case from investigation  to trial. Congress recognized the problem by extending the statute of  limitations for financial fraud to 10 years from five, he said.  </P> <P> The cases, like other fraud committed by white-collar criminals, are difficult  to prosecute. The crimes are intricate, the perpetrators often well-known,  once-respected members of the business community.  </P> <P> There seems scant opportunity to recover much of the billions of dollars in  losses suffered by S&amp;Ls, federal officials believe. They feel that the  money has melted away along with the collapse of real estate values in many  markets.  </P> <P> Inflated values of land, office buildings, shopping centers and condominiums  plunged after the markets turned bad. Those who made the biggest profit were  the last sellers of the property before the bust, according to L. William  Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency handling the  dismantling of crippled S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> Riegle also was critical of efforts to dispose of failed S&amp;Ls. "While the  pace is now accelerating, the overall progress to date must be considered  disappointing," he said.  </P> <P> The government has inherited thousands of properties from defunct S&amp;Ls,  including shopping centers, office buildings, homes and land.  </P> <P> "There is no simple recipe for orderly, efficient and cost-effective  disposition of these assets, particularly given the slack real estate markets  in areas where the real estate inventory is largest," Riegle said. "This unique  and very difficult problem needs the sustained attention of the administrative  agencies, Congress and the public."  </P></p>

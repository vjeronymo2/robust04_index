			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: SIGNS SAY GOD IS NOT A VEGETARIAN  </P> <P> Food shoppers are being faced with a major decision these days. Should they buy  a zucchini or make the house payment? It's happened before. Every time the  South experiences a deep freeze, the price of fruits and vegetables soars out  of reach.  </P> <P> To the veggie freaks whose idea of pigging out is to graze on the front lawn,  these are indeed dark days. For me, it's an omen.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago I said, "God, if you want me to get off this crummy diet, give me  a sign." The very next day in the supermarket I picked up a single tomato. It  was marked $3. At that very moment, I heard organ music. The tomato was  returned and I hit the Dove bars.  </P> <P> It doesn't take much to dissuade me from buying and eating greens. Not only am  I not a vegetable disciple, I have never been convinced that vegetables make  you thin. The first time my mom took me to the zoo, I watched as the keeper  threw a bucket of greens to an orangutan. I wasn't the brightest kid on the  block, but I figured here was an animal that exercised regularly, ate healthy  and got a lot of sleep, and look how he turned out. He had a waistline the size  of a Disney parking lot.  </P> <P> That sorta set the pace for me. I'm possibly the only person who can visit a  salad bar and run up a calorie tab of 1,200 on one plate. I start with a bed of  croutons and drown them in a sea of blue cheese with bacon bits, then garnish  it with two cherry tomatoes.  </P> <P> As is generally the case, carbohydrate eaters are attracted to mates who thrive  on proteins. I came from a family where gravy was a beverage and ketchup was a  vegetable. My husband's family bought lettuce by the field.  </P> <P> After we married, it wasn't easy trying to blend our eating habits. I thought a  long time before I made a decision to bring a child into a world polluted by  Brussels sprouts.  </P> <P> When my husband looked into the refrigerator last week, he said, "Where's the  vegetables?"  </P> <P> I handed him an artichoke with the price on it and he gasped. "Let me guess.  You bought a designer artichoke? I thought I told you to get eggplant."  </P> <P> "If you want me to buy eggplant," I said, "I'll arrange financing, but the way  I look at it, we are being given a sign that the world is coming to an end as  we know it."  </P> <P> "What kind of nonsense is that?" he asked.  </P> <P> "All the foods that experts say are good for you are dwindling -- fresh fish,  vegetables, fruits."  </P> <P> "The shortage can be explained," he said. "The weather is an act of God."  </P> <P> "That's what I've been telling you," I said. "Hear the organ?"  </P></p>

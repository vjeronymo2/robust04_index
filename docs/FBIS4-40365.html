			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vs.O. under the "Meanwhile" rubric: "Such </F> Prospects Are Costly"]    [Text] "Russia's Choice," the most capital-intensive  political association in the last elections, is continuing to  organize itself. As was only to be expected, businessmen are  flocking to the banners of radical economist Yegor Gaydar. They  are not taking up rank-and-file posts under these banners  either. For example, the Executive Committee of "Russia's  Democratic Choice" was recently headed by Oleg Boyko, leader of  the renowned "OLBI" Concern and of the less renowned  "Natsionalnyy Kredit" Bank.    "OLBI" is known as a major trading house and as an open-type  joint-stock company. Naturally, even the largest trading house  is hardly capable of funding a national political movement. In  other words, a direct financial interest in Boyko on Gaydar's  part is unlikely. On the other hand, in the last elections  "OLBI" actively supported "Russia's Choice," so that Mr. Boyko's  new post may be regarded as political compensation of a kind.  But there is also a third aspect, the most interesting one.    The point is that Mr. Boyko, "OLBI," and the "Natsionalnyy  Kredit" Bank have strong ties (including partnership ties) with  the "Vzlet" Science and Production Association, one of the  flagships of the Russian defense industry. The interest of the  military-industrial complex in Gaydar -- the leader of the  largest Duma faction, which voted for broader budget spending on  defense, and someone with access to the president -- is obvious.  In addition, Gaydar must also be of interest to the defense  industry as a radical market economist. They can complain as  much as they like about the collapse of the defense complex as a  consequence of the reforms. But only Gaydar's reforms can  enable the leaders of large defense enterprises to participate  seriously in privatization.</p>

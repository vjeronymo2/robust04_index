			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Technology: Helicopters fly with fuzzy logic - Worth Watching Because helicopters are difficult to operate, many companies have a hard time recruiting pilots for dangerous activities such as mountain surveys or photography of dangerous sites. The Tokyo Institute of Technology and the Omron Corporation believe they could have solved the problem with an electronic control system for unmanned industrial helicopters. The control system uses 'fuzzy' logic, a computer technique designed to handle unpredictable sequences of events such as the flying movements of a helicopter. The Tokyo Institute developed the control programs and Omron the chips and other hardware for the project. For the field test the organisations used a Yamaha craft with a 20kg payload.

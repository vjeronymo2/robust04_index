			<p>BFN     [Text] Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has concluded  his official visit to Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Russia  successfully. Following is our radio review on results of the  visit.    Vietnam has traditional friendship and cooperation with  Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Russia, and other republics of the former  Soviet Union. After political changes that lead to the collapse  of the former Soviet Union, relations between Vietnam and  members of the former Soviet Union were suspended because these  countries met with numerous difficulties.    The first visit to Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Russia by the  Vietnamese prime minister has breathed a new life into the  traditional relations between Vietnam and these countries.    After the visit, the mutual understanding, friendship, and  cooperation have been developed in the principles of equality  and mutual benefit. It is worthy of note that during the visit,  Vietnam and Russia signed four important agreements, including  the treaty on the principle of friendly relations between the  two countries. The treaty is a foundation for the restructuring  of cooperation to make relations between the two countries  develop effectively.    On this occasion, ministers, vice ministers, and businessmen  who accompanied the prime minister exchanged views with their  Russian counterparts to study the market and the possibility of  cooperation between the two countries.    Following the visit, ministries, branches, and enterprises  of  Vietnam and Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Russia will work out  concrete plans for more effective cooperation.    Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said upon his return home from  Moscow that Vietnam has resumed its friendship with members of  the Commonwealth of the Independent States on the basis of new  relations.</p>

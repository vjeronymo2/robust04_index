			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / A black and white morality tale: Patti Waldmeir reflects on her time in S Africa Like nowhere else that I have ever lived, South Africa has seared my soul. The grinding agony and the transcendent joys of the past five years, during which I have been Financial Times correspondent in Johannesburg, have touched me in a way that (I suspect) no country will ever do again. I am not a particularly emotional person - my friends say rather a cynic and a pessimist - but South Africa has got under my skin. It is a land of huge, empty beauty, whose people have taught me confusing lessons in the nature of the human spirit: immensely generous and chillingly brutal by turns, they are extraordinary. Apartheid brought out the best and worst in them: it left little room for the mediocre. They have lived one of the most dramatic moments in the history of the human spirit, and I have lived it with them. The liberation of blacks and emancipation of whites from the twin burdens of oppression and guilt must rank as among man's greatest positive achievements this century. I can hardly believe I was lucky enough to watch it happen. From the first, I was fascinated by the political theatre which is South Africa; for nearly a decade, I have made it my life. In 1985, I arrived for my first visit bearing the certain knowledge of good and evil which was the common baggage of most foreigners: the Afrikaner was demon and the African saint; there were no mixed tones in the black and white morality of the place. That vision did not survive my first week. Though the police behaved predictably, shooting at mourners at a township funeral, the same funeral generated an incident which disturbed the simple plot: mourners used the 'necklace' - the South African method of death by means of straitjacketing the body with a burning tyre - to attempt the murder of a man standing near me. Archbishop Desmond Tutu intervened, and the episode ended without bloodshed; still, I found it hard to grasp the primordial hatred that could spur such a deed. I still do. I visited South Africa several times in 1985-86, years of township revolt and state repression which left me certain the place would never escape from its vortex of madness. They were years when I wondered about my own sanity, too: I remember watching from a distant bridge as vigilantes hacked each other to death in the KTC squatter camp near Cape Town; afterwards, I returned to a luxury hotel for a hamburger and a beer. As though nothing - or nothing worth noting - had happened. Over the years, I am ashamed to say, this incongruity ceased to bother me: I would return from some township conflict, take off my bullet-proof vest, relax in my fragrant garden with a chilled glass of Cape wine, and experience nothing other than relief. Or worse yet, I would simply stay in the garden and leave the deathwatch to others. South Africa was designed for that: laid out physically to ensure that the worst black misery was invisible to whites who did not detour to see it; socially structured to permit white masters and black servants to live within metres of one another, yet never cross the gulf of privilege between them; politically constructed so that, with few exceptions, only blacks feared police brutality, the necklace or political murder. Whites had only crime to worry about. But always, the generosity of spirit of many, many Africans, and not a few Afrikaners and other South Africans, defied those divisions. In the time that I have known it, this most divided of societies has made great strides to heal itself. No one - certainly not I - would have believed it possible: reason cannot explain it, nor cynicism grasp it. Today the South African flag, which used to fly only behind barbed wire and sandbags at embattled police stations, flutters in the garden of my neighbour's house in a white suburb. The local radio station provides lessons to its listeners in how to sing the two sectarian hymns chosen to unite this land as a national anthem: Nkosi sikelel i'Afrika (God bless Africa), the liberation anthem, and Die Stem, the theme song of apartheid. Blacks practise singing Die Stem and whites stumble along with the unfamiliar African syllables of Nkosi sikelel i'Afrika. And cynic that I am, my eyes fill with tears. This is not to suggest that South Africa has overnight attained national nirvana. Earlier this month, three men were 'necklaced' in Duduza, the same township where Bishop Tutu prevented the necklacing in 1985. The killings were not political - the three were suspected car hijackers - but they were nonetheless chilling for that. Like many things, they are a hangover from the old South Africa. Whites still grumble about blacks and vice versa; many whites refuse to sing Nkosi sikelel i'Afrika and the black labour federation, Cosatu, sang only the black national anthem at its recent congress. But in so many other ways, the racial divide is being bridged. Most Afrikaners have somehow found ways to adjust to a fate they always believed would be worse than death: rule by the black man. And at least in urban areas, where white and black often share the colour-blind camaraderie of the workplace, race relations have undoubtedly improved. So far, blacks have been magnanimous in victory and whites gracious in defeat. That may change when the real struggle begins - the battle over the redistribution of wealth - but it is a good start. The credit for that goes to all the South Africans who have eschewed the bitterness which one might have thought inevitable under apartheid. But overwhelmingly, it goes to Nelson Mandela, who has charmed even his most committed enemies since the day in May when he stood on the steps of parliament in Cape Town, and placed his hand over his heart in respect for the singing of Die Stem, anthem of his oppression. I wore sunglasses that day to hide my tears from my more professional colleagues, as Mandela gave this extraordinary public signal of forgiveness, while white sharpshooters protected him from roof tops. I have needed my sunglasses often as this strange and wonderful tale of collective liberation has drawn to its conclusion. South Africa will never be the same again - but then, neither will I.

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Nine killed as fighting flares in south Lebanon NINE people were killed in renewed fighting in southern Lebanon yesterday including a 29-year-old Irish soldier with United Nations peacekeeping forces. Guerrillas from the Iranian-backed Shia Moslem Hizbollah militia launched a rocket attack against a hilltop position manned by the South Lebanon Army (SLA), Israel's proxy militia. Hizbollah, which recently won eight seats in the Lebanese parliament, stepped up its attacks after the latest Middle East peace talks closed in Washington last Friday. Four Hizbollah and two SLA men were killed in the initial assault yesterday. Later, Hizbollah guerrillas attempted to pass through a United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) checkpoint manned by Irish soldiers. After being denied passage, the guerrillas fired a rocket propelled grenade at the guard house, killing Corporal Peter Ward. Two more Hizbollah gunmen were killed in ensuing fire. Cpl Ward was the 187th Unifil soldier to die in southern Lebanon since the 6,000-strong force was deployed in 1978.</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Russia looks to closer western ties soon: Meeting of Nato and former Warsaw Pact ministers becomes 'trench warfare' Russia yesterday held out the prospect of a broad and rapid improvement in its relations with the west, but it surprised some western officials by the toughness of its terms. President Boris Yeltsin said in Moscow that he hoped to attend the forthcoming European Union summit in Corfu, and sign a wide-ranging co-operation agreement, and he also expected to play a full part in the political discussions of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Naples next month. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, said in Istanbul that he hoped to sign a military co-operation deal with Nato in the very near future. This fuelled anticipation that the agreement could be sealed before the Naples summit and possibly before the Corfu meeting. However, a meeting in Istanbul of foreign ministers from Nato and its former Warsaw Pact enemies degenerated into an angry five-hour haggling session after Russia held its ground on a series of sensitive points. At Russia's insistence, the ministers in Istanbul dropped language from their final communique that would have held out the prospect of full Nato membership for Moscow's former satellite countries. Nato officials said this did not change the fact that the alliance was still open to central and east European countries, but there was undisguised irritation at the toughness of Russia's stance. Some key procedural questions that need to be solved before Russia's co-operation deal with Nato goes ahead were also left outstanding, and this clouded the prospects for an early signing ceremony in Brussels. Mr Kozyrev insisted that he would only travel to Brussels and sign up to Partnership For Peace (PFP) if the broader relationship betwen Russia and Nato had been agreed in principle and could take effect immediately. 'I can only afford to come to Brussels once,' said Mr Kozyrev, signalling his refusal to accept the procedures which have been required of the other 20 countries that have adhered to PFP, a military co-operation programme devised by Nato. The 20 existing members were told they must sign up first and discuss details later, but Russia has pressed for an informal waiver from this principle. Mr Sergio Balanzino, acting secretary general of Nato, said he expected Mr Kozyrev to come to Brussels and sign the PFP entry form as well as exchanging documents that would record the two sides' understanding of how Moscow and the alliance would work together. Other issues that held up agreement in Istanbul included Russia's insistence on greater freedom of action to mediate in the fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Moscow also held out for diplomatic language that would leave open the possibility of acceptance of Russian demands for an increase in the troop numbers it is allowed under the agreement on Conventional Forces in Europe. The ministers were also forced to drop language that would have welcomed the recent agreement under which nine east European nations were associated with the Western European Union. A senior alliance official described the angry five-hour exchange as 'trench warfare of a kind that should not have disgraced a meeting at this level'. Mr Balanzino said the difficulty of the negotiations might have reflected the fact that Mr Kozyrev and most other ministers had left the conference hall and were allowing senior diplomats to argue their case. He said it was possible that Russia might have shown greater flexibility if it had been represented by Mr Kozyrev in person. However, other alliance diplomats said they saw no reason to doubt the fact that Russia's diplomats were acting on direct instructions from their political masters. 'I have not seen negotiating tactics like this from Russia since we settled the terms for German unification nearly five years ago,' said one diplomat.</p>

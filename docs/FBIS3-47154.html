			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "No Concessions to North Korea"] </F>   [Text] We are paying close attention to news reports that  North Korea has agreed to only a one-time international  inspection of seven declared nuclear sites but has avoided a  much more serious issue -- IAEA [International Atomic Energy  Agency] access to undeclared sites, especially two nuclear waste  dumps needed to verify clearly whether Pyongyang has been  building nuclear weapons.    At this moment we do not expect the U.S. to knuckle down to  the crafty ploys of Pyongyang, whose words have been seen in the  past to bear absolutely no relation with its intentions. Nor  will it allow North Korea to wring out of it concessions in  their negotiations because it will also have learned that the  North, if given an inch, will take a mile.    Despite the reported accord, as U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher pointed out Thursday [6 January] in an  interview, the U.S. and its allies still face some difficult and  sensitive steps before they reach the goal of regular  inspections and a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.    As far as the nuclear issue is concerned, the fundamental  question is whether North Korea has really cast aside its  intention to go nuclear. We are particularly suspicious of what  appears to be North Korea's strategy to sidestep the crucial  issue by allowing only an inadequate single inspection.    It cannot be denied that North Korea has delayed things as  long as possible anticipating a slip in the basic U.S. position  on North Korea which it will exploit for all it is worth.    In this connection, both the U.S. and the IAEA must play  their cards carefully in their separate talks with North Korea,  not unilaterally giving in to North Korea's persistent demand  for U.S. diplomatic recognition and cancellation of the Team  Spirit military exercise. We stand to lose more than we gain if  we resort to a hasty approach in dealing with North Korea.</p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Lloyds rises 29% to Pounds 1.03bn - Acquisition sought to make use of accumulating capital Lloyds Bank yesterday gave a strong signal that it was looking for a suitable acquisition after announcing a 29 per cent rise in 1993 pre-tax profits, from Pounds 801m to Pounds 1.03bn, accompanied by a 20 per cent rise in its dividend. The bank, which failed in its bid to take over Midland Bank in 1992, said that it was seeking a use for its accumulating capital. The equity base rose 14 per cent after the total dividend of 22.1p (18.4p), including a proposed final of 15.5p, was more than twice covered by earnings per share of 47.4p (35p). 'As we accumulate more capital, we remain watchful for an opportunity that will enable us to use this for the further benefit of shareholders,' said Sir Robin Ibbs, chairman. He said the bank would consider 'all types of opportunity'. Lloyds became the third bank to raise its dividend strongly after similar moves by TSB Group and Royal Bank of Scotland. Its ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets nonetheless strengthened further to 6.6 per cent (6 per cent). Problem country debt contributed Pounds 260m (Pounds 193m) to profits, including a net release of Pounds 46m debt provisions. Its portfolio fell from Pounds 2.77bn to Pounds 2.28bn after receiving bonds from Argentina in exchange for loans and past due interest. Overall bad debt provisions fell by 10 per cent to Pounds 505m (Pounds 556m), covering 1.2 per cent of lending. Provisions in UK retail banking fell to Pounds 389m (Pounds 506m), but Lloyds made a Pounds 45m (Pounds 35m) general provision against credit losses this year. The fall in bad debts helped the UK retail bank to return to a profit of Pounds 74m (losses of Pounds 32m). Loan demand was weak, but Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive, said there had recently been a 'very significant' increase in demand for personal loans. Mr Pitman said Lloyds was responding to low interest rates, which had led to customers transferring Pounds 900m out of savings and investment accounts, by training more staff to advise on equity and fixed income savings products. The post-tax return on shareholders equity rose to 21 per cent (17.1 per cent). Mr Pitman said he thought it was possible to sustain this return despite low interest rates. Operating expenses rose slightly to Pounds 2.47bn (Pounds 2.43bn), but the ratio of costs to income fell to 62.1 per cent (64.2 per cent). Mr Pitman said costs would be under pressure because of the need to recruit more highly trained advisers. The bank capitalised on a firm opening in the gilts market to raise Pounds 400m of subordinated debt through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds. The bonds were priced to yield 72 basis points over the 6.75 per cent gilt due 2004. An official at lead manager Salomon Brothers said that although it was well-capitalised it had room for lower tier two capital. It saved between 50 to 75 basis points by raising subordinated debt rather than upper tier two capital. Lloyds Bank shares closed 2p up at 617p. See Lex</p>

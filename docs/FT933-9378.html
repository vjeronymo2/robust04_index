			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Observer: Testing the royal water So you want to get your throne back? Deposed monarchs the world over will be watching with interest the surprise visit to Greece by former King Constantine and his family. The king, who lost his throne in 1967, has stooped to employing a big international public relations company to publicise the symbolism of his return. Judging by the good turn-out for the recent funeral of King Baudouin of the Belgians, the royalty business is doing rather well at the moment and if an ex-king is to make a come-back now is as good a time as any. Burson-Marsteller, which employs some of the world's top spin doctors, has been primed to supply media-friendly answers to the most obvious questions about the ex-king's return to Greece. Hence, the only official significance of the timing of the visit is that it coincides with some of the king's children finishing university and other teaching jobs. As to who is paying for the expedition, all B-M is prepared to disclose is that the royal family are on board a motorboat chartered from a Greek company through a British brokerage firm and are guests of the Prince of Hanover. No mention of the wealthy Greek shipping families who frequent the king's off-shore court in London's Hampstead and would dearly love a return of their monarch. Nor for that matter is there any mention that Constantine is returning to Greece when the government is looking particularly wobbly. If B-M does a good job for Constantine there could be plenty more out-of-work monarchs knocking on its door.</p>

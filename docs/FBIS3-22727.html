Iran turned to a Spanish company to supply it with the  diversion technology known as "Diversion" [word in English]  after it failed in the past to obtain this technology from the  German company Siemens and the Czech company Skoda. Iran  accuses the German and Czech companies of submitting to U.S.  pressure in their withdrawal from the project to offer their  nuclear engineering services. As is known, the Spanish company  dealt in the past with the German company Siemens and it has the  nuclear engineering expertise available to the German company.  The Spanish company participated with Siemens in building the  Bushehr reactors in Iran.    After the failure of its previous attempts to obtain Western  diversion technology, which is more advanced than Russian and  Chinese technology, Tehran was eager to submit its new order for  Spanish technology in the framework of its endeavors to improve  safety levels for the two nuclear reactors it is building with  Russian expertise in Gargar and the two reactors (300 megawatts)  it is building with Chinese expertise in al-Ahvaz.    Nearly a month ago the Iranian Nuclear Energy Commission  signed a contract with the Spanish company, under which the  latter undertakes to provide engineering services for one of the  two Chinese reactors in al-Ahvaz , and a similar contract to  provide the same services for the the Russian Bushehr reactor,  after signing a contract with the Russians to rebuild it. The  deal concluded with the Spanish company totals $80 million.    In the first stage Iran hopes that the Spanish company will  resume building the Bushehr reactor, 80 percent of which has  been completed, before the German company Siemens pulls out of  the project.    As is known, the capacity of this reactor is 1,000  megawatts.    However, Tehran expects now to obtain technology from Spain  to divert the Bushehr and Gargar reactors from civilian to  military use.    Tehran's great interest in these negotiations is reflected  in  the level of its negotiating delegation, which is headed by Reza  Amrollahi [as transliterated], assistant to President Rafsanjani  for nuclear affairs and chairman of the Iranian Nuclear Energy  Commission, his deputy Mahir 'Alizadeh, and Mohammad Kazem  Rasuli, director of the Nuclear Technological Center in Esfahan  (ENTC).    In charge of the negotiations from the Spanish side are the  director general of the Spanish company and his assistant. The  director general of the Spanish company participated with  Siemens in building the Bushehr reactor.    It is worth mentioning that 300-megawatt nuclear reactors  are  technologically capable of being diverted from civilian to  military use.</p>

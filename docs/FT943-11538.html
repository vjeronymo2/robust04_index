			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Johnson Fry back in black with Pounds 2.3m Johnson Fry, the financial services and investment group, returned to profit in the six months to June 30 after last year's restructuring and name change from LIT Holdings. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.25m, compared with losses of Pounds 21.1m which included exceptional losses of almost Pounds 20m resulting from the sale of LIT America. Turnover and operating profits were down substantially, largely because of the ending of the business expansion scheme, formerly one of Johnson Fry's main areas of activity. Turnover was Pounds 18.2m, against Pounds 24.7m excluding the contribution from LIT America. Operating profits of continuing operations fell to Pounds 2.17m (Pounds 6.32m). Mr Christopher Castleman, chairman, said that comparisons with 1993 were meaningless in total 'because of the very material effect on prior periods' figures of BES revenues, the results of the American businesses which were divested last year and the group capital structure prior to the restructuring'. Johnson Fry Property was the best performing division during the six months. Turnover doubled to Pounds 8.83m (Pounds 4.31m), and operating profit rose from Pounds 494,000 to Pounds 3.28m. Properties under management were valued at Pounds 907m (Pounds 665m). Funds under management by the asset management arm rose to Pounds 225m (Pounds 145m), but fell from the Pounds 250m year-end figure despite the launch of one new investment trust. The financial services and insurance services divisions operated at 'about break-even'. The group is still looking for acquisitions, which would be funded through equity issues. Earnings per share were 8.9p (154.1p losses).</p>

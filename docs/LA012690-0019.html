			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SUPER WEATHER DUE FOR SUPER BOWL WEEKEND  </P> <P> Drag the television out into the front yard, get a deck chair and some snacks.  This is one Super Bowl weekend when the weather will be so superb it would be a  crime to spend any of it indoors.  </P> <P> Lots of sunshine and seasonal temperatures are expected through Sunday, said  National Weather Service forecaster Wilbur Shigehara. A cold front passing  through San Diego today will blow away the warm Santa Anas of earlier this week  and make for a very pleasant weekend, he said.  </P> <P> Weak Santa Ana winds will develop tonight to keep things breezy, but they will  not pack much warmth, Shigehara said. Nights will remain on the chilly side.  </P> <P> The normal high for this time of year is about 66 degrees, Shigehara said. The  high at Lindbergh Field Wednesday was 78 degrees, and on Thursday it was 77  degrees.  </P> <P> Beach highs today through Sunday will range from 65 to 68 degrees, Shigehara  said. The surf is at 3 to 5 feet and the ocean water is 58.  </P> <P> Coastal highs this weekend are expected to be from 65 to 70. Overnight lows of  45 to 50 are forecast tonight and Saturday.  </P> <P> Highs inland today will be between 72 and 77 degrees, and between 68 and 74 on  Super Bowl weekend, Shigehara said. Lows will be from 35 to 45 tonight and  Saturday night, he said.  </P></p>

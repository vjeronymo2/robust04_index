			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT UPHOLDS $5.8-MILLION FINE FOR UNION  </P> <P> A state appeals court Friday upheld a $5.8-million verdict against a  Pomona-based union local sued by two men who claim that the union illegally  forced their Chino grocery store out of business during a 1975 strike.  </P> <P> The award, made in 1987 by a Pomona Superior Court jury against a local of the  Retail Clerks Union, now the United Food and Commercial Workers, attracted  widespread attention in 1987 when the local filed for protection from creditors  in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The filing was made after the two men, Peter Vargas  of Walnut and Kenneth Henderson of Chino, moved to attach the union's assets.  </P> <P> Vargas and Henderson sued after closing their Chino Farms Market.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Economic Sciences Z.G. Shirinskaya, </F> professor of the Finance Academy of the Russian Federation  Government, under the rubric "Commentary by a Specialist": "On  Banks' Transition to International Accounting Standards"]    [Text] A shortage of skilled banking personnel, an obsolete  chart of accounts, and the absence of a clear-cut regulatory  base for the accounting and documentation of certain banking  operations are problems that banks are encountering in the area  of organization of accounting. A similar problem exists in  methodological support for analysis of financial reports by  banks. Under the new conditions, banking personnel should not  only ensure that operations are reflected in accounts correctly,  that is, that account-keeping is expert and professional, but  also be capable of analyzing the financial reports they compile,  thus participating in the management of the bank.    The difficult financial conditions under which domestic  commercial banks operate at present: the inflationary  depreciation of credit resources and equity capital, the  stringent, restrictive policy of the Central Bank geared toward  the contraction of credit resources and limitations on credit  outlays, a tax policy that is not conducive to the development  of banking--all these factors are prompting banking personnel to  search for new ways to "survive," which in turn call for complex  accounting solutions, choices, and substantiations of the  patterns for registering operations which are new in principle  in balance-sheet accounts. Among them is documentation of direct  correspondent accounts which make it possible to solve the  problem of not only speeding up client settlements but to a  certain degree also those of interbank credit and the optimal  centralized resource reservation. As a rule, these operations  are combined with trust services to manage funds in clients'  settlement and current accounts. It is necessary for banking  personnel to grasp the essence and economic advantages of new  technologies and management patterns for resources, liquidity,  and risk, and their professional registration in balance-sheet  reports. Deficiencies in the regulatory base for resolving many  technical issues in bank accounting are expressed, in  particular, in the failure to develop a mechanism for writing  off long-defaulted loans and to determine the timing of such  write-offs or for registering the sources of write-offs on the  balance sheet (credit risk funds or the account "Profits and  losses," as well as the schedule for accrual of interest on  long-defaulted loans). It should also be kept in mind that banks  are operating in an extremely difficult foreign economic  environment with heightened risk. As a result, their credit  portfolio is burdened by poor-quality credit. Credit personnel  repeatedly prolongate poor-quality loans; they are not  documented on the relevant balance-sheet accounts for the  registration of defaulted loans. Bank reports documenting credit  risks are becoming less and less authentic in this regard; their  quality is deteriorating. In a number of banks, accounting  personnel abandon the existing favorable tradition to  participate in the monitoring of timely repayment of loans,  their prolongation, or their assignment to the account of  defaulted loans. The accounting of time obligations off the  balance sheet, which was previously commonly accepted by banks,  largely facilitated the performance of this monitoring function;  a number of banks have recently abandoned such accounting  without justification. As a result, operations to issue, repay,  or prolong loans are concentrated in the hands of a narrow  circle of individuals in credit directorates, which does not  further the interests of either authentic reporting or bank  security.    Accounting in commercial banks should be uniform, and should  comply with international standards. The Central Bank has been  taking clearly inadequate measures to speed up the transition to  international accounting standards, to develop a banking  infrastructure, and to ensure the security of document  circulation. Perceiving tremendous financial losses due to the  infiltration of forged advice notes, orders, checks, and so on  into the circulation of documents, commercial banks are just  beginning to engage in systematic work on comprehensive  security, including computer security. In view of inadequate  preparations and the absence of the necessary prerequisites for  a transition to international accounting standards in commercial  banks, two versions of proposals are being introduced: either  incentives from the Central Bank for the voluntary assumption by  the banks of obligations to switch to worldwide standards, or  the use of just some of the standards used in world practice in  the operations of domestic commercial banks. It appears that the  latter noncomprehensive approach may entail unfavorable  consequences. Thus, if reserves are not set aside in line with  credit risk, the volume of reserves is understated, and  simultaneously, accounting for defaulted loans is abandoned, and  the loan obligations are practiced [as published] repeatedly and  without substantiation, bank reports will not reflect real  credit risks, and the balance will cease to be authentic.    The transition to international accounting standards by  banks  calls for producing, as soon as possible, a regulatory document  on the organization of accounting at commercial banks which  would be in line with banking legislation in effect. "Accounting  and Reporting Rules" approved in 1987 are clearly obsolete and  run counter to some of the laws of Russia, in particular, the  Basic Civil Legislation, the Law "On Property in the Russian  Federation," and the Law "On Banks and Banking."    The accounting rules provide the basis for the right of the  Central Bank to debit funds from correspondent accounts of  commercial banks without acceptance, which runs counter to the  laws in question. According to legislation in effect, money can  be debited from a correspondent bank account only on  instructions from the bank itself or by decision of a people's  court or arbitration panel. The right to debit without  acceptance is actually assigned by the Central Bank to other  organizations. In particular, in 1993 the Cash Union in Moscow  enjoyed this right, which caused a strain on liquidity for many  banks and ultimately resulted in large losses.    As can be seen, implementation of the transition to  international accounting standards by banks has begun under  difficult conditions for their operations. However, the issue of  the need to harmonize accounting also affects banks in  conjunction with the appearance of their most successfully  operating segment on the world market and the inclusion of  Russia in the process of worldwide economic integration. At the  end of 1993 commercial banks embarked, on an experimental basis,  on drawing up new financial reports and switching to new  accounting standards. The task of improving the quality of  accounting and the authenticity and dependability of bank  reporting should be accomplished simultaneously. Some of the  main accounting principles highlighting world standards are  outlined below.    1. Continuity of operations.    In keeping with this standard, rules for keeping accounting  records do not change if a bank plans to continue its operations  in the foreseeable future and is not slated for liquidation. In  the event of the projected elimination of branches or the sale  of an asset, reports should reflect the hidden loss that will  occur if the sales value of the assets in question turns out to  be less than the residual value.    2. Fiscal year distribution.    Implementation of this principle requires that the banks  register proceeds and expenditures as they are made, regardless  of the time of the actual receipt of funds. Implementation of  this principle will necessitate opening and keeping a new  balance-sheet account "Accumulated profit plus deferred  expenditures." The reporting of the bank should, as of 31  December, indicate and register in the above account the  accruing interest proceeds for the entire reporting month or  year (rather than for the status as of 20 December, as is the  case now). In the process, the client continues to pay accrued  interest once a month (for example, on the 20th day of each  month). At the same time, the cumulative interest outlay,  regardless of the time of payment of interest on deposits,  should be reflected in the above account in correspondence with  the profit and loss account.    3. Prudence.    The principle of prudence requires that the assets and  liabilities of banks be appraised realistically, with a  sufficient degree of prudence, in order not to carry already  existing risk over into subsequent years. This is particularly  topical for Russian banks because it induces them to project  credit risk and stimulates the generation of reserve funds that  are adequate for the risk in terms of volume and timing. In 1994  this principle was accepted by the Central Bank, and its  implementation in the practice of commercial banks was  recommended. With a view to accounting for credit risk  provisions, account No. 945, with the same name, shall be opened  on the balance sheets of banks; a reserve is generated out of  operating expenditures (it does not influence the size of the  base of taxation). The initial experience of reserve fund  generation by commercial banks has revealed two problems. These  are the striving to understate credit risk and, correspondingly,  the size of reserve funds. In turn, this is largely due to the  procedure for the generation of the fund established by the  Central Bank according to which the volume of taxes paid by  banks is not reduced, but the incentive funds and the dividend  on shares are diminished. As a result, the entire effort to set  aside reserve funds with a view to protecting the banks against  the possible late repayment of loans by borrowers may turn out  to be ineffective. Meanwhile, in international accounting,  accounting entries for reserves of all types are made at the  time the corresponding risks emerge, regardless of the  availability or sufficiency of profits. According to  international standards, profits cannot depend on tax policy,  and tax rules should not influence accounting procedures for the  operations of the bank. It should be taken into account that  banks operate in a difficult economic environment, and that the  bulk of the risk is associated precisely with economic  instability. Under the circumstances, there are no adequate  grounds for the recommendation of the Central Bank concerning  the creation of credit risk reserves after determination of the  base of taxation. Such reserves should be generated out of  expenditures prior to determination of the base of taxation, in  an amount in line with the risk.    Implementation of other international accounting standards,  such as priority of content over form, constancy of accounting  methods, openness (transparency), consolidation, and  substantiveness will require great and serious effort and a high  degree of professionalism on the part of accounting personnel.  It is regrettable that the Central Bank refused to implement an  international accounting standard proposed by the World Bank  which requires that appropriate adjustments in reporting be made  for the index of inflationary depreciation in the environment of  hyperinflation (when the total rate of inflation in three years  exceeds 100 percent).    The transition to international accounting standards should  be accompanied by drawing up new financial reports. It includes  a balance sheet drawn up on the basis of aggregated asset and  liability items, an off-balance sheet report, and explanatory  memorandums which should outline the bank's analytical effort to  classify the credit portfolio and determine reserves and to  manage resources, risk, and proceeds.    Loans (time and defaulted loans) should be presented in the  balance-sheet report as a single, joint total. Procedures for  accrual of interest on defaulted loans for a limited period of  time (30 days) are established. This gives banks the incentive  to write off their balance sheets long-defaulted loans and paper  proceeds (account 943 is overloaded with such proceeds at a  number of banks) and thus makes it possible to make bank reports  healthier and more authentic. In this reference, it is  absolutely obvious that commercial banks need to speed up the  process of transition to worldwide accounting standards which  make it possible to obtain authentic financial reports and,  therefore, improve the quality of bank management.</p>

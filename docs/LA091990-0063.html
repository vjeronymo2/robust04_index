			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: RIGGINS MAKES SUDDEN IMPACT;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: IN FIRST GAME FOR CALABASAS AFTER ABORTED TRANSFER ATTEMPT, BACK  GAINS 208 YARDS.  </P> <P> When Calabasas High running back Damon Riggins dashed toward Agoura last month,  his teammates weren't dashing ahead opening holes.  </P> <P> Instead, their hopes were dashed.  </P> <P> Riggins, a two-year starter at running back and safety, wanted out of the  Coyotes' three-legged program. Calabasas' roster had dwindled from 35 players  to eight at one point this summer, and Riggins wanted to use his deceptive  moves to get out of Calabasas once and for all.  </P> <P> "From what I heard, (my teammates) thought I let them down, and I don't blame  them for being mad at me," Riggins said.  </P> <P> But Riggins was soon back in the Coyote huddle. Agoura and Calabasas are  members of the Las Virgenes Unified School District, and Riggins failed to meet  requirements for an intra-district transfer. After 2 1/2 weeks of practice with  Agoura, he was sent back to Calabasas on Sept. 6. The team -- then 12 players  strong -- voted to accept him back.  </P> <P> "They just told me they were glad to have me," Riggins said.  </P> <P> Riggins, a 5-foot-9, 185-pound senior, was ineligible for Calabasas' opening  game Sept. 7, a 30-13 loss to Bishop Diego, because he had not participated in  10 practices. He regained his eligibility last week and opened the season with  a stunning performance.  </P> <P> Riggins rushed for 208 yards in 19 carries, scored on touchdown runs of 76 and  49 yards, intercepted a pass. In addition, he had a 96-yard kickoff return  nullified by a holding penalty. With Riggins back in the fold, the Coyotes, all  15 of them, defeated St. Genevieve, 28-14.  </P> <P> "Before the game, I couldn't wait to get out there," Riggins said. "I knew my  teammates were questioning whether I was going to take it seriously, and I  wanted to show them I'm out to give 100%."  </P> <P> Riggins, who rushed for 660 yards as a junior, was one of the few bright spots  in a decaying program that was 1-9 last season and 4-16 the past two.  </P> <P> Of the 35 players who participated in Calabasas' spring drills, only eight  appeared for the opening day of practice in August.  </P> <P> Riggins was one of the defectors. He had moved to Agoura, a former Frontier  League rival, pending approval of his transfer. Agoura moved this season to the  Marmonte League.  </P> <P> "I wasn't getting along with some people at Calabasas, and I was making new  friends at Agoura," Riggins said. "It seemed to be a better situation."  </P> <P> Riggins initially strained his relationship with his Calabasas teammates last  spring when he was indefinitely suspended from the team because of an on-campus  incident. His dash west further weakened the relationship.  </P> <P> "I was discouraged, like just about everybody else, but we knew he'd be an  asset," said senior Ron Adelman, Calabasas' quarterback and a team captain.  "When we met to decide about taking Damon back, we had only 13 people on the  team. If we didn't take him back, we were at risk of not having a team, and  that just wasn't worth it."  </P> <P> Riggins sought to solidify his support among his teammates with a strong  showing Friday as a running back and linebacker.  </P> <P> "I felt I had to help out and let them know that I want to play for them,"  Riggins said. "I wish I had been able to help out for the first game."  </P> <P> That thought wasn't lost on Adelman.  </P> <P> "If we had had him the first game, we'd be 2-0," he said.  </P></p>

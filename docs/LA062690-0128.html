			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> HURDLERS: Danny Harris and Edwin Moses are now neighbors. . . . Moses, of  Newport Beach, holds the world record in the intermediate hurdles, and Harris,  his hottest challenger, is the man who broke Moses' nearly 10-year string of  victories in 1987. . . . Harris has moved from Los Angeles to Irvine (C12) and  is training on the UCI track, where Moses has been seen working out. . . . It's  quiet here, Harris says, and a relief from L.A. traffic and smog. Jeffrey A.  Perlman and Barbie Ludovise  </P></p>

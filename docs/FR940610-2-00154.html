			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Commission Review of Exchange Proposals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the review procedures provide the Commission with sufficient opportunity to examine the representations made by an Exchange in connection with its listing of options on a narrow-based index pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A). Specifically, the Commission believes that the seven day prefiling requirement gives the Commission staff an opportunity to discuss with an Exchange whether its proposal to list and trade particular narrow-based index options properly qualifies for effectiveness upon filing. In addition, the Commission finds that the 30 day delay in the commencement of trading of proposed narrow-based index options will provide a meaningful opportunity for public comment prior to the commencement of trading, while also providing the Exchanges with the opportunity to inform market participants in advance of the proposed trade date for a new index option. In accordance with section 19(b)(3)(C) of the Act, if the Commission determines that the rule change proposal is inconsistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, the 30 day delay would allow the Commission to abrogate the rule change before trading commences, which will minimize disruption on market participants. This authority could be utilized if, for example, it is determined that the proposed narrow-based index option does not satisfy the applicable generic listing standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission notes that its ability to review an Exchange's proposal submitted under the procedures outlined herein would not necessarily be limited to determining whether proposed narrow-based index options satisfy the generic standards. Rather, the Commission will have an opportunity to determine whether the proposed index options raise other regulatory concerns that should be addressed before trading commences. For example, the Commission will have an opportunity to determine whether the listing and trading of options on the new narrow-based index will have an adverse impact on the underlying securities markets. <FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> An Exchange, in conjunction with a section 19(b)(3)(A) rule filing to list options on a narrow-based index, must provide the Commission with written representations that both the Exchange and the Options Price Reporting Authority have the necessary systems capacity to support those new series of options to be generated by the narrow-based index. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In summary, if the Commission determines that a proposed index option product does not completely satisfy the generic listing standards, or if based on the foregoing considerations it generally appears to the Commission to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, the Commission, within 60 days of the Exchange's filing, may summarily abrogate the Exchange's rule change and require that the rule proposal be filed with the Commission pursuant to sections 19(b) (1) and (2) of the Act. Although the purpose of streamlining the review of new narrow-based index options by creating generic standards is to facilitate the Exchanges' ability to list such new products as the demand for them arises, the Commission believes nevertheless that its authority to abrogate such a rule change proposal supplies a significant regulatory check on the Exchanges to ensure that these new standards are implemented properly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Changes and Exchange Amendments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule changes filed by the NYSE, PSE, and Phlx, and the Exchange Amendments, prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication on notice of filing thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The rule changes proposed by the NYSE, PSE, and Phlx, and Amex Amendment Nos. 1 and 2, conform their proposals to the CBOE's proposal. Further, the CBOE's proposal was published for the full 21-day comment period, and no comments were received. With the exception of Amex Amendment Nos. 1 and 2, the Exchange Amendments clarify, but do not change, the proposed rule changes. The Commission finds, therefore, that no new regulatory issues are raised by the foregoing proposed rule changes and the Exchange Amendments. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve the NYSE, PSE, and Phlx proposed rule changes and Exchange Amendments on an accelerated basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

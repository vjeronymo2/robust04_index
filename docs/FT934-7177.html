			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (14): Not so obscure objects of desire - Cult objects There are some products which command a loyalty, a reverence which is out of all proportion to their usefulness. These are the ones that somewhere along the line have achieved cult status, that are recognised from Kuala Lumpur to Fifth Avenue, from San Francisco to Tokyo. Each has something to offer which is above and beyond any rational assessment of their worth. REAL CULT objects can be identified by their stamina. Not for them the sudden onset of instant fame and then the humiliating relegation to the dusty back shelves. They have staying power. These are the names and the labels that can be spotted across a crowded room, that draw their owners into a sense of kinship with each other; thus, the Gucci loafer. Ever since it was introduced in 1960 the distinctive loafer with the snaffle on the front has been snapped up by modish dressers, by Sloane Rangers, by Voguettes, and by those who simply love a really comfortable shoe. All through the 1960s it sold as if it were one of life's great essentials. Even in the nightmare years when the Gucci logo became so devalued that its sales figures went into free fall the loafer sailed serenely on. For, as with all objects that leap from mere success to cult object, behind the hype there lay genuine quality. Anybody who has ever slipped on one of those soft, featherlight mocassins recognises that here is the perfect all-purpose luxury shoe. It looks good with anything from Levis to sleek grey flannels or a pinstripe suit. Even Dawn Mello, called in by Gucci to restore its tarnished name, felt little need to tamper with the loafer. Handbags were scaled up and down, gilded Gs taken off everything from belts to luggage, but she made sure that the classic loafer was still available in all its original simplicity. She brought back hand-stitching, insisted on quality, toned down the gilt of the snaffle but the basic mocassin has changed little. The loafer comes in soft novocalf, black, dark brown or larice (tan to you). It costs Pounds 195 for the men's version, at Pounds 170 for women. Those who are prepared to shell out for it say it is worth every penny. Those who cannot are busy buying up the copies that are to be found in every high street.</p>

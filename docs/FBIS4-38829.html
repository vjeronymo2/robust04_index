			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 2 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Asked by an ITAR-TASS  correspondent about the Russian initiative on convening an  international conference on security and a nuclear-free status  for the Korean Peninsula, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said  that the Russian and Korean leaders "are greatly concerned at  what is going on in North Korea, considering how close it is to  Russia's eastern borders." He was speaking at a joint news  conference of the Russian and South Korean presidents today,    "We cannot look with indifference at North Korea's attitude  toward the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, signed earlier, and  we are prepared to take every action," the Russian president  said. At the same time, he said that the issue "is dragging on  and there is still no positive solution."    Boris Yeltsin said that "if the opportunity presents itself,  this question will be discussed with U.S. President Bill  Clinton."    The Russian president believes that it is premature to speak  about sanctions against North Korea, as no decision has yet been  made on convening an international conference on North Korea's  nuclear problem. However, he said, "if North Korea tries to  cancel the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Russia will be  forced to tackle this problem stage by stage. It would first  have to issue a warning, and then the world community would have  to take sanctions in relation to North Korea."    Regarding the 1961 Treaty with North Korea on friendship,  cooperation, and mutual aid, Boris Yeltsin reminded that an  amendment has been made to the first artcile of the Treaty. "It  contains no rigid statement regarding the fact that we are  helping and taking the side of North Korea," The Russian  president stressed.    Boris Yeltsin admitted that the Russian debt to South Korea  now totals 1,400 million US Dollars. President Boris Yeltsin  admitted that the Russian debt to South Korea impedes bilateral  economic cooperation, but nevertheless called on Korean  businessmen to invest in the Russian Far East.    Russia owes South Korea $1.4 billion, and $400 million are  overdue debts.    "This serious problem impedes the development of major  projects between the two states", yeltsin said at the news  conference, citing the construction of a gas pipeline from the  Siberian Republic of Yakutia to Korea as an example. Other  major projects include the development of the Far Eastern port  of Nakhodka and the construction of a trade center in Moscow.  It is important for us that the South Korean president has  shown undertanding with regard to rescheduling the debt, Boris  Yeltsin stressed.    Asked whether Russia intends to take upon itself to pay out  compensation to the victims of the Boeing shot down over Russian  territory, Boris Yeltsin said that this tragedy occurred during  the cold war, and "is complicated by a number of circumstances."  He said that the documents on that prblem have been handed over  by the Russian side to the international commission, which  concluded that "the primary party to blame was the crew of the  KAL airline company, which must accept responsibility."    Regarding the problem of North Korean workers in Russia,  Boris Yeltsin said that "every foreigner on our territory has  the right to leave Russia if he so desires."    Touching on the nuclear problem with regard to the DPRK,  President Kim Yong-sam stated during the joint news conference  with the Russian president that the leaders of the two states  agree on "the need for complete transparency" with regard to  suspicions that the DPRK is developing nuclear weapons. Both  presidents, Kim Yong- sam noted, agree to maintain constant  contact with one another on this problem, with the aid of a  special telephone line.    Kim Yong-sam told correspondents that he has invited Boris  Yeltsin to visit the Republic of Korea in the near future. The  dates of the visit, he said, would be agreed by diplomatic  channels.    Kim Yong-sam attaches "historic significance" to the fact  that Boris Yeltsin has given him archive documents connected  with the war in Korea between 1950 and 1953. The ROK president  stated that he is extremely satisfied with his visit to Russia  and said he has favorable impressions of Moscow and the  capital's residents, in connection with the changes being  brought about by the reforms.</p>

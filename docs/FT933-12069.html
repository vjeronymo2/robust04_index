			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Turkey reviews its spheres of influence: Ankara is raising its profile in regional and Middle East affairs WHEN a senior US strategist allots Turkey a prominent role in American Middle East policy a few raised eyebrows should be expected in Ankara. Surprising then that there was so little Turkish press comment after such an assessment by Mr Martin Indyk, a key adviser to the Clinton administration; a measure perhaps of how Turkish opinion has absorbed the changes wrought by the Gulf war. Turkey is tentatively assuming a higher profile across a broad range of policies, from the Arab-Israeli dispute, to the region's water problems and the unresolved issue of Iraq and the Kurdish question. Underlining the point, Mr Hikmet Cetin this week becomes the first Turkish foreign minister to visit Israel. Part of Ankara's apparent willingness to assume a greater regional role is no doubt tactical and comes from a realisation that its application to membership of the European Community is stalled and its future in European security structures unclear. But the strategic arguments for rethinking policy are also compelling. In the wake of the Gulf war, Turkish officials have come to accept that even a threat to the security of a distant Gulf state has a direct impact on Turkey. This perception is the main reason for the Dollars 4bn Turkish Defence Fund, set up to boost Turkish defence capability. The turning point was the late President Turgut Ozal's decision, taken against domestic opposition, to allow the US to use Turkey's bases in the war with Iraq. If there is now to be a regional solution in the wake of any Arab-Israeli peace settlement, Turkey will have an important role, controlling as it does two of the region's main rivers, the Euphrates and the Tigris. Certainly a few years ago it would have been unthinkable for an Arab minister to suggest that Turkey had a role in the Middle East peace process. It would have been equally unthinkable for a Turkish minister to welcome such an idea. But Arab governments have been acknowledging Turkey's weight in the region - as did Mr Talal Al-Hassan, Jordan's minister of state for foreign affairs, when Mr Cetin arrived in Amman, on the first stop of his five-day regional shuttle. More broadly, Turkey offers itself as a model of moderation, an economic and military power both Moslem and secular, and a long-time US ally. The US for its part has helped nurture a thaw in Turkey's relations with the Syrians. Conversely while US relations with Iran remain frozen, Turkey provides an informal conduit for US interests particularly on the commercial side, where Turkish subsidiaries of US companies are doing lively trade with Tehran. But considerable difficulties remain, not least the Turkish perception that its immediate neighbours are helping forment Turkey's own Kurdish problem through support for the Kurdistan Workers party, the PKK. At its crudest, Turkish diplomacy towards the Arabs has been a form of damage control. Recent efforts to win Syrian assurances on curbing PKK activities have come to nothing. The breakdown of a short-lived ceasefire in May is in part attributed to Syrian disappointment at the failure to make progress on talks towards a final allocation of the waters of the Euphrates. Many Turks still disapprove of moves to strengthen links with Moslem neighbours and there is some anxiety that Turkey's increased involvement in the Middle East could divert its energies from its overriding goal - to be part of Europe.</p>

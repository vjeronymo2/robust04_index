			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Contracting out saves civil service only Pounds 100m: Market-testing brings smaller than expected drop in costs SAVINGS from contracting out civil service work have been much smaller than expected when the market-testing programme was launched 18 months ago. In a Commons statement, Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, said that market-testing - which puts civil service work out to competitive tender - had so far produced savings of about Pounds 100m. This compares with the Pounds 375m which would have been saved if the programme had achieved its targets. Savings are running at 14 per cent of the value of the work, compared with the 25 per cent figure predicted at the launch. Tendering has been completed on just Pounds 700m of work, less than half the Pounds 1.5bn target set for the end of September. Mr Waldegrave said further work worth Pounds 300m and currently carried out by 35,000 civil servants, would be market-tested in the coming year. Next year's programme includes many items not completed in the first round. A 'substantial further tranche' of the first year's programme would be completed shortly, he said, including the Pounds 250m contract for managing the Inland Revenue's computers. Around 10,000 civil service jobs would go as a result of the first year's market-testing, Mr Waldegrave said. Most would be redeployed to other civil service work, while some would be transferring to companies which had won contracts. Market-testing has been dogged by delays, particularly over the employment rights of staff whose jobs are contracted out to the private sector. Contractors have also accused the civil service of dragging its feet and failing to realise the efficiency savings possible from contracting-out. The results of the first round of market-testing show that the civil service has been successful in holding on to much of the work put out to tender. In-house teams won 57 per cent of the bids by value, and 91 of the 150 contracts awarded where there was a competition between the existing staff and outside contractors. In Customs &amp; Excise, just three of the 14 contracts were won by outside contractors - all in support services. None of the VAT debt management work, currently done by regional collection offices, went outside. Yesterday's announcement came amid mounting complaints from private sector companies bidding for work. Writing in the FT yesterday, Mr Charles Cox of Hoskyns, the information technology company, said the programme had been implemented in ways that undermined the potential for savings. The number of private sector bidders would diminish unless the government addressed the problems faced in winning bids. Another bidder said yesterday that some departments had made it very hard for outside bidders to win. 'We've been pitching into bidding like lambs to the slaughter,' he said. The savings of about Pounds 100m would recur year after year, according to Mr Waldegrave. Spectacular gains had been achieved in some parts of the programme. Mr Michael Meacher, Labour's Citizen's Charter spokesman, said the savings had not come from improvements in services. Work-to-rule, Page 12</p>

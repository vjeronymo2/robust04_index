Analysts said the report was in line with the economic  "soft landing" sought by the Federal Reserve Board -- slow but continued growth  with low inflation.  </P> <P> Inventories often rise during slow economic growth as production exceeds  demand, a process that sometimes leads to a loss of jobs as businesses cut  their output.  </P></p>

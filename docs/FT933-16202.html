			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / International Company News: Rover plans strong North American drive LAND ROVER North America has outlined to its 80-strong dealer network a strategy to quadruple sales of its UK-built four-wheel-drive vehicles in the US. Plans to lift annual sales to 16,000, from just over 4,000 last year, depend heavily on the success of the Land Rover Discovery model, which is to be launched in North America early next year. Currently, dealers are selling only the luxury Range Rover and high specification versions of the utility Land Rover Defender. The company, part of the British Aerospace-owned Rover Group, is calling for a substantial structural change in the dealer network to cope with the expansion. Mr David Schworm, vice-president, has told dealers by letter that Land Rover wants as many as possible to drop their practice of selling its products alongside other luxury vehicle franchises - known as 'dualling' - and set up large outlets selling exclusively Land Rover's vehicles. These 'Land Rover Centres', of which the company would like about 30, would have sales territories covering many square miles and would operate 'satellite' showrooms under the same ownership. The concept, aimed at preventing Land Rover dealers from having to compete against each other, has been pioneered - with considerable success - in North America by General Motors' Saturn subsidiary. However, Saturn is a volume franchise. Dealers in other more up-market makes have traditionally resisted their manufacturers' pressure for exclusive outlets, arguing that they do not offer adequate returns. Such resistance is understood to lie at least partly behind Mazda of Japan's decision last year not to proceed with setting up a separate luxury car sales channel - Amati - at a time of economic recession. The Discovery, which is expected to sell for some Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 20,000) in the US, compared with Dollars 40,000 upwards for the Range Rover, is expected rapidly to take the lion's share of Land Rover's intended 16,000 total annual sales in North America. Earlier this month it was announced that Honda, which has a 20 per cent shareholding in Rover, was to sell the Discovery under its own badge in Japan, where it will be known as the Honda Crossroad.</p>

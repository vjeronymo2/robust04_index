			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Accountancy Column: Hopeful travellers should not miss boat next time - How audit opinions could be backed by other action to prevent another Land Travel debacle A SHORT probing letter arrived earlier this week at the office of a small firm of chartered accountants in Bath, in the latest investigative salvo from Mr Nigel Griffiths, the Labour party's international trade and consumer spokesman. It highlights the much broader issue of the adequacy of the government's existing mechanisms for detecting signs of trouble in companies - particularly those which are of public interest because they have many employees or a large number of individual customers. The subject of Mr Griffiths' letter was Land Travel, the tour operator which went into liquidation in July leaving more than 200 irate customers out of pocket and without their holidays. The accountancy firm was Shaw &amp; Co, the auditor to the company. The question was simple: what steps did the firm take to draw the attention of the public and the authorities to the financial plight of the company? Shaw &amp; Co is keeping silent about its response at present, while the partner most involved in the audit is away on holiday. But it has said it will provide an answer. Meanwhile, Mr Griffiths has already had a detailed response from Price Waterhouse, which was auditor to the company until August last year. The Land Travel case does not lend itself to the all too frequent charge levelled against the embattled accountancy profession: where were the auditors? In this case they appeared to be very much in the forefront. PW's letter to Mr Griffiths is instructive for two reasons: it is damning, and it is based on public information. The firm says its audit opinion for the financial statements for the six months to March 31 1990 was 'extensively qualified'. It said it could not be satisfied that the company was a going concern because liabilities exceeded assets by Pounds 2.1m; nor was it certain that Pounds 1.6m of debts and deferred expenditure were recoverable. 'Our audit opinion is unambiguous and expresses very clearly our concerns about the viability of the company,' the letter continues. The information it cites is, as the firm points out, on the public record in the accounts filed with Companies House, the government's corporate information agency. So is the subsequent - and unusually long - audit opinion for the year to March 31 1991, from Shaw &amp; Co, which concludes that the firm is unable to state whether the accounts present a true and fair view. It stresses that the company had made a loss of Pounds 1.8m and had net liabilities of Pounds 4.1m, offset by long-term loans of Pounds 2.4m and a statement by Mr Valere Tjolle, the director, that he was confident that the company's trading position had since improved. In fact, just one month after this statement was signed, Mr Robert Buller and Mr Michael Gerrard of Grant Thornton were appointed as liquidators. They told creditors that there was little chance of receiving any of the more than Pounds 12m they were owed. Despite the warnings in the accounts, the news clearly came as a great shock to most of those members of the public attending the meeting, including one who poured water over Mr Tjolle and another who threw torn copies of the company's brochures into his face. With hindsight, there were a number of warning signs in the accounts which creditors and potential creditors could have read which might have caused them to query any exposure to Land Travel. First, there are the auditors' qualifications and the notes and figures in the accounts. Second, the fact that Price Waterhouse - one of the largest UK firms - resigned last year as auditor to be replaced by a local firm. Third, that the accounts were filed extremely late: the 1989 and 1990 years were signed off and delivered to Companies House together in July 1991. There is also a confusing saga in the previous few years of changing ownership, altered financial year-ends, loans from the holding company, and a previous period in which Shaw &amp; Co was auditor. Both the auditors and the Department of Trade and Industry take satisfaction from the fact that all this information is available to the public. But the likelihood of ordinary customers of a company being able to find it out or interpret it is minimal. The DTI says that it is has certain discretionary powers to investigate companies, but it must have substantive information before taking action - and that there were no complaints with regard to Land Travel in advance of the company's collapse. It argues that it would be impossible to scrutinise all the 1.1m sets of accounts filed each year. Meanwhile, Companies House performs an essentially clerical function, ensuring that accounts are filed but spending very little time scrutinising the information they contain. The question is whether a more active system of detection and scrutiny is required. After all, if Land Travel had been a quoted company, it would probably have been suspended from the stock market and investigated, and generated wide publicity, because of its net liabilities. Should not a similar system be in place for non-quoted companies? A start would be for Companies House to regularly and publicly circulate lists of companies which have not filed their accounts on time, have changed auditors, moved year-ends or which show qualified audit reports. The agency has already considered offering 'triggered' searches which would alert users as soon information is received from companies. But its recent decision to cancel its ambitious computerisation project which would have allowed documents to be electronically scanned and 'read' will make this difficult in the short-term. A more practicable option - favoured by Mr Griffiths - is for a change in guidelines to require auditors to alert regulators to the accounts which they qualify. Only about 6 per cent of audit opinions were qualified or contained special comments last year according to a recent survey, meaning a far smaller pool from which to start work. There would also clearly need to be a unit - probably within the DTI - to cope with the extra work involved in dealing with these notifications and investigating the companies concerned. There would have to be clear guidelines about exactly what questions they could ask, what action could be taken. A wider issue is exactly how far the government should be involved in this process. But a strong case could certainly be made for those companies with influence over many members of the public, whether employees or customers. Mr Robert Buller, the joint liquidator for Land Travel, is sceptical of these proposals. He believes that the trade creditors to the company were aware of the financial position, and that the DTI does not have the resources to cope with all the additional scrutiny which would be required. In his view, a more pressing case for reform to help the individual customers affected by the collapse would be compulsory bonding for travel agents. However, Mr Bill Morrison, chairman of the Auditing Practices Board, is receptive to the idea of drawing attention to qualified accounts, although he says it would probably require a change of legislation. He suggests that there might be an 'accounts ombudsman' to which auditors would send copies of any accounts they qualified for further investigation once the information was lodged with Companies House. 'It would be a load off auditors' minds,' he says.</p>

Except for the requirement that the issuer of the underlying linked security must be a U.S. company, the listing requirements for ELNs linked to a security issued by a non-U.S. company will be the same as those set forth above with the following enhancements: <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  (1) Section 107B of the Guide is being amended to clarify that the trading volume requirement refers to U.S. trading volume; <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  (2) the term of such ELNs shall be limited to between two and three years; (3) either (i) the Exchange must have in place a comprehensive market information sharing agreement <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  with the primary exchange on which the underlying security is primarily traded (in the case of ADRs, with the primary exchange where the security underlying the ADR is traded), or (ii) at least 50% of the market for the underlying security and all related securities <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  for the six months prior to issuance must occur in the U.S. market; <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  (4) if linked to an ADR, the ADR must be sponsored; (5) there must be a minimum of 2,000 holders of the linked security; (6) the ELNs issuance may not exceed (i) 2% of the total shares of the underlying security outstanding provided at least 30% of the worldwide trading volume for the security for the six-months prior to listing occurred in the U.S. market, (ii) 3% of the total shares of the underlying security outstanding provided at least 50% of the worldwide trading volume for the security for the six-months prior to listing occurred In the U.S. market, or (iii) 5% of the total shares of the underlying security outstanding provided at least 70% of the worldwide trading volume for the security for the six-months prior to listing occurred in the U.S. market; and (7) no ELN may be listed if the U.S. market for the underlying security accounted for less than 30% of the worldwide trading volume for the security and related securities during the prior six months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment No. 6,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 5. As opposed to an unsponsored ADR, a sponsored ADR is established jointly by the issuer of the underlying security and a depositary. With a sponsored ADR, the depositary is generally required to distribute notices of shareholder meetings and voting instructions to ADR holders, thereby ensuring the ADR holders will be able to exercise voting rights through the depositary with respect to the underlying securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The exchange defines a non-U.S. company as any company formed or incorporated outside of the United States.

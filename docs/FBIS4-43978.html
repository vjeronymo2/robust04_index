			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special  representative in Cyprus, arrived this afternoon and will meet  President Glavkos Kliridhis tonight. [passage omitted]    Clark said there is a feeling that the entire effort was  never devoted exclusively to the confidence-building measures  [CBM's] and that it has always been, in the UN's judgment, an  essential way to begin the resolution of more substantive issues.    He denied that he was unwilling to take over the new mission  in Cyprus, saying: I had a difficult schedule in Canada, to  which I will return permanently in one month, and it was  difficult to get away. He added, however, that he wanted to come  to Cyprus and he hopes he will have constructive talks.    He avoided giving details of what he will discuss with  Kliridhis and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas. He also  avoided commenting on UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's  reference to the need to find alternative ways of promoting a  Cyprus solution. He added that we need goodwill from all sides  to get some movement on the issue. [passage omitted]    A DIKO [Democratic Party] statement on Clark's arrival in  Cyprus mentions that this is another effort to find a formula  that will represent Ankara and Denktas as accepting the CBM's.  DIKO calls upon the UN secretary general, the British, and the  Americans look to Ankara and Denktas for a just solution instead  of pushing us to make concessions to the Turkish positions and  demands. DIKO said it is angry about this stance and concerned  about the course of developments on the national issue. The  party reiterated its adamant opposition to the  confidence-building measures.    A Socialist party EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus]  statement expresses concern at the continuing activity by UN  envoys regarding the CBM's. On Clark's visit, EDEK mentions  that this does not aim to find a new procedure but to modify the  measures to help the Turkish side and put pressure on the  Cypriot Government to accept an amendment to the 21 March UN  document. In its statement, EDEK says it is time to declare the  CBM's dead and to turn our attention toward convening an  international conference to discuss the substance of the Cyprus  issue on the basis of international law.</p>

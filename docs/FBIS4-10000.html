			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 5 Apr (EFE)--There were many demands to  introduce the democratic system in Cuba during the first day of  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's official visit to  Montevideo. Robaina is seeking support for the Cuban regime.    Uruguay's President Luis Alberto Lacalle received Robaina  for  half an hour on 4 April, but made no comments on the meeting.  Sources close to the president confirmed to EFE that one of the  things the two officials discussed was the democratization of  the Cuban regime.    Deputies from various parties also made comments in that  regard. The Congressional International Affairs Committee held a  one-hour meeting with the Cuban foreign minister behind closed  doors. Deputies who attended the meeting, as well as members who  did not, commented on the matter.    Out of a total of 12 committee members, three did not  attend.  The three said "they did not want to meet with the  representative of a dictatorial regime."    The three legislators absent were Broad Front (leftist  coalition) Deputy Francisco Rodriguez Camusso; committee  chairman Oscar Magurno of the Colorado Party of former president  and new presidential candidate Julio Maria Sanguinetti; and  Colorado Party Deputy Daniel Garcia Pintos.    Among the deputies who attended the meeting, Hector Lezcano,  of the Christian Democratic Party, said he told Robaina that the  Cuban Government should "embark on a democratic opening program  leading, in the near future, to the establishment of a  multiparty system in the country."    Committee member and Colorado Party Deputy Guillermo  Stirling  said he attended the meeting because "talking is the best way to  show leftist and right-wing radicals which is the best path."    Robaina answered that Cuba respects human rights, does not  have political prisoners, and the government is willing to  preserve the essential characteristics of what was achieved  during the 34-year period that started on the date of the  revolution.    Robaina admitted that the economic inefficiencies of the  Cuban system have forced them to open their market to foreign  investments, adding that economic changes on the island  "continue day by day," and that today 100 companies already have  investments in Cuba.    It was known that President Lacalle asked Robaina today  about  the debt of $33 million the Cuban Government has owed to  Uruguayan entrepreneurs since 1986.    The Cuban foreign minister said that his country does not  have the cash to pay back that debt, adding that Cuba could  cancel the debt with pharmaceutical and sanitary products.    Robaina will be received today by his Uruguayan counterpart  Sergio Abreu. The Uruguayan foreign minister has also publicly  mentioned that he intends to remind Robaina about the need to  repay the debt.    Robaina will stay in Montevideo until tomorrow, and will  then  visit Ecuador, Peru, Paraguay, and Argentina within the  framework of his government's "Latin American offensive." This  initiative seeks to obtain regional countries' support against  the U.S. "blockade" and private investments in the island.    The Cuban foreign minister's youth and dynamism has prompted  various communication centers to consider him as "President  Fidel Castro's probable successor."</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Chrysler's debt outlook now 'stable' STANDARD &amp; POOR'S, the US credit rating agency, yesterday gave Chrysler, the financially-stretched US automotive manufacturer, a boost by changing its rating outlook from 'negative' to 'stable'. The move follows a year of downgradings of Chrysler's debt by the credit agencies. Chrysler currently ranks below investment grade. Standard &amp; Poor's said it had made the change because of Chrysler's recent issue of up to Dollars 850m of new convertible preferred stock in a private sale to investors. The agency said this materially improved the company's near-term financial flexibility. The proceeds of the issue, together with Chrysler's existing cash position, saleable assets, and access to bank credit, meant 'financial flexibility should be adequate at least for the next one to two years'. However, it added that negative cash-flow this year, due to persisting weak car markets, would leave Chrysler ill-prepared to meet future challenges. 'The ratings,' it said, 'still reflect concerns about Chrysler's long-term staying power.' General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, the 'Big Three' US auto manufacturers, have formed a partnership to carry out research on the recycling of car parts. About 75 per cent of a car consists of metal, which is usually recycled. The study will examine recycling the remaining 25 per cent, made of materials such as plastic, rubber and glass. 'Through the partnership, we hope to avoid duplication of effort and expense, while enhancing scientific knowledge,' said a spokesman for the team.</p>

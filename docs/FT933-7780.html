			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Acquisition boosts Credit Suisse CREDIT Suisse, the flagship bank of the CS Holding financial services group, has reported a 67 per cent jump in consolidated profits before taxes and provisions in the first half of 1993 to SFr2.4bn (Dollars 1.59bn), and forecast 'good profits' for the full year. The profit growth rate was flattered by the inclusion, for the first time, of the results of Swiss Volksbank, which was acquired by CS Holding for SFr1.6bn in mid-April. Excluding the Volksbank contribution, Credit Suisse's pre-tax profits grew by 51 per cent. Like Union Bank of Switzerland, which last Thursday reported a 58 per cent rise in first-half profits before taxes and provisions to SFr2.76bn, Credit Suisse said buoyant trading income was the main contributor to its growth. The group's profits from securities and foreign exchange trading nearly doubled to SFr1.53bn, with 20 per cent of the growth coming from the addition of Volksbank's trading results. Trading, which has long been a strong point at Credit Suisse, surpassed lending to become the group's largest source of earnings. The inclusion of Volksbank business accounted for roughly half of the 47 per cent gain in commission income to SFr1.23bn, and provided all of the 27 per cent gain in net interest income to SFr1.51bn. Group expenses jumped by 38 per cent to SFr1.99bn, with Credit Suisse's own costs rising only 8.7 per cent. Credit Suisse said that the process of uniting the two banks had been progressing well. Expenses were lower in the second quarter than in the first, indicating that synergies were already occurring. Credit Suisse did not reveal a figure for bad loans provisions at the interim stage. However, it said that the difficult business climate and continuing structural adjustments meant that substantial provisions would again be necessary. Last year's provisions rose 34 per cent to a record SFr1.5bn. The acquisition cost of Volksbank was roughly SFr640m below the disclosed net worth of the bank. Credit Suisse subsequently realised SFr170m through the sale of Volksbank shares held in Volksbank's own treasury. It has since transferred the remaining SFr472m of this 'badwill' from the bank's capital reserves to a special provision to cover anticipated restructuring costs. The group's total assets reached SFr229.4bn at the end of June, 33 per cent higher than at the end of last year, mainly as a result of the Volksbank acquisition. This almost certainly means that Credit Suisse has surpassed Swiss Bank Corporation to become Switzerland's second-largest bank after UBS, with total assets of SFr290.7bn at the end of June. CS Holding, which also owns Bank Leu and other banks, has become the largest.</p>

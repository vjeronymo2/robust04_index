			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Restructured Borthwicks Pounds 2m in the red BORTHWICKS, the flavourings maker, yesterday reported a swing from profits of Pounds 1.29m to losses of Pounds 1.99m pre-tax for the 12 months ended March 27 at the end of 13 years of restructuring. The deficit mainly reflected the one-off cost of disposing of loss-making meat interests and concealed operating profits on continuing operations of Pounds 1.97m (Pounds 1.53m) after stripping out losses from businesses now sold. Comparisons have been re-stated to comply with the FRS 3 accounting standard. Losses per share emerged at 3.8p (earnings 1.8p) but a proposed final dividend of 0.7p lifts the total by 9 per cent to 1.2p (1.1p). Mr John Thomson, chairman, said: 'A serious profit haemorrhage has been staunched and Borthwicks is now moving forward unencumbered in its chosen field of natural flavours.' Borthwicks said it now produced a range of flavours, some of which were popular with cave men in prehistory, while others were aimed at the new age community. Recessionary conditions pushed turnover down to Pounds 43m (Pounds 44.4m). The figure included Pounds 17.4m from discontinued operations - Burton Son &amp; Sanders, the bakery business, Consumer Products, the prepared meals maker and Ringer abattoir, which have all been sold. The company reported net exceptional charges of Pounds 2.65m relating to the final stages of the restructuring. Interest payments fell to Pounds 614,000 (Pounds 707,000). Gearing declined to 44 per cent (67 per cent).</p>

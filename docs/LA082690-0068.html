			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USING THE U.N. TO SETTLE MIDEAST CRISIS  </P> <P> The Times is correct in calling attention to the oil industry's renewed attempt  at offshore drilling in environmentally sensitive areas. These areas have  unproven reserves and where oil is found it is in such small quantities as to  be negligible in the entire energy picture.  </P> <P> No, drilling off the California coast and areas such as the beautiful,  biologically productive and very fragile Arctic National Wildlife Refuge must  remain off-limits to the environmentally destructive oil industry.  </P> <P> This country must develop a credible energy policy incorporating conservation,  new energy sources and maximum exploitation of existing supplies. Great strides  in energy conservation have been made in this nation, but as other nations have  shown, particularly Japan, we can do much more without compromising our  comfortable lifestyle. Increasing the fuel efficiency standards is a wise first  step.  </P> <P> A little leadership from Washington, is that too much to ask?  </P> <P> VANCE R. EWALD  </P> <P> Grand Terrace  </P></p>

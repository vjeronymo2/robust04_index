			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mobil returns to Vietnam HISTORY TURNED full circle in Ho Chi Minh City yesterday when Mobil Oil executives arrived to take part in a trade show in the city. They were greeted with open arms by Vietnamese officials who believe that after an absence of nearly two decades, their arrival shows Mobil's eagerness to get back into Vietnam. The last time Mobil executives were in this city, it was called Saigon and it was the capital of South Vietnam. That was in January 1975, when Mobil became the first company to find oil off the coast. Three months later, however, North Vietnamese tanks rolled into Saigon and Mobil got out. After the war Vietnam set up a joint venture with the Soviet Union to exploit the oil that Mobil had discovered and Soviet technology has been pumping out Vietnamese oil ever since. Now, a team from Mobil is back in Vietnam, led by regional Vice President Mr Bob Aberbach. This week they are exhibiting the company's wares at PetroVietnam 93 and Mobil has already bid for a production-sharing contract on the Dragon field, which will soon be awarded by the state oil and gas corporation. The US trade embargo against Vietnam still prevents American companies from doing most kinds of business in the country, but under the recently relaxed rules of the embargo, American oil companies can go a long way towards exploring potential fields. 'We can sign production-sharing contracts, carry out exploration drilling and appraisal drilling, which is the first stage in any production-sharing programme,' Mr Aberbach said. He added that this process could take anything from two to five years. Mobil hopes its past ties with Vietnam will give the company an edge in trying to secure part of the Dragon field and Mr Aberbach admits Mobil has a historical soft spot for Vietnam. Many of his colleagues from other companies believe, however, that the potential for oil production in Vietnam has been greatly exaggerated. They say that unless more evidence emerges soon of major reserves, it is unlikely that Vietnam will ever fulfil its much-hyped promise. One executive even suggested that Vietnamese officials might have falsified some of the evidence they produced to inflate the apparent potential of the country's fields.</p>

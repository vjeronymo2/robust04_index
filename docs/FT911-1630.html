			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: Three executives quit US arm of NatWest THREE more senior executives have resigned from the troubled US operation of Britain's National Westminster Bank, which is in the throes of a shake-up aimed at restoring it to profits, writes Martin Dickson in New York. The three are Mr Brendan Dugan, president and chief executive of National Westminster USA, the group's banking subsidiary in New York state, and two of his senior lending officers. The New York bank has suffered a heavy exposure to the depressed north-eastern property market, including loans to Mr Donald Trump. The bank's US operations are being shaken up by Mr John Tugwell, a main board director from London, who last month took over as chief executive of National Westminster Bancorp, the group's US holding company, from Mr Bill Knowles, who resigned in March. National Westminster Bancorp reported a Dollars 190.9m first-quarter loss last month, forcing the UK parent to inject Dollars 150m of fresh capital into the business. Mr Tugwell is to assume Mr Dugan's duties until a successor is named. Mr Dugan, aged 43, had been with the bank since 1974 and had headed the New York unit for the past two years. The other two departures are Mr Allan Schreiber, 50, and Mr Richard Fitzpatrick, both responsible for areas of medium-sized lending. The New York bank is NatWest's main US operation, although it also has substantial interests in New Jersey. Mr Tony Warren, a senior NatWest executive from London, has been appointed chief operating officer of the US holding company. The London bank yesterday filed a 'shelf offering' with the US Securities and Exchange Commission which would allow it to offer up to Dollars 500m of American Depositary Shares - paper of a non-US company which wishes to issue stock in America. The company said the proceeds of the dollar preference shares would be directed to Natwest USA.</p>

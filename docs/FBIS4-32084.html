			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Zhan Videnov, chairman of the Bulgarian </F> Socialist Party Supreme Council, by Teodora Encheva; place and  date not given]    [Excerpts] [Encheva] Mr. Videnov, do you want to be prime  minister?    [Videnov] I want Bulgaria to have a lasting, efficient, and  leftist-centrist government. I think that the voters will soon  resolve this issue. I have often said that Bulgaria will hardly  be an exception to the other East European countries, where the  composition of leftist-centrist cabinets is formed after complex  coalition negotiations that often have an unexpected or  unconventional result.    [Encheva] I meant your personal ambition.    [Videnov] I have neither sick ambitions nor an inferiority  complex. Both the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] and I could  cope with such a challenge. [passage omitted]    [Encheva] Why did you sacrifice Georgi Pirinski as a member  of the BSP Executive Bureau? You know that he will not work  together with Doncho Konakchiev and Nikola Koychev. He  repeatedly stated that their economic policy concepts are  incompatible with his. Could you comment on him withdrawing his  candidacy and resigning as deputy chairman of the BSP  parliamentary faction?    [Videnov] Georgi Pirinski did not know the entire membership  of the Executive Council, but he was informed about Doncho  Konakchiev and Nikola Koychev. I am sure that this is not the  reason he withdrew his candidacy. I rather think that his  personal decision was influenced by the plenum's discussion,  which showed that the new membership is firmly determined to  implement the congress decisions regarding early elections in  the fall.    [Encheva] Do you mean that Georgi Pirinski does not want  elections?    [Videnov] Only he could answer this question. I think that  his decision was influenced by certain economic measures that  the cabinet and parliament are adopting now. They could produce  a positive effect in the fall, if we have political stability.  However, it would be an illusion to hope that things will  proceed at a good pace in the legislative sphere. I would not  dramatize his resignation from the post deputy chairman of the  parliamentary faction, because he said that he wants to work in  the Supreme Council organs, and as far as I am concerned, I will  help him. [passage omitted]    [Encheva] Could you say when there will be elections?    [Videnov] The elections issue must be resolved this year.  Theoretically, this proposal was already discussed by the BSP  leadership last fall. Now we are certain that early elections  will take place.    [Encheva] Prior to the congress you were more categorical  regarding having the elections this fall....    [Videnov] Technically, the end of October-beginning of  November is the best time for elections. Afterward it will be  too late to develop an election campaign, form a new cabinet,  prepare the new budget, and so forth. Naturally, not all  political forces take those criteria into consideration and  surprises of all kinds are possible. Therefore, the degree to  which one could be categorical is limited. [passage omitted]    [Encheva] Do you think that the influence of Aleksandur  Lilov and Andrey Lukanov over you has decreased after the 41st  BSP Congress?    [Videnov] The influence of noted BSP figures over party  policy has always been implemented through their participation  in the party's leading organs and not through the party chairman.    [Encheva] Do you think that Aleksandur Marinov will form an  ideological current within the BSP, as he said in his STANDART  NEWS interview?    [Videnov] No, I do not think that our ideological  differences  are that great. The BSP does not need a new ideological  current. The time when inner party and personal problems were  resolved in such a manner is over, therefore, I think that such  a step has a very low probability. I think that this is rather  intensified activity on the eve of the referendum on the party  program. I assume that Mr. Marinov will be among the  participants in the discussion related to the party program.  [passage omitted]</p>

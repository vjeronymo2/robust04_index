			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: AMP offshoot alters Japan stock portfolio AMP Asset Management, the investment management arm of the Australian insurance company, said yesterday that it has completed Dollars 650m-worth of trades in the last four days, in a restructuring of its Japanese stock portfolio. The trade, completed by Morgan Stanley, is believed to be one of the largest rebalancings of an actively managed Japanese portfolio. The trade consisted of 73 stock positions across 21 accounts. The changes were initiated by Mr Zac Bharucha, AMPAM's new Japanese portfolio manager, and comprised changes in specific stocks, rather than a shift in the weightings of specific sectors.</p>

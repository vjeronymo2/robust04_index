			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Bowater interim profits rise 19% BOWATER, the diversified packaging and printing business newly installed in the FT-SE 100 index, produced a 19 per cent improvement in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 62.4m as it successfully digested recent acquisitions and improved operating margins. But the company warned that the outlook for the second half remained uncertain in Europe although it expected continued improvement from its operations in North America. Mr Norman Ireland, chairman, said: 'It could be described as unnecessary these days for a chairman to say that world economic conditions remain difficult. However, that is the position that applies to Bowater's operations.' Group turnover from continuing businesses rose 23 per cent to Pounds 706m in the six months to June 30 and operating profits were 31 per cent up at Pounds 61.1m. Mr David Lyon, chief executive, said the packaging market was suffering from deflationary pricing and rising costs. But these pressures were largely offset by partnership arrangements with long-term customers. 'If you go for quality, service and quick response then price drops down the list of priorities. The inventory chain has now shrunk permanently, I believe, because of technological advances,' he said. DRG Packaging and Cope Allman Packaging, two companies bought in March for Pounds 444m, bolstered Bowater's sales and enhanced earnings largely thanks to cheap acquisition financing. Stripped of their contribution, Bowater's sales grew just 2 per cent. Profits by division were: packaging and print Pounds 40.7m (Pounds 32.8m); coated industrial films Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 8.4m); building and engineering Pounds 8.1m (Pounds 4.6m); and tissue Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 600,000). Mr Lyon said Bowater had invested heavily at the bottom of the economic cycle and should reap the rewards when conditions improved. Bowater's fully diluted earnings per share rose 7 per cent to 22.3p following its one-for-three rights issue in March. The interim dividend was lifted 9 per cent to 9.7p. The company is proposing a share split. Mr Lyon said Bowater would consider making 'bolt-on' acquisitions. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] We just received a press communique from the  Albanian Foreign Ministry which states: Today, 3 May 1994, the  official meeting between the Albanian Foreign Ministry  delegation led by Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi and the Greek  Foreign Ministry delegation led by Greek Foreign Minister  Karolios Papoulias was held in Zurich, Switzerland, a meeting  decided upon long ago to analyze Albanian-Greek relations  following the terrorist action against a recruit training center  in Peshkepi on 10 April 1994.    During the meeting, the Albanian delegation stressed that  the  Albanian democratic government considers Albanian-Greek  relations to be very important not only at the bilateral level,  but also for the whole region. It has shown goodwill for the  normal and useful development of these relations on the basis of  the principle of reciprocity and noninterference in each other's  internal affairs.    Nevertheless, the Albanian delegation pointed out that  unfortunately, we determine that we have recently been  confronted with a series of incidents and provocations, but  there is no precedence for the 10 April act of terrorism. The  furious reactivation and conspicuous and uninhibited  aggressiveness of the Vorio-Epirus chauvinist circles, the  irresponsible anti-Albanian statements issued by several  high-level Greek state personalities, the exploitation of  certain elements of the Greek minority in Albania to achieve  expansionist ambitions, the provocative interference -- contrary  to every diplomatic ethic -- of Greek diplomats in the internal  affairs of the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church and the  Albanian state, the absence of a serious commitment by the Greek  Government to throw light on the tragic event in Peshkepi and  make criminals legally responsible underscore these incidents.    The Albanian side asked the Greek Government to immediately  take measures to prevent the frenzied warmongering propaganda of  radio stations installed in southern Greece, Corfu, and Konjice,  and publications by the Institute of Vorio-Epirus Studies in  Ioanniana, which call for making territorial claims so far as to  include armed intervention against Albania, as well as the  measures necessary so that the terroristic acts are not repeated  in the future. Its public stance should be clearly dissociated  from the absurd chauvinistic claims directed toward the south of  Albania.    For his part, after assessing Albanian-Greek relations to be  very important, the Greek foreign minister reiterated his  willingness to cooperate for a rapid normalization of bilateral  relations and assented that the Greek Government will fulfill  the aforementioned demand.    Concerning the investigation of the event, the Albanian side  insisted that the Greek side agree to an investigation from an  international unbiased commission, assessing that both sides  should be interested in an objective and impartial assessment of  evidence.    For his part, Mr. Papoulias objected to the Albanian side's  opinion and, referring to the Ioannina meeting between the  Public Order Ministries of both countries, proposed the  activation of a joint commission between the relevant Public  Order Ministries.    The Albanian side explained that the freeze on the execution  of the decision to reduce Greek Embassy staff does not mean its  non- execution and stressed that, within a reasonable deadline  and in conformity with the Vienna Convention provisions, the  staff of the representations of both countries will be reduced  to the extent necessary for their normal functioning at the  present level of relations.    During the meeting, they also discussed other aspects of  Albanian-Greek relations, such as Albanian economic emigration  in Greece, border administration between both countries, the  presence of Albanians since earlier times, and the Cam issue in  all its aspects.    The Greek foreign minister laid stress on the reactivation  of  the joint Albanian-Greek commission and the need to open a  branch of the Greek National Bank in Tirana, and also referred  to the draft agreement on seasonal employment that the Greek  side has furnished to the Albanian side.    The Albanian delegation stressed that the Albanian side is  studying the aforementioned issues and pointed put that the  draft agreement on seasonal employment does not solve the  question of legalizing the Albanian present economic emigration  in Greece.    For its part, the Greek side confirmed that this draft  agreement will provide the legal framework for the future, but  it will also be a basis for future emigration.    In conclusion, both sides expressed the sentiment that the  climate of Albanian-Greek relations has been aggravated, and all  efforts should be made to create an atmosphere of bilateral  confidence.    The Albanian side stressed that it does not acknowledge  responsibility for the situation created in these relations and  that, as always, it will be ready and willing to render, through  dialogue, constructive assistance to normalize relations between  Albania and Greece, which are in the interest of relations  between both countries and the entire Balkan region.</p>

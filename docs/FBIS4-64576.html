			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Axel Hofmann/Guenter Stauch article: "Forward March?"] </F>   [Text] "We can only keep this up for another two or three  years, and then we can close shop." Such views from  high-ranking officers are typical of current moods inside the  Bundeswehr.    The cause of this is not just the difficult debate about the  future personnel level of the Bundeswehr. Officer  dissatisfaction mainly concerned equipment -- the Marder tanks  that have become museum pieces, and the Leo tanks that can only  be preserved by being reconditioned. Added to these are  antiquated combat and transport aircraft and elderly vessels.    Commanders are annoyed because the Bundeswehr is being  treated increasingly like "the nation's savings bank," a  sentiment echoed by the SPD's [Social Democratic Party of  Germany] Karsten Voigt. With a shrinking Bundeswehr personnel  level, the defenders of Germany are going to find it  increasingly difficult to do their duty -- that of guaranteeing  Germany's security in the NATO alliance. The red pencil is  attacking from all sides. It is mainly major equipment and  urgent projects that are suffering.    The targets of the relevant people in the Defense Ministry  are rather high. The 1994 white paper says: "The Bundeswehr  must be capable of contributing at short notice to the combating  of possible international crises and conflicts together with our  partners and allies. It must have sufficient reserves and  strength for currently the most improbable and most unfavorable  scenario, the defense of Germany and the alliance." There is a  huge gap between these expectations and reality. Says Peter  Kurt Wuerzbach, former state secretary of defense: "It is  remarkable how soldiers overcome difficulties by means of  improvisation and initiative."    A retired lieutenant colonel says that "what the political  leadership is doing to the Bundeswehr" is the reason for the  increasing deficiencies in the defense sphere. Even Joerg  Schoenbohm, a confidante of Defense Minister Volker Ruehe with  the rank of secretary of state, stuck his neck out very far at  the latest Defense Industry Conference. The former general  criticized the fact that the proportion of the defense budget  allocated for investment purposes has fallen from 30 percent in  1990 to 22 percent.    With such a level of spending, the long-term equipping of  crisis-reaction and defense forces so that they may fulfill  their tasks, and an efficient armament industry, cannot be  guaranteed, says Schoenbohm. This has been a burning issue for  the Luftwaffe, navy, and army chiefs for a long time. For years  they have been shouting about the need for new, modern weapons  systems in order to meet the noble objectives of the political  leadership, but with little success, as the inventory shows.    The army is the hardest hit. Geared for decades to the  defense of German territory, this branch of the Bundeswehr is  now expected to make a significant contribution to international  crisis control. Says the white paper: "With its strength, the  army can undertake tasks within a broad spectrum of future  operations, from the defense of Germany and its allies, right up  to participation in humanitarian and peace missions."    But the reality is as follows: Once the 649 30-year-old M-48  tanks have been scrapped by 1995 in compliance with the Treaty  on Conventional Security in Europe, the army will only have  2,007 Leopard 1 tanks left. But even these are 30 years old;  258 of them have been reconditioned. Even the successor Leopard  2 tank is being permanently reconditioned in order at least  partially to meet the modern requirements for heavy track  vehicles. The crisis-reaction forces are also to be equipped  with these vehicles.    The army is setting high hopes in the modern mobile  armor-plated 2000 howitzer. Its predecessor, the M 109-G  howitzer, has already been in the service of the fatherland for  three decades, most of this time in repair workshops.    The army is worried that there are only enough funds to  acquire 185 of the Model 2000 howitzers, instead of the 760  required, and that they will be given to the crisis-reaction  forces, which is giving rise to fears of the emergence of a  two-tier army. The Luftwaffe is flying into the next century in  a state of crisis. The Eurofighter 2000, desired so strongly by  the Luftwaffe Command, is incapable of escaping from political  flak.    There has also been no cease-fire following the maiden  flight  of the technically and tactically proven Fighter 90. This  aircraft is flying off into a turbulent future after a delay of  almost two years. Even the former supporters of the  7-million-German Mark [DM] project now have doubts as to whether  the Eurofighter is "politically and militarily survivable." The  Luftwaffe only expects to receive 140 Eurofighters, which are to  protect German airspace from 2002 onwards.    Unless the new fighter is shot down by the autumn  parliamentary elections, it will replace the F-4 Phantoms, which  are now over 25 years old. These U.S. veterans, 150 are still  operational, will be scrapped by 1996 as part of the combat  upgrading scheme.    Fortunately, the heritage of the GDR National People's Army  includes the neglected but quite efficient MiG-29. Two dozen of  these machines, brought up to Western standards, should last at  least another 12 years.    On the other hand, it is uncertain how long the workhorse of  the transport division, the Transall C-160 D, will continue to  fly. Luftwaffe experts doubt whether it can meet the growing  demand for a modern transport system, as the Bundeswehr Command  hopes it can. In any case, this aircraft will soon celebrate  its 25th birthday. Its possible successor, the multinational  Future Large Aircraft [previous three words in English], exists  only on the drawing board.    The men on the high seas are not free of problems either.  But they have fewer problems adapting to new tasks. "We do not  need any transport capacity, and are quite well-equipped," says  Captain Manfred Hartmann, naval spokesman at the Defense  Ministry. In the autumn, the navy will receive the  "Brandenburg," the first of four new Type 123 frigates, each  vessel coasting DM585 million.    But there is a storm brewing even in the navy. The planned  Type 124 frigate, the navy flagship for about the year 2004, is  currently sailing in choppy waters. Instead of the planned four  vessels at a price of DM650 million each, the officers in  Gluecksburg, Kiel, and Wilhelmshaven are expecting to receive  only three. Thus, the three 25-year-old Luetjens-class ships  are destined to see ignominious service beyond the threshold of  the next century.    Even under water there are problems. The 18 Type 206  submarines, 12 of which have been modernized, have been  operating for 20 years. For a long time now, the budget planners  have been torpedoing plans to build four modern Type 212  submarines, to the horror of the suffering shipyards.    New business is simply impossible with the Bundeswehr.</p>

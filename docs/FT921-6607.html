			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Palestinians in hard line on peace talks PALESTINIAN delegates yesterday went into the third session of Middle East peace talks insisting they would only discuss Israeli settlements and what they described as human rights abuses in the occupied territories. They ridiculed the Israeli plan for Palestinian self-rule presented on Monday, calling it an attempt to negate the whole purpose of the peace process. Israel planned to bring in the first of its experts yesterday to analyse issues involved in its proposals for interim self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation, said the scheme put forward by Israel was a tactic to use the peace process to reorganise the occupation. By proposing two separate legal systems for the West Bank and Gaza, for Jewish settlers and Palestinians, Israel was trying to legitimise the annexation of the territories and set up a formal apartheid system. Efforts are continuing in Washington to find a formula allowing Israel access to Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.7bn) loan guarantees requested to settle immigrants from the former Soviet Union.</p>

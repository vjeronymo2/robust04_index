			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa said Friday he will urge China to cooperate in  implementing measures which may be imposed by the UN Security  Council against North Korea over its alleged nuclear weapons  development.    At a press conference after a cabinet meeting, Kakizawa said  he will make the request when he meets Chinese Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen in Beijing on Sunday. He also said he will call for  Beijing's influence in persuading Pyongyang to change its stance.    In talks between Qian and South Korean Foreign Minister Han  Sung- chu on Thursday, China refused to endorse sanctions as a  means of breaking the deadlock over North Korea's suspected  nuclear development. Kakizawa, who will visit South Korea on  Saturday prior to his China trip, said he will ask Han about the  details of his talks with Qian.</p>

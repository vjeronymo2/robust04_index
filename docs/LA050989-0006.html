			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISGUIDED REFORM EFFORT  </P> <P> Proposition 13, the 1978 initiative measure promoted by Howard Jarvis and Paul  Gann, launched the taxpayer revolt in California with an exceedingly complex  and far-reaching tax law, only part of which dealt with rolling back and  limiting the property tax. There are significant portions of Proposition 13  that need to be corrected, while maintaining a reasonable limit on homeowner  levies. But another blunderbuss voter initiative measure is not the way to fix  the defects of Proposition 13 or to provide needed tax reform in California.  </P> <P> Such an initiative is being drafted by Voter Revolt of Los Angeles, the  organization that sponsored Proposition 103, the auto insurance measure  narrowly approved by voters in 1988. It would create a split property roll in  California, allowing businesses to be taxed at a higher rate than the 1% now  applied to both commercial property and homes. The business rate would be  raised to 2.2%, and business assessments could grow at a faster rate than those  of homes. The basic homeowners' rate would remain at 1%.  </P> <P> The proposal would raise $9.4 billion a year, Voter Revolt officials said.  About half of that would be earmarked for "California life style" programs such  as housing and to generate additional revenue for local government. The other  half would finance an increase in the homeowners' property-tax exemption and  renter tax credits. The higher exemption would result in a $500 property-tax  cut each year on houses valued at less than $1 million.  </P> <P> Many of these goals are worthy ones. There is a need for more moderate and  low-cost housing in California. Local government is desperate for more revenue.  There is a substantial argument in behalf of a split-roll property tax on the  basis of equity, including evidence that business has received proportionately  more tax relief from Proposition 13 than homeowners.  </P> <P> But an initiative measure, where voters have only the choice of yes or no, is  not the proper way to write complicated tax law. Modern initiative campaigns in  California do not provide for a serious discussion of such complex issues. Nor  is this the way to allocate and earmark massive amounts of tax revenue. And the  Voter Revolt measure apparently would not correct one of the biggest flaws in  Proposition 13, the growing disparity in property taxes levied against homes  remaining in ownership since 1978 and homes that have sold more recently.  </P> <P> Since Proposition 13 is part of the state Constitution, it can only be amended  by a vote of the people. The preferred manner of doing this is approval of a  proposed amendment by two-thirds of the members of the state Assembly and  Senate, a process that provides for extended debate, technical examination and  development of consensus through negotiation and compromise.  </P> <P> California voters, of course, would find it difficult to resist the allure of  cutting their own taxes again through an initiative, and some might enjoy  socking it to business. But whenever such an initiative petition begins to  circulate, they should think carefully about the unexplored implications of  such a drastic plan and respectfully decline to sign it.  </P></p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Time for USAir to face the music  -Labour cuts could be its last chance It is so long since USAir, the sixth biggest US carrier, made an annual profit that shareholders must have forgotten what it feels like. On Monday, they learned that this is not the year in which their memories are going to be refreshed. Not only did USAir dash hopes that it would share in the recovery taking other big US airlines into modest profits; it warned that its sixth consecutive year of losses would take it even more heavily into the red than last year's Dollars 349m pre-tax. The serious question now facing USAir's shareholders - and none more so than British Airways, which has spent Dollars 400m since early last year to buy and maintain a 24.6 per cent equity stake in the airline - is what future awaits such a poorly performing company in a market suffering so badly from overcapacity. The precedents do not augur well. More than 100 airlines have gone bankrupt since the US airline industry was deregulated in 1978, many of them bigger and better known than USAir. Braniff International, Eastern Airlines, Trans World Airlines and Pan American World Airways are just a few. Nor has the cut-throat competition in the US domestic market shown any signs of alleviating. If anything, it has grown worse, as overcapacity has enabled new operators to enter the industry by picking up redundant aircraft and crews on the cheap. USAir's main markets are in the eastern US. Its primary hubs are in Charlotte, Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Philadelphia, all of which have direct flights to New York's JFK international airport where they connect with British Airways flights. USAir has always suffered the disadvantage that its routes are predominantly short-haul in an industry where the revenue-to-cost ratios are more favourable on long-haul routes. Until recently, however, it had drawn comfort from the fact that many of its routes were effective monopolies. That started to change last year when Southwest Airlines, the biggest and most successful of the new breed of low-cost airlines, moved into its market, setting up a rival hub in Baltimore. Things got worse in January when Continental Airways, fresh out of bankruptcy with a new, low-cost structure, announced that it was introducing its so-called Peanuts Fares to many routes in the east. USAir was left with no alternative but to slash its own fares, which it duly did last month. But the inevitable consequence will be that its already very serious losses will grow still further, unless it can significantly cut its costs - and that means getting its labour unions to accept drastic cuts in jobs, wages and conditions of employment. Seen against that background, it becomes clear why British Airways is threatening not to fulfil its agreement to take its stake in USAir to 44 per cent in the next four years by investing another Dollars 450m. Until now, USAir's labour unions have had little reason to accept the need for drastic cuts because if the airline ever got into really serious trouble, British Airways would be there. Now, British Airways has taken that security away. Within hours of these developments on Monday, USAir's management had met representatives of its four labour unions and asked them to start talks. Some indication of the scale of the cuts that will be needed can be gleaned from the fact that its operating costs of 11.2 cents per available seat mile in last year's fourth quarter were more than 50 per cent higher than those of its competitors. If the experience of other large US carriers offers an example, one likely outcome of the negotiations will be a deal under which a substantial proportion of the airline's equity is sold to its employees in return for labour concessions over a period of years. Under similar deals, employees have already taken 37.5 per cent of Northwest Airlines and 45 per cent of a restructured TWA, and are due to receive 53 per cent of United Airlines. Such action may be the least unattractive alternative. Mr Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment bank, points out that no US airline yet has lost as much as USAir without either reaching a deal with its unions - or going bankrupt.</p>

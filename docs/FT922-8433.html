			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Personal View: A dose of market reform The Conservative government's market-oriented reforms are transforming the provision of public services in Britain. Advocates of markets or quasi-markets usually support them on the grounds that they promote efficiency, improve responsivness and accountability and expand the range of opportunities and choices open to users. Critics argue that they may have such effects under certain favourable circumstances, but that those circumstances rarely arise in the provision of welfare services. area, that Markets, critics add, generally have other, undesirable consequences, notably increased inequalities and that administration and other transaction costs that may offset gains in efficiency. More precisely There are four specific conditions that which must be satisfied if these reforms are to achieve their ends without adverse consequences. First, the market structure must be competitive on both sides, with many providers and purchasers. Competition is the engine of efficiency; if dissatisfied purchasers cannot take their business elsewhere, or if providers are at the mercy of monopolistic purchasers, incentives for efficiency or responsivness are reduced, and providers are driven into other activities. Second, both sides purchasers and providers need access to cheap, accurate information, particularly concerning costs and quality. Providers must be able to cost their activities so as to be able to price them appropriately. Purchasers must be able to monitor the quality of the service they are purchasing so as to limit the opportunity for providers to reduce costs by surreptitiously lowering quality. Third, providers must be motivated at least in part by financial considerations. If, instead, they are not, if they are public duty, motivated largely by a sense of public duty, they will not respond appropriately to market signals. Finally, there must be restricted opportunities for 'cream-skimming' - discriminating in favour of the less expensive user. Providers must not be able to avoid discriminate against the expensive costly or the troublesome user - the chronically ill patient, the incontinent, confused elderly person, the disruptive child from a deprived background. If providers can select for their clients the relatively healthy, the competent and the easily educable, that is, if they can skim off the cream, then welfare services will not reach those who need them most. It is too early as yet to say definitively whether these condition are being met in practice. in the services concerned. However, preliminary studies at the University of Bristol, the London School of Economics and elsewhere indicate some disturbing signs. In the case of health authorities, the typical market structure, far from being competitive, is often closer to a bilateral monopoly, with a single purchaser and, at best, a few providers. Also, purchasers are heavily dependent on the providers for information; and they have few mechanisms for monitoring quality. In community care, the quasi-market is more competitive on the provider side but, as with health care, there are substantial information gaps. In response to this, purchasers often prefer to contract with voluntary organisations, whose non-profit motivation makes them less likely to exploit their informational advantage and to engage in cream-skimming. However, precisely because such organisations are not largely motivated by profit, profit-maximisers, they lack the incentive to minimise on costs. be cost-minimisers; Hence any gains due to their reluctance to exploit their monopolistic position may be offset by a reduction in efficiency due to the absence of incentives for cost-minimisation. minimising costs. The situation with respect to concerning GP fund-holding and education is rather different.  In the case of education, the market structure does seem to be broadly competitive both for providers and purchasers. on both sides (although entry and exit into the market is limited). Also, the information gap is less than in other areas. (although it still exists). Moreover, there do appear to be signs of some, surprisingly rapid, changes in behaviour in the direction that theory would predict, with parents exercising their opportunities for choice and schools being motivated to make financial surpluses. However, there also appear to be preliminary signs of cream-skimming, with schools setting up formal or, more commonly, informal, means of selection. GP fund-holding also appears to have considerable potential for improving efficiency. The quasi-market is competitive on both sides. Even More important, GPs have access to the best possible information concerning the quality of care. they can assess a patient's health before he or she goes into hospital and they can assess it when he or she comes out. On the negative side, the costs to providers of negotiating with large numbers of fund-holders is high. And there is an obvious danger of cream-skimming by fund-holders in their selection of patients, although as yet there is little sign of this actually happening. None of this is to suggest that these changes have failed. The systems they these reforms are designed to replace replaced also had their inefficiencies and inequities. The re-election of the Conservatives last month election result means that the reforms will be given time to work their way through. We will then be Only then will it be possible properly to assess whether quasi-markets in the provision of welfare services are the way forward to a more efficient and more responsive system, or a retrograde move towards commercial exploitation and greater inequality.

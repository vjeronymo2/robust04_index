			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 24 (YONHAP) -- The National Conference  of Union Representatives (Chonnodae) threatened on Friday to  enter general strikes at major industries across the country  unless the government sets free arrested train operators and  meets other union demands promptly.    In a press conference at the social service hall of Sungsil  University, Chonnodae leaders said that if their demand goes  unheeded, the unions of about 100 industries would go on general  strikes beginning next Monday.    The strikes will begin at some 30 firms including Hyundai  Heavy Industries Co. and Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery  Co. where unionists have already voted for strikes.    The Chonnodae leaders claimed that the use of police force  against the striking train operators early Friday morning was  "an express illegal action."    They then demanded the immediate resignation of Home  Minister  Choe Hyong-u, release of arrested train operators and  recognition of Train Operators Union (Chonkihyop) as an official  dialogue conduit.    The Train Operators Union (Chonkihyop), too, vowed on Friday  to carry on their strike unless the police release all the  persons arrested and apologize for use of police force against  their striking unionists.    Choe Chi-hwan of the union told reporters at the Christian  Hall at Yonji-tong that his union, however, asked the Korean  National Council of Churches (KNCC) to mediate between them and  the government based on their demands.    Meanwhile, the Seoul Subway Corp. reacted furiously against  subway workers' strike on Friday, suing 41 unionists actively  involved on charges of violating the law on labor disputes.    The Corp. also relieved 24 leading union officials of their  duties.    Corp. President Han Chin-hi warned that striking workers  should report to work by 11 A.M. Saturday or face disciplinary  actions including dismissal.</p>

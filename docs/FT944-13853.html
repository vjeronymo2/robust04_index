			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Telecoms union supports pay test British Telecommunications plans to introduce team-based performance-related pay for nearly 30,000 engineers if an experiment in the Nottingham/Derby area succeeds. The company hopes that between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of an engineer's pay will be based on performance appraisal. The main BT union, the National Communications Union, is cautious about performance pay but has backed the experiment involving 100 of its members. The experiment is linked to other changes in working time and introduces the idea of engineers acting as part of the salesforce, with commission paid for any new business that they pass on from a customer. During the trial individuals will receive a Pounds 100-a-month bonus in lieu of overtime. The experiment comes at a difficult time for the union, which has faced criticism from activists over the acceptance of a new system of flexible working time. BT's experience with performance pay for managerial grades has been an uncomfortable one. After various experiments since the late 1980s a new system was introduced in May last year, only to be abandoned this year when it threatened to become too expensive. A provisional system introduced for managers paid about 80 per cent of them an unconsolidated bonus.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BACKLOG FIGURE FOR S.D. COURTS RAISES DOUBTS  </P> <P> The San Diego Superior Court cut its backlog of civil cases awaiting trial by  75% last year, recently released statistics indicate.  </P> <P> The astounding cut would seem to dramatically highlight the success of the  controversial "fast-track" plan, which pushes judges to speedily resolve civil  cases. First put into practice in San Diego, it has been closely watched by the  rest of the state.  </P> <P> The cut is all the more amazing because it occurred during a year that saw all  civil trials in San Diego come to a screeching halt for three weeks. Not only  that, other county courts reported slight increases in the number of cases they  had waiting for trial, the statistics indicate.  </P> <P> The problem is that the San Diego court's judges and managers don't believe the  numbers.  </P> <P> "If somebody told me I reduced the caseload in that year by 20%, I would be  ecstatic. And I think we probably did that," said Judge Michael I. Greer, the  court's presiding judge last year.  </P> <P> "But to have reduced the caseload by 75% in one year is not the real world."  </P> <P> Greer and San Diego court administrators conceded that they generated the  numbers, which they passed on to the state, which dutifully reported them. They  also acknowledged that they have a good, but not firm idea about why the  figures might be wrong, can only guess at what the true numbers might be and  are scrambling to figure out the true picture.  </P> <P> So, at a time when the state report should be a point of pride for the San  Diego court and Greer's leadership, he is left, once again, to deny charges  that the three-week moratorium on civil trials was not a pressure ploy designed  solely to secure more judges for the county -- which it did. "I was not crying  wolf," he said.  </P> <P> And, though the report should provide empirical support for the efficiency of  the "fast-track" plan, Greer, one of its primary proponents, is left to fret  about whether the statistics will instead spark a public-relations fiasco and  jeopardize expansion of the fast-track program around the state.  </P> <P> "It hurts the system to have inappropriate figures like that," Greer said.  "Then people wonder about everything. It's unfortunate. I'm rather taken aback  by it."  </P> <P> According to the figures, the San Diego Superior Court reported 9,141 civil  cases "awaiting trial" on June 30, 1988. At the end of the next fiscal year, on  June 30, 1989, the San Diego court counted 2,249 waiting cases, a 75.4% drop.  </P> <P> The statistics were published Jan. 5 by the Judicial Council of California,  which administers the state courts. They were taken from monthly reports sent  by the courts themselves to the state agency's San Francisco headquarters, said  Mike Kramer, a spokesman for the Administrative Office of the Courts.  </P> <P> By contrast, the eight other Superior Courts that were ordered by law to begin  a "fast-track" program beginning in January, 1988 -- a year after the plan  began in San Diego -- reported that the number of cases awaiting trial went up  by a combined 4% from June, 1988, through June, 1989, according to the Jan. 5  report.  </P> <P> Those eight courts include other counties with large backlogs, including Los  Angeles, San Francisco, Orange and Sacramento.  </P> <P> Superior Courts that voluntarily instituted a "fast-track" program in 1988  recorded a 6% increase, according to the tables. All other Superior Courts  reported a 23% increase.  </P> <P> Because the San Diego figure is so dramatically down when other counties' are  up, Ron Titus, the director of research and statistics for the Administrative  Office of the Courts, said he "would definitely suspect something is wrong  there."  </P> <P> And yet both Titus and Pearl M. Taylor, executive director of central  operations for the San Diego Superior Court, confirmed that the state agency  only printed what the San Diego court sent it.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying it's not true," Taylor said. "It's a gut feeling it's not  true."  </P> <P> A court deputy, she said, has been assigned to figure out what might be wrong  -- and, if there's a discrepancy, to calculate the correct figures. The "strong  feeling" among the court's managers is that there may be a discrepancy caused  by a change in computer software, she said.  </P> <P> Court managers suspect the problem is not with the June, 1988, figure  indicating 9,141 cases awaiting trial, but with the June, 1989, count of 2,249  -- which should be "more like 7,000," said Kenneth Martone, executive officer  of the San Diego court.  </P> <P> Court staffers hope to have a clearer picture by the end of the week, Martone  said Monday.  </P> <P> All of this might never even have been noticed in previous years because the  tables detailing the number of pending cases were printed in the spring as an  appendix to the Judicial Council's annual report. Buried among reams of  statistics in the back of a fat, bound book, the "awaiting trial" category  rarely drew public attention.  </P> <P> This year, however, the Judicial Council published on Jan. 5 a slim volume  listing the "awaiting trial" tables -- along with information on filings,  dispositions and criminal convictions -- for all state trial and appellate  courts.  </P> <P> "The worst thing that can happen is to have statistics like that come out and  have someone say, 'How did you do it?' " Taylor said. "We have to say, 'We  didn't do it.' "  </P> <P> That answer is especially galling, she said, because the success of the  "fast-track" program is being measured, in large part, by what happens in San  Diego. The program began in San Diego in 1987, a year before it was taken up  anywhere else in California.  </P> <P> The program pushes San Diego judges to conclude 90% of civil cases filed after  January, 1987, within 12 months. The court's most recent statistics indicate  that it is meeting the 90% goal at the 24-month mark, Greer said, much better  than the four years it used to take to get a case to trial but not what the  program demands.  </P> <P> The fast-track programs are to be reviewed at the end of 1990 by the state  Legislature, which, after watching San Diego's experience with it in 1987,  ordered it extended in 1988 to the eight other counties with large backlogs and  urged other counties to experiment with it.  </P> <P> "I would bet we had a very significant reduction in our backlog," Greer said.  "But, to me, significant would be, just guessing, 20%."  </P> <P> The publication of the 75% figure, meanwhile, has renewed debate over Greer's  move in February, 1989, to halt civil trials because of an overwhelming backlog  of criminal cases. Civil cases resumed three weeks later, after Gov. George  Deukmejian named seven San Diegans to the Superior Court bench.  </P> <P> "I had to get out those criminal cases," Greer said. "I was down five judges  and in trouble in crime. The minute I got those judges assigned, I could go  back to work. I think those cases are too important to play games with them."  </P> <P> The number of criminal cases awaiting trial rose from 691 in June, 1988, to 848  in June, 1989, a 23% increase, according to the Judicial Council tables.  </P></p>

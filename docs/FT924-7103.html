			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Observer: Up and over One clue to the recent decision by British insurers to exclude terrorism as a risk covered by commercial insurance policies is the sheer enormity of the loss arising from last April's Commercial Union bomb in London. Hard to believe, but the Association of British Insurers now estimates the CU-related losses at Pounds 750m, a figure which exceeds the sum paid out for all terrorist damage in Northern Ireland since the troubles started. Since the late 1960s the government has paid out around Pounds 620m to compensate property owners for damage. Losses peaked in 1976-77, when the payout amounted to Pounds 50m. After falling steadily to Pounds 15m in 1986-87, the bill last year amounted to Pounds 33m.</p>

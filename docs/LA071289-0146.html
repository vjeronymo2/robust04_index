			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PAPER PAYS $2.77 MILLION FOR LIBEL  </P> <P> The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette has paid a $2.77-million libel judgment to a lawyer  who was the subject of a 1979 story over a will he prepared.  </P> <P> It was the largest libel judgment ever paid by a newspaper and the  second-largest judgment upheld by U.S. courts, according to the Post-Gazette.  The largest was a $3-million libel award last year against CBS News.  </P> <P> But the newspaper's editor, John G. Craig Jr., said today that he believes the  libel decision is "a particular Pennsylvania problem" and will not have  nationwide repercussions.  </P> <P> A Westmoreland County jury ruled in 1985 that the newspaper libeled Richard  DiSalle, a former state and appellate judge. At issue was a Sept. 10, 1979,  article about the disputed will of millionaire Paul Ciaffoni. The article  contained allegations made in court documents by some relatives that the will  was fraudulently altered and that DiSalle had a close relationship with the  co-executor, Ciaffoni's youngest daughter.  </P> <P> The judge instructed the jury that under state libel law, publications about  judicial proceedings are immune from legal responsibility even if they contain  information that defames an individual. The judge said, however, that  newspapers give up that immunity if an article is not a fair summary of those  court proceedings.  </P></p>

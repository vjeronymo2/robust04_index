			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOSCOW SAYS IT WON'T EXPEL IRAQI ENVOYS;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: SOVIETS WARN AGAINST ADDING "FUEL TO THE FIRE" BUT CONCEDE THAT  ASSISTING IRAQ'S ARMY LEAVES THE NATION IN MORAL CONFLICT.  </P> <P> Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov this week criticized the  U.S. expulsion of Iraqi diplomats as causing an escalation of tension in the  Persian Gulf region. He said his country will not follow suit.  </P> <P> "I don't believe that we have to add fuel to the fire in this explosive  situation," Gerasimov said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The official conceded, however, that the Soviet Union faces a moral conflict  because Soviet military specialists continue to assist the Iraqi army, which is  equipped chiefly with Soviet weapons.  </P> <P> On Monday, the United States expelled 36 of the 55 members of the Iraqi Embassy  staff in Washington and encouraged other countries to act similarly.  </P> <P> The move was in response to Iraq's demands that all foreign countries close  their embassies in Kuwait, which Iraq has invaded and annexed. The United  States and some other countries have refused to close their embassies in  Kuwait. The staff of the Soviet Embassy has left, but the Kremlin maintains  that the embassy is still legally open.  </P> <P> "Of course, Iraq's actions to close embassies in Kuwait are illegitimate,"  Gerasimov told reporters. "But if you use a tit-for-tat policy in this  question, you risk falling into the spiral of escalation and aggravating the  situation. We do not plan such action."  </P> <P> Responding to questions, Gerasimov said that the Soviet Union, Iraq's No. 1  arms supplier before the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, is not breaking U.N.  Security Council sanctions by keeping military specialists in Iraq.  </P> <P> "From the legal point of view, there are no violations," he said. "But a moral  problem does exist, and we will try to resolve it."  </P> <P> After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the Kremlin quickly cut off arms sales to the  government of Saddam Hussein and has repeatedly denounced Iraq's action. On  Saturday, it supported a U.N. resolution authorizing the use of force by  foreign naval forces blockading Iraq, but President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said  his government has no plans to use force against its former ally.  </P> <P> "It is a delicate situation, so we are approaching it cautiously," Gerasimov  said, continuing to emphasize the use of diplomacy rather than force.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, Gerasimov said, the first group of relatives of Soviet  military specialists working in Iraq, 240 women and children, arrived in  Moscow. He said all 983 military dependents are expected to be home by  Saturday.  </P> <P> About 8,000 Soviet nationals, mostly oil workers, diplomats and dependents,  were in Iraq at the time of the invasion. The 880 who were in Kuwait have  already been evacuated. However, the Kremlin has announced no plans to pull out  the approximately 5,000 Soviets remaining in Iraq, some of whom by Soviet  admission have been training the Iraqis in the use of Soviet-made military  equipment.  </P> <P> The 193 Soviet military specialists may not come home until their contracts run  out, Gerasimov said, but he predicted that existing contracts will not be  renewed and that no new contracts will be signed.  </P> <P> Several Soviet peace and disarmament organizations issued a joint statement  calling for the withdrawal of all military specialists from Iraq until Iraq  abandons its claim to Kuwait, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported.  </P> <P> Gerasimov said that although the Soviet government is staying in close contact  with Baghdad in an effort to forge a political settlement, it does not want a  special role as a go-between.  </P></p>

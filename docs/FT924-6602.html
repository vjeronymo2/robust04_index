			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Cater Allen gets benefit from lower UK rates CATER ALLEN yesterday became the latest discount house group to announce strong profits on the back of falling UK interest rates, though it continued to refuse to comment on whether it is discussing a takeover of rival Union Discount. Outlining the group's plans, Mr James Barclay, chairman, said: 'We're in the business of building on what we've already got . . . We don't want to over-diversify.' Ill-judged diversification into leasing and property in the 1980s has brought losses at Union Discount, culminating in news on Wednesday that it is discussing a possible takeover. Mr Barclay refused to be drawn on whether absorbing a rival discount house would meet his objective of strengthening Cater's existing businesses. He added: 'If Union Discount disappears, it would be a disappointment to me.' Cater did not publish figures for the six months to the end of October, but said that its discount house, stock lending and Jersey businesses had 'performed particularly well.' Also, futures broking is reported to have improved and to have shown a profit. Losses on the group's business at Lloyd's, where it operates both as a managing agent and a members' agent, were larger than in the first half of last year. Mr Barclay said the group had not made large profits when sterling sank out of the ERM in September, but that discount houses always did well when interest rates were falling - a factor which had made November a good month so far, as UK base rates fell again last week. Cater is raising the interim dividend by 1p to 7p, though Mr Barclay said this did not indicate it was planning to lift its final dividend as well.</p>

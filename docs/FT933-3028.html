			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Argentina sees low inflation and strong economic growth ARGENTINA forecasts record low inflation, continued strong growth and a smaller trade deficit in its 1994 budget, sent to Congress on Tuesday evening, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires. Economy minister Domingo Cavallo once again plans to balance the federal government's books. Rock-solid government finances were one of the keys to suppressing hyperinflation and unleashing rapid growth. Mr Cavallo has trimmed spending slightly by Dollars 4.8m to Dollars 39.98bn  -equivalent to a 10 per cent cut in real terms. Nonetheless, he has used big savings on debt service payments and subsidies to increase spending on education and social services. One of the budget's key assumptions is a forecast 4 per cent inflation rate, the lowest in Argentina's recent history. Independent economists believe this is attainable and should strengthen confidence in the ability to sustain Argentina's fixed exchange rate. Low inflation, plus continued economic liberalisation, is expected to generate 6.5 per cent economic growth. If this objective is met, it will bring Argentina's accumulated growth rate to over 30 per cent since Mr Cavallo took office in January 1991. The budget forecasts 1994 GDP at Dollars 285.31bn, giving Argentina income per head of Dollars 8,800 - the highest in Latin America. Despite strong growth, Mr Cavallo expects the trade deficit to fall by almost half from a projected Dollars 3bn this year to only Dollars 1.81bn in 1994. Social services are the biggest item, with Dollars 25.66bn - 3.7 per cent more than last year. Spending on education will rise 20 per cent to Dollars 2.44bn. The defence budget is set at Dollars 3.58bn, an increase of 14 per cent. These rises are offset by 9 cuts in debt service payments to Dollars 3.12bn and the Economy Ministry's spending, which falls to Dollars 3.76bn. The Interior Ministry's budget is halved to Dollars 720m.</p>

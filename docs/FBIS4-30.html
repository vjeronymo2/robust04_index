			<p>SUMMARY                                Recent Japanese media reporting has suggested that the Japanese  Government and agricultural wholesalers have passed to Japanese  consumers relatively little, if any, of the savings from the  foreign rice Tokyo has been importing to make up for the current  domestic rice shortage.  If this pattern continues, Japanese  consumers will gain little advantage from Tokyo's decision to  partially open its rice market as part of the Uruguay Round of  International Trade talks.                          END SUMMARY      Despite the Japanese government's importation of an estimated  2.29 million tons of foreign rice, rice prices in Japan have  reportedly continued to rise sharply from their already high  levels.  According to a 25 March Kyodo report, a Japanese  government report released at the end of March revealed that  consumer prices of rice in Tokyo rose 7.4 percent in March over  those in February--reportedly the sharpest monthly increase in 17  years.  The government report also indicated that the consumer  price of rice in March rose 19.7 percent over prices a year  earlier.  According to a 12 April Kyodo report, the Ministry of  Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries' (MAFF) 1993 White Paper on  Agriculture indicated that even before these increases, rice  prices in Japan in 1993 were approximately 8 times higher than  those in the United States.     While panic buying of domestic rice in response to rumors of an  impending rice shortage accounted for some of this increase, the  higher prices may also stem from a failure by the MAFF to pass  significant savings from imports on to wholesalers and consumers.  According to a 13 April Kyodo report, the Ministry has made a  profit of 211.7 billion yen (slightly over $2 billion) on the  2.29 million tons of rice it has imported so far.  Kyodo quoted  unnamed Ministry sources as saying that this worked out to an  average profit of about 92,000 yen (approximately $900) per ton  on sales of rice to wholesalers, who presumably marked their  prices up still further before selling it to consumers.     Another factor contributing to the high prices may be bidrigging  on government sales of imported rice.  According to the 1 April  Asahi Shimbun, the Director General of MAFF's Food Agency sends  written instructions every 6 months to the 28 trading companies  involved in grain purchases telling them, before bidding takes  place, the share each company will receive in upcoming grain  auctions.  Asahi Shimbun reported that, according to sources  close to the trading companies, the companies then rig their  bidding prices, deciding which company will bid the lowest price  on the basis of the percentages determined by the Food Agency.  Although Asahi Shimbun said nothing about the effect of this  practice on rice prices, judging from the profits MAFF has  reportedly been making on the sale of imported rice, the  bidrigging probably limits competition and helps to keep the  prices that wholesalers pay to the Ministry relatively high.

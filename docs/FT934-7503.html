			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / People: Stone sinks from Owners Abroad The departure of the old guard at travel group Owners Abroad continues with the news yesterday that Geoffrey Stone, the finance director, has resigned with immediate effect. Callers to his office at the group's headquarters were told that he had already left. He could not be reached for comment. Stone's departure caused few flurries in the travel industry. Two other senior figures had already left earlier this year; Howard Klein, chairman, and Roger Allard, managing director, announced their resignations last July after warning that profits this year would be half market expectations. One industry observer says of Stone's departure: 'I think he felt the writing was on the wall. He felt the new management wanted a clean sheet of paper.' Errol Cossey, one of the few survivors of the old Owners regime, is now deputy chairman and heads both the group's airline and relations with Thomas Cook, with which it has an alliance. But the top job has so far eluded Cossey. Michael Julien, former chief executive of the Storehouse retail group, was brought in as non-executive chairman. Last month, Francis Baron, chairman of Anglo-Saxon Television, was appointed chief executive.</p>

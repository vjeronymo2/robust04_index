			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (13): Foreigners risk disappointment - Taiwan Analysing Taiwan's mercurial stock market has never been easy, but it is simpler than divining the mood of the country's central bankers. Citing concerns over an appreciating currency and impending chaos in the financial markets, the powerful bank moved to quash a year-end stock rally by mopping up liquidity and cutting off foreign investment, writes a correspondent in Taipei. Until a few months ago, none but the strictest of asset managers went to the trouble of investing in Taiwan's historically overvalued stock market. But when neighbouring markets became dangerously top-heavy, fund managers flocked to invest in Taiwan, which after several sluggish years looked comparatively cheap. Most of them will be disappointed. While other Asian countries have chosen to capitalise on the deluge of foreign funds pouring into the region, Taiwan's conservative Bank of China appears determined to keep the local stock market all but hermetically sealed. At about 2 per cent of total market capitalisation of Dollars 183bn as of January 14, foreign investment remains a force of inspiration more than substance in Taiwan's bourse. 'In the context of Asian markets, Taiwan is successfully becoming a non-market', says Mr Mark Mobius, president of Templeton Emerging Markets Fund. 'Taiwan has got to join the world. That's the bottom line'. Long-standing promises to liberalise financial markets appear designed more to enhance Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade than to attract foreign investors. Unlike South Korea, Taiwan has yet to set a timetable for its reforms, which for the most part have been painfully slow and fitful. The central bank has set an overall ceiling of Dollars 5bn on foreign investments in the local bourse. Each would-be foreign institutional investor (foreign individuals are not allowed to buy local shares) must apply to the central bank for an investment quota of no more than Dollars 200m. If approved, funds may be remitted, usually in small tranches, into the country at the discretion of the central bank. The entire process can take several months. Investors must wait at least three months before profits may be repatriated again, at the central bank's discretion. As of mid-January, foreign institutions had brought a net amount of roughly Dollars 3bn into the country since the equity market was first opened to outside investment in early 1990. Approved quotas worth Dollars 1.3bn awaited the central bank's green light to be remitted into the country. Applications pending at the central bank totalled Dollars 1.5bn. The total now exceeds the cap on foreign investment. But fearful that the runaway bourse, stoked by underground financing, would career out of control and destabilise the financial system, authorities recently ruled out raising the ceiling. Foreign investors have thus been virtually frozen out of the market which promises some of the best growth prospects in the region. This situation may eventually change, but the process will likely be slow, punctuated by back-tracking and muddied conflicting signals. Ultimately, Taiwan may open up to foreign investment only if it is forced to do so as a condition to GATT entry, or when it decides that it needs foreign capital to upgrade its industrial base and develop infrastructure. For the time being, planners feel they have the luxury of turning foreigners away.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 1 KYODO -- The United States has  postponed until June 30 its decision on whether Japan is  discriminating against U.S. businesses in government procurement  of telecommunication and medical equipment, the chief U.S. Trade  negotiator said Saturday [30 April].    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor's office was to  submit by Saturday to Congress its report that would specify the  countries it sees as discriminatory against U.S. firms in  government procurement.    The action is based on Title VII of the 1988 Omnibus Trade  and Competitiveness Act.    The countries specified in the report could be subject to  trade sanctions by the Clinton administration.    The Japanese Government of former Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa has vowed to put together market-opening measures by  the end of June.    But, Japan may be included in a list of such countries if  Washington remains unconvinced of the Japanese measures which  are aimed primarily at rectifying Japan's external trade  imbalances by boosting domestic demand.    The postponement of a decision apparently stems from the  judgment that it is inadvisable to take a get-tough policy  toward Tokyo amid the uncertain political outlook in Japan.    The new coalition government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata,  Hosokawa's successor, inaugurated last Thursday, is widely  viewed as fragile due to the departure of the Social Democratic  Party [of Japan, SDPJ].    Kantor said, however, that his office will "review the  situation in 60 days on the basis of Japanese actions in the  interim."    He also noted that "in deciding whether to identify Japan  under Title VII in 60 days, we will assess the seriousness of  any official Japanese response to the points that were  discussed" at his meeting with then Japanese Foreign Minister  Hata in Marrakech, Morocco, on April 15.    Kantor also announced the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative places Japan and five other trading partners on  the "priority watch list" under the trade act's special 301  Provision concerning the protection of intellectual property  rights.    The listed countries are subject to a statutory review over  the next year.    Meanwhile, Kantor said his office has put off until June 30  a  decision on whether to name China, Argentina and India "priority  foreign countries" which deny adequate and effective protection  of intellectual property.    If a solution has not been reached by June 30, these  countries will be named priority foreign countries, and  investigations of their practices will immediately be initiated  under Section 301 of the trade act.    U.S. concerns over protection of intellectual property  rights  in China have been prompted by massive pirating of compact discs  in that country.    Kantor indicated in a teleconference with U.S. journalists  that the U.S. Administration does not want bilateral trade  problems with China to become confused with the question of  whether to extend China's most favored nation (MFN) trade status.    President Bill Clinton must decide whether to renew the  status by June 3.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Legalization of Revised Yalta"] </F>   [Text] Belgrade -- Yesterday's Croatian-Muslim agreement,  backed by the United States and the powerful Western states,  presents in its essence the division of the former Yugoslavia  into the Western and Russian sphere of interests. That  agreement, if it succeeds, will represent an international  legalization of a somewhat revised oral agreement reached half a  century ago in Yalta among Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill.  This is said in the statement by the Serbian Renewal Movement  [SPO] Presidency.    Slovenia, Croatia, and about half the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina will be under the political and economic  patronage of the most developed countries in the world, while  Serbia, Montenegro, and the Srpska republic will be in the  sphere of the political influence of Russia. It will be a region  that will not be in the position to count on the economic and  technological support by the West for a long time, the SPO says.    As for the republic of Serbian Krajina, its fate will be  decided through negotiations between Zagreb, which is becoming  increasingly strong economically, and Knin, which on the other  hand is economically weakening.    The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will most likely  find itself with Greece and Albania under the political and  economic influence of the West, the SPO Presidency says.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / World Trade News: European business in plea to Japan - Tokyo urged to open door for imports EUROPEAN business leaders yesterday added their voice to a growing chorus of discontent with Japan's burgeoning trade surplus and called on the Japanese government to take a more affirmative and managed approach to the problem. The Council of the European Business Community said cultural factors were in part to blame for Japan's growing trade surplus and suggested a more managed approach would go further in dealing with a problem that natural market forces had failed to solve. The views expressed by the council, which represented European interests at the Fourth Import Board - an international forum of foreign businessmen and Japanese government officials held in Tokyo yesterday - are similar to those of an increasingly popular school of thought in the US. This says that, because of unique cultural factors, trade with Japan cannot be left to ordinary free market forces. 'The natural market forces are not sufficient to bring, in the short term, a new situation in which imports have a share commensurate with their relative price and quality,' the council said. Since normal market forces have not been effective in changing the situation, 'we are deeply convinced that the sectoral approach would be the most efficient means to reach improvements'. European representatives at the forum also called on the Japanese government to introduce succeeding supplementary budgets with firm funds directly allocated to government purchases of imported products. 'What we are asking for is a special programme of imports for use by government agencies,' Mr Henri Martre, honorary president of Aerospatiale, said. Japan also needed to make bidding procedures for government procurement more open and fair and to ensure purchase decisions are not politically motivated but based on commercial considerations. It was difficult to understand why Airbus, which has 30 per cent of the world market, had just 10 per cent of Japan's market, he said. The council recommended that the Japanese government try to quantify the benefits of any programmes to boost imports and that it seek to match the best practice of the most liberalised countries in the EC rather than align itself with the minimum level of liberalisation. In spite of the Japanese government's efforts, Japan had a trade surplus with the EC last year amounting to Dollars 32bn (Pounds 22bn). Imports into Japan from the EC fell 1.6 per cent while exports to the EC increased 14 per cent.</p>

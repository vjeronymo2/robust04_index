			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Talks have been continuing between the UDF [United  Democratic Front] and Aford [Alliance for Democracy]. Aford won  all the seats in northern Malawi, but trailed behind the UDF  with 33 to the UDF's 84. They need an alliance to take on the  old ruling MCP [Malawi Congress Party] which has 55 seats in the  assembly. But there were reports that Aford was unhappy with the  three junior ministries that had been offered by Bakili Muluzi.  On the line to Malawi, Mary Harper asked Aford's Secretary  General Dr. (Meke Mchewa) how the talks were going.    [Begin recording] [(Mchewa]) The talks are going very well,  I  should say, and that the invitation when offered to Aford for a  discussion in Blantyre two days ago, at least, we -- Aford --  accepted those [as heard] in the goodwill and spirit in which  they were intended.    [Harper] But things don't really seem to be going very well  at all. You were offered three ministries by the UDF in the new  government and you refused them?    [(Mchewa]) We have not said no to that. That is a position  yet which has to be (?briefed) to our president and our  president was only briefed yesterday by some members of the  delegation, but not the entire team.    [Harper] So, what is it exactly that Aford wants?    [(Mchewa] No, I think the question must be what is it  exactly  that the UDF wants. I think that has been our question to them  and they are unable to define it.    [Harper] What about the question of ministries? How many  would you be satisfied with?    [(Mchewa]) They have a [words indistinct] and they are the  ones who formed the government. We know that they have so many  [words indistinct] with. We are being invited to be careful and  I don't think we can dictate the terms of [words indistinct] to  them. That offer was made to us. We should be in a position to  say whether or not indeed it does meet the minimum of a decent  relationship to occur.    [Harper] Now, what has become of your party leader, Chakufwa  Chihana? He seems to have completely disappeared?    [(Mchewa] Not at all. He is well and alive and doing  absolutely well by [words indistinct] and doing at least the  normal thing that he has missed doing as a family [words  indistinct] productive man in these past few months.

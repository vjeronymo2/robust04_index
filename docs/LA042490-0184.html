			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ALMODOVAR LOSES APPEAL OF X RATING  </P> <P> Spanish film director Pedro Almodovar lost a bid today to lift an X rating the  Motion Picture Assn. of America gave his latest film, "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down."  </P> <P> The MPAA's appeals board voted 6-6 to sustain the rating despite an impassioned  plea by civil rights lawyer William Kunstler. A rating can be overturned only  with a two-thirds majority vote.  </P> <P> At issue was a sex scene in Almodovar's film, "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down," a black  comedy about an escaped mental patient who kidnaps a porn actress and then gets  her to fall in love with him by tying her up. The X rating restricts audiences  to age 17 and older.  </P></p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Contingency plans being made to withdraw British troops from former Yugoslavia Contingency plans are being made to withdraw British troops from the former Yugoslavia although the government has no immediate intention to pull out, Baroness Chalker, Britain's overseas development minister, said yesterday, writes Sheila Jones. 'Like any good army we have to be prepared for any eventuality,' Lady Chalker said. 'There is real and perfectly understandable worry about troops and aid workers. I believe we should be seeking to continue as long as we reasonably can.' Britain's 2,400 troops, helping to guard UN aid convoys, would continue to play a humanitarian role so long as it was safe to do so and would not be drawn into fighting.</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Asset sale lifts Pancontinental Mining PANCONTINENTAL Mining, the Sydney-based metals company, has staged a big earnings turnround in the first half to December, following the sale last year of its stalled Jabiluka uranium prospect in the Northern Territory, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney. The company turned an ADollars 83.73m (USDollars 62.9m) net loss into a ADollars 57.88m profit on a 17 per cent rise in revenue to ADollars 101.6m. The turnround came from an abnormal gain of ADollars 67.9m on the sale of Jabiluka to Energy Resources of Australia, which operates the nearby Ranger uranium mine. Mr Lindsay MacAlister, managing director, said the group had offset reduced earnings from mining operations by cost-cutting and a fall in interest payments. Net debt fell ADollars 48m to ADollars 173m. Pancontinental shares have risen strongly in recent months, and yesterday gained 5 cents to 96 cents on the Australian Stock Exchange.</p>

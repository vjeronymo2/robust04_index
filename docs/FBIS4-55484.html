			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Muslim offensive on the Mount Majevica  battlefield diminished in intensity after Serbian soldiers  succeeded in repelling several fierce Muslim artillery and  infantry attacks, regaining areas captured by members of  Izetbegovic's army in a surprise attack five days ago. Both  sides suffered considerable losses in manpower in heavy fighting  -- hand-to-hand in many places -- over the last five days, in  which all available weapons and heavy artillery were used.  However, the soldiers of the republic of Srpska army have  almost completely regained temporarily lost areas and pushed the  Muslim units back to their initial positions. Muslim forces  fired more than 300 shells on residential areas during the  clashes, targeting Priboj and Lopare, said Major-General Novica  Simic, commander of the eastern Bosnia Corps. Chlorine-charged  shells were even fired on the primary school in Priboj, Simic  said, pointing out that Majevica was attacked from all  directions and that it was the site of fiercest fighting  currently taking place in the republic of Srpska.

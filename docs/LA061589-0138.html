			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEPUTY D.A. CLEARED IN 'COTTON CLUB' CASE  </P> <P> After a week of testimony and cross-examination, Deputy Dist. Atty. David Conn  was exonerated Wednesday of charges that he withheld evidence from the defense  during a hearing into the so-called "Cotton Club" murder of New York producer  Roy Radin.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Municipal Judge Patti Jo McKay ruled that Conn and three sheriff's  homicide investigators did not try to hide notes, tapes or transcripts of  interviews with the prosecution's star witness, William Rider. Under terms of a  court order, Conn must turn over such information to the defense before a  witness takes the stand. McKay found "substantial compliance" to the order.  </P> <P> During his testimony June 2, Rider said that two of the defendants -- William  Molony Mentzer and Alex Lamotta Marti -- bragged during a poker game about  killing Radin. Defense attorneys charged that Conn deliberately kept his  knowledge of that testimony from them.  </P> <P> Radin's bullet-riddled body was found in a canyon northeast of Los Angeles on  June 10, 1983.  </P></p>

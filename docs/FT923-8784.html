			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses depressed by disappointing first-half results THE REALITY, or the anticipation of disappointing first-half results pulled most bourses lower, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS was depressed by the release of further, poor first-half results and the CAC 40 index closed 1.59 lower at 1,777.27, up 1.3 per cent on the week, in turnover of FFr1.34bn. Saint-Gobain dropped FFr28 or 5.1 per cent to FFr520 in response to news late on Thursday that the glass and building materials group's turnover rose 3.9 per cent in the first half to FFr38.9bn. Peugeot fell another FFr7 to FFr642 as its poor first-half results earlier this week prompted analysts to downgrade their full-year forecasts. Accor dropped FFr19 to FFr619 following the previous day's news that it will have to compensate minority shareholders in Wagons-Lits as a result of its takeover of the Belgian company. Elf fell a further FFr7.30 to FFr326 while Euro Disney lost FFr2.75 to FFr90 on news that it had decided to close one of its top-of-the-line resort hotels from hotel October to Easter, 1993. FRANKFURT slowed down, as turnover fell from DM6.1bn to DM3.4bn. After a fall of 3.19 to 635.66 in the FAZ at midsession, the DAX closed 11.65 lower at 1,609.50; falls on the week were 0.2, and 0.4 per cent respectively. Allianz, with a fall of DM30 to DM1,805, took its decline to 18.5 per cent since the Bundesbank lifted the German discount rate in mid-July. The intervening period has seen poor results from the insurer and sell notes from brokers. Dealers reacted badly to flat results from Veba, the big utility, leaving the shares DM8.10 lower at DM374.80. However, Mr Michael Crawshaw at County NatWest said that the provisions which had flattened profits had been forecast last May and that, without them, profits would have been a little better than expected, with an underlying gain of 7 per cent. Bilfinger &amp; Berger led constructions down with a fall of DM21 to DM902. Mr Michael Geiger, also of County, said that UK holders were nervous about Bilfinger's 15 per cent stake in the UK contractor, Birse, and the bad news from the UK construction sector. BRUSSELS was pulled lower by Petrofina, which announced a bigger-than-expected 56 per cent drop in first half profit after the close on Thursday. The Bel-20 Index fell 9.91 to 1,133.28, a fall of 1 per cent on the week. Petrofina closed down BFr475 or 4.3 per cent at BFr10,475 in heavy volume of 48,060 shares. Analysts cut their full-year earnings forecasts for the oil company and warned that it might have to cut its 1992 dividend. Wagons-Lits returned from suspension with a BFr610 leap to BFr6,710. MILAN fell back in thin trading ahead of the close of the August trading account next week. Dealers were disappointed that the prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, had failed to make any concrete commitment to support the stock market at a meeting with Milan stockbrokers on Thursday. Rumours of a further cut in interest rates, which put the lira under pressure, also weighed on equities. The Comit index fell 4.48 to 416.89, up 3.8 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at less than Thursday's L70.7bn. STOCKHOLM declined following an unexpected six-month loss from the ball-bearing group, SKF. The Affarsvarlden General Index fell 8.5 to 850.9, down 1.3 per cent on the week, in thin turnover of SKr190m. SKF fell SKr3.50 to SKr94 after reporting a pre-tax loss of SKr194m after a pre-tax profit of SKr63m a year earlier. AMSTERDAM saw Hoogovens drop 6.7 per cent on fears of disappointing half-year results, losing Fl 2.90 to Fl 40.10. The results are due on Tuesday. The CBS Tendency Index fell 1.0 to 115.9, down 0.5 per cent on the week. COPENHAGEN was supported by sharp gains in Den Danske Bank following its release of better-than-expected six-month results. The shares gained DKr11 to DKr262, lifting the all-share index by 0.32 to 305.40. ZURICH maintained its relative strength, a fall of 10.0 to 1,819.6 in the SMI index leaving it still 0.6 per cent higher on the week. Roche advanced SFr70 to SFr5,080 on UK and US interest, the latter related to its ADR programme. ISTANBUL fell 3.4 per cent to a six-week low on heavy selling as the index dropped 136.72 to 3,932.55, the lowest since 3,840.34 on June 23. The loss on the week was 7.8 per cent.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - AUG 7  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Hourly changes   Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1071.79  1071.97  1071.45  1068.80  1067.71  1068.68  1066.68  1067.01  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          Day's High  1071.97            Day's Low  1065.87  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      Aug 6         Aug 5        Aug 4        Aug 3         Jul 31     1078.71       1081.21      1076.44      1069.17       1067.77  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

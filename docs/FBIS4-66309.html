			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by own commentator: "(1) On Strengthening </F> Propagandistic and Ideological Work Under the New  Circumstances--Persist in Arming the People With Scientific  Theory"]    [Text] The provincewide conference on propagandist and  ideological work has just been concluded. According to the  spirit of the All-China Conference on Propagandistic and  Ideological Work, and with due integration with the actual  conditions of Henan Province, we shall resoundingly proclaim the  fundamental guiding principle which we shall adhere to in our  propagandistic and ideological work: we shall raise high one  main propaganda theme and energetically pursue five particular  tasks. Comrade Deng Xiaoping set forth the theory of socialism  with Chinese characteristics, a theory which is to serve as the  fundamental directive for all work throughout the party. This  fundamental directive must be firmly applied, in particular also  to propagandistic and ideological work. Arming all party members  and cadres with the weapon of this theory is primary task of the  day, a task that must be carried out earnestly and effectively.    Deng Xiaoping's theory on the building socialism with  Chinese  characteristics profoundly reflects the objective law that  governs China's socialist construction and succinctly manifests  the will and desire of party and people. It is continuation and  development of Mao Zedong Thought, and it is the Marxism of  present-day China. The said theory is the spiritual mainstay for  the entire party and for all nationalities throughout the  country. It is the powerful ideological weapon that will win  victory in reform, opening up, and modernization. During the  past 15 years of reform and opening up, it is precisely under  the guidance of this theory, that our undertaking of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics was seriously tested and  vigorously developed within a most changeable international  situation. China's economic construction, the people's living  standards, and overall national strength have all reached a new  and higher level of development, an achievement that has  attracted worldwide attention. It is particularly under the  guidance of the said theory that work in all the various sectors  of Henan Province also resulted in huge achievements, that the  economy could maintain its tendency of rapid growth, and that  the strategic objective of "one high, one low" [yi gao, yi di]  could have been achieved. Practical experience has made us  deeply aware of the fact that whether or not we shall be able to  arm all our party members, cadres, and the masses with Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics will have a direct effect on success or failure  of our socialist modernizations, a direct effect on whether we  shall be able to advance united, whether we shall be able to  realize the objective of bringing prosperity to Henan Province,  and whether we shall be able to implement the tasks set forth at  the conference on propagandistic and ideological work.    The theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics  is a complete scientific theoretical system, in which the  various basic concepts and basic principles do not stand alone  in isolation, but are inherently linked with one another. To  truly grasp this theoretical system, to achieve mastery of it  through comprehensive study, is not at all an easy matter. It  requires attention to the complete and accurate understanding  and mastery of the theoretical system within the overall body of  the whole, as well as with respect to the mutual linkages of its  parts. Particular attention and effort must be directed to the  following three aspects:    1) Great efforts must be expended to attain the basic  viewpoints expressed in the said theory concerning the  important and fundamental theoretical problem of "what is  socialism, how socialism is to be established and developed"; 2)  An accurate understanding must be reached as to the inherent  connections between the series of fundamental concepts in  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's writings; we must completely and  accurately understand the fundamental line and theoretical basis  of the principle "one central task, two basic points" [economic  development plus a) adherence to the four cardinal principles  and b) implementation of reform and the open policy; 3) We must  firmly grasp the quintessence of "liberation of the mind" and of  "seeking truth from facts," and must gain an understanding and  mastery of the world view and methodology of dialectic  materialism and historical materialism that permeates all of  Comrade Deng's writings, while at the same time avoiding and  reducing all subjectivism and metaphysics.    In the study of scientific theory, emphasis must be on its  ultimate linkage with the realities and on the guidance it  provides for action. Comrade Jiang Zemin recently emphasized the  need for a thorough study of Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping, the need to closely link such  studies with the overall situation in the work of the entire  party during this year, and the need to raise the level of  political consciousness as to all action within the present  overall situation. The Central Committee has decided on the  following to be this year's overall tasks for the entire party:  to seize the favorable opportunity to deepen the reform, expand  opening up, promote economic development, and to preserve  stability. In matters of establishing the socialist market  economy system, China has this year accomplished many important  reform measures, actions which may be compared to "storming  heavily fortified positions." To gain victory in a fight of this  nature requires a particularly strong measure of close unity  among the broad masses of party members, cadres, and the people,  also concerted action of all concerned, breaking new paths, and  vigorous advances ahead. Through the study of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's writings, we shall attain a better unity of thinking  with regard to the overall state of the work performed by the  entire party, a unity of thinking also with regard to all  important policy decisions of the party and the state on  improving reform. When linking up with the realities, we must  also link up closely with the particular realities of Henan  Province in its reform, opening up, and economic construction.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping, for instance, has repeatedly emphasized  seizing favorable opportunities to accelerate economic  development, and has questioned why some regions have always  been slow in their development. There may be many reasons for  it, but the main reasons, we are afraid, are that they have not  truly effected "liberation of minds" and have not  conscientiously "sought truth from facts." You, who are in  leading positions, have not yet changed your ways of thinking.  You have not yet replaced those old "leftist" things and those  traditional concepts, formed under the conditions of the planned  economy, by the new ideas and new concepts suited to the  socialist market economy. You have not yet become fully  conscious of reform and opening up, of market economy, and of  the spirit of arduous pioneering work. How, then, can you expect  that your districts can spread the wings that would lift them  up? If you who are in leading positions will not do a solid job,  if you are afraid that your actions may result in "political  merits," and if you, in the end, go in for formalism, put on  false airs, even go so far as to resort to deception, deceive  those above and bully those below, is that not running in the  opposite direction to "seeking truth from facts"? Through the  study of the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, all regions and all agencies are to find out  the strong points and deficiencies of their regions and units,  should reason out their developmental paths, and should  determine their particular development plans according to actual  conditions, seize favorable opportunities, and accelerate  economic development. There a common saying: If the cadre does  not lead, the water buffalo will fall into the well. It is the  same with theoretical studies. Leading cadres at all levels,  especially those of department [chu] and higher rank in the  counties, must set an example, take the lead in studying and  applying, and by their own model actions motivate and influence  all party members and cadres toward studies. At the same time,  they should start out from the realities of their district or  unit, meticulously arrange and well organize -- in a planned  way, with points of emphasis, and level by level -- the study of  all their many party members and cadres. Best material for the  study of the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics is  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. It  is now a necessity to effectively organize the study of Volume 3  of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. This should  be combined with the study of the documents from the 14th NPC  and the decisions of the Third Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, as well as a thorough study of the theory and basics  of the socialist market economy. These studies should furnish  full knowledge of the necessity, urgency, and arduous nature of  establishing this new economic system, should strengthen  political consciousness as regards the reform, and this should  ensure, through concerted effort by high and low throughout the  entire province, the ultimate success in the reform, a victory  in what appears like "storming of a heavily fortified position."</p>

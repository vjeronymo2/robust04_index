			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Letter: Successful military intervention in Bosnia is feasible Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, recently told the Western European Union in Paris that 100,000 troops and many casualties would be necessary for successful intervention in Bosnia. This might be so, if by it he means the expulsion of every Serb. What is most needed, however, is to raise the sieges of Sarajevo, Gorazde and Srebrenica, and to protect Travnik and the remaining free Moslem areas. To do so would establish minimum conditions for a permanent ceasefire. To achieve such limited aims, the existing United Nations forces of 16,000 would suffice, provided: the 'no-fly resolution' is rigidly enforced in Bosnia, by allied aircraft; helicopter support is available for UN convoys and for the Bosnian state forces; the Bosnian forces are provided with ammunition, machine guns, rocket launchers and mortars, together with a few military advisers; air attacks on Serb artillery, munitions factories and air bases may also be required. The evidence of Slovenia, Dubrovnik and even Croatia shows that the Serbs pull back when they are seriously resisted. Surely the above limited proposals are necessary to halt aggression, prevent the exodus of another million refugees and avoid the involvement of Middle East powers, in what could only be an ever-expanding war. Air power is the key, as was seen in Kurdistan. Hylton, House of Lords, London SW1A 0PW</p>

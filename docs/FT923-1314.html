			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / High imports push trade gap to Pounds 1.2bn: Export volumes flat - Call for fresh cuts in loan rates to stimulate housing market / National Savings lowers its returns RECORD IMPORT volumes pushed Britain's trade deficit sharply wider last month, while sluggish world economic activity took its toll on export growth. Official figures yesterday showed that the underlying deficit on visible, or merchandise, goods was at its worst level for two years after import volumes rose to a record level and export volumes flattened off. The overall deficit on trade in visible goods rose to Pounds 1.2bn last month compared with Pounds 1.1bn in July. The current-account deficit - which includes a projected Pounds 100m surplus on trade in so-called invisible goods such as financial services, government transfer payments and dividends - was Pounds 1.1bn in August, barely changed on July. However, both figures benefited from a striking increase in Britain's surplus in oil trade, which rose from Pounds 48m in July to Pounds 233m in August, the biggest surplus since September 1990. The underlying picture was much bleaker. Excluding oil and erratic items such as precious stones, ships and aircraft, the visible trade deficit was Pounds 1.7bn last month, its worst level for two years and Pounds 300m greater than in July. The latest figures from the Central Statistical Office will add to worries that import penetration is too high in the UK. Britain has remained in deficit with the rest of the world throughout the present recession in spite of weak consumer demand. Other CSO figures last week showed that the current-account deficit for the first half of the year was almost Pounds 6bn, only Pounds 0.5bn less than the Treasury's forecast for the entire year in the Budget. Last week's sterling devaluation is likely to boost import prices in the short term, but should eventually buoy exports as British goods become cheaper to overseas buyers. However, an export boom might be stifled by weakness in the economies of Britain's main trading partners. A breakdown of the UK's trade by area shows that exports were down almost everywhere in the latest three months. The value of exports to the European Community fell by 4 per cent compared with the previous three months, and to the US they were down by 1.5 per cent. The three-monthly measures of the figures confirm that the underlying trade gap is being widened by flat exports and continued growth in imports. In the three months to the end of August export volumes, excluding oil and erratics, grew by 0.5 per cent compared with the same period a year ago, and fell by 1.5 per cent compared with the previous three months. The same measure of imports shows that they grew by 7.5 per cent year on year, and by 1 per cent quarter on quarter. The weakness in export volumes was spread across most categories, although exports of basic materials, capital and intermediate goods suffered particularly badly. Import gains were also widespread. Volumes of car imports rose by 20 per cent in the three months to the end of August compared with the same period a year ago, while imports of consumer goods rose by 13 per cent. Imports of chemicals were up by 9 per cent. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the 'yawning trade gap' was evidence that the government's policies had 'failed Britain and destroyed Britain's industrial base'. He added: 'There is no precedent anywhere in our economic history for a rise in imports during a recession. If imports go up while demand is on the floor, Britain is in for a monster trade gap if recovery ever comes.' The Treasury said the drop in export volumes was not surprising given the slowdown in the main world economies.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         CURRENT ACCOUNT (POUNDS BN)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                               Less oil              Current             and                      Invisibles              Balance   Total  erratics   Exports  Imports  Balances  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1990          -17.0    -18.8    -21.1     102.0    120.5     +1.8 1991           -6.3   -10.3     -13.6     103.4    113.7     +4.0   Qtr 2        -0.5    -2.2      -3.0      25.9     28.2     +1.8   Qtr 3        -1.3    -2.4      -3.5      26.4     28.8     +1.1   Qtr 4        -1.7    -2.6      -3.5      26.2     28.8     +0.9 1992   Qtr 1        -2.9    -3.0      -3.5      26.1     29.2     +0.2   Qtr 2        -2.9    -3.2      -3.9      26.7     29.9     +0.4   Jan          -1.1    -1.1      -1.3       8.3      9.4     +0.06   Feb          -0.9    -1.0      -1.1       9.0     10.0     +0.06   Mar          -0.8    -0.9      -1.1       8.9      9.8     +0.06   Apr          -1.3    -1.4      -1.5       8.8     10.2     +0.1   May          -0.7    -0.8      -1.2       9.1     10.0     +0.1   Jun          -0.8    -0.9      -1.2       8.8      9.7     +0.1   Jul          -1.0    -1.1      -1.4       8.8      9.9     +0.1   Aug          -1.1    -1.2      -1.7       8.8     10.0     +0.1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Invisibles for April to June 1992 are projections.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 13 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] today wrote a letter  to Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] on the Qiandao Hu  tour boat incident.    The letter says: Your foundation's 7 April letter "regarding  holding consultations to handle the Qiandao Hu boat disaster"  has been received. Regarding the issue raised in the letter,  replies have been made in the 9 April statement of a responsible  person of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office as well as  in our association's 4 April letter and 6 April telephone  conversations.    The letter points out: The personal and property safety of  the vast number of Taiwan compatriots are protected by the law  when they visit their relatives, travel, invest, and participate  in various exchange activities on the Mainland. Relevant  authorities are putting in great efforts to find out the cause  for the unfortunate incident of the "Hairui" tour boat accident.  Your foundation and our association should consider the overall  task of making joint efforts to safeguard the legitimate rights  and interests of compatriots on the two sides of the Taiwan  Strait as well as developing cross-strait relations. The two  sides should rationally and calmly handle the relevant issue and  not allow ARATS-SEF cooperation and the development of  cross-strait relations to be affected.    The letter says: In cross-strait exchanges, many incidents  involving the loss of lives and property of Mainland and Taiwan  compatriots have occurred. Our association has always paid  close attention to this sort of issue. We suggest that ARATS  and SEF hold talks after making necessary preparations. As for  dealing with the aftermath of the "Hairui" tour boat accident,  our association is willing to listen to your foundation's  opinions, and convey them to relevant departments.</p>

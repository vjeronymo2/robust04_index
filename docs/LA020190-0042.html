			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION FOES WIN LEGAL BATTLE;  </P> <P> PROTESTS: A FEDERAL JUDGE DISMISSES A SUIT OVER BLOCKADES AT FAMILY PLANNING  CLINICS. HE ALSO VACATES AN INJUNCTION BARRING SUCH ACTIONS.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles federal judge awarded a major victory to anti-abortion forces  Wednesday in dismissing a lawsuit which asserted that Operation Rescue's  blockades at family planning clinics violated the civil rights of women seeking  to use the clinics' services.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima denied claims by the National Abortion  Federation and other pro-choice groups that Operation Rescue's actions violated  a woman's right to travel and her right to obtain an abortion.  </P> <P> Tashima also vacated a preliminary injunction he issued March 15 barring  blockades, thus freeing abortion opponents to reinstitute such actions without  fear of legal consequences in federal court.  </P> <P> "It's a great result for us," Operation Rescue attorney Victor Smith said of  the decision. He said that, while Tashima's decision "is not a world-changing  decision, it will limit the tools of the opposition to interfere with the  protests."  </P> <P> Susan Finn, Operation Rescue's Southern California spokeswoman, said "we're  encouraged that Judge Tashima feels that there are no grounds on a federal  level to prevent Operation Rescue from saving babies and women from the  destruction of abortion."  </P> <P> Finn said the organization's next major blockade is scheduled for Saturday,  Feb. 17, but the location has not yet been made public.  </P> <P> American Civil Liberties Union attorney Carol Sobel, the lead lawyer for the  plaintiffs, said she will ask Tashima to stay his ruling today while she  appeals it in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.  </P> <P> Sobel denounced Tashima's ruling, saying it meant, in essence, that "women are  forever prisoners of their biology." She stressed that Tashima's decision was  in conflict with a ruling by a federal appeals court in New York last September  and decisions by federal judges in Oregon and Washington.  </P> <P> Wednesday's ruling was not a surprise. In September, Tashima had ruled that  "abortion seekers" are not a special class of people entitled to protection  under the Ku Klux Klan Act, a 19th-Century civil rights law, which was the  underpinning of the suit.  </P> <P> He wrote: "Although women, under certain circumstances, still have a  constitutional right to seek an abortion, the courts have never designated  'abortion seekers' as a class requiring special protection. . . . The court  holds that women seeking abortions is not a class intended to be protected by  the Ku Klux Klan Act."  </P> <P> Tashima told the plaintiffs that they could amend their complaint. But he  expressed doubts about whether they could succeed.  </P> <P> ACLU attorneys filed new papers in the case. But in his decision Wednesday,  Tashima said they had not met their burden of showing that pregnant women were  entitled to protection under the 19th-Century law. He said that the ACLU had  failed to prove that Operation Rescue had animus against pregnant women in  general, or women as a class.  </P> <P> "Plaintiffs confuse effect with motive," Tashima wrote. "While the alleged  blockade/rescue actions of defendants may have" the effect described in the  lawsuit on pregnant women and women in general, in order to qualify for  protection under the law the ACLU had to show that Operation Rescue was hostile  toward those groups.  </P> <P> The judge acknowledged that he had a difference of opinion with the New York  appeals court.  </P> <P> Tashima also said the ACLU complaint did not specify what federally protected  right, privilege or immunity of the plaintiffs has been infringed by the  defendants' conduct. He said the plaintiffs, to prevail, would have had to  demonstrate that the government interfered with their legal rights.  </P> <P> The judge also stated that health care clinics were not a protected class under  the Ku Klux Klan Act.  </P> <P> The statute was enacted during the Reconstruction Era and was designed to  protect blacks from attacks by racists, but it has been applied to others since  then.  </P> <P> Sobel, in criticizing Tashima's opinion, said it was nonsensical to say that  Operation Rescue did not have animus against women seeking clinic services,  including family planning counseling.  </P> <P> "The fact that women and only women can get pregnant doesn't mean they're  entitled less protection under the Constitution" than other groups covered by  the law in question, Sobel said.  </P> <P> Sobel said that if the ACLU's appeal is spurned, she will file a new suit in a  state court seeking to enjoin Operation Rescue blockades. She said the basis  would be the state Constitution's right to privacy and the Unruh Act, which  prohibits anyone from using force or coercion to prohibit someone from  exercising a lawful right.  </P> <P> "We have constitutional and statutory rights that apply to women in California  that are broader than federal rights," the lawyer said. "Our clients will not  go unprotected."  </P> <P> Tashima's decision Wednesday represented a marked shift from his earlier  rulings in the case.  </P> <P> In March, he issued an injunction against Operation Rescue prohibiting  blockades. In August, he found Operation Rescue leaders in contempt for  violating the injunction and ordered them to pay $110,000 in attorneys fees  incurred in bringing the contempt action on behalf of pro-choice groups. The  contempt order is not affected by Wednesday's decision.  </P></p>

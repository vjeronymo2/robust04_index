			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unionists angry at Reynolds' remarks UNIONISTS MPs last night attacked Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, over Ireland's constitutional claim on Northern Ireland and over counter-terrorism efforts - reducing still further the chances of political talks resuming soon, Ralph Atkins writes. Mr Reynolds said the Irish government employed 'all means' at its disposal to combat terrorism. But Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist leader said: 'The Irish government has the same ultimate objectives as the IRA, a united, republican Ireland. It is simply that the Irish government want to achieve it by peaceful means, and the IRA otherwise.' Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, has tried to reassure Unionists that Ireland's constitutional claim could be re-negotiated as part of a wider political settlement. But political talks are not expected to resume before May's local elections in Northern Ireland.</p>

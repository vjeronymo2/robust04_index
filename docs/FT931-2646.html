			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Reed Intl 10% up at Pounds 137m prior to merger REED International, the publishing group, increased its pre-tax profits by 10.2 per cent to Pounds 137m in the nine months to December 31, its last separate reporting period before the merger with Elsevier of the Netherlands took effect. Sales rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 1.2bn (Pounds 1.14bn). Reed said that with little sign of economic recovery in the UK and only a weak upturn in the US, most of the profits upturn was attributable to strong market positions and greater efficiency. Books continued to show strong growth and increased operating profit by 32 per cent to Pounds 46.9m, largely due to improved margins and cost control. Underlying performance grew in all three divisions - professional, education and consumer. The largest profit gain was in Butterworths. Reed said several acquisitions contributed to this result, but the main impetus came from production savings and control of overheads. A strong publishing programme contributed to a good result from consumer books. Consumer publishing, comprising IPC magazines and Reed regional newspapers, increased operating profits by 26 per cent to Pounds 50.4m. It was helped by the return to profitability in the television listing sector and because IPC's core consumer magazines and the regional newspapers both performed well, in spite of a fall of revenue. At IPC magazines, the downturn in advertising volumes was partly offset by higher circulation revenue. At Reed regional newspapers, the increase in operating profits was largely because of cost-cutting, although the group said many titles had strengthened their market positions. Business to business published increased operating profits by 19 per cent to Pounds 21.2m. In the US, Cahners performed strongly in the medical and specialist consumer sectors. Costs were cut through keen paper and print buying, the implementation of pre-press technology and job losses. In the UK, Reed business publishing closed three magazines or merged and various activities were centralised, leading to greater efficiency. Operating profits from travel and information services were 18 per cent down at Pounds 35.1m because of higher development costs, the rephasing of a major UK directory and difficult trading conditions in the US hotel market. In spite of adverse trading conditions, Reed travel group increased both revenue and profit by focusing on core activities. Reference publishing saw operating profits dip to Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 7.5m) and profits from exhibitions were also down at Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 9.6m). Reed said both businesses were heavily geared towards the first calendar quarter, so the results did not give a true indication of the underlying performance. Earnings per share rose 9.6 per cent to 17.2p (15.7p). A final dividend of 7.25p gives a total for the nine months of 12.75p, an increase of 6 per cent on a pro-rata basis.</p>

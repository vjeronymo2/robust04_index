			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Outsider named US Prudential chief Prudential Insurance, the US's biggest retail financial services group, yesterday named an outsider as chairman and chief executive for the first time in its 119-year history. The company said Mr Arthur Ryan, currently the number two at Chase Manhattan, would take over when Mr Robert Winters, 62, retires on December 1. The appointment of an outsider highlights the Prudential's expansion into mutual funds, lending and other financial services beyond its core life insurance business. In areas such as credit cards and mortgage lending, the Prudential is in direct competition with banking groups such as Chase. Mr Ryan faces the immediate task of retouching Prudential's tarnished reputation, which has been sullied by a scandal at Prudential Securities, its broking arm. Last year, Prudential Securities agreed to pay up to Dollars 371m in fines and restitution to settle charges that it defrauded hundreds of thousands of investors in the early 1980s by selling them Dollars 8bn of high-risk limited partnerships. Although it wasn't directly involved in the scandal, the strength of the Prudential Insurance name helped to bring investors into the partnerships. Mr Winters, an actuary by training, had indicated that he would retire early ever since becoming chairman six years ago, the Prudential said. It added that the board had picked an outsider because 'he was the best man for the job'. Mr Ryan, 52, a banker with a reputation for toughness and strong operating skills, will face a very different culture at Prudential. The group, which is based in Newark, New Jersey, is a mutual institution, owned by its 50m policyholders, with an approach to business sometimes described as 'Prudential polite'. It employs more than 100,000 people and had revenues of Dollars 45bn last year. The new chairman said the Prudential would be 'a tough, focused competitor with the highest standard of business ethics'. He said that he would start by 'working intensively' to understand its operations. Mr Ryan and Mr Thomas Labrecque, Chase's chairman, have presided over a strong recovery at the New York banking group. The group's cumbersome structure was streamlined, with all line units around the world reporting to Mr Ryan. However, Mr Ryan's chances of taking over as chairman were thought to be limited because the two men are only four years apart in age. Mr Labrecque said last night that the relatively small gap between the men's ages had 'undoubtedly been part of the issue for Art'. He said it meant that 'at some point it was inevitable' that Mr Ryan would seek the helm of another company. Chase said yesterday that it did not intend to name a replacement for Mr Ryan, and was instead promoting the three executive vice-presidents responsible for its main divisions to work directly under Mr Labrecque.</p>

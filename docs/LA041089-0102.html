			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> UEBERROTH, EASTERN UNIONS REACH PACT, TAKE IT TO JUDGE;  </P> <P> WOULD END ACQUISITION ROADBLOCK  </P> <P> Unions at Eastern Airlines and a management group headed by former baseball  commissioner Peter Ueberroth have reached agreements that would remove a major  obstacle to the sale of the strikebound carrier, a labor source said today.  </P> <P> The source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said a formal announcement  would be made later today before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland in New  York. Lifland must approve any sale of the airline.  </P> <P> Lifland began a closed meeting with the principals at mid-day in bankruptcy  court but there was no immediate word on the progress of the talks, which have  been held under a news blackout.  </P> <P> Ueberroth and his group have been seeking more than $200 million in concessions  from three unions and Eastern's non-contract employees, but there was no  immediate word on what, if any, pay-backs are contained in the tentative  accords.  </P> <P> The source declined to discuss the agreements further.  </P> <P> The tentative agreement followed a weekend of secret talks in Washington  between the unions and representatives of Ueberroth, who last week reached  agreement to buy Eastern from Texas Air Corp. for $464 million. Ueberroth could  have called off the deal if agreements were not reached with the unions by  midnight Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Sell Eastern Shuttle  </P> <P> Ueberroth has said he will go ahead with plans to sell the lucrative Eastern  Shuttle to New York developer Donald Trump for $365 million.  </P> <P> The unions involved are the International Assn. of Machinists, the Air Line  Pilots Assn. and the Transport Workers Union.  </P> <P> The IAM struck Eastern on March 4 after refusing to accept more than $120  million in wage and other concessions demanded by Texas Air, Eastern's parent  company. The other unions have accepted concessions in the past, but honored  IAM's picket lines.  </P> <P> The unions brought Eastern operations to a virtual halt, and the airline filed  for protection under the bankruptcy laws on March 9, five days after the  walkout began.  </P> <P> Eastern since the strike has been seeking court orders requiring the pilots to  return to work. A federal district judge in Miami was scheduled to issue a  ruling on the request today, but his office said the judge had granted a  request from Eastern and the pilots union that he not issue the decision today.  </P> <P> The weekend talks were held under the guidance of attorney David Shapiro, who  is serving as court-appointed examiner of the airline under an order issued by  the bankruptcy court.  </P> <P> While union officials said they believed they could come to terms with the  Ueberroth group, they expressed concerns about its plans for the carrier.  </P> <P> Union officials also questioned statements by Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo  that Eastern could be operating within 24 hours of completion of the sale to  Ueberroth.  </P> <P> Eastern has been flying a skeleton schedule since the IAM walkout.  </P> <P> Officials from two of the unions, noting that the majority of Eastern's planes  have been grounded for more than a month, said it would take some time to  inspect them.  </P></p>

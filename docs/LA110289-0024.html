			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCIETY: CULTURES MIX AT 'MIDNIGHT IN MOSCOW!'  </P> <P> Soviet director Roman Viktyuk and set designer Vladimir Boyer went native  Saturday night and dived -- with knives and forks that flashed as bravely as  Georgian dancers' swords -- into California culture as represented by salad  with goat cheese, surf 'n turf and raspberry cream cake.  </P> <P> The arrival of the cake occasioned a consultation between Viktyuk and his  interpreter, who explained to Viktyuk that the 350 chorused voices in the Hotel  del Coronado's Crown Room were climbing the scales in honor of the Moscow  director's birthday. Viktyuk responded with a quick wave and a tired smile, but  could be forgiven for looking partied out, since he had spent the previous  evening at a downtown San Diego nightspot celebrating his natal day in an  enthusiastic survey of California wines.  </P> <P> Viktyuk and Boyer, in town to help stage the world premiere of Soviet  playwright Nikolai Kolyada's "Slingshot" playing at the San Diego Repertory  Theatre, shared the spotlight as guests of honor at the Rep's "Midnight in  Moscow!" gala, which was given as one of the seemingly innumerable ancillary  events of the city's Soviet arts festival.  </P> <P> Despite its name, the party actually began at 6 p.m. (or 5 a.m. Moscow time)  with a VIP reception that gave top-level patrons a chance to schmooze, through  interpreters, with the visiting Soviets. Viktyuk and Boyer made easy targets  because, like most visiting Soviets, they wore suits instead of black tie. (The  light gray pinstripe regularly sported by Soviet Minister of Culture Mikhail  Gribanov, who did not attend the Rep gala, has already become something of a  legend).  </P> <P> Not quite everyone required an interpreter. "I've been really practicing that  Russian," reported Rep managing director Adrian Stewart as he rattled off a  greeting in what may have been a Moscow accent. "I know how to say 'hello, good  evening and nice to meet you.' " (Stewart added that he also knows moznah,  moznah, which he said now echoes through Rep offices and auditoriums. It  translates as "move it!")  </P> <P> Jennifer Hankins and Linnea Arrington shared the duties of mounting "Midnight  in Moscow!"  </P> <P> "Having 'Slingshot' here is so thrilling that we had to build our gala around  it," Hankins said. "We have Russians here tonight, but we're also making a lot  of money, which for any arts organization in this day and age is pretty  exciting."  </P> <P> "Having the Russians here made this event an easy sell," added Arrington, who  echoed a comment made by other party-givers who have been lucky enough to snare  a Soviet or two. Anything Soviet is so "in" in fund-raising circles these days,  in fact, that itinerant Soviets could easily become a growth industry for San  Diego charities in the 1990s.  </P> <P> Hankins estimated net proceeds of $50,000, a fair portion of which was raised  by a live auction of such items as a purebred Siberian husky pup (the buyer,  who paid $750, actually will get the pick of the next litter at the donating  kennel) and a walk-on role in a November preview performance of the Rep's  annually staged "A Christmas Carol." That bit of fleeting fame cost its buyer  $3,250.  </P> <P> One of the blue crystal "Friendship" eggs, commissioned as a commemoration of  the arts festival by Jessop's Jewelers and created by British artist Carl  Faberge, ended in the hands of Shelia Davis and hotelier Larry Lawrence. Davis  was listed as event honorary chair in recognition of her help producing  "Slingshot," a donation that won her considerable praise from table-mate and  Rep producing director Sam Woodhouse.  </P> <P> "Shelia's contribution is one of the boldest acts of generosity in our history,  because it allowed us to bring to San Diego an artist (Viktyuk), who I would  say is a genius," said Woodhouse, who went on to praise his theater's  production. "This is a work of art like San Diego has never seen. We're not  doing middle-of-the-road American theater. This is a very Russian, very  passionate, very international piece of art."  </P> <P> Guests at the gala contented themselves with international art in the form of  the Wayne Foster Orchestra, which enticed the Soviets to the floor with "La  Bamba" and "I Heard It Through the Grapevine," and with performances of an  Uzbekistan drum dance and a traditional Russian shawl dance. The Wayne Foster  singers, who make a point of moving with the music, stood by and marveled at  the exotic arabesques of the Soviet dancers.  </P> <P> The guest list included Dottie Georgens, emigre artist Natasha Doubrovskaya,  Amy and Bill Barnett, Susan and John Wertz, councilman Bob Filner, Sheri and  Ben Kelts, Diane Saikhon with Alex Szekely, Maggie and Scott Anderson, Valerie  Preiss with Harry Cooper, Bud Fischer, Susan Zale with Jack Berkman, Mary  Swanby, Pat and Charles Beck, and Susan Eddington with Larry Favrot.  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO -- A sextet of Soviets drew several dozen key supporters of the San  Diego Opera to a genuine midnight supper and cast party after the Oct. 21  opening of "Boris Godunov."  </P> <P> Bill and Rene Jenkins hosted the intimate soiree in an upstairs room at the San  Diego Yacht Club and cheered delightedly when title bass Alexander Morozov,  conductor Jansoug Kakhidze and other cast members burst into song over the  stuffed eggs, offered from a tray by a strolling server who looked altogether  enchanted by this response to so ingenuous an hors d'oeuvre.  </P> <P> All the other principals, including mezzo-soprano Irina Bogacheva and tenor  Teimuraz Gugushvili, joined members of the opera's Bravissimo Forte Patrons  (who donate $5,000 or more per year) for the buffet of chicken hash, roast beef  and blinchikis, all of it set around a carved ice bear that dripped slowly onto  a silver platter of crudites. Most cast members paused first to accept the  glasses of iced vodka and champagne that waited just inside the door.  </P> <P> The scene was jovial, occasionally musical and never quiet. Mayor Maureen  O'Connor arrived in the company of her sister and brother-in-law, Mavourneen  O'Connor and Tom Kravis, and provoked nearly operatic peals of laughter when  she addressed Kakhidze as "Spencer Tracy;" the conductor evidently is very  proud of his close resemblance to the late actor, and he offered a toast when  given the nickname.  </P> <P> Opera director Ian Campbell and San Diego Museum of Art assistant director Jane  Rice huddled by the buffet and reminisced about Thanksgiving 1987, which they  spent in Moscow with O'Connor and other members of the San Diego delegation  that negotiated the exhibits and performances for the Soviet arts festival.  </P> <P> "We laid the groundwork there," Rice said solemnly.  </P> <P> "It was only 15 months from 'go' to 'whoa,' but we put the opera together that  fast," added Campbell. "That's a very short time period when you're dealing  with the Soviets."  </P> <P> Among the guests were opera President Esther Burnham with Jack Lasher, Lollie  and Bill Nelson, Lee and Frank Goldberg, Frank Rice, Sally and John Thornton,  Ann Campbell, Kathryn and James Colachis, Monsignor I. Brent Eagen, Jacque  Powell and Marion Bateson.  </P></p>

The ASAHI SHIMBUN and the MAINICHI SHIMBUN raised  subscription fees last December and the YOMIURI SHIMBUN in  January, all by 200 yen per month. The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN  raised its monthly subscription fee by 300 yen in February.    The FTC suspect the four major dailies colluded in  increasing  the fees, the officials said.    The Antimonopoly Law stipulates that a concerted price hike  occurs if two of the top five firms in a sector with a market of  60 billion yen or more in which the top three firms together  account for a share of more than 70 percent, raise prices of  their goods within three months of each other.</p>

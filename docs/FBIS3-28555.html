Security  Council.    "The (South Korean) Government will not abandon its efforts  to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue  even if it is referred to the Security Council," Kim said. "Even  if dialogue fails, the government has to prepare for everything  so that the people can trust their government and have  confidence in the government with regard to their safety and  survival," Kim said.    The presidential instruction came at a Chongwadae  [presidential offices] meeting attended by Prime Minister Yi  Hoe-chang, Deputy Prime Minister and head of the National  Unification Board Yi Yong-tok, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu,  Home Affairs Minister Choe Hyong-u, Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae and others.    The meeting was convened amid rising international tension  after the United States said it will have to refer the North  Korean nuclear question to the U.N. Security Council if  Pyongyang and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) fail  to reach agreement on IAEA inspections by Feb. 21.    President Kim reiterated the Seoul government's position  that  it does not want to see North Korea isolated from the world  community.    "North Korea will have to allow comprehensive inspection by  the IAEA of its nuclear facilities as it has promised, and a  political solution to the nuclear issue has to be achieved  through sincere dialogue between South and North Korea," Kim  said.    "North Korea is facing a grave point by refusing to accept  (IAEA) inspection," Kim said. "The (Seoul) government should  maintain the principles and consistency of its policy while  exercising flexibility in order to resolve the nuclear problem."    President Kim went on to stress that "it is important above  all else to maintain close cooperation with the United States  and other countries," according to Chong Chong-uk, senior  presidential secretary for foreign and national security affairs.    Kim then told Foreign Minister Han to hold close  consultations with U.S. Government leaders when he visits  Washington on Wednesday.    With regard to the perceived rise in tension on the Korean  peninsula, the president said that the ministers should inform  the people of as many developments as possible.    In addition, Kim instructed them to strengthen  inter-ministry  cooperation as the North Korean nuclear issue reaches an  important turning point before and after the IAEA Board of  Governors' meeting Feb. 21.    Briefing reporters on the background of Tuesday's security  meeting, Chong said that considerable efforts will be made to  peacefully resolve the nuclear question even after it is brought  to the Security Council.    Chong said he did not believe the Security Council would  impose economic sanctions immediately against North Korea.    Rather, the world body would have to go through many stages  before deciding to impose sanctions.    That is why the Seoul government will continue its efforts  to  resolve the question through dialogue even after it is referred  to the Security Council, he said.    Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae reported to the meeting that  the frequency of exercises by the North Korean Army and Air  Force has been on the rise recently. His ministry has obtained  evidence that defensive exercises around the nuclear complex in  Yongbyong, north of Pyongyang, are being strengthened and work  to reinforce underground facilities stepped up, Yi said.    North Korea is also stepping up propaganda efforts to  denounce South Korea, he said. Despite these actions, Yi said  there were no signs that North Korea would launch a provocation  in the immediate future. Asked whether South Korea has been able  to detect signs of an imminent provocation by the North, Chong  said that under the worst circumstances, "we can detect it one  or two days ahead."    "The people can trust our ability to detect it," Chong said.    The reason that President Kim convened the year's first  national security meeting one day before the three-day lunar new  year's holiday begins, is because the deadline for resolving the  North Korean nuclear issue is approaching fast and because there  is no indication it will be solved soon.    President Kim apparently wanted to reassess the government's  policy and dispel the rising sense of anxiety here, fueled by  foreign reports that warn of an imminent crisis in Korea.</p>

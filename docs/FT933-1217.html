			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (9): Hunt is on for better returns - Equities / The Continent is finding favour with investors as the United States and UK stock markets lose their bloom IN SPITE OF expectations of only sluggish economic growth in OECD countries, stock markets have been booming this year, with record highs for the UK's FT-SE index and the US Dow Jones Industrial average. Low interest rates are expected to fuel further stock market gains, as developed economies emerge from recession. In addition, the current low interest rate environment has encouraged investors to favour stock markets, switching out of bonds and money markets in search of better returns. 'Anyone looking for strong GDP growth in Europe in the next 12 months is likely to be disappointed, but that is not to say that the combined effects of lower interest rates, weaker currencies against the US dollar, and, in particular, restructuring of European industry, cannot produce big gains in corporate profits and a continuation of the shift towards cyclical stocks', argues Mr Richard Davidson, an economist at Morgan Stanley International. In Europe, financial stocks, the first to benefit from lower interest rates, have already rallied strongly, up 41.9 per cent in Europe since the start of the year. But cyclical stocks, after three years of underperformance have also bounced back by 30 per cent since the start of the year. Consumer stocks on the other hand have risen just 3.5 per cent since the start of the year. 'Cyclicals in Europe are back in fashion and, as might be expected, the rubbish has risen with the tide, on expectations of reduced debt problems and exponential growth in earnings per share next year,' reports Mr Davidson. Ms Sophie Blancpain, European equity strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston, believes that Europe is 'the hot place to be.' She argues that the US stock market cycle is two years ahead of Europe, since real interest rates have already fallen to very low levels. Real rates in Europe on the other hand still average around five per cent, ranging from an extreme of around 10 per cent in Denmark to just 2 per cent in Germany. When real interest rates available on bank accounts fall below dividend yields, there is a clear incentive for investors to take the additional risk of buying stocks. With average dividend yields ranging from 4 1/2 per cent in Spain to about 2 per cent in Germany, that stage is not far off. Although the prospects for dividend growth remain muted, as companies rebuild their balance sheets, many analysts believe that there is room for a pick-up in earnings, despite low economic growth. 'One of the positive aspects of Europe is that there will be a cyclical rally, due to re-evaluation as (European economies) come out of recession,' said Ms Blancpain. She expects to see 'a better performance than growth expectations suggest. They have the potential to show earnings growth through restructuring.' The restructuring of European companies, many of which are currently less competitive than their US counterparts, is already under way, helped by labour reforms, she believes. In fact, continental Europe has already outperformed the US and UK so far this year. Although the UK and US markets have hit the headlines by reaching record highs, they have actually offered relatively low returns: 7.7 per cent for the US and 10.5 per cent for the UK, compared with 25.9 per cent for Germany, and over 40 per cent in local currency terms for Sweden, Italy and Spain, according to figures from Salomon Brothers International. 'The FT-SE may have breached the 3000 mark, but it is the second worst performer' of the 10 leading stock markets tracked by Salomon Brothers, according to international equity strategist Mr Marcus Grubb. The Japanese market, which is still viewed as sick since it is still 48 per cent off its highs, has also performed well this year, and is up 24.5 per cent. The prospect of further cuts to already low Japanese rates is helping to fuel renewed interest in the market. 'The government is more concerned about recession than inflation,' said Mr Philip Wostencroft, an equity strategist at Smith New Court, who expects further easing of rates this year. However, he admits that price/earnings ratios are very high in Japan, because earnings have been marked down by recession. High price/earnings ratios - 24 times in Germany and 22 times in France - are also a cause of concern in Europe. Chartists are beginning to worry that high p/e ratios, given the relatively poor growth prospects, could mean that markets are heading for a crash. However, Mr Grubb argues that p/e ratios are not currently a good indicator of value, partly because earnings are cyclically depressed. His argument is that the current outlook of low inflation, low interest rates and low economic growth is actually positive for stock markets, as in the UK in the 1960s. He believes that the flow of cash into equity markets caused by low interest rates has only just started and will buoy the market for some time to come. 'A lot of people looking at past levels of earnings and economic growth are concerned about the current level of stock market valuation. They forget that there is a cycle of asset class rotation,' said Mr Grubb. 'Relative to earnings, profits and growth, equities are expensive; but relative to cash and bonds, they are cheap. However, within this context, most analysts favour continental Europe, suggesting a broad consensus that the US and UK have lost their bloom. 'As the US and UK economies went into the pit of recession in 1990, their stock markets performed well, because the green shoots of recovery were priced in very early. The same thing is happening in Germany now,' believes Mr Grubb. There has also been growing interest in emerging markets in Asia and Latin America, where economic growth is running well ahead of the developed countries.</p>

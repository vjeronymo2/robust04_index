			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Inspectors attack 'narrow' work-based qualification New work-based qualifications concentrate too much on narrow practical skills and provide insufficient knowledge and understanding about the job, inspectors from the Further Education Funding Council said yesterday. This criticism came in a report on the national vocational qualifications introduced into colleges and workplaces over the past few years. The council, whose responsibilities include ensuring the quality of further education in England, also said that there was little evidence that these qualifications were meeting their objective of rationalising vocational qualifications. In some colleges, they said, 'there has been an increase in the number of awards. For example, in some vocational areas NVQs are now offered alongside traditional qualifications'. More worrying for the government will be the criticisms of the qualifications themselves. The inspectors said there was evidence of widespread misunderstanding of the aim of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications, which developed the NVQs, that knowledge and understanding should be integral elements of competence to do a job. Some lecturers and assessors, as well as employers and a few employees, had expressed concern about trainees' understanding of the principles underlying competence. A study commissioned by the inspectorate in brickwork, business administration and hairdressing compared the new qualifications with those they replaced. The overall impression gained from the study was that NVQ trainees would be better fitted to carry out immediately the practical tasks required in a particular job, but less able to appreciate the job in its context and to react to changing circumstances. Dr Terry Melia, the Further Education's Funding Council's chief inspector, said more attention should be devoted to core skills and underpinning knowledge, while employers should become more involved in training and assessment in the workplace if the qualifications were to have credibility.

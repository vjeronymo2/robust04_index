			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Private View: The whole Globe on his shoulders - Sam Wanamaker has spent 24 years battling to rebuild Shakespeare's theatre IT TOOK Shakespeare and his fellow shareholders a few months to move their Globe theatre from Shoreditch to Bankside in 1588. It will have taken Sam Wanamaker, the American actor-director, more than 25 years to reconstruct it  -if he gets there at all. His monomaniac dedication to rebuilding the Globe has been more derided than applauded. But four sections of a 20-sided timber playhouse have risen from their concrete plinth by the River Thames, two more will be added in September, and last month Wanamaker was made an honorary Commander of the British Empire. Are the doubters themselves beginning to doubt the thing can never happen? I found the 74-year-old impresario in his Bear Gardens museum next door, wrapped against the summer cold, and asked him what made him persist. Any normal person, I said, would have quit long ago. 'Yes, that's true. I think it's because I'm a stubborn person, that I have very strong convictions and that I had - and have - a vision of what this project will be. And it can only be successful. It can only be successful on all kinds of levels. It will transform the nature of theatre in this country and in America.' There are mock Globes all over the world, though none claiming the architectural authenticity of this one. Wanamaker saw his first Shakespeare in a Globe in Chicago, where he was born. As a drama student he worked in another replica at the Great Lakes festival in Cleveland, Ohio. 'So when I came to England in 1949 to find the original Globe and found nothing except a plaque on a wall, I was bewildered. Here was potential for touristic exploitation.' Wanamaker's reconstruction is about 100 yards from the remains of the original Globe, which lie directly behind the head office of the Financial Times and next door to Christopher Marlowe's Rose Theatre. The foundations of both were uncovered recently - a mixed blessing, as it turned out, for the Bankside pioneer. Wanamaker will not - cannot - see anything wrong with his idea. Why, then, has it taken him a quarter of a century to realise it? The usual answer is that Shakespeare is already in good supply. The National Theatre is half a mile along the South Bank, the Barbican Theatre, the London home of the Royal Shakespeare Company, is across the water, and Stratford-on-Avon amply satisfies the need for a national shrine. Wanamaker has better explanations. For one thing, he said, the Establishment has a down on him. 'I am convinced that if somebody like Peter Hall or Ian McKellen or Trevor Nunn had decided this was a good idea it would have been built years ago, with government funding. But I was an alien in more ways than one: I was not only a British alien, I was a London alien and a Southwark alien. The theatrical establishment has no truck with me whatsoever.' Why is that? 'You can well ask. I think it's typical British condescension. First of all, they don't think Americans can do Shakespeare - that it's their British birthright. I haven't got a great theatrical Shakespearean background: I don't claim to be an expert Shakespearean. But not one - and I know them all  -not one of them has given me their voluntary support for this project.' His voice had risen angrily. 'Not one, in the 24 years that I've been involved. 'They clearly believe that what I was trying to do was self-aggrandisement. They also had, I think, that innate suspicion regarding all Americans - that they are money-grubbing, out to make a fast buck.' Did you, as a matter of fact, think you might make a lot of money out of it? 'No. I never thought I would make a lot of money out of it. I have been accused of this over and over again by the local authority. I threatened to sue one of the Southwark council members who said this in the chamber.' He continued: 'A lot of my British friends say I'm obsessed by this . . . what is it? . . . xenophobia, and think I'm exaggerating. That's part of their demurring that there is no such attitude to Americans. You know very well there is. It's resentment for the fact that they had to turn to the Americans for help during the war. They welcomed it, but they resented it. And they still resent it.' It was not the Establishment but the newly-elected left-wing Labour council of Southwark in 1982 which did most to defeat him. Intent on restoring industry and housing to the south bank, they rescinded the decision of their moderate predecessors to give Wanamaker a site. It took him three years and a court action to get his planning permission back. Wanamaker felt this blow keenly because he had himself been black-listed in the US as a leftie. He is a British resident because in the early 1950s he was sub-poenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee while filming in Britain and decided not to go home. 'I said (to the council): 'I'm on your side, but what you are doing is destroying a potential for new jobs, housing and industry.' I tried every way. It didn't matter that I was left-wing, blacklisted. They didn't give a damn about that. My whole history is creditable in terms of the action and sacrifices I undertook of time and money and effort to win through on social causes. I came from the working class. My father was poverty- stricken. As much as I appealed to my history, they just absolutely turned a blind eye.' The discoveries of the Rose and Globe remains should have helped Wanamaker more than they did. According to him, the 'Establishment theatricals' seized on the 'real' Rose to discredit his 'fake' Globe. Negotiations for joint fund-raising failed and Wanamaker says he severed relations when Rose supporters began suggesting that Shakespeare had both acted and been acted at the Rose. 'There is not one iota of evidence for that.' His blood pressure rose again when the press reported recently that an unknown American was negotiating with Lord Hanson, owner of the original Globe site, to buy the land and put up his own replica. 'The press is extremely naive,' Wanamaker thundered. 'They just pick up this press release. They don't ask who this man is. Do they call Hanson and say is he really negotiating, or what? No. They just print the bloody story.' He was shouting now. 'Then they call me up and say Whaddayou think . . . ?' You get pretty angry about things, I said. Does it keep you awake at night? 'No, never] I don't get really angry, I get passionate. The difference is distinct. I flare up from time to time at the stupidity of people and the short-sightedness of people . . . It doesn't take much imagination to see the potential of this.' What about your health? Is this thing driving you to an early grave? 'It's helped to keep me going. It's helped to keep me young and active and alive and it's involved me with all kinds of circumstances and people I would never ever have experienced.' What about the worry? 'No, I'm not a worrier. I sometimes get frustrated with people and situations but that never affected my health and never did anything but make me more determined.' That Wanamaker should still be trying to raise money after so many years made me wonder whether it was, in the end, his own personality that was the biggest obstacle to realising his dream. He reflected. 'Well, I think it is true to say that I have a difficult personality, that I rub people the wrong way - some people,' he added quickly, 'some people. It's also true to say that the bulk of the funding has been raised by me. Now, the only way you can raise money from the private sector is on a one-to-one basis. 'Therefore I think there is a contradiction there between my personality possibly being abrasive and the fact that I have the ability to convince people in a very difficult situation. It's very hard to judge oneself and one's personality.' After so many years you must have a pretty good idea. 'Well, I'm tenacious . . .' Is your abrasiveness due to frustration, impatience . . . ? 'Impatience, probably.' Because people are stupid, slow-witted? 'No, they're not stupid.' What is it? 'Well, you know I depended for many years on volunteers. People say they will do something and then don't do it. And that made me impatient. And of course I was very bitter, I suppose, with the extreme left in Southwark.' Do you thing you convey the impression of someone just trying to raise money for a self-glorifying project? 'No. Anybody who knows me, or spends time with me, cannot believe that I am superficial, or phoney or dishonest or self-aggrandising. Cannot believe it. It doesn't take more than a few minutes of discussion with me . . . and I defy anybody to prove that I have ever gained anything out of this project other than a marvellous experience of life.' Wanamaker has spent Pounds 10m so far, needs Pounds 2m to complete the Globe and Pounds 8m to build the rest of a complex which is to include a second, indoor theatre, a museum, lecture hall, library, shops and restaurants. He says the proposed national lottery may help him. Is this thing definitely going to be built now? 'How can you ask me that question after what I've said? Yes, Yes, Yes] It's on it's way to being built.'</p>

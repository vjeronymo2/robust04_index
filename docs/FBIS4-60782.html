			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuras Karmanaw: "Stanislaw Shushkevich: `I Am </F> More Determined Than You Think'"]    [Text] Analyzing the reasons for the economic and political  crisis -- the situation in which our society has found itself --  Stanislaw Shushkevich said that the key reason was the  unwillingness of Belarusian authorities to undertake specific  measures to reform the Belarusian economy. Market declarations,  issued by the government, and antimarket measures, undertaken by  it, have led to unbridled inflation and a catastrophic drop in  GDP. (In February of this year, GDP dropped by 36 percent in  comparison with the same period in 1993). The drop in  production is continuing. "It is necessary to tell people the  truth, to dispel the myth that, in comparison with other states,  the Belarusian people live better," believes the former speaker  of the legislature. "Having realized our current situation, it  is necessary to undertake steps aimed at pulling the state out  of the crisis." S. Shushkevich bases his steps on the program  -- drafted by the Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly and the  United Democratic Party of Belarus -- which foresees the quicker  implementation of reforms.    As for the political situation in the Republic, S.  Shushkevich paid attention to the constitutional crisis caused  by the signing of the monetary merger agreement with Russia.  Having sharply denounced the steps taken by the government, he  called them "a conscientious gambling on public opinion,"  explaining his viewpoint by the fact that the government cannot  but understand that even if the agreement comes into force in  its current form, Belarusian workers in Soligorsk will receive  their wages no quicker than workers in Vorkuta [Russia], who  have not been paid in several months. S. Shushkevich cited the  example of the Supreme Soviet commission, headed by A.  Lukashenka, as the manifestation of the exacerbation of the  constitutional crisis. "Though the commission's activity has  made a lot of noise," argues S. Shushkevich, "no `mafia' members  were punished. At the same time, the dismissal of the  commission was illegal. The fact that some deputies withdrew  from this commission could not be the reason for its shut down.  The commission was enacted by the Supreme Soviet, so it was up  to the Supreme Soviet to dismiss it."    Answering questions from the audience, which chiefly  concerned the "unused Supreme Soviet chairman's power" and  admonishments for being indecisive, S. Shushkevich said: "I am  more determined than you think. However, my determination has  never exceeded and will never exceed the limits of the law. As  for the allegedly unused opportunities of the chairman's  position, you are overestimating them. My power differed  considerably from that of a president. I was only authorized to  sign international treaties and agreements, and nobody will  accuse me of giving Belarus a poor image on the international  scene. As for other things, I fulfilled the Supreme Soviet's  will. Please, recall my negative position on the collective  security treaty. However, I was forced to sign it because this  was the Supreme Soviet's decision." Rejecting the reproaches  for being unable to set up a team of like-minded people when he  occupied the position of Supreme Soviet chairman, S. Shushkevich  said that such a team exists and, considering the recent  mistakes -- one of his key mistakes being that "he trusted  unworthy advisers" -- he will draw corresponding conclusions.  It seems that the saying "forewarned is forearmed"  characterizes fairly well Shushkevich's trump card on which his  team counts.</p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Railtrack There are clear attractions for the UK government in privatising Railtrack before the next general election. Another Pounds 3bn or so would help plug the Treasury's funding gap. Moreover, unlike the Post Office, there would be no need for legislation. Railtrack could also appeal to investors and not simply those who are railway buffs. The company is a utility, which will receive its income mainly from track charges paid by the new breed of rail franchisees. Railtrack therefore has much in common with other transport infrastructure suppliers such as BAA or Associated British Ports. Still, the timetable looks ambitious. Railtrack has only been formally in existence since April. Assuming privatisation in 1995-96, the company would be able to show investors only one set of annual results. Moreover, Railtrack would probably not be as low risk an investment as other utilities. Most of the rail franchisees will be subsidised by the taxpayer, so Railtrack's income could be vulnerable to a future reduction of those subsidies. The political risk is also probably somewhat greater than with other utilities because the rail regulator is formally required to take account of guidance from ministers until the end of 1996. The other regulators are more independent. One danger is that the Labour Party might win a mid-1996 election and order a cut in Railtrack's charges as a means of driving down fares paid by passengers.</p>

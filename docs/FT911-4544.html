			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Internatio-Mueller plummets NET PROFITS at Internatio-Mueller, the diversified Dutch transport, trading and engineering group, plummeted to Fl 2.6m (Dollars 1.38m) in 1990 from Fl 56.1m in 1989, reflecting setbacks in Australia, New Zealand and the port of Rotterdam. The company, which cautioned in December that it would produce a 'small' net profit in 1990, is to omit the cash dividend, which in 1989 totalled Fl 3.60. Shareholders will receive a tax-free payout in shares of 2 per cent. Turnover rose by 7.4 per cent to Fl 2.9bn, while pre-tax operating profit tumbled to Fl 17.2m from Fl 60.2m. In Rotterdam, the group's transport division was hit by a downturn at its 44 per cent-owned Europe Combined Terminals, the world's largest container handling company. Unfavourable economic conditions in Australia and New Zealand hurt the results of Internatio's trading division. At the same time, its engineering division had had to create provisions for several technical installation projects. Internatio, which said it was unable to make a forecast for 1991 results, plans to concentrate increasingly on its engineering and trading businesses in future. Nationale-Nederlanden, the biggest insurance company in the Netherlands, said that losses at Orion, its UK subsidiary, were expected to narrow by roughly one third in 1991, falling to around Pounds 30m (Dollars 53.7m) from Pounds 48.8m in 1990. Major losses at Orion, which had posted a profit of Pounds 6.3m in 1989, were one of three main factors behind the 7 per cent decline in Nat-Ned's 1990 net profit to Fl 905m (Dollars 479m). Nat-Ned's results were also affected by two severe winter storms which lashed northwestern Europe in January and February 1990 and by the losses posted by its non-life insurance activities in North America. Mr Jaap van Rijn, Nat-Ned's chairman, said the North American non-life insurance market was still in a down phase but should improve in 1992.</p>

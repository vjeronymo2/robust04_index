			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "State Picks Counties To Pioneer Reforms"] </F>   [Text] The central government has selected 13 counties  with varying degrees of development to carry out comprehensive  reforms aimed at bringing prosperity to farmers.    The counties will pioneer economic development and social  security reform in the next three to five years as a pilot  project for national growth, a State official said in an  interview with CHINA DAILY over the weekend.    They will serve as a case-study for authorities reviewing  the  on- going national rural reforms.    The programme is based around the concept of making rich  counties richer and allowing poor counties to climb out of  poverty, said an official from the State Commission for Economic  Restructuring (SCER).    Experts and government officials will provide specialist  advice and help solve problems emerging from local reforms, the  SCER official said.    Each model county will have a special fund from its province  or city to ensure smooth development of reform.    These counties are scattered in ten [as published] provinces  such as Zhaodong in Heilongjiang, Haicheng and Wafangdian in  Liaoning, Huanghua in Hebei, Gongyi in Henan, Guanghan and  Fuling in Sichuan, Xuanzhou in Anhui, Yangxin in Shandong,  Shanyin in Shanxi, Changshu in Jiangsu, Zengcheng in Guangdong  and Shunyi in Beijing.    Seven of them are in affluent river delta areas or in  regions  adjoining big cities while the rest lay in inland and  mountainous regions.    By China's standards, five of them are considered  "developed," six are "moderately developed" and the other two  are "less developed."    "We choose those counties because they represent the actual  conditions in this country, where levels of economic development  differ greatly in different regions," the official said.    County-owned enterprises will be encouraged to switch either  to a shareholding or shareholding co-operative system. Some of  them will diversify to include related industrial production to  enhance market competition.    The key parts of social security reform will be establishing  solid health insurance plans and pension funds.    Local labour markets will also be developed to guide the  flow  of the surplus rural workforce, according to the official.    Reform of local science and education will be carried out in  line with the local economic development.    Capital drawn into the pilot counties from overseas  investors  as well as other provinces should be used to cultivate natural  resources, the official said.    These pilot counties will continue to push reform of local  governments to serve the region's economic development.    The official said SCER will help hammer out a monitoring  programme to oversee the reform process in these counties.    The project's evaluation will be thorough and objective and  reflect the implementation of the reforms.    Information exchanges in these model counties should be  enhanced to distribute their experiences.    The SCER official stressed each county will be able to carry  out individualized reform measures.</p>

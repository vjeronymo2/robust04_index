In his view, it is possible that even the current management  of the Kymmene Group may have different opinions on the matters.  Ehrnrooth has been the chairman of the Central Federation of  Finnish Forest Industries and the Central Federation of Finnish  Industry for many years.    In Ehrnrooth's view, the forestry industry should embark on  a  counterattack that should use an information strike based on  scientific fact as its weapon. This endeavor would be supported  by an international panel of scientists.    ``One can certainly find bad conditions in the field, but  the  discussion regarding them must be elevated to a higher level,  above the wild public debate. New argumentation must be  developed, because it has become evident that the industry is  unable to hold its own in today's public debate,'' said  Ehrnrooth.    According to Ehrnrooth, one should remember that within the  forestry industry, significant changes have taken place by means  of normal industrial evolution. For example, in his view,  Greenpeace and other environmental organizations have not  contributed to the fact that the pollution of waters has  decreased in severity to a fraction of what it was 20 years ago.    Ehrnrooth would like to see all the industry in Europe  joining forces for a counterattack, as Finland, by itself,  cannot dictate its views on the markets. ``Precise argumentation  is necessary, as intimations only worsen the situation,'' he  said.    ``It is almost inconceivable that the industry has been  unable, in connection with the talk about recycling, for  example, to present its views on the burning of waste. The  debate is conducted on the terms of Greenpeace and other  movements, and the industry's attempts to defend itself have met  with varied success. A large portion of fiber-based wastepaper  lends itself to recycling, but clearly the best way of getting  rid of bad cut is burning, at today's technology level. That is  fire without smoke,'' said Ehrnrooth.    According to Ehrnrooth, the industry has been unable to  close  its ranks, because, in a confused situation some parties will  experience short-term competition advantages. ``Each and every  one may look inward and consider how to benefit from industry or  national advantages,'' he said.    ``We can react with calm to the German magazine DER  SPIEGEL's  recent attack on Finnish forestry, at least as long as the  information is spread through pictures taken in Canada. We have  at our disposal some solid weapons for a counterattack, when we  consider that hardly any other country can manage its forest  resources with the same competence as we, and major mistakes lie  way back in time. The national economy should be given the  opportunity to utilize the tax funds that have systematically  been sunk into our forestry sector,'' said Ehrnrooth.    In domestic raw materials policies, Ehrnrooth still sees  remnants of a closed economy. ``Slices from the national  economic pie were amicably cut for milk production and stumpage.  Such an interlinkage is not allowed anymore,'' he added.    ``The pricing of wood raw materials is a different story,  and  the producers are represented on the markets by a strong  interest organization. It makes one wonder why anyone still  gives it any credence, considering the bad advice it has  dispensed to its members during the last few years,'' he noted.    ``It is not the first time that the Forestry Association,  which is owned by the producers, is pushing for price increases  in the entire field of wood products. It is difficult for me to  understand why other companies would have to follow the Forestry  Association's lead. I would imagine that, in the future, large  forestry companies would deal directly with the forest owners.  When lumber prices are increasing the way they are now, it  should also be reflected in the stumpage prices. On the other  hand, wood pulp prices are so low that it does not make sense to  increase fiber prices,'' said Ehrnrooth.    ``The dual role of the Forestry Association has been subject  for discussions as far back as I can remember. However, the fact  is that the interests of the industry represented by the  Forestry Association are quite similar to the rest of the  industry. Luckily enough, the disagreements regarding raw  materials do not dominate the whole field,'' Ehrnrooth added.    ``Instead of our returning to a policy of price  recommendations, we should find other ways to peaceful  solutions. My opinion is that, in a way, it is in society's  interest that the wood does not rot in the forests. If we cannot  reach an agreement on wood prices, we should consider, for  example, the use of arbitration,'' he concluded.</p>

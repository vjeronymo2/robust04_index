			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / US agrees next stage of Concorde project THE US has given the go-ahead to the next stage of the programme to build a supersonic airliner to replace the ageing Anglo-French Concorde. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will start work next year on the second phase to develop the airframe, propulsion and systems technologies over seven years at an expected cost of Dollars 1.2bn, Mr Lewis Williams, Nasa's director of high speed research, said yesterday at the Dubai Air Show. The aircraft, planned to enter service early in the next century, will have twice Concorde's 3,000 nautical mile range, carry 300 passengers - three times Concorde's capacity - and operate at close to standard subsonic air fares. Nasa began research in 1990, evaluating environmental considerations, including atmospheric effects, nitrogen oxide engine emissions, noise and sonic boom. That first phase, costing about Dollars 400m, has shown the aircraft to be 'environmentally compatible', said Mr Williams. 'We had to ensure that the environmental issues could be resolved before embarking on the second stage of research,' he added. Although other government agencies, aircraft manufacturers and engine-makers elsewhere are collaborating on the supersonic aircraft study, the US appears to be taking a far more active role in research. Nasa's annual high-speed research budget has just been increased from Dollars 117m this year to Dollars 197m in 1994, although the agency had asked for Dollars 187m for next year. The US is keen to catch up with the European aerospace industry's expertise and experience in supersonic airliner development through Concorde. However, any future aircraft is expected to involve broad international co-operation because it is widely accepted that the market will bear only one programme. Mr Williams argued that a 300-seat supersonic aircraft offering passengers fares similar or slightly higher than for subsonic travel would compete effectively against the new 600-seat subsonic super jumbo conventional airliners which the aerospace industry is now studying.</p>

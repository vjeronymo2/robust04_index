Coroas, </F> Cuban National Center for Scientific Research, Organic Synthesis  Institute at the Latvian Academy of Sciences, Riga, and Havana  University Department of Mathematical Cybernetics; UDC  578.324.087:591.181]    [Abstract] The ion exchange process occurring by means of  ion channels in the cell membrane and the recently discovered  ion channels in viral protein shells (capsides) which consist of  base structural building blocks referred to as protomers linked  by polypeptide chains are discussed, and it is speculated that  chemical substances with the specific effect of blocking the  viral or bacterial ion channel can be found. Such mechanism, if  found, could make it easier to identify viral infection  protection mechanisms. A mathematical model developed for  designing substances with the desired ion channel blocking  property which makes it possible to examine how some ions or  molecules affect the state of ion channels is proposed assuming  that the kinetic energy of the transported ions can be ignored.  The underlying principles and realization of the mathematical  model as well as its applications to the South American bean  mosaic virus for Ca[.sup]2+[/] and Li[.sup]+[/] ions are  described in detail. The Ca[.sup]2+[/] and Li[.sup]+[/]  ion trajectory inside the ion channel and the electric potential  magnitude at the Ca[.sup]2+[/] and Li[.sup]+[/] ion  trajectory points are plotted. The findings show that a  potential barrier arises in the path of the calcium ion but does  not in the case of the lithium ion, which is consistent with  Silva, Cacheau, et al.

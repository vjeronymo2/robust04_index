			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Base metal prices extend losses - Market report Most base metals prices extended last week's losses yesterday as short-term sentiment switched towards the downside with the recent speculative uptrend losing momentum, London Metal Exchange dealers said. ALUMINIUM prices broke lower in after hours trading, with the three months delivery position falling below the Dollars 1,250-a-tonne level as the market lost some enthusiasm over the current round of output cuts. Long holders had seen recent announcements of cuts as an opportunity to take profits, and there was further to go on the downside, dealers suggested. Noranda Aluminium Noranda, a subsidiary of Noranda of Canada, said yesterday it would cut output at its New Madrid, Missouri, smelter by about 22,000 tonnes a year by delaying the relining of pots and reducing amperage. The cut will be implemented within 90 days. COPPER prices were fairly resilient, holding close to the Dollars 1,850-a-tonne three months level after early rises attracted sellers. But dealers warned that there was further scope on the downside and some thought a test of support at Dollars 1,830 a tonne was likely soon. The ZINC market slid back in line with the overall trend, although some support seemed to be developing around Dollars 960 a tonne, with final business at Dollars 966, down Dollars 9. LEAD prices fell to session lows after the afternoon trading ring as stop-loss selling orders were triggered by a breech of the Dollars 490-a-tonne level. Final business was at a one-month low of Dollars 482 a tonne, a Dollars 14 loss from last Friday. Although the fundamental picture was constructive for lead, in the short term the market was coming under pressure from the overall re-alignment in metal prices. The London Commodity Exchange's COFFEE and COCOA markets both ended a routine day in the minus column as they continued bereft of any fundamental news. Precious metals prices picked up after a slow start with GOLD closing Dollars 2 up at Dollars 382.75 a troy ounce, SILVER 9 cents up at Dollars 5.34 1/2 an ounce and PLATINUM Dollars 3.75 up at Dollars 393.75 an ounce. Dealers saw few fresh factors affecting the markets, which were still dominated by the weaker dollar following the breakdown of US-Japanese trade talks. Gold's indifferent performance had been predicted on the charts, which had been signalling a sideways drift for several weeks, one dealer said. Compiled from Reuter</p>

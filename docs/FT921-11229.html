			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Gardening: Swimming against the tide - A nursery that kept faith with private clients SINCE the 1970s, the British nursery trade has been acting out a horticultural version of Big Bang. Trading now takes place all round the calendar, thanks to the rise of the garden centre and the growing of plants in containers of black polythene. Dual capacity is all the rage. Big retailers have become bigger wholesalers with many fewer private clients. In the old days, you might have bought roses from Mattocks, shrubs from Waterers, and sent away by post for rarities from Hilliers, Bressingham and Notcutts. Mattocks and Waterers have gone up the water spout; Hilliers, Bressingham and Notcutts have developed vast wholesale businesses for garden centres and institutions. All their retail lists now carry fewer varieties of the specialities which their fathers' generation used to sell. It would be a brave gardener who ordered a rare shrub by post for Pounds 20 or more. It might well arrive as a hopeful twig. Shopping by post has given way to shopping by car. Garden centres have proved that urban punters will pay unimagined prices for plants which can be shovelled straight into their vehicle's boot. These changes make me fascinated by growers who dragged their feet at the time and decided to go against the tide. If I had been in business, I like to think that I would have done the same and decided that private clients would not disappear simply because the shopping trade had come up with centres in new locations. As the bigger nurseries have become centres or wholesalers, smaller private nurseries have indeed multiplied, supplying unusual plants to those who do not want to pay Pounds 4 for an overgrown bush of lavender. Among older names, one or two have continued to prize their casual business by post and not impose a minimum charge. My sympathies lie with them. In this class, I doubt if there is an older name than Scotts of Merriott, Somerset. Its roots go back into the 18th century, perhaps as far as the 1730s and certainly into the 1790s where a recent find of papers has shown that one Lord Digby was already buying plants at the Merriott nursery. The last John Scott left the business in the late-Victorian period, not without financial problems. The enterprise was bought by the Wallises in 1923; since then, it has passed through only two generations although there are prospects now of a third. Scotts employs 50 people, one for each acre of intensely-cultivated ground. Some stock, but not much, is bought-in from Holland and suppliers lower down the chain. Most of it is then grown-on to standard at Merriott before being loosed on the public. This year, the nursery sees two new landmarks: Mark Wallis, who runs it, has reached the age of 65 and, for the first time in 60 years, it will be exhibiting at the Chelsea flower show. This venture has been encouraged by a third-generation Wallis to see if Scotts can add to its large stock of private clients. Scotts always has had a strong brand loyalty, not least because its catalogues are illustrated so handsomely with line drawings and filled with worthwhile shrubs; I know nowhere else where you can still buy the charming rose Ashwednesday, which has ashen-grey flowers early in the season. Like the other big names, Scotts has a wholesale business, but it amounts to only 50 per cent of total sales around Pounds 1m. The rest largely involves orders by post, delivered by Scotts' vans across the south of England. Most of the wholesale stock goes to garden centres although, this year, orders from them are being delayed until the last possible moment for fear of economic collapse. At Scotts, however, the retail trade has actually been stronger than before and Wallis foresees a serious rush for stock this March. One of the nursery's famous strengths is its fruit list, still under the care of Wallis's 75-year-old brother. Its range of cider apples is unique; it is a haven for refugees from Golden Delicious, and serious planners of an orchard ought to consult the yearly list. In 1877, the consultation would have been bewildering. Wallis showed me a bound copy of Scotts' list for 1877 which he had acquired via his wife's vicar. It contained more than 1,500 varieties of apple, 1,500 pears and 200 varieties of soft fruit. The descriptions were rather stylish. 'Mulberry: ever-bearing, but how truly, it would be difficult to say: only none of the sorts on this side of the water is endowed with the faculty.' Border plants are Wallis's first love, though. As a grower, not a gardener, he claims to like them all in different ways. He did agree that Scotts has some unique lupins, propagated continuously from the original Russell hybrids. Anemones, he also thought, were particularly appealing (it must have been telepathy because I was thinking the same). No, he did not think that any one white was exceptional, but he had been impressed by the deep-red Hadspen Abundance on a recent visit to Devon. He denied that plants grown in Somerset were less likely to survive northern weather than plants grown in Yorkshire. The biggest problem, he thought, was incorrect naming of stock in the trade. When last he sat on a panel, he found that only three out of 18 plants of something as common as double-flowered Philadelphus Virginal were being labelled correctly. As for rosemary, Miss Jessup's upright form was a constant problem. Did I realise that the leaves on the true variety lay close to the main stem, whereas many nurserymen sold upright officinalis instead? Although Wallis is 65 this year, he has no intention of taking his knowledge into retirement. I thought that he had referred rather wistfully to a lost opportunity when Waterers collapsed: early in the 1970s, he could have bought the entire place for about Pounds 600,000 and would be a multi-millionaire nowadays, not least because of the property. Would it all be so different, then, if he had pulled off this deal? Not really, he reflected. People who were used to a 12-hour day did not bother with interest. He would continue growing plants because he enjoyed it, although he might be rid of the paperwork if he had a million in the bank. He did not think that he wanted to take up golf. I believed him; but, as one of Scotts' long-standing private clients, I suppose it was what I wanted to hear. Catalogues are available from Scotts, Merriott, Crewkern, Somerset, for Pounds 1.50 each.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEY TOOK CHALLENGES IN STRIDE  </P> <P> This was a year of challenges for sophomore Kerri Pegues and her track coach at  St. Bernard High, and, judging from latest results, both have adjusted  spectacularly.  </P> <P> In last week's CIF 2-A Southern Section finals, Pegues took first place in the  200 meters in 24.98 and 400- and 1,600-meter relays.  </P> <P> And for Barbara Ferrell Edmonson her girls finished second in team scoring in  her first year of high school coaching.  </P> <P> Last year Pegues finished fourth in the 100 in a wind-aided 12.37 and was  fourth in the 200 in 25.52 but eagerly sough out her new coach's opinion on  which were the best events for her to run this year. Pegues knew Edmonson  understood track.  </P> <P> Edmonson, as Barbara Ferrell, was a silver medalist at 100 meters in the 1968  Mexico City Olympics and co-world record holder at the distance and twice set  American records in the 200.  </P> <P> And when it was suggested that Pegues move up to the longer sprint, she  grudgingly agree.  </P> <P> "I didn't think I was ever going to run the quarter because I didn't feel it  was my race," said Pegues, who is 5-1 3/4 and 102 pounds. "I thought it was too  long for me. It is a hard race to run.  </P> <P> "I think anybody who is a sprinter should run a quarter," Edmonson said. "I  convinced her. Usually if you get one kid that goes out well, it's kind of easy  to bring the others into it. They just hate to work for it."  </P> <P> The sprinters now train with over-distance workouts from 300 to 600 meters, and  it has paid rich dividends.  </P> <P> "It was the workouts we've been having that helped us in the mile relay," said  sophomore Lisa Moxley, who leads off both relays. "We worked on doing the 600s,  so we'd have more energy at the end when we raced a 400. Coach says you get  what you put in your workouts."  </P> <P> Edmonson was impressed with the attitude of the girls. "They're very coachable  kids, which makes it easier for the coach who wants to spend a little more  time. You don't have to fight for workouts."  </P> <P> She has managed this with a demanding schedule of her own, which will soon  include training her daughters, Malika, 10, and Miya, 6, who both may have  potential based on their parents' abilities. Father Warren Edmonson, a Los  Angeles police officer, was an NCAA champion at 100 meters for UCLA.  </P> <P> After completing a coaching stint at West Los Angeles College, Barbara Edmonson  was encouraged by a friend to come out of retirement and later agreed to take  on the position at St. Bernard.  </P> <P> "I got hired in February on the 20th and the first meet was on the 27th, and I  almost had a heart attack," she recalled.  </P> <P> Another surprise was the unusual dimensions of the track at the Playa del Rey  campus. It is a 353-yard configuration, about 4 7/8 laps per mile.  </P> <P> "I had never worked with anything but a 400-meter track before," Edmonson said.  "It took quite a bit of adjustment to get workouts together."  </P> <P> She has also managed the adjustment from athlete to coach.  </P> <P> "As a competitor I never worried about anything because I had a coach whose  responsibility was to worry about what you're going to do. I just got out and  did what I had to do. As a coach, I don't feel the pressure there because it's  for the kids. You're so wrapped up in what the kids are doing, and what event  is next, that you don't even think about it."  </P> <P> Her background and her openness in sharing her experience have made a  difference with the team.  </P> <P> "It really helped us a lot because she's been on the other side of it, being an  athlete," Moxley said. "So she knows how we feel during workouts."  </P> <P> Edmonson brings a steadying influence to the girls at St. Bernard, according to  Tony Veney, who coached at the school until 1982 and is now an assistant coach  at Cal State Northridge. "She's a good one to have just from the standpoint of  the experience she brings," he said.  </P> <P> "When she would tell us about the good things that have happened to her, it  makes those who are serious about track want to go further at the state  qualifying Masters Meet. Friday at Cerritos College Pegues will run in her two  individual races and the 400 relay with Moxley, junior Kim Williams and junior  Nikki Davis, and in the 1,600 relay with Moxley, Davis and senior Bonnie Jones.  </P> <P> "If they stay healthy and keep their heads together, they may go all the way to  the finals," Edmonson said." And after getting a little experience under the  belt, they'll be even better next year."  </P></p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Further slump in business confidence BUSINESS confidence in north-west England has slumped by nearly 30 per cent, according to a survey of more than 2,700 managing directors or senior managers, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. The survey was conducted by EAP Consultants, a subsidiary of Lancashire Enterprises, the privatised economic development arm of Lancashire County Council. An index of economic confidence developed by EAP for its first survey in July had fallen from 34 to 23 by last month. Agriculture was worst hit, reflecting poor harvests, but manufacturers were less positive than during the summer because of recession in mainland European markets. There was also a marked fall in confidence in the distributive sector, where the index fell from 37 to 18 over the three months.</p>

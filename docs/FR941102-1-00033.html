			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MSHA estimates that it would issue about 50 warning letters each year for the first few years_about half of which would require some remedial action such as passing a skills test or undergoing retraining. Of the 50 warning letters each year, MSHA estimates that about 20 would be issued to mine foremen who must be certified to perform various inspection and examination activities, about 25 would be issued for coal dust sampling and 5 would be issued to miners certified to perform such activities as electrical work or blasting. After the first few years, MSHA anticipates that the Agency would need to issue fewer warning letters as mine operators and certified individuals become more aware of the Agency's intent to ensure that these individuals perform their tasks as required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The proposed rule also would allow the district manager to forego the warning letter and send out a notice proposing to temporarily or permanently decertify an individual who repeatedly exhibits disregard for health and safety, and also in instances where a particular single offense is of such a serious nature that decertification is warranted. MSHA estimates that the Agency annually would issue about 10 temporary and 10 permanent decertifications without first issuing a warning letter. MSHA expects that temporary decertifications would last an average of one year and would require the individual to reapply for certification and, perhaps, complete additional requirements, such as retraining or testing. In all, MSHA estimates that the Agency would undertake in total about 70 decertification-related actions a year (50 actions beginning with a warning letter and 20 actions without a warning letter).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  MSHA has attributed most of the costs of this proposal to legal fees. In many instances, MSHA expects that the certified persons facing adverse Agency action would hire an attorney. The costs of such legal fees would vary widely depending on the nature of the action, the level to which the case is appealed, and the legal fees of the attorney. Although a few individuals may not seek legal counsel, others might retain an attorney upon the initial receipt of a warning letter. In some instances, the attorney's services would not be needed beyond the initial response to the district manager. In other instances, in-depth legal advice may be sought at each level of appeal all the way through the Federal Court of Appeals. In general, however, MSHA believes that most individuals would not pursue appeal beyond the level of the Department of Labor's Administrative Law Judges. MSHA estimates that initially about 30 percent of the 70 actions taken by the Agency each year (or 21 individual cases) would result in appeals to the Departmental level. Legal fees vary from region to region and law firm to law firm, ranging from as high as $400 per hour to as low as $50 per hour. In this analysis, MSHA has used an average cost of $120 per hour. Assuming it takes an attorney about 40 hours to prepare and appeal a client's case up through the Departmental level, costs of the proposed rule arising from legal fees would total about $100,800 a year, or $4,800 per contest. Of course, the fees for appealing a single case through the Federal Court of Appeals may total significantly more than $4,800. Conversely, the use of an attorney to draft a response to the district manager to a warning letter could cost as little as $50.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In addition, MSHA has assumed that the certified person would have to take time off from work to address decertification actions initiated by the Agency. The average total compensation (wages plus fringe benefits) for a certified person ranges from $24.74 to $28.50 per hour or an average of $26.50 per hour. Assuming that all 70 certified persons each takes an average of 20 hours off from work to avail themselves of the procedures of the proposal, then the annual loss of income attributable to responding to Agency's actions under the proposal would total about $37,100.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  MSHA estimates that the total annual cost of this proposed rule to be about $137,900 ($100,800 related to legal fees and $37,100 related to income loss during the appeal process). The Agency specifically requests comments concerning these cost estimates; comments, including rationale, should be as specific as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Although MSHA does not have data at this time to estimate quantitative benefits, the Agency has determined that the qualitative benefits of this proposed rule are improved safety and health conditions for miners. The possibility of a temporary or permanent decertification should be an effective incentive for certified and qualified persons to perform their duties and tasks as required. The potential loss of pay or possible unemployment resulting from decertification should serve as a strong, economic incentive for certified persons to comply with the required procedures. As the tasks and duties of certified persons are critical to the safety and health of miners, ensuring that these activities are performed in the required manner should result in fewer fatalities, injuries, and accidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  A recent example of the need for formal decertification procedures involves the submission of fraudulent respirable coal mine dust samples by some individuals certified to take them. To ensure the integrity of the respirable dust program, the Agency needs more efficient decertification procedures to serve as a more effective deterrent to such illegal activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  As a result of plea agreements or criminal convictions stemming from respirable dust fraud, MSHA has permanently decertified 7 people and temporarily decertified another 73 individuals for periods ranging from one to four years for respirable dust fraud. The Agency temporarily decertified about sixty-five percent of these individuals for a one-year period and about thirty percent for a three-year period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

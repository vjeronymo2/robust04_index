			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: COULD WE GET A FEW AIRCRAFT CARRIERS IN THE PARKING LOT?  </P> <P> A San Diego labor union wants you to think of Saddam Hussein before you shop at  a grocery market in Linda Vista owned by an Iraqi.  </P> <P> The union is asking for a boycott of a store owned by Victor Najor by comparing  him to the Iraqi dictator.  </P> <P> The dispute began more than a year ago when employees at Najor's stores in the  Linda Vista and Nestor neighborhoods of San Diego voted to be represented by  the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, Local 135.  </P> <P> But Najor and the union have yet to agree on a contract. Now the union has  mailed out a flyer complete with a picture of Hussein:  </P> <P> "Worried about the hostages in Iraq? What about the hostage situation in your  own neighborhood?"  </P> <P> On the flip side:  </P> <P> "Victor Najor, an Iraqi businessman and owner of the Victory Foods store in  your neighborhood, is holding his employees hostage -- to inferior pay,  inferior conditions of employment and little or no job security.  </P> <P> "The United States Government has conducted a democratic election of the  employees of Victory Foods, and they voted to be represented by a union. But  negotiating a contract with Victor Najor is like negotiating with Saddam  Hussein."  </P> <P> There's more:  </P> <P> "As a community, let's help Victory Foods' employees fulfill their rights as  free Americans! Boycott Victory Foods."  </P> <P> Najor, one of 8,000 Chaldeans (Christian Iraqis) who have settled in San Diego  County in recent years, has had other problems, too. A rowdy stomped on a Saudi  Arabian flag hanging in one of his stores.  </P> <P> Najor isn't around to discuss the union flyer. He's on his way home from a trip  to Israel with a church group.  </P> <P> His partner and attorney won't talk. Neither will the labor union.  </P> <P> One neighbor who received the flyer says it persuaded her to start shopping at  Victory Foods:  </P> <P> "I think the flyer is offensive. Whatever the labor dispute, I think it's  outrageous to mention that Najor is an Iraqi and smear him with a picture of  Saddam Hussein."  </P> <P> </P> <P> And We All Have Tans  </P> <P> Name it and claim it.  </P> <P> * Bi-coastal woes.  </P> <P> A San Diego-based company that handles phone-in reservations for New York state  campsites is catching flak for long delays and lack of information.  </P> <P> "You call the 800 number, get put on hold, and you get a San Diego radio  station saying, 'It's 70 degrees outside and the surf's up,' " grumbled a  legislative aide in Albany.  </P> <P> In San Diego, officials for MISTIX have no comment.  </P> <P> * Actress Rue McClanahan ("The Golden Girls") is scheduled to be part of a  demonstration next week outside the Animal Control Department's Central Shelter  in San Diego. She'll then have a press conference urging a "no" vote on  Proposition C, the countywide measure that asks people if they favor using  pound animals for medical research.  </P> <P> * How slow was Monday?  </P> <P> Advisory from United Press International: "There are NO known newsworthy events  scheduled in San Diego County at this time. Updates will be posted as they  arrive."  </P> <P> * Say what?  </P> <P> In his campaign literature for Assembly, former San Diego City Councilman Mike  Gotch says he "led (the) successful opposition" to North City West.  </P> <P> That may come as a surprise to 11,000 people who live in North City West, where  building continues apace.  </P> <P> </P> <P> If You Look to Your Left . . .  </P> <P> The Republicans are coming, the Republicans are coming. Or: No mooning, please.  </P> <P> Those six helicopters you may see hovering over San Diego on Friday morning  will not be carrying a road company from "Apocalypse Now."  </P> <P> The copters will have members of the Republican site selection committee for  the 1992 national convention. The Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau arranged the  tour to sell the aerial view of America's Finest . . .  </P></p>

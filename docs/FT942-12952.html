			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Huntleigh climbs 24% to Pounds 6.86m Huntleigh Technology, the medical equipment manufacturer whose share price has risen 10-fold in the last three years, increased pre-tax profits by 24 per cent, from Pounds 5.54m to Pounds 6.86m, over the 1993 year. Sales rose 25 per cent to Pounds 35.5m (Pounds 28.4m), driven partly by strong growth in the UK which accounted for 27 per cent (21 per cent) of group turnover. There was a Pounds 2.99m contribution from acquisitions. The company also announced that Mr Julian Schild had been made deputy chairman in addition to his present role as finance director. Mr Schild said his father, Rolf, now 69, had no intention of retiring as chairman but added: 'He may devolve more of the bureaucratic side of running the business.' Profits included a contribution of Pounds 160,000 after financing costs from Nesbit Evans, Huntleigh's first significant acquisition, purchased for Pounds 11.8m in November. The group ended the year with net borrowings of Pounds 6.2m, largely due to the acquisition, representing gearing of 57 per cent. This is expected to fall significantly in the current year. Mr Rolf Schild said that all the group's divisions had started 1994 well and he predicted another record year. Earnings per share share rose 29 per cent to 17.3p (13.4p) and the total dividend goes up 35 per cent to 4.5p (3.33p) with a proposed final of 2.5p. The shares slipped 12p to 488p.</p>

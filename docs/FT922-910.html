			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Depressed conditions keep borrowers away NEW-ISSUE activity in the international bond market ground almost to a halt yesterday, with depressed conditions in most European markets and poor currency swap opportunities keeping potential borrowers away. General Electric Capital Corporation, the financing arm of the US industrial group, added CDollars 50m to its CDollars 100m five-year issue launched last week. The 8 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.80, against 99.95 last week. The issue was made under GECC's medium-term note programme and carries no independent documentation. Using the MTN structure cuts issuing costs for the borrower. Following the recent pattern for larger MTN issues, the bonds were fully underwritten by the dealers to the programme, lead-managed by Kidder Peabody. Other than the documentation, the issue was little different from a conventional syndicated Eurobond issue. Elsewhere, syndicate officials said the European Investment Bank was hoping to raise funds in both the French franc and Italian lira sectors. Both sectors have suffered in the aftermath of Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty on June 2. However, while French franc bonds are supported by strong domestic economic fundamentals - yesterday CAR, the state-backed financing agency, successfully added FFr1bn to an existing domestic issue - the lira bond market remains volatile. Bankers said yesterday that the EIB may find it difficult to assemble an underwriting group for a lira bond issue. Against this, the EIB has shown itself willing to compromise to promote favoured sectors of the Euromarket. For example, its Ecu350m 10-year deal launched on Monday was priced to yield 12 basis points more than French government Ecu paper, with full fees paid to underwriters. Before the Danish vote, the EIB borrowed in Ecu at a yield spread of just 4 basis points - with underwriters offered minimal fees. Swiss franc bonds issued by Heron, the UK property company which is negotiating a debt restructuring with bank creditors, resumed trading having been temporarily suspended trading on stock exchanges in Switzerland. The bonds now trade 'flat': investors no longer pay accrued interest when purchasing bonds. There are no interest payments due until November, by which time Heron hopes to have presented restructuring proposals to bondholders. The bonds reflect that further interest payments are unlikely to be made. Dealers quoted Heron's six outstanding Swiss franc issues at around 20 per cent of face value yesterday, for yields of 40 to 50 per cent. However, there was little or no dealing activity in the stock. Heron has continued to service bonds issued in other currencies. On Monday, it met an interest payment on a Dollars 100m floating-rate note issue.</p>

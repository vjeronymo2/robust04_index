			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALICE KAHN: SHE'S LIVING IN A TECHNOWORLD  </P> <P> Up in his loft -- it's a nerd! It's a dude! No! It's TechnoGuy!  </P> <P> TechnoGuy lives and works in his technopad surrounded by big black machines. He  thinks nothing of it.  </P> <P> "Awesome," I say when I walk in.  </P> <P> "Alice, it's just a big stereo," he says of the 10, 8-foot-high black boxes  with maybe 30 control panels that make me feel like Alice when she was just  small.  </P> <P> There are only three items in the pad I can identify. There's a tea kettle next  to some kind of state-of-the-art coffee bean splicer. There's a couch where  TechnoGuy parks it when he logs off his computer. And I recognize the  comforting, almost homey gray box of TechnoGuy's Macintosh computer. It's a  clone of the Mac I have back in my low-tech home. But, of course, he's got some  kind of fancy computer mouse that's like a genetically altered animal compared  to my old house mouse.  </P> <P> He pops some coffee into the microwave. (Ever notice how no one ever puts  anything in a microwave? They "pop" it in furtively, with full fear of frying.)  </P> <P> I decide to gross out TechnoGuy. "I don't own a microwave," I say in the  rebellious tone of a technophobe.  </P> <P> No microwave!  </P> <P> And I don't have a stereo.  </P> <P> No stereo!  </P> <P> And I don't have a dishwasher.  </P> <P> No dishwasher!  </P> <P> So, what's a nice, red-blooded, machine-fearing girl like me doing in a place  like this? How is it that I find myself on the cutting edge in a strange man's  apartment? Why am I in TechnoGuy's world?  </P> <P> I am here because he has gallantly offered me the use of his laser printer.  Like some latter-day Walter Raleigh, TechnoGuy's gesture is his way of throwing  his cloak over a black puddle.  </P> <P> Until he buzzed me in past his security system, I have only known TechnoGuy in  the virtual sense. Virtual reality is what computer people call the world in  the box of chips. TechnoGuy is my pal from The WELL, the computer network  favored by people who like to transmit for the hell of it.  </P> <P> All I knew of him before I entered his technopad were words on a computer  screen from his modem to mine.  </P> <P> I had asked people on The WELL (acronym for Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link) if  anyone could recommend a good place to take a disk for quality printing. One  WELLbeing (as gentle users are known) pointed out that if I take my disk to a  commercial printing place, I'd better get it disinfected for viruses. In the  virtual world, you can get a disease from casual contact. Old-fashioned girls  never think of these things.  </P> <P> TechnoGuy takes my disk. I am a stranger in his electronic paradise. Before I  leave the technopad, he "treats" my disk with his viral detection software.  </P> <P> Now, I'm a suspicious modern city gal. If there is one thing I don't trust,  it's machines. If there's another thing I don't trust, it's strangers. But even  as I remain suspicious of the weird golems in TechnoGuy's world, I trust the  medium by which I have come to know him -- words. You know, when you finally  pay some attention to that man behind the curtain, you find that even the  Wizard of Oz is just a friendly guy with a lot of gadgets.  </P> <P> He ain't heavy. He's my virtual brother.  </P></p>

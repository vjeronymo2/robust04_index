			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / BSkyB plans to increase links with BT: Raymond Snoddy looks to the future as the shares are priced at 256p and open at a premium British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, which yesterday made its stock market debut in New York and London, is planning a close and growing relationship with British Telecommunications. BSkyB shares, priced yesterday at 256p, opened at a premium. In London, the shares closed at 268 1/2 p. In New York, American Depositary Shares offered at Dollars 24.05 were trading at Dollars 25 1/4 . Last month BSkyB, valued yesterday at Pounds 4.4bn, and BT announced a marketing tie-up to offer discount telephone services to satellite television subscribers. Other more extensive links between the two organisations, which see themselves as natural allies, are now possible. BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake, has been planning for some time a move into digital television. The 'black boxes' now being developed have an internal modem to enable data communication down existing telephone lines. The aim is to use a telephone data link to enable viewers to order automatically films of their choice using a keypad. At least at the outset the intention is to offer 'near-video-on-demand'. Such a system involves broadcasting a small number of the top films on a large number of channels with staggered starts so viewers are never more than 15 or 20 minutes away from the beginning of a film of their choice. The system which would involve extra business for BT could also be developed for home shopping services. BSkyB, which plans to add the Disney Channel to its roster of channels next autumn, would also like to provide programming and marketing services if BT launches video-on-demand nationally using telephone lines. More than 500 financial institutions around the world bought into the BSkyB share offer which was more than five times subscribed in the UK and nearly six times in the US. The UK retail offer, which raised Pounds 93m, was 1.3 times subscribed. Overall, the net proceeds of the issue are estimated to be Pounds 824m which will largely be used, together with a new bank facility, to pay off guarantees entered into by BSkyB's main banks. None of the original shareholders sold shares. Chargeurs, the French communications group, actually bought new shares to prevent dilution of its stake. After the flotation, on a fully diluted basis, the public will own 17 per cent of BSkyB and Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International will hold 40 per cent. Chargeurs will be just below 17 per cent with Pearson on 14 per cent and Granada 12 per cent. Granada has long said it will ultimately be a seller of its BSkyB stake because it usually wants to own 100 per cent of the businesses it is involved in. If Granada sells it would mean that BSkyB would be able to enter the FT-SE 100, almost certainly giving a further boost to the shares. In the UK retail offer, applicants for shares worth Pounds 50,000 or less will receive all they applied for. At higher thresholds, these allocations apply: up to Pounds 60,000 - 95%; Pounds 70,000 - 90%, Pounds 80,000 - 85%, Pounds 100,000 - 80%, above Pounds 100,000 - 62.25%.</p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SANDS OF TIME CAN'T SLOW THIS BEACH VOLLEYBALL PLAYER  </P> <P> Twenty-five years ago, Nina Matthies wandered onto a beach volleyball court  near her home in Manhattan Beach. She didn't realize it at the time, but that  day at the beach would leave a lasting impression on her.  </P> <P> A long-lasting impressing.  </P> <P> A quarter of a century later Matthies still goes to the beach to play  volleyball on weekends. She's no longer a gangly 11-year-old batting a ball  over a dipping net with her mother and father, though. She's now a mother, wife  and coach of one of the nation's top collegiate volleyball teams.  </P> <P> And Matthies, 36, is the second-oldest player on the women's pro beach tour.  She's also among the winningest on the circuit. Matthies and first-year partner  Elaine Roque rank fourth in the money standings with $4,421 after finishing no  lower than fourth in their first four tournaments.  </P> <P> Some athletes survive tests of time -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Gordie Howe and  Nolan Ryan to name a few -- but Matthies said she flourishes because of age and  experience. She stands only 5 feet 6 1/2 inches, but she seems to tower over  her taller, younger opponents.  </P> <P> Matthies said her intensity keeps her competitive.  </P> <P> "The older I get," she said, "the more intense I need to be. The younger  players can play on sheer emotion. I have to be intense, or I won't be as good  as I want to be."  </P> <P> Roque understands Matthies' on-court attitude better than anyone.  </P> <P> "Actually, intense is only the tip of the iceberg," Roque said. "(She) begins  with intense and then goes further. She's really fiery. She yells and screams a  lot. All the top players do.  </P> <P> "We're both perfectionists. We always kid each other after a match. We tell  each other that we shouldn't make any mistakes."  </P> <P> Although they didn't play error-free volleyball, Matthies and Roque cruised  through two matches Saturday at the Huntington Beach Open to advance in the  double-elimination tournament. They'll meet Dana Point native Janice Opalinski  and Linda Chisholm, a 1984 Olympic silver medalist, in the winners' bracket  semifinals today.  </P> <P> Success has come quickly to Matthies and Roque, the second-seeded team in the  tournament behind Patty Dodd and Brazilian Olympian Jackie Silva. But it hasn't  come easily.  </P> <P> They faced a problem when they joined forces at the beginning of season -- both  played the right side of the court. Matthies volunteered to move to the left  side.  </P> <P> "I've played (the right) side for 25 years," Matthies said. "I thought my game  was more adaptable. It's been a fun change."  </P> <P> Matthies has seen many changes in beach volleyball. The sport attracts taller,  quicker players than before.  </P> <P> "You don't have any easy matches anymore," she said. "It has changed from a  casual meet-at-the beach sport to a business. I run and train every day for  volleyball. It's not something where you get together and bat the ball around  anymore."  </P> <P> Marie Stielow, a second-year player, often seeks Matthies' advice. Stielow and  tour veteran Roxana Vargas dropped a 15-6 decision to Matthies and Roque in the  second round.  </P> <P> "Nina has helped me a lot," Stielow said. "She encourages me and gives me a lot  of pointers. She's one of the great players on the tour and I look up to her."  </P> <P> Matthies said beach volleyball also provides supplemental income for her  family. But something other than money keeps her diving headfirst into the sand  to save points week after week.  </P> <P> "You can make money at this," she said. "The least we've won this year (in a  tournament) was $750. But you can't do this for the money. You have to love  what you're doing. That's why I've been able to play for so long. If I didn't  love it, I couldn't keep going."  </P> <P> Before turning professional in 1975, Matthies played on two national  championship teams as a freshman and sophomore at UCLA.  </P> <P> After quitting school, she competed in four indoor professional leagues,  including two co-ed organizations. In 1977, she became an assistant coach at  UCLA, a job she held until accepting a head coaching job at Pepperdine in 1983.  </P> <P> Matthies suffered through a 5-21 season in her first year at Pepperdine, but  has since guided the Waves to five consecutive NCAA tournament appearances.  </P> <P> "We've lost each time in the first round," she said. "But we always play in the  West regional, and that's one of the toughest."  </P> <P> In the summer, Matthies leaves indoor volleyball behind. She dons her  sunglasses and swimsuit and heads for the beach. She's played with a variety of  partners and had an undefeated season with Linda Robertson in 1987.  </P> <P> She said the weekend tournaments give her time to herself, away from her job,  husband Dan, a firefighter in Santa Monica, and sons Morgan, 6, and Marty, 4.  </P> <P> "They keep me pretty busy," she said. "But this is my time. And I need that."  </P></p>

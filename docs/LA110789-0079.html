			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FILM SAVES RECORD THAT GOT AWAY;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: A STATISTICIAN'S ERROR GIVES CAL STATE FULLERTON'S MIKE  PRINGLE SHARE OF NCAA RUSHING RECORD THAT HE THOUGHT HE HAD LOST WHEN COACH  GENE MURPHY SIDELINED HIM.  </P> <P> Coach Gene Murphy of Cal State Fullerton says now that he made a mistake  Saturday by not giving Mike Pringle a chance to break the national single-game  rushing record.  </P> <P> But Fullerton officials found another mistake Monday -- a five-yard  statistician's error that, when corrected, gave Pringle a share of the record  anyway.  </P> <P> Murphy kept Pringle on the sidelines in the final minute of Fullerton's 45-10  victory over New Mexico State Saturday, choosing to give reserves the playing  time he had promised them, rather than give Pringle a chance to get the six  yards he needed to break the record of 357 yards set by Washington State's  Rueben Mayes against Oregon in 1984.  </P> <P> But in a routine review of game statistics Sunday night, Mel Franks,  Fullerton's sports information director, noticed a five-yard discrepancy  between the play-by-play and the tabulation kept by official statistician Dean  Lohuis. Fullerton reviewed game films Monday and found a five-yard error.  </P> <P> "It's an embarrassing situation," Franks said. "But we'd rather be embarrassed  than Mike Pringle not have his yards."  </P> <P> The NCAA has been informed of the revision, and will list Pringle as co-holder  of the record, said Jim Wright, NCAA assistant director of communications.  </P> <P> The error occurred on a third-down play at the end of the third quarter. The  play began at the Fullerton 41-yard line, and after Pringle's carry, the film  shows the ball at the 43. But Lohuis' records indicate he mistook the 43 for  the 38, shorting Pringle five yards.  </P> <P> Pringle, who had borrowed the game films himself Sunday night to watch them but  did not catch the error, learned Monday afternoon that he had tied the record  after all.  </P> <P> "I feel good about it," said Pringle, who leads the nation in all-purpose  running and is second in rushing to Florida's Emmitt Smith with 148.9 yards a  game. "It's not the same high I would have felt on the field, not the same  excitement. I'm pleased. Now I know my name will be in the record book."  </P> <P> With the correction giving Pringle a share of the record, some people are  asking why Fullerton can't find another yard to give him the record outright.  </P> <P> But Franks said Fullerton was only correcting a mathematical error, and would  not question any issues of judgment.  </P> <P> "We're not going to mess around and look for a yard," Franks said.  </P> <P> Lohuis, an accountant and high school football official, said he was glad the  error had been discovered.  </P> <P> "It doesn't bother me," he said. "You want things right. Everybody does make  mistakes."  </P> <P> Murphy spent part of Monday conducting more interviews on his decision, one  that drew television news crews to the offices of a football program that  struggles for recognition and drew only 3,000 fans to its game Saturday.  </P> <P> "If I had known it would cause such upheaval and furor, I'd have let him get  the six yards," Murphy said.  </P> <P> Murphy had kept Pringle in a runaway game well into the fourth quarter, trying  to let him get the school record of 301 yards and all the while promising the  backups they would play as soon as Pringle got the record.  </P> <P> But when Pringle finally broke the record, he did it on a 67-yard run,  shattering Obie Graves' school record and ending up an apparent five yards shy  of tying the NCAA record when he was pulled down five yards short of the goal  line.  </P> <P> Murphy took him out, and never sent him back in.  </P> <P> "At the moment, at the time, I was personally caught up in the emotion of  wanting to make the substitutions," Murphy said. "Unless you've been in  coaching, you never know what it is like to watch those kids practice and never  get to play. . . . I should have let Mike Pringle get the six yards. I  apologize. I'm sorry."  </P> <P> Murphy regretted his decision Sunday and made apologetic phone calls, first to  Pringle's mother, Annie Pringle, and then to Mike, who had grown more unhappy  with the decision the more he considered it.  </P> <P> "I said after the game it would probably hit me later, and it did," Pringle  said. "It did. . . . I was kind of bitter late Saturday, and all day Sunday."  </P> <P> As the knowledge that he shared a national record set in Monday, Pringle  thought back to Saturday's game, when he stood on the sidelines waiting to go  back in. He had stood there, planning to get the record, and planning to hang  on tight to the game ball.  </P> <P> "It would have been nice to be able to run off the field carrying the ball,"  Pringle said Monday. "Now it's, 'Where's the ball?'

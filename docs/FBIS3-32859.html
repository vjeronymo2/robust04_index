			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed "Our Opinion" commentary] </F>   [Text] Encouraged by the United States, many Cubans want to  emigrate to that northern country. Why has the United States  sponsored an incident involving the Interests Section in Havana?  What has hurt the United States? Could it be that after 35 years  of frustration it can no longer resist a Cuba that keeps  resisting, and which in its [word indistinct] has adopted  initiatives to facilitate the reunion of Cuban families? Or is  it perhaps trying to create incidents with rumors like these, to  prevent the meetings called for by Cuba? Or was it perhaps  trying with this incident hastily to create charges to justify  its groundless accusations against our country at the UN Human  Rights Commission, which is meeting in Geneva? Or was it perhaps  trying to tarnish the rally it knew was scheduled to be held in  New York on 12 February in support of Cuba and the proposal that  Charles Rangel will submit to the U.S. Congress demanding the  lifting of the blockade? Or perhaps, because of its arrogance,  the United States can no longer resist the many blows such as  those scored by the success of Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina's tour of Africa; the great Israeli rabbi's recent  remarks about Fidel Castro; Ricardo Alarcon's tour of several  European nations; the agreements signed with businessmen from  developed nations who have publicly stressed the feasibility of  Cuban projects; and of Carlos Lage's successful visit to three  Latin American countries?    Imperialism, the Miami counterrevolution, and the warmongers  disguised as dissidents are fully and exclusively responsible  for the incident.    Cuba does not implement any coercive policy; neither does it  have any military base in any country whatsoever, nor does it  finance radio or television stations against any government, nor  does it lend its territory to shelter terrorist organizations  with all material and radio means to promote incidents like this  one.    The strength of the Cuban policy is based on its universally  recognized justice, its clear openness, and its loyalty to the  principles it proclaims.    The embassies in Cuba will always have the necessary  protection and facilities to carry out their activities and  provide security to their staffs, who also have the moral  obligation not to promote incidents which have nothing to do  with their diplomatic roles.    Trying to hold the Cuban press responsible for this incident  because of the recent publication of a number of works on the  emigration issue is a maneuver by certain U.S. sectors which can  have no other objective than trying to disguise the true origin  of the problem. It is childish to try to hold those who condemn  and denounce such an action responsible for it.    Once again it is confirmed that the streets of this country  belong to and will belong to revolutionaries. Under no pretext  will anyone jeopardize the fatherland's independence.    The economy is experiencing a special period, but the  dignity  and decency of a people who are displaying heroism will never be  at stake.    Today we must be more alert than ever. What imperialism  could  not achieve at Playa Giron or during the past 35 years, it is  now trying to achieve, as in the 1960's, by spreading lies and  rumors that could create incidents propitious for its goals.    It is not the Cuban Government that must give explanations  to  the people who might go to the U.S. Interests Section, but  rather the U.S. officials. Surely they have publicly explained  their rules for the issuance of visas, which will help dispel  the false rumors and unfounded illusions created.    Our action and our duty, clearly outlined during the  incident, are strictly based on the obligations of a nation and  have been fulfilled impartially and efficiently. Cuba will  continue granting all guarantees to those who are authorized by  the United States to travel or to emigrate to that country.    Nothing happened within the U.S. Interests Section. There is  not a single Cuban citizen inside the building. No one was  either injured or wounded. With the dispelling of the rumor,  everything returned to normal.    However, this type of incident or irresponsibility can  provoke more serious consequences, all the responsibility for  which will fall upon the promoters. This incident will serve as  a lesson to the unscrupulous perpetrators of this ordeal. No one  will ever step on the Revolution, because to step on the  Revolution means to step on the courage and resolution of  millions of Cubans who believe neither lies nor rumors when they  must defend their country's integrity.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 25 May (MENA) -- AL-AHRAM says the Sudanese  Government, through its illogical measures against Egypt and its  illegal confiscation of Egyptian property in Sudan, proves that  it does not have the required level of political thinking and  that it is exploiting Egypt's obvious tolerance, patience, and  rational reaction to such measures.    The paper stresses in its editorial today that Egypt does  not  want to add a new crisis to those already experienced by the  Arabs or erupting in their faces occasionally. Egypt believes  that the Sudanese measures, although tactless, are too small and  trivial to cause a serious crisis between Cairo and Khartoum.    This being so, the paper adds, the Sudanese Government  should  realize that Egypt's silence does not stem from weakness, its  patience does not reflect a lack of will, and its failure to  retaliate does not proceed from fear.    AL-AHRAM calls on the Sudanese Government to return to logic  and understand the truth of Egypt's position and policy so that  it may not take similar unwise and shortsighted measures in  future.    The paper also urges the government in Khartoum to learn  from  the experience of insensible people here and there in the Arab  world, which suffers the consequences of the foolish policies  pursued by some of its leaders.</p>

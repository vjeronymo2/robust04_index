			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Why regulation often fails Sir, No doubt inadvertently, the letter from Mrs Celia Hampton, editor of Business Law Brief (October 16), neatly illustrates the irrelevance of many regulations and the desirability of cutting red tape. She says that many people are unaware of the risks of using the same knife to cut raw and cooked meats and that the regulations aim to stop an outbreak of food poisoning. However, if people are ignorant, no amount of regulation will solve the problem. A much better approach would be a public information campaign which would probably render much of the excessive environmental health legislation completely unnecessary. Unfortunately, the automatic reaction of many people to a problem is to devise a regulation which, it is hoped, will deal with the problem. Until the government devises systems to overcome this automatic tendency, its deregulation initiative is bound to fall short of its objectives.

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Management: Codes of ethics on a wing and a prayer Following in the footsteps of their more self-conscious American brethren, more and more European companies are introducing codes of ethics. At first sight they look impressive to the 'stakeholders' at whom they are aimed - employees, suppliers, customers and the wider community. But how many are really worth the paper they are written on? Much depends on how they are drawn up, according to Richard Harries, the Bishop of Oxford. In many companies they are formulated by a small group at the top. But the Bishop disparaged such codes last night in a London Business School lecture on 'the morality of good business'. Instead, he advocated a lengthy process of consultation in which everyone affected could participate. His own diocese had involved all of its parochial church councils in drawing up a Vision, Priorities and Targets paper, he said. The process took two years. Itemising other requirements needed to make codes of conduct effective, the Bishop said they should be expressions of, not substitutes for, a deeply-imbued sense of corporate values. Rather than just being applied in a 'minimalist, legalistic way', they were effective only when they were seen to be part of a corporate culture with a strong sense of moral purpose about what the company did and how it did it. Codes should be communicated widely and kept constantly effective, said the Bishop. The next stage for companies must be to review and monitor them. Adequate mechanisms must be set up to test 'the effectiveness, the reality, of what exists on paper'. Comparing the existence of codes of conduct in Britain with other industrialised countries, the Bishop cited statistics which suggest that about 75 per cent of US companies now have them, against 40 per cent of companies in Germany and France in 1988, but only 28 per cent of Britain in 1991. However, this was well up on the 18 per cent in 1987. The Bishop expressed confidence that the increase would continue.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Ministers' deficit deal paves way for EU budget rise European Union finance ministers agreed yesterday on recommendations for member states to cut their budget deficits to comply with the Maastricht treaty terms on economic and monetary union. The ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, also appear to have averted an EU crisis by pressing Italy to agree on ratification of a planned increase in the Union budget next year. Without this increase, Spain had said it would not ratify an EU enlargement plan to bring in Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway in January. Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, resisted any suggestion that he would be unable to make tax cuts because of the European Commission deficit recommendations, which apply to all member states except Ireland and Luxembourg. With an eye on this week's Conservative party conference, he said: 'We will make real tax cuts when we have reached a satisfactory position in public finances.' France won a token victory in deferring formal adoption of so-called 'excessive deficits' recommendations, after Mr Phillipe Seguin, the anti-Maastricht Gaullist president of the National Assembly, demanded that the European Parliament should be consulted first. The recommendations urge member states to stick to the European monetary union convergence plans they originally presented to their colleagues. Italy, one of the most indebted member states, was urged to return to its original target of stabilising its government's ratio of debt to gross domestic product in 1995, instead of the new target of 1996 adopted by the Berlusconi administration, in the light of economic recovery. On the separate issue, Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said he expected the Italian opposition to the EU budget increase to be resolved within weeks. A senior EU official said the likely compromise would probably lower Italy's EU fine for cheating on its milk quota of over Ecu3bn (Pounds 2.36bn) which the Commission has sought to halve. The UK is challenging this reduction in the European Court but, as part of the deal, would drop its case.</p>

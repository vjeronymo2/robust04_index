			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA received several comments that state that the borescope inspection for corrosion assessment of Nickel-Cadmium (NiCad) disks is unreliable and can cause unnecessary engine removals. The FAA concurs. The borescope inspection for corrosion assessment of NiCad disks has been eliminated and only in-shop inspections are now required. In addition, high utilization disks require this inspection only at next part access.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA received two comments that state that the four month grace period for the records search should be extended. The FAA concurs in part. The records search is no longer specifically required, and can be replaced by a simple utilization determination and an eddy current probe inspection for coating type identification. In addition, the utilization determination is based on a fleet or sub-fleet average. The AD, however, requires that a utilization determination must be conducted for each HPC disk within four months of the effective date of this AD for low utilization operations. But, the FAA believes that it is now a much simpler task.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA received several comments that state that the AD does not adequately address disks that have been used in both high and low utilization operations. The FAA concurs. The utilization rate determination now includes an adjustment for disks that have experienced mixed utilization rates, and both an initial and a yearly recalculation that will account for changes in utilization rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter states that the AD should contain a provision to allow for incorporation of the inspection requirements into the operator's FAA-approved maintenance program. The FAA does not concur. The criticality of the inspections required by the AD require that they be separate and distinct from the operator's routine maintenance tasks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA received several comments that state that the records search and inspection requirements of this AD pose an undue burden on operators of PW JT8D engines. The FAA concurs in part. The records search is no longer specifically required, and has been replaced by a simpler utilization determination together with an eddy current probe inspection for coating type identification. In addition, the utilization determination is based on a fleet or sub-fleet average. The borescope inspection has been eliminated, the disk removal (for inspection) requirements have been relaxed based on additional analysis and disk inspections, and high utilization disks, fleets, and sub-fleets will not require a forced engine removal to comply with the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA received two comments that state that the compliance schedule for disk inspections is complex and requires extensive recordkeeping. The FAA concurs. The compliance schedule has now been simplified by eliminating the borescope inspection and by requiring high utilization operators to inspect the disks at the next access regardless of coating type.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA received two comments that state that the issuance of the Final Rule should be delayed until additional analytical and statistical analyses can be performed to further refine disk fracture predictions and required inspection intervals. The FAA does not concur. The FAA performed extensive additional analysis since the issuance of the proposed rule which has resulted in the revised compliance requirements discussed in the FAA's responses to several comments. Based on this additional analysis, the FAA believes that the Final Rule should not be delayed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter states that the cost to drill the borescope hole would place an undue burden on the operator. The FAA concurs in part. The borescope inspection has been eliminated from the AD and borescope access is not specifically required. However, borescope access is required if an operator elects to forgo a records search and elects to use the eddy current probe to determine coating type.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter states that the disk records do not always allow for identification of the coating. The FAA concurs. The identification of disk coating can now be accomplished by use of an eddy current probe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sevastopol, 14 April -- According to the press  service of the Naval Forces of Ukraine, power supply to the  ships of Ukraine's Naval Forces moored in Sevastopol has been  cut off since 11 April, although the Ukrainian side was not  indebted to the financial department of the Black Sea Fleet.  The supply of electricity to the Hetman Sahaydachnyy and the  SKR-112 patrol-launch ships, as well as the Lutsk small  antisubmarine ship has been cut off for unknown reasons. The  Black Sea Fleet press center representative, Serhiy Dolzhykov,  could not explain anything in this connection.</p>
